That's right. It's a gun that shoots wooden stakes. Impale demonic World War I soldiers against a wall! Or you can freeze them with the alt-fire of your shotgun, then blow them to bits with the primary fire.\n\nPainkiller is pretty rad, although I never did beat the game.","November 26, 2013","true","4.7"," 274 of 306 people (90%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","90","274","306","25","2"

A wonderful retreat back into "Shoot Everything That Moves" land, Painkiller has a great sense of style, difficulty progression and zany weaponry. Each level has a cool concept, populated by equally atmospheric adversaries that are fun to eviscerate, explode, or pin to walls with your giant stake gun.  The final levle is an incredibly fun take on everyones favorite nine-tiered dungeon, and has to be played to be truly appreciated.\n\nThe expansion "Battle Out Of Hell" continues with new weapons and more levels. Although many are equally as impressive as thier counterpars in the original game, the difficulty curve cuts far steeper, as Russian Suicide Bombers and Nazis...(Surprising they didn't make the cut for the original game really) will really test your skills in the Leningrad level.\n\nIn all though, when you're tired of dealing with bland quests, uninspired plots or character, or even every sentient thing around you, it never hurts to fire up a game that rewards for simply murdering everything in-front of you.","February 15, 2014","true","22.4"," 182 of 199 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","182","199","18","0"

Additionally, it has quite possibly the widest variety and sheer scope of weapons available in first person shooters, including a weapon which fires large sharpened wooden staves, and one which shoots shirukens and lightning, just to give you a taste.\n\nWhile the sequels do not quite stand up to the original, this original game is simply great and will completely whet the appetite of someone who's looking for a more pure run and gun experience than modern shooters provide.","February 22, 2014","true","4.8"," 91 of 99 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","91","99","4","0"

Read here then skip to the last lines: HOLY CRAP! WHAM! BLAM! COLORS! SOUNDS?! PEW PEW!\n\nDo you actually take time to play and enjoy games? Read here: Get this game. It's really well made and worth your attention.\n\nAutism? Social CONVENTIONS?! EYE CONTACT? WITH PEOPLE?!?!  :  This game does so many things right that they become nearly indiscernable until you stop to really look. In fact, the reason NONE of the Painkiller knockoffs have managed to be fun is apparent. Painkiller isn't about throwing a bunch of random cool looking enemies at you because HOLY CRAP! It's about a very subtle attention to pacing. The enemies at the start and at the end of Painkiller are a carefully planned spectrum. You get a bunch of easy fights, a slightly niftier new enemy, a bunch of easy fights, a newer niftier enemy, easy fights.... you get to a point that it all seems tired but if you look back, its a spiral staircase slowly building you up to a point that you're a god compared to the trash you started the game fighting. But at the same time you were dazzled by baubles strung along to distract you.\n\nAwesome levels in terms of space (at the time in the early 00's it was pretty neat-o) and in terms of detail (Get absorbed into the game and tell me you haven't visited Limbo recently), Sounds are a bit meh at times and "That's cool" at others. Nothing stands out. Overall graphics were good for the time and, unless you really stop to critque them, they haven't faded much. The ambient and battle musics transition well, you're kept in the realm of "what's happening now." Blended together you get a game that Epic Games rightly caught wind of. People May Fly joins Epic Games, some "Cool 'bro" happens then we wind up with BULLETSTORM!!! And if you loved Painkiller, admit it, you LOVED Bulletstorm.\n\nEither way: Cool game bro!","April 19, 2014","true","194.5"," 109 of 141 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","109","141","11","5"

Blowing up Satan himself was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing when i was younger that i can't even think of anything that comes close game wise. I mean, damn. How much more badass can ya get? But, the game does have its flaws, it is unforgivingly brutal at any difficulty other than the easiest, i havent played Painkiller in a few years i think the lowest difficulty was called Daydream, you will be in for such a masochistic ride on the highest difficulty that when you eventually beat it, you will shout in happiness and eternal badassery as you watch the Satan gibs fly everywhere, but then, you play the DLC expansion. Good Lord, if you thought the first game was hard you don't know anything yet. That one will drag you through a batter of pain and misery and then dip you in the fryer of anger and frustration and after you're done it'll chew you up, swallow you, then ♥♥♥♥ you out and promptly take a ♥♥♥♥ on your defeated head.

The objectives required to unlock these tarot cards are different for each level in the game & can be a bit tedious & annoying on certain levels so you may want to focus on just getting the most useful cards rather than all of them.","September 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

On this basis alone, Painkiller is worth a few hours of your time. The weapons are some of the most imaginative that you will experience, and the enemies are just as interesting. The storyline is a tired trope, but it's little more than an excuse to deal death to hordes of demons, clowns, nazis, witches, zombies, and pretty much everything else you can think of. Also the bosses you fight are truly epic in scale as they tower above buildings and clouds alike. The sheer variety of weapons and baddies keep things from getting stale, but the gameplay is a little one dimensional, as you are simply tasked with obliterating everything you see. But there is a genius in that simplicity as you creatively carve up throngs of adversaries. 7.5/10","August 7, 2011","true","3.8"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Don't bother with the sequels/expansions; this is the best one of the series. Crazy weapons (a gun that shoots shurikens AND lightning), great old-school level design that encourages exploration and rewards completionists, and some semblance of a plot to keep pushing you forward. There's a "black tarot" system where you unlock cards to give yourself active & passive powerups by performing certain tasks in levels. You equip these between maps and they give you unique boosts such as increasing your base health, faster movement speed, and temporary invincibility.

The story is lame, the graphics are ok for how old it is, and the music and sound are kinda bad.  It's not very hard except there are a couple fights you're supposed to figure out with no hints that you're supposed to or any clues to what the answer is.\n\nMost of the game is just kill all the monsters go to the next room, repeat until the boss who you just shoot a lot until he dies.  But 3 fights have a trick to them that you have to figure out while the rest you just have to learn how to not die from their attacks and shoot them.  The first tricky one you encounter is the most difficult to figure out and a nonsense solution, the second is meh, and the third is kind of solveable but non of the game's mechanics are explained to get you to think about how to solve it.","July 26, 2014","false","9.4"," 35 of 401 people (9%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","9","35","401","8","8"
