Still obviously rough around the edges, especially as the difficulty ramps WAY up in the campaign very fast - I might say frustratingly fast.  A bit more "Clicky" than I normally prefer but a very interesting alternative the the usual RTS fare and a lovely visual presentation.  A lot of potential, assuming it keeps getting developed.\n\nA few things I hope will play out as development goes along:\n\n1) A gentler ramping up of difficulty.  The first two planets are challenging for a newcomer, but easily beaten.  The third one is suddenly far more difficult.  I find this just a bit too punishing - a smoother curve is needed.\n2) Something to automate repairs.  Having to manually send out one drone at a time while you're being harried to death is a bit much in my opinion.  Interesting idea but I'm not sure it scans, because there aren't really any "lulls" in combat to support a manual repair mechanic.\n3) Menu transitions in the game are too long.  Just getting out of the game when you're done takes thirty seconds or so, which doesn't seem like a lot until you wait through it.\n\nAnd one suggestion:\nMultiple star systems.  This would make a very interesting basis for an extended, or even a procedural campaign mechanic, and would help keep the game fresh.  And after all there are a lot of elements in the Periodic Table.\n\nIn spite of my quibbles it's a game that shows a great deal of interest and promise and I am looking forward to seeing it take shape.  Definitely worth its buy-in cost, even taking all the above into account.","December 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glidder/recommended/422300/","glidder","[PERRA]  Glidder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glidder/","614 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nV1.1 UPDATE:Most of the problems described in my previous review have been solved or at least acknowledged for the next content update.\nWhat has changed:The interface is still beautiful, and now it's also way more convenient an comfortable.\nThe amount of clicks necessary have been substantially reduced with a back button and context sensitive placement of structures.\nAll relevant information is now shown on the improved right panel, and the different type of structures are now easier to differentiate.\nThe gameplay has been tinkered, and now feels more agile and fair. Objectives have been adjusted to solve some awkward situations that previously existed (like losing the game for destroying the enemy before mining enough materials), and I feel like repair drones are more effective.\nThe tutorial has been temporarily removed, but it will be improved to be included in the next update with a readjusted difficulty curve.The game (being still in Early Access) is obviously not content-complete, but the developer is doing great as far as I'm concerned, and I'm excited for the next update!\n\n(previous review:\nThis game has a great aesthetic sense and a somewhat interesting concept, but unfortunately for now (It is still Early Access) that's all it's got.\nUser InterfaceIt's beautiful, but dreadful.\nIt takes ages, sweat and tears to navigate the menus. I've had to click up to 12 times to place 2 different structures, as I navigated from terrain type, to unit type, to unit strength, and then click back all those options again to return to the initial menu... not ideal for a quick response.\n\nThe structures are too similar for me, and the game provides very little feedback of what's going on (particularly on the side of the planet you can not see).\n\nIn short, the UI is often one of the game's greatest source of frustration. And speaking of frustration:\nDifficultyThis game really needs balancing. The first two planets are almost boringly easy, and suddenly by the fourth one it's impossible to get a foothold, as you are quickly surrounded by an ever-growing mass of enemy structures and satellites.\nGame MechanicsThe game consist of placing structures for attacking, defending, and resource gathering. The structures can be placed on earth, air and water.\nThe placement of the structures is not context sensitive, and you'll have to manually specify the terrain type (meaning that you have to  constantly deal with the click-fest described in the UI section).\nDefensive structures feel useless.\nThe game includes missiles and repair drones that can be sent at any time, but the interface is such a burden, the structures are destroyed so quickly, and the drones are so slow that they're essentially pointless, except for repairing the main base. Also there's not enough feedback to know when and where they're needed anyway.	)\n\nThe game is still in EA at the time of writing, so I'll update this review if anything changes in the future.","December 28, 2015","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was wondering if it would ever be possible to have online play enabled. I know that setting up a server would be difficult but if it was user run it still could work quite well. Is that in the works? Or does it depend on sales etc.?\n","December 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
