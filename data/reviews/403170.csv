Titan is pretty much that, a breakout clone of sorts with some pinball elements. Based on unity with up to 4k resolution and the standard range of quality settings available. No in-game options to speak of other then language selection and toggling sound on or off. Volume slider would be welcomed but the soundtrack was reasonable.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LcAlDGIXus\nGame consists of 80 levels spread across 8 different worlds, each having alternate colour schemes, music tracks and increased number of hazards. Main objective is to clear out the bricks, in doing so you uncover both power-ups and random enemy spawns. Complete a world and face a boss fight, which was a nice change of pace and little bomberman-esque.\n\nBiggest downsides are the fussy controls but after playing more I've noticed it's a matter of placing the cube behind the ball rather then 'batting' it, else it tends to travel in the wrong direction and can be a quite frustrating. Gamepad, keyboard and mouse are all supported though menus require mouse for navigation. For $3, can't expect everything and I think it's a reasonable game overall.","September 18, 2015","true","1.3"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","29","37","0","1"

There's really no excuse for this - Unity's physics are quite good if theyr'e used properly but here they're not being used properly at all.\n\nThe fact you can play with a pad but must use KBM for the menus etc. is also just laziness - the whole thing has an air of 'half finished' about it (I genuinely assumed it was Early Access on my first play!!)\n\nIt's not unplayable by any means but it really does seem like someone just stopped working on it one day ;0","October 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It's only $3 and there is a story-line, 80 levels and some unique gameplay.\n\nJust like in Brick Breaker, you are hitting an object into other objects to win the game. This time it's in 3D, and there are lots of new obstacles to prevent you from completing the level. Yes, there are some bugs with the gameplay but it's not enough to ruin the gaming experience.\n\nWorth the $3 if you enjoy Brick Breakers!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

As others have mentioned the physics are pretty bad and that ruins the experience for me. The ball bounces in incorrect directions and you have to figure out which odd/incorrect way to position yourself in order to get it on a predictable path. Many times the ball should bounce off your block at an angle but ends up being locked to the x or y axis.\n\nOther issues include:\n\n- Annoying switching back and forth between mouse and gamepad\n- Poor performance, I run other much more complex games at the highest settings but this title dips below 30fps if I have all the settings up\n- Buggy walls\n- The tutorials at the intro to each level seem like an afterthought, and are barely functional at conveying information.\n\nEven at the price of only $2.99, this isn't worth it because of the failed physics.","March 2","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
