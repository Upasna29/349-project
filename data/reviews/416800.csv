But just to remind you: This is only a small minigame from the Upcoming "Spaceventure". Not designed to be a full game. Its released on steam to support the final development of Spaceventure (With the money it generates).\n\nAnd finaly: As a Backer i already got a DRM Free Version of this Minigame for 2 weeks. And still i Bought this game on Steam!

This is a parody of Five Nights at Freddy's. A parody, not a rip-off. If you think someone was trying to pull a fast one here, you're a ♥♥♥♥♥. You haven't noticed something that's escaped the notice of everyone else. You've noticed the most obvious thing in the entire collected history of obvious things.\n\nAs parodies go... it's one of those parodies that's better than the original product. You know, the kind of parody that ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS. And I really like the games it's based on, don't get me wrong. The production values here are well in advance of even the last Freddy's game, as its developers can boast decades of combined experience in making awesome games. It's got indie soul plus triple-A quality.\n\nThis game was made by the Two Guys from Andromeda, who made Sierra's famous sci-fi parody adventure game series Space Quest. It's in the same vein. In fact, it's been released to get a bit more funding for their new project, SpaceVenture, a spiritual successor. So buy this cheap-as-heck game, enjoy it, and know you're making an even better product possible. I grew up playing Space Quest, and I can't think of a better way to pay these guys back for the hours of fun and frustration they provided than helping them provide even more.\n\nBe assured, this is a full game in its own right. It's a bit longer than the games it parodies, in fact.\n\nThis game has terrific visuals, excellent gameplay, and a great mixture of goofy and nerve-wracking moments.\n\nSeriously, play this game. FIve Nights at Freddy's is awesome. This is awesome plus decades of talent and a lot of Kickstarter money, and it'll pay for even more awesome later on. PLAY THIS GAME.","November 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","1"

I like the Patrick Warburton styled voice acting and SCI FI setting.  best of all is the jump scares WILL scare you. :) and the EVIL mutant chickens are some of the most hilariously freaky creatures I have seen yet. Never thought the sound of clucking in the dark could be so fear inducing!\n\nKnowing that this is just a tiny part of a larger upcoming adventure game by two classic video game veterans makes it a valued part of my collection, their trade mark humor is felt a lot in the dialog and even the very premise is very in line with classic Crowe/Murphy humor.\n\nThanks for the fun playable teaser you guys!  very happy to hear you are still making games! :)\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

I went in expecting a FNaF clone, but what I got a rich, enjoyable parody full of chicken-humanoid humor set in a sci-fi world with mutant birds, robotic variations, and a twisted Colonel Sanders. A bit on the easy, even when claiming "I'm not scared, Let's play!" at the start. I was let down that the camera really did little in the line of aiding me to survive the seven nights (yes, it's not just a standard work week in this one), but the deeper you get, the more tense it all becomes as you unravel more through discussions and log entries.","December 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","0"

I’ll never look at it the same way and for that I’ll never forgive them. At the same time, it was an honor to be a part of the development process even if it was just telling them every build that I hated them. Seriously, though, it’s worth playing just to get an idea of what to expect when SpaceVenture finally hits by the end of next year. And it’s cheap, with all sales going straight into developing the main game.\n\nhttp://cliqist.com/2015/11/23/five-nights-at-freddys-clone-cluck-yegger-will-make-you-scream-and-shout/","November 23, 2015","true","0.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

I've known him since he was an Astro Chicken. Or maybe that was just a buddy of his. Either way, the Two Guys from Andromeda are back with their chicken (okay rooster) fixations. Cluck Yegger is a Free Ranger protecting the galaxy. However, unlike the chickens we keep here, he is doing more than eating the ticks in the woods. Nope, Cluck is after the evil Col. Zanderz in this "Five Nights at Freddy's" parody.  Cluck is shot down by the evil genius Zanderz and now needs 7 nights to repair his ship. At night, he must use the energy he stored up during the day to fight off Zanderz's minions.\n\nThe game is the mini-game that is due to appear in the Two Guys new adventure game  Ace Hardway. Ace Hardway  hasn't graced our terminals yet but they decided to release Cluck Yegger to give us all a little taste of the game. I for one am glad they did. Okay, the fact that Five Nights at Freddy's didn't even exist when they funded  Ace Hardway  on Kickstarter is just one of those strange time bending problems you expect in space (see  Star Trek, Star Wars, Buck Rogers  and  Lost in Space ). The game is a pretty slick parody with fun game play. You have the lights and doors to your cockpit but also cameras and lights in your ship and cameras in Col. Zanderz's factory. You also have a ship shield to deal with one rather large oven roaster. You also get Cluck's commentary which shows that the Two Guys haven't forgotten how to write in their too long absence.\n\nCan you last all seven nights? Thus far, I've made it to 5am on night 4 but I'm pathetic at Freddy's too. This delights my children who are laughing themselves right out of an inheritance. For $2.99 you can probably do better. And hopefully have a laugh or two along the way. Plus you are helping out a couple of swell guys from Andromeda. Me, I'm going to make it to night 5. Even if I have to ask the kids for help.","November 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

That is up to you, as only YOU can save Henkind!\n\n...\n\nFor $3 you really can't go wrong with this game, especially since it will help development of another, larger game from developers that were at the forefront of parody and satire in videogames back in the day.

Only this time, you’re not the night watchmen at a children’s pizzeria, but a Space Ranger by the name of Cluck Yegger. Crash landed on the industrial planet of his arch nemesis, Colonel Zanderz, Cluck must remain on the planet for seven days before his ship’s engines can reach full capacity. Each night, however, he must survive the constant threat of Zanderz’s mutated chicken monsters.\n\nAs mentioned before, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is an FNAF clone. You’ll have a variety of security cameras to monitor, doors to open and close and lights to flicker on and off, all the while maintaining battery power… sound familiar? So, gameplay is pretty much identical between both titles.\n\nHowever, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is clearly aimed towards a younger audience. The scenery and monsters aren’t nearly as sinister as other horror titles and the game has a humorous tinge to it. Thing is… it’s not very funny. The voice actor behind Cluck is trying WAY too hard to be Patrick Warburton, who some of you may know as Joe from Family Guy, and his audio logs between nights may crack a smile outta your kid, if anything.\n\nThe game’s managed to get me with a few jump scares, and I’ll give it credit for that, but there’s such a lack of dread to it. There’s no nail-biting tension or crazy build up, they just seem to happen without rhyme or reason.\n\nGameplay is solid for the most part, but one thing is seriously hindering the experience: Almost every ten seconds or so, your monitors will be bombarded by static. This happens so often and so frequently, that I don’t have time to spot the monster before the screen goes white. It’s stupidly annoying. Apart from a minor mechanic where you can stun the monsters with high-powered lights, there’s nothing new to see here.\n\nAs of this review’s posting, I’m only on night five, but I still plan on beating the game. Seeing as how they’re only asking for 3 bucks, feel free to give it a shot if you're a fan of FNAF or games like it. But don’t expect anything too special from Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid.","November 9, 2015","false","1.3"," 28 of 63 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","28","63","0","0"
