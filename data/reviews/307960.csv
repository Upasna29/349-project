Not very... simulationy.. is it?\nThis is excellent way of 1C telling you that they did not have anything to offer for a proper campaign, and instead force you to take the free-to-play design of slow grind for small progress.\n\nWith that said, the campaign atleast works in its own way and AI behavior is not outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, although your flight will often take the route of attacking a bomber directly from behind, and you'll most likely be dive-racing PE-2's at +600km/h in order to even have a chance to shoot them down.\nOther gamemodes are similar to the campaign, though quick mission builder allows for more customization. Do note that you cannot "grind your unlocks" in any mode except campaign.\n\nPlane selection is pretty much what you'd expect from such a title, Luftwaffe sports the ever-iconic Bf 109's, models F-4 and G-2, the Ju-87 "Stuka" divebomber, He-111 medium bomber. Soviet airforce has the less enticing selection consisting of the LaGG-3 and Yak-1 fighters, iconic IL-2 Sturmovik ground attacker and Pe-2 light bomber.\nBoth sides also have a special DLC fighter plane available, Fw 190 A-3 for the Luftwaffe and La-5 series 8 for the Soviets. And no, the premium DLC planes do not come fully unlocked, you still have to "grind the unlocks".\n\nEach plane has it's unique characteristics; the 109's are fast and easy to handle, with cockpit layouts simple enough to learn fast, while the LaGG-3 is a tumbling mess, most dedicated into driving you to the ground while you try to make sense of the gauges, with the Yak staying far more competetive with the superior German fighters.\nThe Stuka and Sturmovik attack planes are both slow and steady, with very different methods of attack. The Stuka will mostly dive from above with its nose pointed almost directly down to bomb accurately, only airbrakes to slow the descent, while the IL-2 will attack almost level with rockets, bombs and big cannons for widespread destruction.\nThe bombers fly level, and bomb, when they're not just for target practice. Really, what else is there to say?\n\nCommenting on flight or damage models is the hardest thing, but while the planes fly and get shot down like planes do (I guess), one can definitely say a lot of the arcade-like simplicity the mechanics and maintaining have.\nAll of the planes do their start-up routine with a push of a single button, with crucial actions remaining automated, or optionally, under manual control in a very simple way. This takes away a lot from the potential immersion, with "detailed aircraft systems modeling" being mostly text on the screen and few animations.\n\nMultiplayer works well, with no larger bugs around, although the lack of servers and even the amount of max players per server is disappointing.\n\nWhile the gameplay is definitely lacking, is there anything the AV department can salvage?\n\nBoS does have decent lighting to complement the snow-covered potato fields and the clouds aren't low-resolution mush, gun and engine sounds are enjoyably powerful with models representing accurately their real-life counterparts.\nBut besides that, what can a game of such limited sensual experience give?\n\nSadly, this is again where the game falls short. Planes otherwise being well-detailed, their textures are low resolution, with blurry and blocky normal maps reflecting the sun off your wing in a gringeworthy glare, and jagged, low resolution shadow maps looking like they're about to cut your cockpit into half as they pass.\nSounds are incredibly bugged as well, with sound latency up to the level of you hearing your gunfire hits on the enemy plane, and it being impossible to hear your plane being hit.\nDespite the seemingly low amount of graphical detail at any given time, the game has issues with low framerates, suttering and overall poor performance even on a modern, mid-end PC (i5-4690k, R9 270).\n\nThis is most likely due to the ancient DirectX 9 renderer the game uses, and very limited graphical customization, being limited to resolution, four presets of Low, Balanced, High and Ultra, with an added MSAA option.\nNot even the v-sync is properly implemented with triple-buffering, so you'll most likely have to choose between massive tearing, or being locked to 30FPS on the slightest framedrop.\n\nAfter all this, who is this game really for?\nWith its simplified systems and gameplay, I wouldn't recommend it for people looking for the most authentic simulation experience, it offers too little for the price.\nBut the same thing is true for the more casual player or enthusiast, it offers too little for the price and there are games out there that do most of what BoS offers, better and for less.\n\nI can't help but feel this game was released crippled and is simply trying to ride the IL-2 name to simply break even. There's potential to this, but as it is currently, I can't recommend it to anyone.\n\nRating: 5/10 at the time this is written. Mostly for the working multiplayer, although many of the issues creep into there as well.","November 7, 2014","false","45.9"," 450 of 578 people (78%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","78","450","578","16","14"

IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is a true flight simulator with realistic aerodynamics, wind, bullet trajectories, bullet velocities, engine management, etc. You don't necessarily need to be a pilot to be able to do things in this game, but it'll take you some time to understand some of the basic flight physics that are modeled into the game. However, that first lift off that you accomplish will feel like a real accomplishment, and that's what this game is about.\n\nBefore I get into my review session, let me clarify why there are a lot of negative reviews for this game. I'm a founder, and bought the game while it was in early access. I then had the key transferred over to steam so that I could have all of my games in one place. When the game first came out, there was a lot of things lacking. The flight models still needed some work, and the grind to get camos and modifications was pretty hard. However, the studio has fixed the problems with the flight models for the most part, and they're very active within the community on their own forums.\n\nThere are two versions of this game: the standard and the deluxe version. The only difference is that the deluxe version comes with two more planes: the Focke-Wulf 190 A3 and the La 5 series 8, and it also gives you all of the unlocks for the planes right off of the bat. Neither of these planes are the best of the best. I find that the skill level of the pilot is what decides who wins what engagement. I've had countless of battles with the FW 190 and the La 5 and still came out on top.\n\nThe campaign in this game is pretty lackluster, but this is more of a multiplayer game, anyways. There are two parts: the initial part of the Battle of Stalingrad where the Germans are forcing their way in, and the second part where the Russians use a pincer maneuver to encircle the German forces. Within each part, there are three sections that chop the part up into smaller pieces to give a sense of advancement. You select a section which then brings you to a map. You select an airport where you want to start from. You have the option to choose either normal or expert mode and also whether you want the mission to be short or long. Normal mode is basically arcade mode. You don't have to worry about your engine management; the game will throttle itself for you and manage the radiators so you don't kill your engine in mid flight. You also have a HUD on your screen that shows you a map, gives you your indicated air speed and alitude, and marks everything friendly with a blue dot above it and anything enemy with a red dot. It also shows you how far out you are as well. In expert mode, everything is gone. You have to look at your gauges to see how high you are and how fast you're going. You have to look at your coolant temperature and oil temperature to keep from overheating your engine. If either ones gets too high or too low, you have to open or close your water and oil radiators. There are no markers that show where your enemy is, so you have to scan the sky for black dots or scan the ground for smoke trails that come from trains or tracers that come from artillery positions. The main difference between a short and long mission is that you have to take off and land on a long mission, while a short mission will start you up in the air pretty close to your target. You don't have to land on a short mission, but you have to fly through an "exit point" to clear the mission.\n\nEach plane has its own flight model that is very accurate. Each plane has different stall characteristics, engine management characteristics, etc. A good example is the Stuka. Its engine can't take sudden throttle changes, so if you cut the throttle really fast for a dive bombing run and then shove it back up when you go to climb, your engine will sputter and die. In the BF 109, if you run the throttle at 2600 RPM at 1.4 engine manifold pressure for over a minute, the engine will start to choke causing the plane to shake, sputter, and die.\n\nDamage models are pretty realistic as well. You can't shoot down a bomber from its six o' clock (why would you?) because the gunners will shoot you straight in the engine with their machinegun. Depending upon where it hits, you'll either have a critical oil system failure which will cause your windshield to get coated in oil and the engine to eventually die, you'll fly off safe and sound, and anything in between. When it comes to this game, one bullet in the right place is all it takes to take down a plane.\n\nThe multiplayer is really what this game is about. Unfortunately, in America, I don't seem to be able to find many players playing on our servers. Instead, I have to go to European servers to play with people. However, I don't experience any lag or rubber banding.\n\nThere is another game that is coming out soon in March called IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Moscow. Like this game, it's centered around one specific battle. The Battle of Moscow occurred earlier than the Battle of Stalingrad, so you'll be flying earlier versions of the aircraft such as the BF 109F2, I-16, BF 110, MiG 3, etc.","December 24, 2015","true","48.2"," 126 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","126","142","10","5"

It's a highly polished gem, fitted into cheap mass produced jevelry and wrapped in gift bag bough on discount last January. If you want realistic flying experience, don't miss it. If you want to treat yourself seriously as a simmer, you may find out-of-cockpit parts of game not dignified enough *Still mostly true, although quality of jewelry is much better*.\n\nThe good: The sim part (simulating planes and their enviroment) is very good - the game is great stick and rudder experience, the planes have mass and inertia, when flying them on the edge of flight envelope you feel them sliding from course, rather than being pushed to the side along set vector with randomized shaking added. The AI planes use the same physics as player, so they don't take breaks from reality and pretend they are jets when pressed to hard. Par the course, some people find flight models unrealistic or simply not what they expected. There are no clickable cockpits like in CloD or DCS, but after automated engine start you get to control most of plane systems (IMHO the biggest missing part is no manual fuel tank selection). To me it has the best feeling of "being there" of all WW2 planes, but I'm stick and rudder fetishist, not clickable cockpit fetishist. There are no stability problems, unfinished plane systems of weird flight behaviour.\n\nThe bad: There are ten flyable plane types in the game (*Battle of Moscow will bring ten more, five already done, that BoS owners can meet in air even without owning BoM*). More are in the works, but because of sim part being detailed like I said above, making new planes is slow process. Do not expect to see tens of flyables soon, or variants of the same model (like all Bf-109F variants) made by small modifications of existing plane. There are *no* AI-only planes (one *has been made since review was written*) because, as they use realistic flight physics, they are not easy to make, either. You won't see tens upon tens of computer-controled planes in misisons, either, they are to CPU-hungry for that. The number of players in MP missions is limited (*much less now than year ago*) , devs still work on optimising support of more players in mission as I write. The single player part, or campaign, is something in between proper career from IL-2:1946 and mission generator - you pick stage of the battle, airfield you take off from, plane, mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, bombing, close air support) and off you go. Missions are generated randomly with variety of weathers and targets, but they aren't as immersive as real career missions - maybe because you get no background on what your target is and why it's important beyond "go and bomb that bridge". There are difficulty settings in game, but in campaign you can use only two presets, normal (icons and automated engine management) and expert (realistic). Instead of adjusting realism settings before mission, you disable unrealistic aids in flight by key command (say, I bound a key that turns all engine helpers off and hit it at start of each mission, to fly with manual engine management but icons on). *The third party PWCG, a full blown career generator, is coming and already playable*.The mission editor is quite complicated so there isn't flood of user-made content and multiplayer servers - but what community made so far was of very good quality.\n\nThe ugly: The most hated part, which caused many people to give up the game as arcade: the plane modifications (bombs for fighters, bigger cannons, armoured windscreens etc) are unlockable - you get them by flying the plane in question in single player campaign. Most of these mods are non-standard, experimantal, or one-off modifications, but few are standard-issue systems that you can't accss from the start. *Owners of Premium edition - all 10 planes - can now disable the dreaded unlocks with one mouse click*. Also, the campaign includes game elements like experience and player "level" (the higher it is, the more dangerous becomes opposition and flak fire in campaign. I suppose it is meant to make game easy for new sim players and progress as they succeed and learn). Then, you can start the mission in the air, half way towards the target, and abort it on reaxching "exit" waypoint - takeoff and landing are optional - and on lower player levels thare is little action outside target area. So the first impression is that missions consist of going to action point, doing your job, going back. It's not the case, but you have to bother playing through simpler missions to make things more interesting. These are pointless additions to otherwise purebreed sim, and many people can't get past it - some play multiplayer only and don't want to play campaign at all, some call it pointless grinding, some are so experienced they want difficult missions from the start and give campign up as to easy before they rise their pilot level and get to difficult stuff. Make no mistake, once you sit in the cockpit you get a proper sim experience, and once you get your unlocks and rise level to get interesting missions you just have a good mission generator to play with forever, no limits - but the awards that are supposed to motivate players to play are something out of console game.\n\nThere are smaller bad decisions, like locking most of graphics options to four preset settings - you don't get to set manually drawing distance for objects or super sampling, you choose high, low, medium, ultra setting and that's it. You have manual control of resolution and antialiasing, though. It made some sense in development, but is pointless now * and has been made more workable with more options to customise your settings some time after review was written*.\n\nAll these are *were* pointless design decisions that nobody i know likes, but the developers stay by them *until they fixed them*. This stubborness earned them lot of enemity and made many people abandon the game *still true*, but I have to say dev team is very cooperative with community in most other respects, adding elements requested by players and listening to suggestions of flight model changes. There was some rush to release the game on deadline, so maybe they will replace it with something better once team catches they breath *they did*. Or not. *Or they add option to drive tanks*.","December 22, 2014","true","97.3"," 204 of 264 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","204","264","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/recommended/307960/","startrekmike","startrekmike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/startrekmike/","210 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been playing this sim since about five months ago via early access so what I will say here is really only based on that experience and not with the final product, if it is possible to edit/update my review once the final release occurs in September, I will be sure to do so.\n\n1.) first impressions.\n\nThe menu/UI is slick and easy to work with, not a lot of fussing about is required to do anything at all and it is quick to get from your desktop to the cockpit. The overall menu presentation is pretty nice as well with the hanger containing your aircraft (the last one you flew with), this is not unlike 777's previous sim Rise of flight with it's museum backdrop with your aircraft in it.\n\nSetting up controls was pretty straightforward and will be easy for anyone with any exprience in simulations previously or even War thunder, in fact, it shares some interesting ideas in terms of control binding with War thunder (in a good way).\n\nSetting up the visual options is pretty basic with presets, I am not sure if this is going to be a permanent thing and sadly I suspect this will be something that really gets hit hard from those that are arbitrarily judging games based on the video options (due to some influence from certain youtube personalities).\n\n2.) The visuals.\n\nVisually this sim is stunning, the snowy backdrop may not be the most colorful or feature rich but it looks very impressive, easily giving you a sense of immersion, you will almost feel like you need a hot cup of coffee after flying your first sortie, it really does give the impression of winter very well.\n\nThe terrain itself is very highly detailed despite it's rather sparse nature, the snow is not just a flat texture but instead gives the impression of varying depths and snowbacks.\n\nThe Sky is very nice, the lighting helps sell the winter setting with a bright, cool sunlight that you would expect from that season, the cloud effects are probably the best I have ever seen in a sim with amazing effects as you fly through them, it really gives the whole thing a dramatic feeling when you set the flight time to early dawn or dusk as the colors get very beautiful.\n\nThe aircraft models are fantastic, they are detailed and well animated with rather impressive texture work, including a really nice reflection effect off the metal (this highlights very well that some aircraft were not entirely metal but instead had some fabric or wood parts). Additionally, the damage effects are great, the billowing smoke when you cause a fire is the most convincing I have seen in a sim and the fire effects are second to none at this point.\n\n3.) Gameplay.\n\nLike Rise of flight before it, IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is a survey sim first and foremost, it is not trying to be DCS WWII or anything like that, nor is it trying to be very arcade like War thunder or Birds of prey, it's realism is found in it's flight models, weapon strength and damage models but like Rise of flight, you don't have a clickable cockpit or anything like that.\n\nOne thing to note very clearly however, you still need to manage your engine and it's cooling systems, these controls are not handled with your mouse in the cockpit but instead you bind these controls to your flight stick/throttle so you can easily access and manage them in combat. Additionally, the methods you use to manage your engine/cooling are realistic, you need to understand your aircraft's limits before you hop in the cockpit or else you will be blowing engines all over the place due to neglect.\n\nThe combat is the real star of the show (as it should be in a WWII air combat sim), the action feels fast, brutal and visceral, this is punctuated by the brutally effective weapons at your disposal, you will be knocking down aircraft pretty quickly due to the way these planes were armed (usually with a cannon through the nose cone and two machine guns on top of the nose), it will only take a few bursts to utterly trash a opponents aircraft.\n\nOne final note on gameplay, the feeling of flight (as I mentioned before) is something really special here, the sound, the control responses and the visuals all combine to really sell you the idea that you are flying in a aircraft, it just feels right in a way that is difficult to describe.\n\n\n4.) The game modes.\n\nThis is a spot that will expand greatly as the game reaches completion, as it stands, you only have quick battle mode and some pretty limited online modes to choose from, this is understandable since these servers really only exist for testing and not for varied gameplay.\n\nOnce the mission editor is made available publicly (something that will happen despite what some have said on the forums), there will be a great deal more available for both single and multiplayer gamers.\n\nThe campaign mode is not yet implemented but it is probably coming soon to early access in some form or another, if it is like they describe, it will offer a good, historical experience that will span specific phases of the Battle of Stalingrad in a realistic way.\n\n5.) Final thoughts.\n\nI can understand the feelings that some may have when they visit the store-page and see the price and the "DLC" but it is important to note that in the flight simulation market, this price is indeed not only fair but very much business as usual, the seemingly high price comes from the fact that flight simulations are a extremely niche genre with a relatively small built in user-base, this is why IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is not price the same as you might find from a more mainstream genre game, it is the only way that they can make enough money to justify the continued work on it.\n\nAs far as the "DLC" goes, it was made clear on the forums by the dev's some time ago that the extra planes were added as a fun extra for those willing to get the premium edition, they were not "removed" from the main game at all since they did not even serve in the Battle of Stalingrad anyway. More to the point, they are not "Pay to win" since they are not really the best aircraft anyway.\n\nThose that are complaining about the extra planes should keep in mind that they were never really part of the main game anyway, they were simply a extra for the premium buyers, they are not objectively better, they are not "pay to win" they are just like any other premium edition of a game with extra content.\n\nAs a flight sim enthusiast first and foremost, I can happily say that this sim brings back a lot of the fun that one could find in IL-2 1946 while still offering a experience deep enough to keep DCS players intrigued.\n\nIf you like flight sims, if you like interesting multiplayer opportunities or even just the Eastern front air war in general, this is a great sim that will give you hours of fun.","August 15, 2014","true","11.4"," 204 of 276 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","204","276","0","9"

And perhaps even the word 'battle' is inapropriate given that instead of the massive Stalingrad campaign involving vast numbers of planes, tanks, infantry and equipment you are presented with a bleak landscape where very little action takes place. You would hardly know there is a war going on let alone one of the most bitterly fought campaigns in history. And on top of that, there are so few available planes to fly. I don't expect a sim to be 100 % historically accurate, but really, a Stalingrad air battle simulation without JU52s? I can just about live with the fact there are no ME 110s (just about) but no JU52s? The whole point of the final phase of the Stalingrad air battle (and I repeat that is all you get) was providing the trapped German army with vital supplies from the air. In this important part of the battle JU52s were key. To a lesser extent the HE111 also contributed to the air-drops (and you do at least get this plane in the under-crowded hangar) but the JU52 was the principal work-horse. Making a Stalingrad sim without it is a huge oversight. In addition the different phases of the so called 'Campaign' are simply repetitions of the same meagre selection of missions given another title. Nothing more than scripted, non-dynamic quick missions with little or no variation. Last, but by no means least, you have to pay extra for two planes you should have received with the main product in the first place. After spending 50 euros on an incomplete sim it is a slap in the face to the customer to have to dish out another 18 euros for one additional aircraft. And by the way, DON'T. These aircraft are not in the same league as DCS World aircraft. For example, the flight characteristics of the FW 190 are almost laughable. Generally considered to be one of the most nimble, agile fighter of WWII, this simulated version snatches into a spin at the least provocation. It spins when you bank steeply and even during a simple barrell roll! Loops and Immelmans are performed reluctantly and the controls lock when you go into in a steep dive. The worst 190 flight model I have come across to date - a complete waste of money. (By the way, my HOTAS joystick equipment is top-notch.)\nIn general this over-priced sim is a missed opportunity. Instead of the high quality sim that flight enthusiasts were hoping for it is simply an upgraded IL2 1946, but without the variety, and with far fewer planes and far less playability. The graphics are ok, but they fall way short of Cliffs of Dover (which is better than BOS in every respect) and, inexplicably, there are no clickable cockpits! As for the unlocks, it is ridiculous that you are forced to grind your way through hours of mind-numbing, repetitous campaign missions just to unlock features you have already paid for. These locked features include gun-pods, rockets and even bombs! Incredibly, you have to do this for every single aircraft type! I suggest you wait and see before you buy. If the developers invest time and effort into completing this product and fixing the many problems it could potentially be an interesting simulation, and worth the price. But for the moment, don't buy it.\n\nUPDATE\nI tried to like BOS. Being a flight sim fan I flew hours of tedious missions (starting way back in pre-order days) hoping the devs would fix some of the many things that needed fixing. But very little has been done and enough is enough - I have deleted the game from my PC. I may try again in a while to see if things have improved. But somehow I doubt things will have changed much. For now I have the feeling I've thrown my money away on a  rip-off. Back to Cliffs of Dover for a top flight-sim experience.\n\nUpdate 2\nSo finally, after much pressure from the community (what's left of it) they have unlocked the absurd locked up features, But ONLY if you buy the two extra planes (another 35 euros down the drain). So FIRST they lock almost every necessary piece of equipment (including bombs for bombers would you believe) then they make you BUY the unlock! Don't support these greedy money-grabbers. They are ripping you off and making it look like they're doing you a favour. Plus they finally added the JU52 transpoprt but ......only AI you can't fly it!","October 24, 2014","false","120.8"," 283 of 407 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","283","407","2","16"

In IL-2 Sturmovik: BoS you take control of WWII planes from both the Russian side and the German side of the fighting that took place during the Battle of Stalingrad. You pilot these aircraft on missions ranging from intercepting enemy bombers to taking out artillery or even war trains.\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad excels at being a great simulation, sadly it fails at being an enjoyable game for the most part so I would suggest only getting this if you're serious about flight sims. Before I get started I'd just like to point out I played this entirely with a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flightstick, the controls are pretty complex and planes are difficult to handle even with a flightstick so if you're a KB&M only player you might want to think about getting a flightstick to play this.\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: BoS is certainly a game which has mixed reviews on the store page but, despite it's issues, I enjoyed playing it and at the end of the day that's what matters.\n\n+Gorgeous graphics, even on medium settings everything looks great\n+Excellent aircraft models\n+Fantastic, realistic physics and fully customisable realism settings though even on relatively low realism settings the physics still feel real\n+Great and importantly accurate plane damage models\n+Has a campaign mode, pre-made missions, quick missions/free flight and multiplayer\n+All of the aircraft feel very responsive\n+A good mix of fighter aircraft and heavy bombers, not that that's difficult with so few aircraft but more on that later\n+Simple UI\n+Very large maps\n+Great sound effects\n+The devs are currently working on Summer and Autumn maps which is exciting as the game currently only has Winter maps\n\n-Only eight aircraft (excluding the two DLC planes) which really isn't good enough for a flight sim\n-Unlocking anything requires grinding in the campaign mode. Having to grind to unlock skins and weapons in a simulation game is bad enough but the fact that you can only unlock things through the campaign is rather disappointing for those who have no interest in playing the campaign, let alone grind the campaign missions, such as myself\n-They've already released DLC which I think is unacceptable for an Early Access game and such an expensive one at that (just for the record I own the Deluxe edition which comes with the DLC)\n-I experienced quite a few issues with freezing and crashing during loading screens\n-Not many graphics options\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA solid WWII flight simulator with gorgeous graphics and great realism that is let down by its lack of planes and all of the grinding to unlock things. If you can look past the lack of aircraft and all of the grinding or you're simply looking for a WWII flight sim then I recommend picking this up.\n\n***This review was written using a Deluxe Edition key provided by the Publisher for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 2, 2015","true","13.8"," 116 of 159 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","116","159","8","11"

THAT IS NOT OK!!!!!\n\nYOU CANNOT PUT UNLOCKS IN A FLIGHT SIMULATOR!!!! IT DEFEATS THE DAMN POINT!!!!!\n\nReally, the dullards who would lose interest without unlocks are not the type of people who play serious flight simulators.\n\nLook at Red Orchestra, there are no meaningful unlocks, nobody cares about them.  People play the game because anyone can do anything regardless of how long they've been playing.\n\nPeople who play flight simulators are intelligent people with work and ♥♥♥♥ to do!!! WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GRIND TO UNLOCK THIS CRAP!!!!!!\n\nThis was my previous review which mostly holds true.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExcellent interface and physics.\n\nThey even let you change the response function on your input. (which is really quite excellent for a flight sim)\n\nThe crash and damage physics are exactly what you'd want them to be. (like 1946, but more modern)\n\nNow that it's not published by ubisoft, we're getting much more game for the money.\n\nOk, here are some nit picks (obviously it's not done yet):\nThe slomo is not as good as in cliffs of dover. (cliffs of dover let you see the individual prop blades) So, the trailer is a lie....\n\nAlso, It defaulted to using my CPU's integrated graphics instead of my GPU...  I've never had a game do that.  So if yours runs really slow, open your nvidia control panel and make sure it's set to use the GPU instead of auto selecting.\n\nThe DLC is overpriced.... (but I bought it anyway.. :-P)\nReally though... I'd like more planes as DLC, but they need to be much cheaper, like 2.50 or something, maybe 5, not 20.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with how it's coming along.\n\nPS I noticed some people don't realize that you must register the CD keys with your account that you create...

The planes themselves feel very faithfully modelled, both visually (particularly the damage modelling) and in terms of flight characteristics. The narrower selection of planes means that each has been finished to a very high standard, although the developers have already made some suggestions about planes being added following release.\n\nAt the moment there are 10 planes scheduled for release, with only one (the HE-111 medium bomber) not yet added. The Soviets get the much-loved but definitely disadvantaged Lagg, the Yak-1, the Pe-2 and the IL-2. The Luftwaffe have the 109 F4, 109 ♥♥♥♥s well as the Stuka and the Heinkel. In addition to the 8 basic aircraft there are two additional "premium" aircraft (the FW 190 and the LA 5). These extra two aircraft can be purchased either in the premium version, or by waiting until launch and buying them individually.\n\nThe visual effects are obviously excellent and the sound is generally very good, although a few effects appear to be missing (eg some hit sounds on your own airraft), but that can probably be put down to the game still being in early access.\n\nThe AI is also very impressive and provides a very challenging opponent without resorting to any cheating: the AI follows the same rules as the player, has his vision constrained by the cockpit and controls his plane via control inputs as well. I've occasionally forgotten that I was fighting the computer rather than players online.\n\nAI gunners also man the gunnery positions in the Heinkel, Pe-2, the Ju-87 and IL-2, however they can also be manned by other human players. Gunnery stations in each of the planes that have them are fully modelled from a first-person pov.\n\nThe multiplayer is also very fun, even at this early stage where it appears to be a basic team deathmatch placeholder. Servers offer two difficulty settings; Normal (icons, automatic engine management, navigation assists) and Expert (no icons, manual engine management and navigation).\n\nEDIT: From reading the community page, a lot of people seem concerned that the La-5 and FW-190 premium aircraft are some sort of pay-to-win issue. They're intended for enthusiasts as neither played a significant part in the Battle of Stalingrad itself, and neither are the highest performing aircraft on either side: multiplayer is still largely a contest between the Yak-1 and the 109s.","August 16, 2014","true","75.4"," 111 of 158 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","111","158","0","0"

After that my PC got too outdated to handle anything, I moved on, years later became a man, and now I have an income so I return to the world of PC gaming and flight sims. Now I am a huge fan of Rise of Flight, DCS, and others.\n\nIf you're in to the flight sim genre, then you probably already own this title, so I will cater the following to those who might have an itch to get in to games like this or who maybe have been pondering getting this for a while.\n\nFirst things first, this game was created to be used with TrackIR. I am not saying you can't get by with a button assigned looking aprroach, but this game was intended to be used with a head tracking system, plain and simple. It is also intended to be used with a joystick, if you aren't sure about that, go out and buy a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, it's not expensive, it works fine, and it will allow you to enjoy this and other titles the way they should be enjoyed.\n\nOkay so the game. To be frank, it's fantastic.\n\nThe sense of immersion is unparalled, I've never felt more like I was really there than in this game. That being said it allows you to tailor the experience to you pretty well, you can play with plane icons, navigation icons, fully automated engine management, or you can go full real and have to hunt down your targets with your eyes and some cunning and instinct.\n\nThe visuals, should you have the PC to run Ultra settings, are great. The clouds and weather are convincing and effect combat, the textures, especially on the planes, are superb. The attention to detail in visualising the damage on your plane is amazing. One particular thing I enjoy is the effect of the sun glare. You really get a sense of how the sun effects your awareness in combat, and you can use it effectively to make attacks on enemies who can't see you coming, and it can be a pain in your side trying to spot an incoming target. I am a real life pilot of varying aircraft, and this sun glare really captures what it feels like. (and you wonder why aviator sunglasses are a thing...)\n\nThe sound design is once again superb, the wind sounds under high G, or hanging your head out of the open canopy, the sound of your bullets hitting the plane you are shooting at, and the speed of sound delay in ground explosions, is a level of detail that is often overlooked, but one that is really appreciated by me.\n\nOverall the thing IL-2 has going for it the most is a clinical attention to detail. The developers of this have spared no aspect of these aircraft in modeling and programming. The flight model of each aircraft is from my experience, spot on, and the damage model is matched with Rise of Flight in being the best I've seen.\n\nThe multiplayer experience is, well let's say it has a steep learning curve at times. There are a lot of experienced sim pilots with really nice hardware flying out there, but once you find yourself having a victory, it is unbelievably satisfying, not to mention your heart is jumpinig out of your chest. I recently chased a flight of three Bf-109s in a Lagg-3, stalking them from their blind spot (behind and slightly below) for something like 15 minutes until I had just the right moment to strike, taking out two of them and high-tailing it back to base before the third could find me.\n\nAs with all sims, yes, there are improvements to be made. I wasn't a fan of the unlock system through campaign mode at first, but I've grown to appreciate it. It has made me spend serious time learning and understanding each aircraft. Sometimes the game crashes with no warning, but this is rare. But the good news is the community support and the developer support is really one of the best out there.\n\nThis review was somewhat long winded, but I hope anyone who reads who is on the fence will give it a shot. But please if you do, be patient, there is a lot of learning and skill involved in a flight sim game like this, it takes serious thought and a sliver of dedication to fully appreciate, but once you get there it can be some of the most fun you've had as a PC pilot.\n\n~Aeronaut\n\n","January 31","true","110.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","1"

Soooo glad I did. The XP system is a non-issue for me, just playing it unlocks add-ons quick enough and they are not necessary to play well or enjoy the game, the graphics are amazing and run like a dream on my 4k monitor (running at 2560x1440) and I feel like the sensation of flying way better than most aircraft in FSX ever felt and remind me of some of the excitement of real flying (I've not flown for a couple of years).\n\nThe hint iconography that some consider arcadey is even less of an issue. Don't like it, turn it off. It is a boon for newcomers though and we do need newcomers to the genre.\n\nThe game may seem expensive for those that compare it to older games but his isn't just an update to an old superseded engine. This is a modern game with a definite focus on quality over quantity. I think most simmers will appreciate that, Whats the point of having 30 planes if they are almost the same except for the skin? How many can you really fly well (unless they fly the same and therefore pointless)?\n\nThere isn't a lot for people that just want to play single player with little in the way of variety (at least for experienced players) but to me that's true of almost any single player game. Online with a group of like minded people is where it is at.\n\nI am impressed with BoS. The core components as a flight simulator are just fantastic even if there aren't tons of frills. In the end if we want a good WW2 sim there only a couple of options. One won't be ready for some time and the others didn't impress me. Especially "free" games that get very expensive if you want to be competitive.

There have been some fairly dodgy descisions made (unlocks being probably the main one). But this game is, in my opinion, the best combat flight sim out there at the moment by quite some stretch. The flight models are awesome - more so than even the modded Cliffs of Dover, the graphics are supurb, damage modelling is up there with the best of them and the map, although mostly white, is really quite beautiful. At sunrise and sunset I find it easy just to look out of the cockpit in astonishment at the scenery. It really is a winter wonderland. I've been pounced on by quite a few Germans from doing just this. Speaking of which, the AI is pretty good and follows the same physics as the player, which makes it far better than anything else out there at present.\n\nAs far as pay to win goes, it's really not. I have both of the addon aircraft and although I like them, I'd never use them online as they simply aren't as good as the Yak or the 109. All the aircraft take skill, but these two probably take more than most.\n\nWith this game you may not get a persistent campaign (although I expect a few modders will change that with the new editors) but you do get a very atmospheric, immersive playground with some fairly historically accurate missions. Though they seem cut and paste, they are actually quite variable. You can tell a lot of work has gone into the game and is still going into the game. I expect it to continue to improve but I already play this over DCS and CloD.\n\nIn all, get this game, enjoy the flying and the dogfighting, don't get sucked into the points thing too much, and try not to look at the scenery too much either or you will be leaving smoking holes in the ground like I do.","March 1, 2015","true","79.5"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","27","36","0","1"

It is still questionable experience if we do not take Team Fusion mod and custom built campaigns into account.\n\nThe price is understandable as well, Making a sim is a pricey project and the possible audience is not even a million players. And the devs focused on the most important part of a sim game - the simulation of aircrafts. I like it that way better than rpg without role play (Dragon Age: Inquisition), or shooter without everything but graphics (Evolve).

It's on par with many top level games with DLC.\n\nMixed:\n- Campaign is based on dynamic missions. Okayish, but could be better. Since story is not a vital part of the simulator I can forgive devs for that,\n- Unlocks. If you have a premium version you could do an instant unlock, but I have decided to unlock everything myself so that I have a sense of progression. Questionable but understandable decision and it is not a simulation braking feature at any level and I will laugh at anyone saying that the abscence of 37mm on Lagg-3 forces him to "grind".\n- Limited amount of planes but it's quality over quantity.

Stalingrad air pollution, perhaps. Very nice environment in lower light levels. Pyrotechnics look good. Can be tough to discern ground elements…am I dropping bombs on artillery or deer hunters out there in the snow? I guess buildings look ok but generic.\n- I’m not a rivet counter, but fighters feel like fighters and bombers feel like bombers. I’ll leave aircraft performance reviews to the pros.\n- Easy to jump in and get started, so it’s pretty accessible for folks new to the flight sim genre. Forget about tutorials or any game documentation. Youtube does have some good videos.\nCons:\n- According to the developers, the team is concentrating on single player first. Wow…The XP grind fiasco is a complete buzzkill. I flew about 15 missions in the IL-2 waiting for the laser death ray, hyperboost and adamantium skeleton for my crews but never got them. Instead I got a tailgunner and turret for my IL-2. I shouldn’t have to grind through missions for that. I don’t play Ratchet and Clank for a reason.\n- The inspired-by-genius XP system suffers from a glitch. During heavy playing times (like the weekend) the XP system stops working. Want to grind out a few missions before the Seahawks game? Think again...grind all you want, but none of it will count till admin fixes the system on Monday morning.\n- Insipid single player mission design. Take off, fly to “action point,” bomb the train/line of 4 artillery batteries (yep 4 every time…aligned string straight)/two tanks and AA unit/transportation convoy, or shootdown enemy aircraft, return to base. Over. And over. And over. No one should call this a “campaign” by any definition. If the Russian winter and Red Army didn’t kill the German 6th Army, playing this game would have ended them as well…there lies Field Marshall Paulus…bored to death with a joystick nearby.\n- Except for the chapter introductions, the missions lack any sense of continuity. Then again, with the mind numbing sameness for each mission, who really cares? At first I was disappointed that we didn’t see the Ju-52 in the game. And I was hoping to see a lot more action on the ground…huge artillery barrages, fierce armor battles, building-to-building fighting in the streets. Nope, none of that.  A smattering of the aforementioned ground targets, and that's about it. Then again, after the grind for 3+ chapters, I stopped caring about the war.\n- Goofy AI. Sometimes your wingmen listen to you, sometimes they don’t. Enemy AI is equally weird. Very accurate tailgunners, but brain dead fighter interceptors. During my last Il-2 mission, I had six Bf-109Gs on my tail with zero escort. Didn’t suffer a scratch.\n- Not as stable as I hoped. Minimum of one mission freeze or crash-to-desktop each time I played.\n- A final minor “feature:” if you do purchase the game, do not use your real name or email address as your game name. Some folks have done that and are now stuck with it, which means you’re broadcasting your name onto every multiplayer server you log into. Developers’ response? “We have other priorities right now.” Yes you do boys, yes you do…","November 19, 2014","false","38.2"," 65 of 105 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","65","105","2","0"

I started with pacific fighters, and then bought 1946, and I loved it.  In 2013 I bought cliffs of dover, even after seeing all it's problems. I actually enjoyed it, and it ran fine for me. Now I bought battle of stalingrad, and I have to say I am really impressed. It looks absolutely gorgeous, and it is very realistic too. I love the damage models and the physics too, it is amazing. The way the wings and tail bend and break looks fantastic, and the cross winds when landing the plane is also great. I love the fire effects and the smoke trails it leaves behind, it looks great. The planes handle very realistic too, and the bail-outs looks and feels very great and smooth. There are 2 difficulty levels to choose from. Normal and Expert. Normal is for the more casual players, while expert is for hard core simulator fans. You can set a custom difficulty for quick missions, but not for the campaign. The campaign is great too, but it is actually made of randomly generated missions. You can choose what kind of mission you want to do, and what airfield you want to start from, and then pick a plane and weapons and then you choose a difficulty, and click on start, then the game will generate a mission for you. Each mission is unique, because each mission is randomly generated. The enemies spawn at different places every time, and the battlefields feel alive, because there's battles all around the place. When flying to your destination, you may notice ground battles happening below you, or other planes fighting each other in the distance, and all sorts of stuff like that. All those battles happening around you are also randomly generated, and you can even join in and help the friendlies out if you want to. You can play as either the Germans or the Russians, and they each have 4 planes to choose from, making it a total of 8 flyable planes. If you get the more expensive version of the game, you get 2 extra dlc planes. I bought the regular $60 version though, so I can't review those 2 dlc planes at the moment. The game has a decent amount of content. There is a quick mission option where you can quickly make a small mission for you to play if you want some instant action, there is a campaign mode if you want to play through 5 chapters of the battle of stalingrad, there is a mission mode where there is a list of missions to choose from if you just want to play a mission without picking options and stuff, and then there's the multiplayer mode where you can battle other players online, which is also fun. The cockpit is not clickable like cliffs of dover, but instead you need to map keys in the controls menu to use the switches and buttons and stuff. Also, I recommend you play this game with either a controller or a flight stick, because it is way too hard to fly with the keyboard. I use an xbox controller, and I am having a great time. If you enjoy flight simulators, or if you like war thunder, you should play this. It is much more realistic than war thunder though, but it is very accessible, and it has a tutorial, so most people should be fine. If you are new to flight sims, play in Normal mode, but if you are a hard core flight sim fan, play in expert mode. I totally recommend this game, even at full price it is worth it. 10/10","December 20, 2014","true","74.5"," 49 of 77 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","49","77","2","1"

The detail in this game is amazing and love the minor details that the developers implemented in the game from trails from your tires going through the snow, the long smoke trails from getting hit in the radiator and the detailed ground units. Very impressed with the games graphics and running stable! The game plays really smooth and finaly, Multiplayer is enjoyable needs some fine tuning but still fun to play.

The flight models, visuals and game-play is all very good – certainly enough to immerse yourself and enjoy flying these aircraft.\n\nPerformance and PlayabilityWhen the game first released there was a questionable amount of content and typical optimization issues, but since the first expansion started development (Battle of Moscow) there is certainly more planes, missions and scenery to expand your game with (purchase separate), and the game has become a bit more refined. Even if you don’t own the expansion, the Battle of Stalingrad campaign has been updated with the additional aircraft (as AI controlled planes), and you can even pick these new planes as AI opponents in quick missions which is a really good way of developing the game. The game has also started moving to 64-bit.\n\nNOTE: You are required to create a straight forward in-game account to play this.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669019306\nAircraftThe game comes with 8 flyable aircraft (excluding addons / deluxe edition) but it appears to of been a definitive quality over quantity approach. Included are a mixture of fighters and two engine bombers. Each ones comes with detailed cockpits, various modifications and a selection of paint schemes.\n\nThe flight models are realistic and makes the aircraft enjoyable and challenging to fly under realistic settings. The learning curve is moderate, with the hardest parts likely to be taxing and then getting these early aircraft into the air.\n\nNOTE: I purchased the Deluxe version of the game. While it does add additional aircraft (La-5 Series 8 and FW 190 A-3) which are fun to fly, I wouldn't deem it essential to those on a budget, plus you can buy both these aircraft separately anyway.\n\nMultiplayerMultiplayer is non-steam, but I found this really accessible to play. Hosting is only done via dedicated server, and it takes a little setting up, but compared to other games this isn’t as difficult.\n\nFree Flight (Quick Mission)In quick missions this is where you can setup quick engagements of a few types and specify a number of parameters easily for quick instant action gameplay for up to 16 aircraft. You are able to define the aircraft of 2 friendly and 2 enemy flights, including their paint scheme, weapons and skill level. In some locations you can also choose to start on the ground and scramble start as enemy approach.\n\nThis mode is a good way to test the ability of your chosen aircraft, as you can choose to go against any aircraft you wish.\n\nMissions & CampaignThe campaign combines a mixture of a handful of scripted missions and mostly dynamic missions. The dynamic campaign missions work by picking the starting airfield and the type of mission you want to complete, it then creates this for you to play. Playing missions gives XP, and once you accumulate you progress to the next campaign chapter (each chapter focusing on a different stage of the battle).\n\nThere are no specific squadrons, you would appear to just be playing the random pilot that plays wherever the battle is. Quite a contrast from the Career found in Rise of Flight for example. However I’ve found progressing through the campaign fun in its own way, and certainly enough to keep you interested for many hours.\n\nThere are also a selection (about a dozen or so) solo missions separate to the campaign that you can complete. There is a mission editor so you can create your own and play other users missions.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669007886\nConclusionUpdates and improvements since launch has made the game certainly more recommendable, and if you are into WW2 aviation then certainly a worth-while purchase.\n\nGood\nSelection of detailed WW2 Fighters and Bombers\nRealistic Flight models\nGood Campaign with dynamic elements.\nLots of available missions\nVery good visuals\n\nNot so good\nNot as wide selection of content as other games (but growing)\nNon-steam multiplayer (though found it easy to use and play)","April 17","true","16.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

Who cares what it costs, the game itself is fantastic. Its a great flight sim, with one of, if not THE best flight model on the market. It's simple and easy to get into, but allows for full engine control if wanted, and models it great. Everything from the time it takes to mix fuels, to the amount of cooling provided by different radiators is fully modeled. Every detail you're looking for is here. The speed inwhich the 109's undercarriage retracts, the stiff controls of the Lagg-3.\n\nAnd the damage model is absolutely top notch. From the way an aircraft wobbles, to the unpredictability and stability brought upon by bent control surfaces and struts.\n\nThis game is simply a must own for any flight sim enthusiest.

However, the graphics are superb and the flight models are good enough.  The flight and combat experience are absolutely wonderful and immersive.\n\nHopefully, the game will only get better if enough people buy into it and development continues which is a big question mark, unforutnately.  Most of the criticism leveled at the game are by long time flight-simmers that have pretty unrealistic expectations and demands.  The price for this game is very steep but it is currently the only World War II simulation under active devopment.

I expect games like this to deliver a pretty realistic feeling flight experience and beautiful graphics, and it does deliver these things, but I was worried with 1C involved it would be less like ROF than I expected. I was hoping for something of an improved ROF: WW2.\n\nI needn't have worried. At this stage in early access a lot of the interface elements look like a cleaner version of ROF and I was able to get in the action right away. I don't do MP and I think there is enough here to play around with and get a feel for the various aircraft at this stage in SP. I guess if you didn't like ROF you won't like this either, this has a much stronger 777 studios feel than a 1C feel.\n- Acccount activation and Log In: a Lot like ROF with a seperate Steam Key and activation needed to play. Should be no problem for anyone.\n- Pricing: Pretty consistent with how ROF was priced, I wouldn't expect anything different here,\n\nI did have an issue with access at first, but they fixed it first thing the next business day. Overall pretty good for early access version, I am hoping for a much more fleshed out SP experience once it's final, but I'm fine with what I have seen so far. Seems like there is room for expansion later on down the line, and that will be a good thing.","September 1, 2014","true","48.0"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

Bringing in the RoF and IL-2 teams under one roof was a genius move and it's really paid off. The flight mechanics are spot on and it doesn't just feel like WW2 planes with the RoF engine. This feels like it was built from the ground up to be a realistic (but fun) WW2 flight simulator. The UI is terrific, I've played many sims flight or otherwise and this game by far has the cleanest, friendliest UI of any. I hope new comers to the flight sim world start here because not only is it a great sim it's extremely easy to jump right into. The addition of short missions (optional takeoff/landing) will really help ease new players into the fun and the campaign seems  well adapted.","October 9, 2014","true","14.1"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","39","64","0","0"

I'm new-ish to flight sims, have a joystick, TrackIR (actually a custom FreeTrack rig), and I prefer the frantic, tactical combat of dogfights to other aspects of flight simulators like systems management and realistic navigation. For me, Battle of Stalingrad gets it just right.\n\nThe game presents two preset difficulty options, Normal and Expert, and options for customization. In neither of the presets are flight mechanics or damage models compromised for ease. The fidelity of the flight simulation is top notch (maybe shy of some DCS modules, but it's hard for me to say - I certainly don't have any personal experience with WWII airplanes), and the feeling of immersion that this creates is wonderful. Dogfights are intense and breathtaking!\n\nThe game has received some flak from some of the more die-hard flight sim fans (who disparagingly compare the game to War Thunder). They complain (perhaps rightly) that the ease-of-use features kill the simulation, even on Expert difficulty. I share none of these concerns. To me, a beginner, the game focuses on exactly what I like about combat flight simulations: combat flight!\n\nI like that I can choose between short (no takeoffs or landings) and long missions. I appreciate being able to turn icons on and off. I like that I can elect to use complex engine management, or leave that to the AI if I just want to focus on dogfighting. I like auto-level, time compression... all the options that allow a relative beginner like me to play the game as casually or as hardcore as I want to.\n\nI had hoped we'd see an imprevement in the single player by the game's release. Now that it's out, I'm a bit dissapointed by the fairly bland campaign. Oh well. I'll hope for a fix, and in the meantime will play more multiplayer. Regardless, the game is quickly becoming one of my favorite flight sims of all time, up there with Rise of Flight (by the same studio), and IL-2 1946.","October 15, 2014","true","128.1"," 42 of 70 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","42","70","0","1"

If you are new to flight sims then I would spend some time in Warthunder or something similar.  While the game isn't historically accurate, it is still a fun game to play if you can max out the settings and have patience. This game does appeal to the senses if played in a realism/hardcore style of play. While playing online there are a number of things that make this simulator very fun online, having to distinguish friend from foe is no easy task, coordinating formation flights to targets in sometimes more than 10-15 planes at a time, aerial gunnery is actually realistic and challenging. Overall, I would give this game good review and worthy of picking up if you truly want to play this game on a realism setting. If you are looking for something arcady and keyboard/mouse capable then your money may be better spent elsewhre.\n\nPros:\n-Great Graphics\n-Strong Multiplayer\n-Excellent Cockpit detail\n-Sounds are magnificent\n\nCons:\n-Grind unlock system\n-Repetitive Singleplayer campaign\n-Physics are great except for the DLC planes that are clearly given some sort of buff.","February 7, 2015","true","599.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I remember a time when a person could walk into a computer game store (yes, it only sold computer games, not console games), and that's all you would see on the shelves.... Flight Simulators!\n\nIt's sad that now you don't see Flight Sims that much, so I'm very pleased to see that 1C/777 are doing what they can to keep the genre alive.  I played the hell out of the original IL2 games, and still do actually.  I was so excited when I heard that they were coming out with a new IL2.  And I'm just blown away!\n\nThe graphics are top knotch!  The realism, again top knotch!  The fact that I can't lean my head out the window (using TrackIR head tracking) until I open the canopy is freaking cool!  The way the cockpit rattles when you fire up the engine, and the damage models when objects are hit by bullets is unbelievable!\n\nNow there are a few things that I've seen that people are complaining about, such as the inability to use multiple monitors, and the way you have to gain EXP to unlock paint schemes and new guns and so on.  But if you ask me, that's all really minor stuff.  I use one monitor, and with the head tracking using TrackIR I don't see the need for multiple monitors.  And I sort of like the EXP system that it has, gives me something to work for, other than just getting through missions.\n\nI was a little dissapointed in the number of planes you are able to fly, the original IL2 games had freaking tons of planes!  I'm hoping that 1C/777 release new planes, and if this game is as big of a hit as I think it will be, I'm sure they will.  Unfortunatly I'm also sure that each new plane will be through purchasing (looks like they will be priced at around $20 by looking at the two extra planes they have available now).  But personally I don't mind, the company has to make money, and in this day and age, where the younger generation just wants FPS games, paying $20 for a new high quality plane is nothing.  I've spent way more than that on my other flight simulator addons.\n\nSo would I recommend this game?  HELL YEA!\n\nEven if you have never flown a flight simulator before, this is a good way to get started!","October 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","45","76","3","0"

The immersion is absolutely top shelf, from the beautiful sound design to the excellent sense of speed and altidude, this game comes closer than any of its predecessors to creating the sense that you're actually in the cockpit.\n\nGraphically BoS is fantastic, while the maps are currently entirely snow covered, they look excellent.

Without a demo, the only guidance I had on how this would play was something along the lines of, take Rise of Flight as a benchmark. Rise of Flight, though not maxed out, is smooth and fast on my machine, and looks excellent, so with not much hesitation, I took the plunge.\nI didn't mind so much reports of few aircraft and skill points to gain unlocks, nor that there was only one map with one season.  When I ran the sim, though, my greatest disappointment was its performance. On my quad 2 q6600 2.40gh, GTX 750, 6 gig DDR2 ram system I can still get pretty much anything to play well with a bit of tweaking, ROF especially (and even IL2 Cliffs of Dover, which everyone considers somewhat of a dog), but IL2 BOS stands out in that it is the worst of the bunch. I can't get framer rates over 30, and am plagued with micro pauses and stutters.\nNormally, I would just tinker with the graphics options and find some option causing the problem, but here, I don't have that option. The developers have taken the stunning decision to lock the public out of the advanced settings and give you low, balanced, high and ultra. There are a couple of other options - screen resolution, shader amount (4,2,0), muliple grachics cards checkbox, and a cinematics checkbox hidden in the camera menu, but that's it. And, as far as I can tell from the official forum, there are no plans to open up the toolbox. It seems we gamers can't be trusted to mess with things.\nSo, this means I have a sim which runs poorly and looks bland. Not ideal.\nWhat else?\nThe vulnerability of the aircraft is somewhat absurd. I tend to fly the 109 mostly, and fly straight and and level and away from the enemy, and you might just stay in the air. Other than that, it's a case of a couple of passes and usually a wrecked engine from either the enemy or one of many mechanical. I've yet to actually shoot anything down so ludicrous is the damage modelling. If this is accurate, then it flies in the face of every single other sim I've flown (and that's about all of them).\nI have to admit to haveing just bought the FW190. It was on sale and I see it as a hedge hedge against the future where the developers might just open the graphics options and address the fragility issues (these things can happen).\nYou probably know all the other stuff - no evidence of any real battle in the city of Stalingrad, no Bf 110, no Ju 52 (though both seem possibilities - for purchase, of course).\nOh, and my last gripe - the IL2 itself is the single seat without the rear gunner. Damnation. I used to love playing as the rear gunner.\n","December 31, 2014","false","6.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

Not to mention a beautiful soundtrack, amazing graphics, spot-on simulation of just about everything even related to the subject, and at times it can be extremely relaxing.

There is room for improvement, as with all combat/flight sims.\n\nContinuity lacks in the stock single player 'campaign.' It is more akin to a series of individual missions.  The unlocks didn't seem to be too popular, although you can choose to bypass them with the premium version.\n\nIt's definitely not easy, and will take a long time to master even one of the aircraft.  Both the flight models and ground handling characteristics of the aircraft are, for the most part, believeable.  Wind and cloud cover adjustments are available, although cloud height is not.\n\nThe graphics are excellent, and there is a lot of detail and moving parts.  Excellent physics and damage models.\n\nAll manner of antecdotes, rants, suggestions, arguments, and technical theories are discussed in the native BOS forum, with every knit picky, off the wall topic, down to the most finite details you can imagine.

Here is but one example, the Ju-87 Stuka:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYweoO-Ki3Y\n\nMostly, I love this game because of the amount of time I spend wide eyed, white knuckled and puckered, with my heart in my throat.

Also upon reading their website, it seems that the developers want this game to develop alongside their next title: Battle of Moscow.

Really? In a sim?\nCockpits graphics look a bit better than IL2 1946.\nHollywood style smoke and fires. No plane goes down unless it is in a CLOUD of smoke.\nMods will be supported, but iffy on how much you can mod, and how restsrictive it will be.\nPreset graphics options (you cant pick your own graphics settings).\nSound is decent, but far from good.\nTrigger lag when firing guns.\nALWAYS on connection to play the Single Player campaign.\nNot sure if it wants to be a War Thunder Arcade game or a sucessor to IL2 as a sim game.\n\nAlso dont be fooled by all the postive reviews. Some are correct in their opinion, but some are just people from the "Lets get good steam reviews" campaign that was launched from the devs forums.\n\nRight now I cant reccomend this game to a combat flight sim fan. When they decide if they want to go Arcade or Sim, and how the release goes, I might have a different opinion.

This game is 777 Studio's "Rise Of Flight" with WWII planes in a WWII setting. Bland environment, empty battlefields, a very disappointing SP experience and paid unlocks and flyable planes. In fact, "Il-2 BoS" may well be the very antithesis of what made the original Il2 such a great and long-running sim.

However, this doesn't stop them to adding things for BoS, like player controlled tanks, Stalingrad seasonal maps, and new campaign chapters for them (for free!).\nThe FM, and DM are very good, and the community usually has over 100 players spread over a few servers during prime time.\nThe planes all have cockpits for both pilot and gunner that both have controllable lights. In some planes, the gunner will have multiple guns he has to switch to or move from one side of the fuselage to the other.\nThis game uses the same mouse control system as Rise of Flight, so you can check it out for free by downloading that. I would definitely but a joystick though. You can get the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro for under $50 from pretty much anywhere; Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.\n\nThere are also several negative things worth mentioning too. There is a lot of controversity surrounding the Yak-1, and Bf-109 F-4, rendering distance of planes and ground targets are really meh, unlocks for planes are a pain in the butt untill you finish them.\n\nMost servers are in Europe, or the US, so you may not be able to play MP if you are not very close to those regions. All players have the ability to create their own server though, so you could be the one to change that. :)\n\nThe game is pretty solid all together. If you are from a game like WT, there will be a learning curve, but you'll get it with practice.","January 1","true","707.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

There aren't even tooltips to make it easier to read and understand the instruments (which are in German and Russian of course). So you can't just jump in a plane and figure it out by interacting with it, and it doesn't feel so immersive or like it's a real plane. I spent way too much time in the menus binding all the different axes, which seem to be redundant in many cases. Like I tried out a twin-engine bomber and my bindings didn't work as expected even though you're supposed to be able to switch between engines with the number keys. There aren't many planes so I expected the systems simulations to be better. Like in the bf109 I noticed that the radiator control in the cockpit says auto when the HUD says manual and vice versa. Though the cockpits look nice.\n\nThe graphics are impressive at first but when I actually try playing, pretty much all I can see is snow and clouds. My whole screen is white outside. All the maps are winter. It also seems very difficult to taxi in this game. The planes slide all over the place. For this reason I don't even bother with takeoff, which I enjoy in other games.\n\nThe campaign has no flavor text or voiceover or story to it. It is just a theater map from which you pick a location, plane, and generic mission scenario. They all appear on the briefing as a rectangular shape. You fly to a waypoint, then to the "action point" which tells you exactly what will be there and at what elevation. Then you MUST fly to the "exit point" to finish the mission even if it takes you the opposite direction of your landing field. It hardly feels like a military sim or immersive at all like Cliffs of Dover was. And in quick mission you can choose any options or simplifications you want before starting, but in campaign you can only choose "normal" or "expert" for some reason (which turns most help settings on or off). And you must earn XP to progress and unlock new weapons etc.\n\nThe UI is clean but overbearing like a mobile game or something. You can only toggle off the map separately but everything else (map icons, simplified instrument icons, autopilot icons, labels) toggles together. And it's not always clear if you're using an autopilot simplification or real auto controls (like German auto-radiator which they did have). And you start in-air with auto-level turned on (why??) which you must find the keyboard binding for or else jerk your stick sideways to disengage (and destabalize yourself).\n\nOverall a frustrating, oversimplified, mechanical, un-immersive experience. I think even the related (and free) Rise of Flight is more immersive and engaging even though it has WWI planes with ancient instruments. I recommend Cliffs of Dover for an immersive campaign that puts you in a real squadron (and it has clickable cockpits, less hand-holding like auto RPM limiter). And DCS has the best (and most expensive) WW2 plane simulations though it is lacking a good campaign.","August 31, 2015","false","8.4"," 71 of 132 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","71","132","2","1"

The complexity of flying is scalable, so one can just have fun shooting at other airplanes rather than spending hours upon hours learning why a BF-109 hasn't got elevator trim but a FW-190 does. However, if you do like that sort of thing, IL-2's latest iteration includes a sophisticated flight model and systems complexity nearly on par with DCS (I said NEARLY; lay off, DCS fanboys/fangirls). Since you get a whole simulator, campaign mode, and a variety of aircraft for the price of one DCS aircraft, that seems like a good deal to me.\n\nTL;DR: pretty, pedantic, promising, pre-release.

When i was thinking of buying this i thought "its just going to be like IL2 Cliffs Over Dover (Clod for short) but now in russia. MAN I WAS WRONG!!\n\nFor those of you that have played the oringal IL2: 1946 this IL2 is more like that!! The cockpits arnt fully clickable to my knowledge but you forgive that when you only 100m in the air skimming buildings whilst looking at your oponents tail with all the bullet holes in it.\n\nTrying to keep this short if you was to buy anyt WWII fighter game for now this will be it. I would say its unfair to relate it to cliffs over dover as it has all the RAF planes. Battle of Stalingrad has a different style of simulation where i beleive its the Dogfight/ground attack you are simulating rarther than the aircraft itself. Yes, you still manage your egine, flaps, RPM take offs, landings, turning your plane on/off but it will will be pressing  "L" to turn your lights on rather looking for the switch. Also it will tell you in the corner what type of failure you have if you get hit. As ever the failures are realistic as useual and it will be up to you as the pilot to decide wither to turn back and go home or to see if you can survive one last bombrun.\n\nI cant stress enough that this is still a simulator and should be treated as such. But i really think that that hint of arcade message in the corner that says " Egine coolent system Damaged" or "right Airlon Rod Stuck" reminds you that this is also a game and its here to be played rather than to be taken seriously!\n\nBottom line is.

I had this game on my wishlist for a year I think, before I decided to give it a try. It wasnt even on sale, and went on sale a week after I bought it, I was enjoying it so much I didnt even care. This is the reason for my HOTAS right now. The game really puts you there in the planes, the immersion is deep, the learning curve is steep ( and rewarding) and the ground is unflinching when you plummit to your demise. There are so many little things in this game that I like, the noise that your plane makes when its taken a few too many hits, the sense of accomplishment when you finally stick a post misson landing and get that 50% bonus for actually landing in one piece. The OH CRAP feeling when you unsettle your attack approch by shooting rockets off one at a time and upset the glide path of your plane etc etc etc , I really like it I swear I can smell the exhaust when I start up for a mission. I liked it so much I went and bought 1/72 models of my favorite planes to put together ha ha ha ha . Oh and the multiplayer is pretty cool too, although not a huge number of people I have been able to join at least one server anytime to find other players to annoy with my noob_ness. A cool touch also for the multiplayer is being able to crew a gun station on a friends plane and vise-versa. If you like a no-bs sim style combat game this may be for you.\nThe only negatives that I have for this game is that it is centered around a specific time and place, and that means a limited assortment of aircraft to fly. I understood this going in ( its all in the name after all) but I would love to see the scope of this game expanded. I dont hold this against the game, but I could see how some may have no interest in the specific planes on offer, so make sure you know what is included before making a decision. the second negative is the somewhat low number of players in multiplayer, there are enough to get into a game generally during most times, the servers arent exactly bursting full. ( the unfortunate side effect being you will play with alot of the same people) this I hope will improve over time.\nthats all i have to say . One of the esiest thumbs up I have given yet.","December 4, 2015","true","37.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

And that's not a bad thing!\n\nBoS hits the same "accessible realism" point that something like War Thunder (mainly sim mode, but "normal" settings in BoS include markers and automatic engine management) hits. Neither are the rivet-counting, absolute to the metal fidelity that something like DCS strives to be (I play a lot of DCS too, by the by), but both War Thunder (outside of arcade battles) and BoS are VERY far from the more arcadey, easy to learn experience that an air combat game like Crimson Skies might be. BoS even has an experimental mouse-aim mode for potential aviators who don't have joysticks, though from what I understand the implementation is very rough around the edges at the moment.\n\nThe main differences in BoS and War Thunder are why I much prefer the former to the latter. War Thunder's primary problems are the free-to-play grind that you have to expect from... well, a free-to-play game (BoS has a progression system that is a tooooouch grindy, as well, but none of the unlocks are really game changing and you can grind them out in singleplayer if you want), and the very questionable flight models and balancing that everyone just sort of accepts as standard from the game now. In BoS, you won't be clubbed by a fighter that's severely over-performing, and you won't be crippled for flying an aircraft you enjoy because it under-performs or finds itself facing unreasonably stiff opposition. Honestly, in BoS, most of the (fighter) aircraft are pretty evenly matched- even the premiums (I fear the 109 pilot over the 190). I've even had semi-successful engagements flying a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed IL-2 up against fighters, because at the end of the day a skilled pilot (which I am not- hence the SEMI-successful nature of those engagements) will win no matter his aircraft... and the IL-2 has much better low speed performance than any fighter in the game so dragging ♥♥♥♥-sure Bubi-wannabes into low-speed duels is a very good way to embarass the Luftwaffe.\n\nAll these comparisons to War Thunder aside- you will need a joystick to fully enjoy IL-2: BoS. Preferably one with a rudder axis (Rudder is SUPER IMPORTANT on these old prop aircraft for managing sideslip) and a throttle flapper. You can find a stick like that for like $15-$20, usually. Also, some form of headtracking makes dogfighting, especially on full-realism servers without markets, MUCH easier (maintaining situational awareness is a big part of being a successful combat pilot)- you can build a headtracker with rudimentary knowledge of how to solder and about $30 in materials, or if you have an android smartphone I hear that there are ways to use that, strapped to a headset or something, to get 3-DOF (as in, you won't be able to lean around in the cockpit, but you can look left and right and up and down) headtracking that works decently well. If you're not able or willing to do any of those, you can map your view controls to a hat on your joystick or something, and that should be serviceable.\n\nSo yeah- If you enjoyed War Thunder when it wasn't harassing you with awful game design and sketchy as frig flight models, and you're okay with a more limited roster of flyable aircraft, AND you're okay with flying with a joystick (until the devs polish mouse aim), pick this game up. It's enormous fun, even flying ground attack or a bomber like the Peshka or the Heinkel (though I do wish you could get magnetic bearing to target in those aircraft, flying bombing approaches on smaller targets without it is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥), and you'll end every fight with a dumb grin even if its you who ended up a fiery ball of dead airplane on the ground. And if you're more a study-sim guy (like I am, honestly), don't gloss over BoS as just-another-WWII-plane-game, it's plenty realistic enough that really only noncombat systems are streamlined (and radios, but we all know you fly with easy communication on in DCS, anyway).","January 9","true","14.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I've been playing flight sims for the past 20 years and this games nails the sensation of flight better than any other. Multiplayer is a blast and it takes less than 30 seconds from the time you launch the game to the time you are flying on a server. It is also deep but accessible. You can play on Normal servers with radar, tagging of planes, a HUD, and autopilot or you can play on Expert servers with none of these assists.\n\nSo why all the bad reviews? Here is a summary of the most common:\n\n"I can't get it to work!" Read the install instructions and register online. You only have to do it once and it is the least invasive DRM on Steam.\n\n"DLC and unlocks have no place in an unfinished flight sim." I can't disagree, especially since the German FW190 is only available as DLC. This was the second most iconic German fighter of the war and should have been made available to all from the start. The Russian La-5 was seldom flown so that is understandable as DLC but the German offering should have been one of the two variations of the 109 Messerschmitt already in the game.\n\nEven if you do not take part in the DLC or unlocks, IL-2 BOS has the most enjoyable online dogfights out there and is a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in a combat flight sim.","January 24, 2015","true","103.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For one: this makes sure that every single part of the game is finished in a state that actually can be called finished. Flight sims are prone for bugs and flight models that are simply a bit off. Thats why they need time to "grow the beard". By splitting the project in peaces the game gets time to do that. (Think of what happened to Cliffs of Dover: Big game, took to long and cost to much money to finish and was rushed to the marked in a horrible state.)\n\nFor now the patches of "Battle of Moscow" with its planes are allready integrated in "Battle of Stalingrad" even if you haven't purchased BoM. The only difference is, that you will not be able to fly its planes  untill you buy BoM. Still you will come across BoM's planes in singleplayer and multiplayers as allies and opponents.\n\n\n\nAll in all I think Battle of Stalingrad is a fun flight sim with a promising future.\n(Fun enough to be a reason for me to replace my stoneage CPU)","November 28, 2015","true","83.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

As soon as the update came out where graphics settings could be tweaked, I finally found myself seeing other people before I was dead so I must admit, this helped a lot towards actually making the game fun.\n\nSince this is supposed to be a sim, I'll do my best to list what I feel like the positives and negatives are and what their bearing is on reality.\n\nOn the plus side, the game is beautiful.  Undeniably, things look great.  This goes a long way to making you feel immersed.  Spotting is great as well.  Depending on where the sun is, the angle of the aircraft and their distance from you, things might get tricky when trying to keep an eye on your prey, pursuer or even your wingman for that matter.  Surface level winds are good as well.  They can cause some serious issues on takeoff and landing if you're not prepared.  Things sound good as well, although I know certain sounds have undergone an overhaul of late, listening to your aircraft can give some important indications as to its behaviour if you choose to turn the HUD off like I do.  Multiplayer is very good.  Don't expect to waltz in and dust everyone because the fact is...you won't.  That being said, for the experienced, I do feel like a clean bounce is still a very viable option.  I've found the level of experience on some games really takes away that aspect of combat, as everyone is competent and adept at clearing their six regularly.  Also, just yesterday, the summer and autumn maps came out so you don't have to look outside at a barren, white wasteland all the time anymore, which is a relief.\n\nOn the downside, there are still some very arcade-y elements to this game, most notably, and to the chagrin of myself and several of my friends, the start-up procedure....is entirely automated.  Press one button and engine start tasks are all performed by the computer.  The irony of it all and the infuriating part is that it still sometimes fails to start!  Whereby, the computer then shuts everything down while you wait 20 more seconds, only to press a single button again, and watch it repeat the process as you silently (or not) curse the game.  I've also seen some things that are...questionable to say the least.  I do fly the 109 almost exclusively and its acceleration and energy retention is second to none (in terms of the plane set in the game) but time after time, I've seen Yaks pull maneuvers that should rob them of all their energy and somehow come out without losing anything.  I've even seen a Yak catch a 190 going balls out on the deck, having started from equal altitude.  I know this may not mean anything to some, and it's impossible to speculate on all the variables like fuel state and loadout but let it be said that more than a few times I've cocked my head to the side and wondered "how?"  There is also the matter of single player and the unlock system.  The single worst idea the developers had and something the community has complained about since day one.  However, they still felt that implementing it into this game and the upcoming Battle of Moscow was a good plan.  I know there are some that like to play single player and for them, this won't matter.  But frankly, multiplayer is the heart of this game and to have to drag your ♥♥♥ through a bunch of boring single player missions just to unlock a paint scheme or two is not appealing in the slightest.  Lastly, and this isn't so much a negative as it is something I can't argue one way or the other; there doesn't seem to be much feeling in the controls.  Mind you, I don't have a force feedback stick but the aircraft does sometimes want to react very violently in circumstances where it shouldn't.  Personally, I needed to spend some serious time with my control settings to try and smooth things out to the point where I wasn't fighting it anymore.\n\nAll in all, this is a game worth checking out if you love flying.  If you want a perfect game, keep looking because you will never find it.  If you find yourself getting frustrated, keep at it because I felt the same way about it at first.  Real pilots and anyone who has even a few hours under their belt will find issue with parts of this game beyond a doubt, but the advantage here is that you get to shoot someone else down!","June 11, 2015","true","191.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","19"

Being an actual pilot myself I can personally endorse the game's flight model in accuracy and feel. The airplanes all feel great with realistic properties of weight to power and engine management. At first I was skeptical that their were so few planes and that new ones are $19.99, but so much effort goes into them and they're all so characteristic that I didn't find this to be nearly as big as problem as I thought would be.\n\nThe much maligned unlock system is in my opionion one of the best features of the game. Giving the sim and campaign a structure previously unheard of these games. Their is a reason to push and work for rewards in the game and the way it's handled is tasteful and contextual to the conflict rather than childish as some people are claiming.\n\nA strong return to form for the IL-2 series and simultaneously a smashing sequel to the amazing Rise of Flight. I strongly recommend this sim to those with an open mind an interest in seeing the genre taken in a new direction.

I was really worried when purchasing this but Im really glad I did. I played Il2 Cliffs of Dover casually as the game was a bit of a strain for me (the cockpits were so well detailed it actually hurt my eyes, framerate was generally not great, UI was awful) even so I expected a great deal of detail and polish in Il2 Battle of Stalingrad and it definitely has it.\n\nIn my opinion one of the most important parts of an immersive simulator are the sound effects and this game has it spot on, the engines and various other effects sound great and authentic. The graphics are quite good as well (especially the aircraft). The game itself plays very well with  aircraft responding realistically to stalling and rough maneuvering. The game while not great as far as optimization goes still runs better than Cliffs of Dover and even when low in framrate still runs strangely smooth. The damage models are very detailed with basically any part of the aircraft being able to come off (I must've spent 3 hours plowing aircraft into the ground watching the wings flex and break). The UI is well designed and a staggering improvement from the one seen in Cliffs of Dover.\n\nBut there are also a few low point in the game like the lack of clickable cockpits. One of my favorite point of Cliffs of Dover was having the completely manual control of aircraft and while Battle of Stalingrad does support it with keyboard binding available I much rather have the option of clickable cockpits. The game can also get repedetive as far as the campaign goes with you generally having the same objectives dependent on which mission type you select. But even with that in consideration I still come back to Il2 daily.\n\nI got Il2 BoS for $30 over a sale and at that price its a good deal, but at $50 im not sure I can recommend it. So wait for a sale and definitely pick it up if you have even a moderate fondness for aircraft simulators (like I do).","November 2, 2015","true","54.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

There's a lack of graphic options but this subject has been discussed to entirety on the forums; head there to take notes. The way it's done is adequate to multiplayer.\n\nPerformance: I had flawless performance on my previous CPU, a dual core intel E7500. Upgraded to a i5 and it's marvelous.\n\ni5 4590 + gtx670 2gb + 8gb RAM on max settings.\n\nMultiplayer is being the most demanded feature now on games, fair enough. Battle of Stalingrad had a underwhelming release. It was far from broken, or bad release, but the features in it were not quite there.\nNow, BoS still counts with a very active community and passionate about the genre. Steady activities of Wings of Liberty (hardcore full sim with navigation assistance) servers and the normal difficulty ones (not my thing).\n\nOverall, multiplayer is amazing. New missions come and go on the servers and generally the players care about the objectives. If bored on those kind of missions and want more elaborated ones, you can take yourself to the mission editor on the game root file, make one and send to the server's hosts, exchange ideas, participate on the community.\n\nSingle player is fun, not quite the thing I expected coming from RoF but is playable and offers immersion. Differently from the release, single player missions have more AI activity, is common to encounter other fights in the path of your objective or when returning to base.\n\nPhysics: The best on the market. The damage model is unsurpassed since RoF. 777 studios really put love into this.\n\nCombat: as physics, probably the also best in the market. You can rip wings off from your oponent with a flow of structural damage unique. Belly landing with precision of forces. Cartridges explosion with HE cannon shells on the wings. Engine damage and fire damage adequately modeled. Tons of parts to rip off from the plane you'll feel that every shot down is unique in a certain way. Some adjustments are made into the flight model here and there, but certainly it got better since release and expect to be even more refined as more people get into the sim.\n\nSimulation vs arcade: It's a simulator.... but DCS has clickable cockpits....... yes, it still a simulator. Philosophies differs from other flight sims and combat sims. 777 studios kept a rather controversy philosophy in relation to pilot/player workload, but the rest are there, planes feel alive, fuel consumption, temperatures, real engine values from real life, it's all there.\nIt's THE most lively experience of flying I've ever encountered in a desktop simulator. DCS comparison can be drawn with discussing it's differences. I freaking love DCS world (non steam standalone) and have a ton of hours in it, but both these sims have disadvantages and advantages in distinct areas. Both are amazing.\n\nNew expansions are coming, new planes and updates to single player and world.\n\nA new summer map for BoS is in the merge of releasing with a ton other fixes and improvements.\n\nBefore stopping my BoS gameplay in late 2014 - early 2015 I gave it a 6/10 for the actual features and state of it at the time. Now I can give a 7.5 with very solid hopes to surpass 9 points with great future expansions and features.\n\nSomewhat, it's a good time to be a flight simmer.","September 9, 2015","true","185.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I didn't have much of a clue what I was doing but there wasn't time to ask, German tanks could be here at any moment. Getting in the air with my wingman we quickly turned east, flying fast and staying low to avoid enemy attention. Verkhnaya Akhtuba appeared off in the dustbowl in the distance, at the same time as a pair of BF109s, to my 3 o'clock high. My wingman peeled away but I made for the airfield, overshooting... my inexperience showing as one of the BF109s shadowed me.\n\nStill worring about the lack of fuel I didn't want to engage, I swung round for another attempt, hoping the 109 was still to high avoiding the flak to have a go at me, but the veteran Luftwaffe pilot was braver than me. On my final approach, my speed and altitude dropping fast now my flaps and land gear were down he struck, metres from the end of the runway. Canopy smashed, bullet and shell holes riddling the hull and worse the engine spraying oil across the remains of the glass  as I decended I couldn't see a thing.\n\nMy arrival at Verkhnaya Akhtuba was abrupt, I hit the end of the sandy runway and skidded sideways, stopping in very short order. I'd survived, the mission was, technically a success. I walked away and brought the bulk of the Yak's airframe to my new home with me.\n\n************\n\nEach one of my 7 sorties so far has created a memorable moment, my first crash landing, my first aerial kill, my first (near) perfect landing, my defence of the evacuation ships for the civilians of Stalingrad and today my all important fifth aerial victory. I have been enjoying this game immensely, the sense of permanent progression is far greater in this iteration than in previous IL-2s. The theatre of operations is fascinating and beautiful, seeing the smoke rising over Stalingrad from my home airfield each time I take off really sets the scene. The inclusion of large numbers of air and ground forces also adds to the sense that a lot is going on all around me. I can't wait to advance further into the campaign and for General Winter to begin biting.\n\nMy only niggle at this point is the inability to contact ground control, as an inexperienced pilot landing feels like a bit of a free for all when myself and my AI wingman land, it would also be nice to get verbal feedback from my wingmen when I issue orders or when they've spotted something.\n\nAll in all I do like this game, I've been playing with my mouse which is okay on Normal difficulty but I can't imagine trying Realistic flight with it. I would recommend IL-2: BOS to new and casual players, it is easy to get into with a little knowledge and the difficulty is very scalable as you get experienced. I know I like it because I just spent a £100 on a HOTAS joystick setup.","December 27, 2015","true","97.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

If you get this game and the DLC planes which i recommend , but when the prices drops or on a sell like i did , you sould find a nice, fairly priced joystick to play the game because the planes are hard to handle and fly with WSAD or The arrows and with these keyboard controlls , when playing it was way easier to stall and crash the planes. So far there are a nice amount of planes with two versions of the Messerschmit BF 109 , which is nice , but this amount of planes in nothing compaired to the ammount of planes in Il-2 Sturmovic 1946 Which had  different versions from the years of the war of all the planes in Il-2 Sturmovic Battle of Stalingrade.

If you are new to the genre, you can activate a lot of little helpers that will make sure that you're able to slowly grow into serious combat flight simulations. The immersion during dogfights is intense! The level of detail the developers put into this simulation is incredible. You have to remember that it's a rather small team, so things need their time. Many rather mixed reviews were posted in the past. Especially when the game was just released last year. But a lot has changed in the last months and great updates are announced for the next months, including new summer and autumn maps of the Stalingrad area and so on. Battle of Stalingrad is still growing. The strong community around it is another plus. Just look at what enthusiasts achieved for the original Il2 series and later the people of Team Fusion for Il2 Cliffs of Dover! Il2 Battle of Stalingrad is worth every cent!","June 29, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Beware that you really need a joystick in order to get enjoyment out of the game.\n\nSim gaming is a incredibly niche market and thus there arn't that many good games out there. IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad is a good product, so I think the developers deserve a bit of love.\n\nThe devs just released summer and autumn maps to go along with the winter map. They also extended the single player campaign with an extra part for free, which is awesome.\n\nAs a very average pilot I'm having a lot of fun flying and learning the planes online and singleplayer.\n\nCons: It uses DirectX9 which makes the performance of the game less than it would be with DirectX11.","October 28, 2015","true","51.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The single player campaign is not too amazing as it is basically just five possible mission types with no ability to create a pilot/career in the traditional sense. However, the campaign can still be fun and I find it quite relaxing. Multiplayer is also enjoyable. Although as an American I tend to have to fly on Saturday and Sunday mornings to get enough people, as there are not many people playing in the evening in the US/central time zone. However the European time zone seems to get plenty of players.\n\nOverall, it is fun to tool around in the WW2 planes with a realistic flight model in a nice looking environnent.

It can be a very challenging experience to figure out the expert difficulty, but as long as enough time is spent testing the capabilities of the controls and the plane itself, anyone can play this game (within reason).\n\n*EDIT - 14/09/15\nI have encountered problems that others should be aware of when buying this game.

While not totally useless they crash way too much and have trouble keeping up.\n\nNon clickable cockpits.\n\nWeather effects are kind of bland and the constant winter environment gets old.\n\nIn summary  IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad is not my all time favorite but it us good enough to recommend to others who enjoy accurate flight simulations like myself.","July 21, 2015","true","73.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game for what you pay could be a hell of a lot better.\nI know free to play games with the same mechanics. I should take a step over to the creator of Heroes and Generals, and tell him that his unlock scheme was totally ♥♥♥♥♥ from him.\n\nPros:\nNone - For a developer who's been in the sim business for a long long time, this is by far their worst release. They have severly "dumbed" it down for the average gamer. Too bad we already have one of those, and it's called War Thunder.\n\nCons:\nMany\n-No Native Oculus Rift support (When the game was demo'd with the DK1 earlier this year)\n-Pitiful Flight Models. The actual flight characteristics in the air are decent, but on the ground are rubbish.\n-No Manual mode for engine control and startup.\n-Unlocks are only obtained in single player grinding, which is HORRIFIC at best. I would be ok with unlocks like this if they were only skins or ways to mark your plane, but instead they're also for weapons, bombs, machine guns, armor, etc. This makes the game unbalanced for the people who don't have hours upon hours of time to spend in Single Player unlocking basic things.\n-Game requires you log in at the start of each session even for single player, no internet = no play\n-Servers are shaky at best, you can barely stay connected for more than one round, and the rounds are only 20-40 minutes long which means it's only for those people who want "quick" action, and not mission based online play.\n-Impossible to win in "Full Realism" without trackIR or some form of head tracking (be warned)\n\nIn final, this is not a sim. This is an arcade version of IL2 with some niceities added in for hardcore people. If you're an avid flyer DO NOT BUY. Stick to IL2 1946 or IL2 CLOD, the community is better, there's content still being produced for those by private parties. I wont deny that the game is fun, but for the price you pay it's not worth it's retail tag. This should have been released as a Free 2 Play with an item mall. Instead they charge you $XX and then give you the bare items to play, with the same UNREASONABLE expectations for grinding out unlocks. At least with Heroes and Generals I could goto the item mall instead of wasting my time in the stupid monontenous campaign to get an item that I actually need to use the plane in the first place.\n\nDO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY.\nI would have not bought this if it wasn't on the steam sale, and even those prices are too high.\nFor the standard it should be $20, and the Deluxe it should be $25.\nThat's all this game is worth. Don't buy this for $100... You'll wish you hadn't.","December 29, 2014","false","9.3"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

With Battle over Moscow or BoM about to be released as a seperate but mergable product the entire project appears to be a very greedy money grab, How can anyone recommend a project hardly anyone is flying. You are confind to a single snow cover map. The single player campaign is a joke... You take off kill an onjective and land. There is no sense of immersion at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreisGreat/recommended/307960/","SpectreisGreat","Spectre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreisGreat/","104 products in account","Let me start this off by saying the game is technically finished, but still is adding and completing the game.\n\nAfter signing up on IL2's website, and starting up the game I was immediately hit with a few tiny problems.  One was that I have to reset the game for fullscreen to take affect, and then have to restart it again after the screen resolution was really wack.  Once that was sorted I jumped into a quick mission and was thrown into the good ol' fashioned IL2 experience that veterans love and newbies will be able to grasp like their own genitalia.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice menu wise is that they're very sleek, and easy to use.  Unlike their usual menu's that are rather strange, buggy or just plain dull, this one is a very nice change of pace.  The options are clear, the writing is slick and the essential options are big and easy to see, aswell as functional unlike the previous installment (Cliffs of Dover) where loadouts wouldnt even be selectable for some strange and unknown reason, the game has a lock beside all the modifications letting you know theyre unlockables, and not just given to you.\n\nGameplay wise the game has a ton of options, allowing for an easy 'Normal' or 'Expert' difficulties to be picked making it easy to start the game up for a quick match for those who just want to play, or just to differentiate where begginers and veterans should be starting off at.  Most noteably out of all the gameplay options is the campaign, this is (to my knowledge) the only real flight sim that starts players off with a quick, helpful tutorial that shows players how to work the campaign mission selector and standardized mission plans.  The campaign has a lot of unique features such as stats that can be viewed from the web, and a 'Full Mission' or 'Quick Mission' options that let players choose if they want to start in the air ready to go, or have to take off and land.  Combat is as standard as simulators come, detailed models, realistic flight mechanics, bullet drop, all the basic stuff.   The only complaints I have is that they removed click cockpit and gave us only four planes per faction (five if you wanna dish out some extra coin) that dont offer us the same depth that the planes in Cliffs of Dover did,\n\nVisually the game is stunning, beautiful vast open landscapes that are nicely brought to life.  The game really captures the battle as it was fought in the air, and on the ground.  All flight sims are visually stunning in the air, focusing on cloud effects and sun effects ETC....  But Battle of Stalingrad makes an attempt to make you have a bit more of a reason to look down other than trying to bomb the crap out of the place, adding some unique smoke effects that billow out from the town which drew my attention during my long stretches back to base and actually impressed me.  However, the onlu problem I have with the graphics is that there is no way to make custom graphics settings, its just four options; Ultra, High, Balanced, and Low.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth a buy if you're a veteran of flight sims looking for a new one to add to your library.  I do also recommend that if people are looking at getting into flight sims this is one game that can be easy to start off with, I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND that if you're getting this as your first flight sim that you buy a joystick, or you'll be key mapping for hours.  For veterans I also recommend a Track IR system, it makes the game way more immersive and gives you a tactical edge when in multiplayer.\n\nFrankly, the people who dislike this game are people who have played War Thunder and bought this on impulse.  The usual complaints are that the game is not user friendly or that it has not enough playability or plane diversity.  I agree that the dev's made a stupid decision to make DLC planes that are as famous as the FW190 and LA5 so expensive and DLC at all, but the planes we are given all have unique play styles and need lots of practice to even come close to mastering them, and the game is meant to be grueling and difficult as its supposed to be simulating.  The planes we have are all very nice and fun to use and although there arent as many as we would probably like, its a quality over quantity type deal.\n","December 26, 2014","true","42.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

There is reason to celebrate this. But history is cold to dreams, and indifferent to sentimentality. History knows that Western Civilization pivoted in the slushy depths of the Volga in 1942. And we all inhabit the world carved out by these inglorious warriors, their blood; long forgotten.\n\n1c didn’t forget. And they’ve teamed up with 777 studios to remind another generation of simjocks what the frozen brutality of the Eastern Front was all about.\n\nThe A Team\nCombining the forces behind “IL-2 Sturmovik” with “Rise of Flight” is a dream-come-true and a tough legacy to live up to. Expectations could not be higher.\n\nWhat’s Perfect\nThe aircraft are expertly modeled and flying them is a pure joy. Individual aircraft showcase historic behaviors.  The atmosphere ignores, aids, or intrudes as it will. Complex flight dynamics will please veterans and challenge newcomers. Battle of Stalingrad may be considered that rarest of things: A Combat Flight Simulator.\n\nWhat’s Good\nThe aircraft are meticulously detailed. Remaining more simplistic than “study sims”, BoS showcases enough detail to set it apart from rival ‘combat’ simulations. In-flight engine systems are modeled, yet may be simplified by the player. Engine components and flight surfaces succumb to stress and mismanagement. Everything is dependent on individual aircraft and realism settings.\n\nWhat’s Bad\nWhile beautifully modeled, the plane set is anemic. And there are no (at this time) AI only planes to flesh out the missions. The settings in general have little variety and shoehorn graphics and realism settings together. Single player jocks seem especially misconsidered.\nThe multi-player, depending on geography, may find few populated servers.\nThere are also “unlockable” skins, load outs, and field modifications. While not much of a practical hindrance, this mentality is a poor portent.\n\nWhat’s Ugly\nWhile the “early access” model is new to most gamers, flight jocks are well familiar with games that sell copies with promises of things to come. Battle of Stalingrad well takes advantage of a hard-core base by releasing a game that’s clearly not finished.\n\nWe all drool at the prospect of Theatres of war to come. And I applaud studios that leave this door open. However, there are plenty of areas where this game lacks basic features. For example, there is no manual. For a game as complex, with a learning curve so steep, this is an obscene omission.\n\nConclusion:\nBattle of Stalingrad is a gorgeous combat flight simulator with no qualifier. Its pedigree is suburb, even if its execution is flawed. While the game it may become is unclear, the game it is, remains excellent and should be had by every serious simjock.\nFor the new-comer I would recommend only if you’ve a passion for combat simulation. Your orientation will be graciously met by the community, not by the developers, Only passion and hard work will see you through the steep learning curve to frozen glory.","December 27, 2014","true","24.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

THE FW 190 FEELS GOOD, DONT COMPLAIN THAT THE GERMANS FROM THE OLD VIDEOS COULD TAXI IT LIKE PROS, BECAUSE THAT GUYS WERE ACES, AND YOU'RE JUST A WANNABE WW2 FIGHTER/BOMBER/INTERCEPTOR.\nDONT GO COMPLAINING WHY THE E7 CANT GO FASTER. THE EMIL IS OLD.\nSTOP SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE ENGINE, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ROF, YOU LITERALLY HEARD ANOTHER PERSON SAYING THAT, AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING IT FOR YOURSELF. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I PLAY A LOT OF ROF. A, L.O.T.\nThere's somethings i need to say now.\n\nAbout 1946.\nGot invited by a national wannabe german squad. Literally they made me download 1946 to play with them.  After nearly 2 hours of download and 30 minutes of UPDATES, i joined the server. Shoot down an enemy blenheim, they where playing BOB. The plane literally defeated all phyisics of know and unknow universes. It was flipling so fast i though it would turn into a hurricane (NOT THE PLANE, THE NATURE HURRICANE, THAT IS HATED BY EVERYONE) I couldn't hear my guns, MAYBE that was something with my settings, although i changed the settings more times that your atoms are destroyed in a dimensional hole ( Catch the reference?), and that didn't changed at all. I was using the HSFX and all other mods the guys wanted to have. My opinion... CRAP.\nAbout DCS.\nIt's a good game, need more WW2 content.  Need servers that are not actually only dogfights. The community need to stop with the "Ahh, i am a 60 years old, and now I WILL SIMULATE the TF-51, because i want to feel how a real pilot feel" TRIGGER WARNING( Flying a BAD plane (MY OPINION) that cant even shoot, and you feel good about it? For real? They even complay "WHY THE K4 CAN DESTROY THE 51 WITH ONE SHOT, AND THE 51 TAKES 1 MILLION SHOTS TO KILL THE K4" because they want the p51 to be the savior of humanity.\nABOUT WAR THUNDER.\nAlright. Their dora d13 cant go faster than 500 km per hour in a straight line.\nGAMEPLAY PERSPECTIVE\nIt's playable, if you dont care 1930 - late 1930 or even 1940 fighting against 1941-1942 planes. I say it's quite a challange.\n"SIMULATION BATTLE"\nPlayers fly at 500 meters below. You cant spot TRACERS/DOTS/WHATEVER if it is 1.5 km away from you. TESTED IT.\n"REALISTIC" <- HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nPlayers can spot you from 3+ km. The player base dont understand how a plane work. Half of your team dive in a single dot, because they made the XP function that makes everyone greedy.  Bombers suicide everytime, instead of flying in formation or letting the fighters "clean" the area first.\nPeople also prefer to go for bots or ground targets, because it's simply easier to get the cash, and experience from it.\nI miss the times where the battles where in high altitudes. THIS MEANS 5-6 K ABOVE. Last time i played, which was this week actually, my whole team of late war planes, climbed to 4k with their doras, died, and reported me for be at 7K.\nARCADE.\nI dont even...\n\n\n\nRESUME:\nBoS, is a great game. We need more mission makers. I know WEB languages, and i'l try to make some COOP missions. IF it is something like arma editor,SHOULD BE easier to me. I am kinda bored about the servers we have, because it's basically 2/3 of your team picking stukas/il2, going to the targets, suicide/crash land/land on enemy territory/Badlands landing. The fighters try to do their work, but when they go help the bomber who is being engaged by the 1/3 of the enemy team, he dies. That's basically the most populated online server. There is a GOOD COOP mission there, Shotout to my buddy The Elf, and TWB for their server. SHAME IT'S NOT POPULATED. Also, the DEVS, basically told us, that WE AS A COMMUNITY SHOULD MAKE THE MISSIONS. IT IS ON THEIR DEVBLOG. You can even check it on steam. You guys are asking for new planes? IF YOU CHECK THE DEVBLOG, YOU'L KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE A 3D ARTIST, Maybe you can achieve something of your own with them. Who knows? Shame i am a 2d artist, cant do many things here, but i am going to study 3d and see what i can do.\nWhat i really think is, YOU GUYS ARE ASKING TOO MUCH FOR THE DEVS, AND THEY ARE GETTING OVERLOADED. GIVE THE GUYS A BRAKE, HAVE YOU SEEN THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THEY PUT ON THE GAME?\nDO YOU EVEN KNOW WHY YOU CANT SEE A DOT AFTER 10 KM? It's basically physics. Shotout to ApeOfheYear, check his spotting videos and he'l explain to you. =)\nBy the way, check their co-partner game, RoF, it's on steam and it's free, you probably will like it if you like dogfights, without those un-cool rockets.\nAND YES, THEY WILL, IF THE GAME GET FUNDED, ADD THE WHOLE WAR.\nFlyingSoap/ AKA former 19te.Soap\nI learned the game through pratice, there's no other way to get into it.\nHOPE TO SEE YOU IN THE SKIES, AS A BATTLE BUDDY, OR AS A HONORABLE FOE.\n","October 28, 2015","true","281.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

THE EMIL IS OLD.\nSTOP SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE ENGINE, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ROF, YOU LITERALLY HEARD ANOTHER PERSON SAYING THAT, AND NOW YOU'RE SAYING IT FOR YOURSELF. I SAY THAT BECAUSE I PLAY A LOT OF ROF. A, L.O.T.\nThere's somethings i need to say now.\n\nAbout 1946.\nGot invited by a national wannabe german squad. Literally they made me download 1946 to play with them.  After nearly 2 hours of download and 30 minutes of UPDATES, i joined the server. Shoot down an enemy blenheim, they where playing BOB. The plane literally defeated all phyisics of know and unknow universes. It was flipling so fast i though it would turn into a hurricane (NOT THE PLANE, THE NATURE HURRICANE, THAT IS HATED BY EVERYONE) I couldn't hear my guns, MAYBE that was something with my settings, although i changed the settings more times that your atoms are destroyed in a dimensional hole ( Catch the reference?), and that didn't changed at all. I was using the HSFX and all other mods the guys wanted to have. My opinion... CRAP.\nAbout DCS.\nIt's a good game, need more WW2 content.  Need servers that are not actually only dogfights. The community need to stop with the "Ahh, i am a 60 years old, and now I WILL SIMULATE the TF-51, because i want to feel how a real pilot feel" TRIGGER WARNING( Flying a BAD plane (MY OPINION) that cant even shoot, and you feel good about it? For real? They even complay "WHY THE K4 CAN DESTROY THE 51 WITH ONE SHOT, AND THE 51 TAKES 1 MILLION SHOTS TO KILL THE K4" because they want the p51 to be the savior of humanity.\nABOUT WAR THUNDER.\nAlright. Their dora d13 cant go faster than 500 km per hour in a straight line.\nGAMEPLAY PERSPECTIVE\nIt's playable, if you dont care 1930 - late 1930 or even 1940 fighting against 1941-1942 planes. I say it's quite a challange.\n"SIMULATION BATTLE"\nPlayers fly at 500 meters below. You cant spot TRACERS/DOTS/WHATEVER if it is 1.5 km away from you. TESTED IT.\n"REALISTIC" <- HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nPlayers can spot you from 3+ km. The player base dont understand how a plane work. Half of your team dive in a single dot, because they made the XP function that makes everyone greedy.  Bombers suicide everytime, instead of flying in formation or letting the fighters "clean" the area first.\nPeople also prefer to go for bots or ground targets, because it's simply easier to get the cash, and experience from it.\nI miss the times where the battles where in high altitudes. THIS MEANS 5-6 K ABOVE. Last time i played, which was this week actually, my whole team of late war planes, climbed to 4k with their doras, died, and reported me for be at 7K.\nARCADE.\nI dont even...\n\n\n\nRESUME:\nBoS, is a great game. We need more mission makers. I know WEB languages, and i'l try to make some COOP missions. IF it is something like arma editor,SHOULD BE easier to me. I am kinda bored about the servers we have, because it's basically 2/3 of your team picking stukas/il2, going to the targets, suicide/crash land/land on enemy territory/Badlands landing. The fighters try to do their work, but when they go help the bomber who is being engaged by the 1/3 of the enemy team, he dies. That's basically the most populated online server. There is a GOOD COOP mission there, Shotout to my buddy The Elf, and TWB for their server. SHAME IT'S NOT POPULATED. Also, the DEVS, basically told us, that WE AS A COMMUNITY SHOULD MAKE THE MISSIONS. IT IS ON THEIR DEVBLOG. You can even check it on steam. You guys are asking for new planes? IF YOU CHECK THE DEVBLOG, YOU'L KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE A 3D ARTIST, Maybe you can achieve something of your own with them. Who knows? Shame i am a 2d artist, cant do many things here, but i am going to study 3d and see what i can do.\nWhat i really think is, YOU GUYS ARE ASKING TOO MUCH FOR THE DEVS, AND THEY ARE GETTING OVERLOADED. GIVE THE GUYS A BRAKE, HAVE YOU SEEN THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL THEY PUT ON THE GAME?\nDO YOU EVEN KNOW WHY YOU CANT SEE A DOT AFTER 10 KM? It's basically physics. Shotout to ApeOfheYear, check his spotting videos and he'l explain to you. =)\nBy the way, check their co-partner game, RoF, it's on steam and it's free, you probably will like it if you like dogfights, without those un-cool rockets.\nAND YES, THEY WILL, IF THE GAME GET FUNDED, ADD THE WHOLE WAR.\nFlyingSoap/ AKA former 19te.Soap\nI learned the game through pratice, there's no other way to get into it.\nHOPE TO SEE YOU IN THE SKIES, AS A BATTLE BUDDY, OR AS A HONORABLE FOE.\n","October 28, 2015","true","281.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Just picked this up this week and so far, I'm still impressed. I don't fall head-over-heels in love with games, but 777 studios and 1C studios has never been a let down!\n\nOne thing these games have taught me - I absolutely SUCK and combat sims. I will admit though, sucking at flying the planes in this series has never felt so good and been this much fun! (Although sucking at combat sims has, somehow, made me quite good at regular flight sims)\n\nAttempt 1 = take off. Line up with my squadron. First one goes fine. Second one goes fine. I go, spin out, drop my landing gear on the runway, break a wing off, bend my plane almost in half and sit there smoking. Next plane goes, runs over my landing gear, tearing their front wheels off, causing them to face-plant into the runway and somersault for several feet.\n\nAttempt 2 = Decide to abandon my squadron (for their safety) and taxi to a side taxiway to take off. Engines good. Rudder positioned. Reach takeoff speed and plane barely leaves ground. Struggle with struggling plane, and tear off my left wing off on a tree, whipping me around in circles. Scratch my head, watch replay and realize I never lowered my flaps... DOH!\n\nAttempt 3 = Begin airborne since I seem to suffer a major case of suckage at taking off. Misread mission map and fly away from my squadron, and from the checkpoint for about 5 minutes. Fix my mistake and arrive late to the party. Fire at an enemy and damage my teammate. Take 2 rounds from enemy plane and my engine goes up in a cloud of smoke, covering the cockpit in a sticky black oil.\n\nI blindly coax my plane along, lowering the throttle and using my map as guidance.\n\nEngine kicks the bucket with about 30 miles left to go... yep, screwed. Can't see the ground, can't see anything really. I keep it level, looking out the side of my cockpit and aim for, what looks like an empty field. Landing gear is down and flaps are lowered, so far so good.\n\nSlam head-first into a house and explode in a fireball, taking the house out with me.\n\n\nAs I said, sucking never felt so good :)\n","December 4, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Absolutely terrible. The flight models are exaggerated (For instance, the ground loop on the FW190 is a real thing, but this game, not a simulator, exaggerated it to the point where I cannot apply enough control to counter it.) In addition, this latest update has added a bug which prevents missions from loading completely, and I as the owenr of the computer no longer have the ability to close the game. I simply don't have the permissions necessary, as the SYSADMIN. That's effed up.\n\nIn addition, two aircraft are locked behind particularly expensive paywalls. Not even DLC, they're there in the game, just paywalled. If this were a DCS level of detail, I might understand. But $30-$40 for an IL2-level flight model and graphics? No, to hell with that.\n\nOne the upshot, the most recent update added mouse controls and driveable tanks. Now, if there wasn't a literal game-breaking bug, we would have a limited-scope War thunder wannabe with a marginally better FM.\n\nThanks 1C company!\n\nAs an addendum, I'm writing this as of the most recent update, for the first time. Previously, eight months ago (Prior to BCT, AIT, and Duty Station) I did enjoy this game, not much of a dogfighter, but to practice maneuvers for the joy of flying a warbird. Eight months ago, I would have recommended it, in spite of the problems.\n\nAt this juncture, I can't.","November 26, 2015","false","9.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","2"

The unlock system is ridiculous. This is supposed to be a flight sim, not a Call of Duty game. My Focke-Wulf 190 should come with MG FFs out of the box, from the factory. I should not have to play through the game's tepid, boring excuse for a 'campaign mode' in order to get basic functionality from my aircraft. Unless, of course, you buy the Deluxe Edition, which is rapaciously overpriced. This is a policy I would have expected from EA or Ubisoft, not from a flight sim developer.\n\nMy advice? Stick with Il-2: 1946. Sure, it kind of looks like ♥♥♥ these days, but you'll get a hell of a lot more out of it in terms of content and fun.

There are many single missions but no continuous story. It is no where near as modifiable as previous games. The campaigns are decently long with average variability, the generated missions do get repetitive but the game itself is still fun enough to draw you back.\n\nThe multiplayer is much more varied and really is where this game shines. You can have a simple dogfight or partake in a long and enduring battle over a massive area with several mission to keep you occupied. Tanks have also made an appearance (for free) and are relatively fun for the small impression they've left so far (early in development at the time of writing).\n\nThe quality of the simulation aspect is as expected, you will not be disappointed. The only downside is that the cockpit is not fully interactable (like in DCS) but all functions are still usable.\n\nWith the release of Battle of Moscow the game community has NOT been split, in fact you will own half of BoM by simply owning BoS. Put simply you will be able to fly with and against aircraft from BoM but not fly them yourself.\n\nIf you want to experience both solo and multiplayer in an immersive and top of the range WWII flight sim, you won't regret your purchase.","December 24, 2015","true","58.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Rant Halt. Now, I want to love this game but is doesn't want me to love it, it seems. i understand it is a more realistic flight sim, and so is 1946. However in 1946 i was able to easily play and remap controls to a cotroller, even the "expert" controlls and difficulty were easy to understand, but with this game nothing is easy. The last thing i have to say is that if this game had a tutorial, (ive looked but i havent found one although it could be hidden if it exists) it would be a hell of a lot easier to catch up to and enjoy.

I'm an early access buyer, and I am now being forced to play mind numbingly boring tutorials BEFORE I can access planes, skins or weapons. Moreover, it looks like, at 90 percent completion, that the single player campaign is limited, repetitive and almost devoid of any interesting material. Worse still, the developers have disabled fast time compression for the tutorials, so you can't even race through them. Add to that a complete disregard toward their fan base, and I certainly do not recommend this game. I bought early access to a simulation with complex engine management and great visuals and FMs, but the recent direction if the game is turning it into a boring arcade like experience. A fail on public relations and a fail on the arcade aspects of the game. Pity, since it had such potential.

Too bad even on low this thing refuses to be playable, maybe is not the low fps (keeps dropping from 50 to 40 to 30 and some times to the low mid 20s) but the stuttering that makes it unplayable. When I zoom in, stuttering, when I look around, stuttering, no matter my settings it always happen. Hey is just me flying no vehicles or enemies around, guess what? Yeah, stuttering and unstable fps. I can play War Thunder with 32 players or bots and lots of action on the ground with Ultra settings at full 60 fps in 1080p with not drops just fine but this game on low looks worse than WT and with nothing but just me on the map barely gets to 50 fps, is unstable and still has the stuttering problem. I've read and many people with better specs than me have the same issues. This is obviously a problem with the game. Now as for the gameplay, the lack of content is also a reason why this game isn't worth the price. First of all the game doesn't even have a tutorial mode so for starters like me our only option is to play with custom settings while we learn how the planes handle in this game, which imo is not very good, on normal settings I can't even turn in the 109, while in simulators like 1946 with everything on full realism I can do it without any problem. I found out that I have to enable an option in custom settings to simplify turning, is strange and is something I've never seen in another simulator game so whatever I did it but guess what? The campaign can only be played on normal or expert, that's right the incompetent developers won't even give you the option to play the campaign mode with custom settings, are you kidding me? And if you want to unlock the planes skins and modifications you have to play campaign or pay. So if you can't even turn the fckng plane how are you suppose to do that? PAY. What a joke. And two of the few flyable planes in this game are behind a paywall. One of them is an all time favorite, the 190. Wanna fly the legendary 190, too bad you gotta pay us more for it because is locked unless you pay for the unlock key. Ridiculous. Oh and don't even bother with the mp, is dead. Unless you consider two out of a dozen lobbies being half full alive.\n\nTl;dr - Unplayable overpriced game with a dead mp, very little sp content and very few planes. Good thing I bought it on sale, too bad that by the time I asked for a refund I already exceeded the two hours limit. Not even worth the sale price.\n\nIL-2 1946 is still the best ten years later.

Just a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off when I wrote this review :P, If yuo have a joy stick, ignore the Gameplay, I belive with joystick it would probably go to a 8/10.\n\nWell, it's time for my first review ladies and gentlemen!\n\nSo, let's start!\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nNeeds to be way more optimized!\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nI personally hated it, seriously I lag everytime I try to play, IT"S IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH KEYBOARD, I PLAY WITH KEYBOARD!!!!!!!!! Seriousy... the alierons, and rudder, and the elevator DON'T RESET WHEN YOU TRY TO TURN YOU KEEP TURNING UNTIL YOU MOVE IT THE OTHER o_O I thought you would the controls reset until you move it again...\nFor example I move my rudder to the right, after wanting it to go straight, instead of letting go of the button I HAVE TO MOVE IT BACK TO NORMAL... This may not seem like a pain, but in those intense moments I gaurentee you, you will forget to push the button back, and then you would be wondering why the hell you hit a tree and blew up....\n\nFIX THE F***ING KEYBOARD CONTROLS!!!\n\nOnly fun part is ramming your enemy to death..\nEven the death cam sucks ):\n\nAmount of Stuff there is in thie game: 2/10\nYou excpect me to pay $60... FOR WHAT IS IT... 6 AIRPLANES?\nPlus it's only snow, like what?!?! Are you really that lazy? They litterally made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuse to, saying "Not many people play this game se we need to jack up the prices.." They even addmited they tried to do this as fast as possible so that they could go do something else...\n\nCamera: 7/10\n\nWhy is it shaky?\nI'm playing a game not watching a movie.\n\nIn total:  3/10 Go buy another game (Il-2 Sturmovik 1946) I have 3,000+ HRS in that seriously.. I'm addicted to it.\n\nWhy has this game even come out yet? It should still be in ALPHA THIS LOOKS LIKE ALPHA TO ME!!!\n\nI will update my review as the updates come along.

The game is hard, and I have played many flight sims, but frankly couldn't be bothered to try to turn my PC into a flying machine financially and otherwise.... crashed on all 10 of my takeoff attempts. In the air on low settings the game if beautiful... I love looking around the cockpit, but I just don't dare move my stick for fear of a crash...\n\nif you are or always wanted to be an amateur pilot and want to have to feel like you are pressing 120 buttons on a real vintage dashboard just to prevent your plane from going into a stall this game is for you.\n\nMy negative rating comes from the following: I feel a bit fooled that I invested in an Alpha (also bought 2 extra planes) that promised me a dynamic campaign with depth of experience and instead I get a half-baked campaign I could have had in IL-2 1946. Very dissapointed... I am supprised they call this version ready when it seems to be so much less than promised.\n\nOhh, today launch day, I know many people had Early Access version and yet there was a total of 16 pilots on at midnigth GMT +1... that is dissapointing. It is actually fun to just jump into the plane and open and close the cockpit without daring to touch the controls... I remember the dev saying in an interview "we want a game even complete newbs to flight sims can just jump into" ... I am no newb, I mastered Red Baron 3d, even did good at this company's Rise of Flight, but I am not a trained Messeschmit pilot nor have the time to become one.\n\nUnlock of planes for a game this expensive is INSANE. Bad choice. Ohhh and my DLC's don't work and they did in early access.\n\nPros: Detail of aircraft\n\nCons: Game is hard, campaign is hard (is it really so hard to make something as good as Dynamix's classic Red Baron?), "fun" factor they promised is not really there more than game released 20 or 10 years ago.","October 24, 2014","false","5.3"," 24 of 69 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","24","69","0","1"

I ran a squadron for 8 years on the old Ubi lobbies through the whole series. I bought Cliffs of dover, and never before had i felt so saddened at how unfinished it seemed to be. I really felt for the developers because it always showed in the past how committed and helpful to the IL2 players they were. IL2 Clod was so disjointed that i put off buying IL2 BoS for a long time. But let me tell you this. I beleive IL2 is now the Sim that Oleg was dreaming of. Its great in this release, and i really feel like, theres no way i could go back to 1946 after having a go of this. I thought i had seen this series die, however now it has been resurrected. Sure i understand some peoples comments about lack of aircraft, however, the detail and damage modelling is tremendous compared to 1946 which i will say, does seem very arcade like in comparison. It would be beutiful to have all theaters, Pacific carrier landings and everything you had in 1946, yes that will be missed. Maybe one day Oleg will add all this in DLC, that would be the next dream. Its a great engine this time. Smooth, and polished way beyond what Clod was. The immersion in this sim on full real settings is superb.","August 31, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clickable cockpits give a direct visual way to familiarize players with a given interface, especially with the helpfulness of mousing over different elements in the pit to help figure out where things are. This is especially important if you are going to switch between multiple aircraft to deal with the workload. In all honesty had I known that the clickable cockpits were not to be featured I would most likely not have bought it. Had I figured it out sooner I would have had it refunded. It's a personal thing; your mileage may vary.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad of course if the mapping for HOTAS setups wasn't so... rigid. My HOTAS Warthog for example would benefit greatly by being able to assign modifier buttons to chord multiple controls to a single hat switch for engine management. BoS as far as I can tell does not allow you to use anything but ALT, SHIFT and CTRL for modifiers. This is a limitation that even War Thunder  doesn't have.\n\nBoS has serious issues with configuring any of the multiple position switches on the Warthog to do anything useful.\n\nThe game also has multiple interface issues that range from annoying to exasperating. From icons in the navigation menu being horrendously cryptic (If you need to exit the game to find out the difference between blue and orange bullets you are designing it wrong.) to old-hat keybinding of 20 keys just to get friendly AI to do anything (Come on guys, commo rose is a modern standard for a reason.).\n\nPrecious little is known about any sort of mod tools for the game as yet, which would greatly benefit from it's expansion the way that IL2: Cliffs Of Dover has. Also when your most complete manual is written by a 3rd party; you have a serious problem.\n\nAside from that BoS gives a solid simulation experience. The sensation of flight is superb and the level of polish is the highest of any simulation in its class at current. They have done amazing things with the spotting system that sits it head and shoulders above it's contemporaries. Moreso than any other sim is the feeling of being "in the moment" above a wintery Russian warzone.\n\nNow if only the game would tell me what those stupid bullet colors meant without resorting to the Steam forums.","August 31, 2015","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This past year, I have been resurrecting an old passion of mine: Flight Simulation/Space Sim. I grew up flying with my father and my granfather was an experimental test pilot in the USAF. I have been an enthusiast all of my life.\n\nBecause I cannot afford to fly in real life (due to  both time and money), so I currently fly a Saitek X-52 Pro and a TrackIR5 setup. My 'cockpit' is still in the beginning stages, but I hope to add little by little over time.\n\nEven though my own setup is rudimentary at best, this game is still likely one of the most realistic and immersive experiences I've ever had.\n\nI highly recommend IL-2: BOS, especially if you are a fan of the franchise. They have improved many facets of the game.\n\nThe one complaint I have (if I must), is that it kind of boasts a narrow focus. In some ways, that can add to the experience. However, there is also a significant drawback. In an ideal world I would like to see a more varied, fleshed-out campaign/story and more aircraft. If nothing else, I wish 1C Studios would put out more content. Whether that be in the way DCS World does it, Expansions on current titles or something else entirely. Really this Con only speaks to what a fan I am of this franchise. I hope to see more from them in the future.\n\nIn terms of experience, this came can be slightly brutal at first; even to an experienced pilot (virtual or otherwise). However, if you stick with it, you'll quickly get the hang of it. I Spent a week hitting it hard each night for an hour or two, and finally started to get the basics and get a feel for the aircraft.\n\nAnyways, pick the game up, it's great!","August 26, 2015","true","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers could've created a masterpiece, You'll have a few hours of fun with this game til you realize it aint great at all. I give you 10 hours of fun, tops!\nGraphics are locked behind presets, low, midium, high, and ultra. Game does look gorgeous, but you will quickly get tired of seeing white everywhere. The developers did promise summer maps, but as of the time of this review they're still in developement.\nThe campaign is garbage. You are greeted with a small summary of the events going on in real life during that time period, fallowed by a very generic random mission generator where you can choose from intercept, escort, and I believe ground attack. You do the same thing over and over, in the same triagular mission flight plan. No real story, it's lazy trash.\nUnless you bought the primium version a while back, you have to grind out every single upgrade for every plane, like this ♥♥♥♥ was WT or something.\nThey refused to include clickable cockpits, it's not maybe they'll add them in the future, nope, they straight up said there will never be clickable cockpits.\nMultiplayer? it doesn't exist, servers are ALWAYS empty. If you get lucky you might find a few peeps in rare occasions, multiplayer in this game is dead.\nthis game still has room for a lot of improvements, still with all the negative things it's got going for it, 777 studios and 1C games are already working on their next title. "Battle of Moscow" which I will highly recommend you stay away from if it's anything like this game.\nThe only way i would recommend this title is if you pick it up at a 50% or less discount. Other than that, stick with DCS, RoF, and Cliffs of Dover. (TF mod)\nUPDATE\nAs the game has grown and more content has been added, it has motivated me to change my review of the game. The summer and autumn maps have been added, and they look absolutely gorgeous! The devs have added a new campaign mode with these new maps, which is still the same as the original "campaign" but now features selectable missions with a story behind it, and are an improvement over the old 'fly the same flightpath everytime' campaign missions.\nMultiplayer has been an improvemnt as well with more playing now coming into this game, with support from Youtubers like Bismark and Apeoftheyear the game has been getting a lot more attention. There are people now actually playing multiplayer! the servers are still pretty limited, the most populated one is Wings of Liberty server which is an EU servers so pings might be a problem. I reside in western coast of the states, and i got close to 200 ping, which isn't bad but isn't good, Australian pilots would not be able to fly this server.\nTo wrap it up, with all the new updates, new maps, this game is starting to turn around, can't help but to recommend it now.","September 7, 2015","true","97.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

You're better off with any other IL-2 and DCS game."\n\nIt got a little better ever since. It still is a very sparse game but at least the engine isn't so resource hungry. They vastly improved the game engine adding support to 64bit and whatnot. I can safely recommend it now.
