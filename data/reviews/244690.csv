It had everything to be perfect, but things were implemented just all wrong.\nThe "puzzles" are simply a matter of finding something well hidden in the scenario and, once you find it, you basically need to move your mouse in the right directions and there goes the "solution".\nThe path you have to take to follow up with the story is made way too explicit by the thoughts of the character. His monologues always tell you what to do next, as hints you didn't ask for.\nBut the worst is that this game just kills the basic principle of point-and-clicking: exploration. Most objects only become available for use when the character already realized that he needs it. So the first time you explore the ambient he will say something like "I don't need it" for almost everything you try to interact with, but then after some stupid event that makes the character think "Hey, I need a blablabla for accomplishing that" then suddenly the blablabla can be picked up(or turned on, closed, open, or any other interaction that was previously unavailable).\nIt's a big challenge killer, you never really get the opportunity to think things through. As soon as the problem is presented, the character's consciousness gets to the answer for it, inevitably preventing you to draw any conclusion by yourself. What keeps you playing is just the hope that at some point all that seemingly pretentious work will actually turn into something fun. But I guess this is just an illusion.","April 13, 2014","false","1.9"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","53","66","0","0"

Sometimes the quality is, well... ugh. Enough said.\n\n2) Animation: The animation is sub-par, today. I mostly speak of the mouth movements. Everything else is quite par.\n\n3) Lockpicking: You can skip doing it altogether.\n\n4) Issues: Now, this is an interesting con. I would have broken this one down into more than one part, but, the single word "issues" really sums it all up neatly. For instance, near the beginning of the game, it seemed quite impossible to be able to find a light switch in a blackened room, which prompted me to get frustrated and stop playing for months. And then, when I finally mustered up the jimmies (yes) to play it again, and use a walkthrough to figure out where the hell it was, I still couldn't find it with my cursor for quite some time.\n\nAnother instance was when trying to get around some NPCs to investigate; finnicky business, that, at times, but not awful. Just.... finnicky. You really have to play the game to know what I mean by  just saying "Issues". It's definitely not (it can't be) a big-budget game, by any means, though it does have it charms, and humour enough to keep me interested.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Humour: The game has a good sense of humour, of which I won't spoil, because there's some fun quirkiness that you need to play into to appreciate.\n\n2) Interactivity: The game is very interactive, for a point and click, and doesn't hold your hand too much with what you're doing. Though, as I said, Lockpicking was just... yes.\n\n3) Story: The narrative is actually kind of interesting, once you... well, wrap your mind around it. Don't take this the wrong way; it's not complicated. It's just... a series of things happening, to the point of me not really remembering what sparked the narrative in the first place. But to be fair, I got frustrated and put this on hold for a few months. Maybe you would fare better..? All I remember is that I'm now framed for something I have to prove I didn't do, at this point. That's all I'll say, detail wise. That small tinge of con aside, it's amusing and not too shabby at keeping you engaged, so I take this as a positive thing.\n\n4) Puzzles: The puzzle solving and clue finding is just what it should be; involved. You really need to think hard, search around, and try every angle you can to get the solutions your looking for. Some are easier than others, but none are 100% obvious.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n\nIf you like detective games, point and click, and something that feels a little rough around the edges, this is the game for you. As long as you don't mind the awkward and sometimes questionable quality of the voice acting...\n\nIf you are looking for something to keep you on your toes, immersed, and delving into the shady underbelly of society, well... not so much.\n\nDo I recommend?\nSure, why not.\n\nBut only if it's very, very, very cheap.\n(Did I add one too many again?)","December 28, 2014","true","3.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","4"

And, of course, I have to mention that anyone buying the game has to live with the fact that it ends with a cliffhanger, and the chances for a sequel are… slim.\n\nThe presentation is a little difficult to rate. The exposition dump dialogues are part of the noir setting, and the writing is mostly acceptable. The voice acting isn’t bad, not at all, but it sounds more like some amateurs and family members doing their best to try to act than actual actors playing roles. (The audio quality is terrible though.)\n\nGame mechanics are painfully simplistic: look at items, pick up items, and use items. For the most part, progress is logical, albeit suffers from the ancient adventure game design problem that doesn’t want to finally die: every single action requires several trips to different spots of the city, even to do simple tasks as making a phone call.\nThere is one addition that brings some novelty, the deduction parts, where the player has to select two previously acquired facts out of many to reach a conclusion. They are a welcomed change of pace, even if their contribution to the 9-11 hour game time is negligible compared to the constant travelling.","May 1","true","10.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I really, REALLY wanted to like Face Noir. A noir detective story wrapped around a point and click adventure? Yes please! But that said this game didn't work for me. The story was decent, the graphics were more than serviceable and level design was nice. But the game was, quite frankly, pretty boring. An excellent adventure game like Still Life pulls you in but Face Noir just didn't work for me. The puzzles were bland, voice acting was hit or miss and it just brought nothing new to the table. I think what I disliked most was the gameplay was so rigid. You HAD to do everything in a certain order or you were not going to proceed. I had to consult a walkthrough a couple times because I got frustrated by that. One last thing that ticked me off. The game ends up being set up for a sequel.  Welp. We'll see if that ever happens. I'd recommend Face Noir if you're really into old school style adventure games but be ready to have a walkthrough handy or you will be going back and forth over stuff you missed. 5/10 from me.\n\nEDIT: I'd be remiss if I didn't give some props to the soundtrack, which was excellent.","August 27, 2014","false","7.4"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

The art, style, setting, story, characters, gameplay and so much more are really dark, gritty, onimous and have a lot of the other aspects that really hit well with the noir genre. It really feels like you're playing some old Film Noir and really hit home with me as I am a huge fan of the genre.\n\nThe puzzles aren't too cryptic, but aren't too easy. Most take a little bit of thinking without having some ridiculous solution that makes no sense as I have encountered in other adventure games. The story flows well, has twists and turns and always has a dark, slightly melancholy feel. The soundtrack is great ((and comes free with the game)) The game brings the suspense, style and so much more. Unlike many games today, it's really easy to delve into and really become entangled with the plot, characters, their issues and so much more.\n\nWhile the game does have a FEW MINOR problems, they are just that. FEW and MINOR. It's a nod to the classic style and feel of adventure games, in a world where gaming is becoming too mundane and unimaginative.

I didn't like the puzzles very much, they are either very easy or very hard to solve, due to a massive use of pixel hunting, but I really enjoyed the story. I think the guys at Mad Orange made an awesome job at ricreating the 1930s atmosphere, and while you play you really want to know how the plot will evolve. I can't wait for Part 2 to know how the story will end. Gameplay-wise they could have done something more, that's obvious, but still, it's just a small indie team.

But trust me, the game is pretty good for what it is.\n\nIt's a little slow to start and it's difficult to grasp the story at times since there are so many characters and side stories to keep track of and there are intervals throughout the game that calls for 'rewinds' and 'fast forwards' in time to portray other perspectives.\nHowever, what sets this game apart from other noir-themed games, is that this is a point & click game - which means it's going to be story heavy and less on the action side, which I personally enjoyed; also, you will be able to pick locks and solve puzzles (some of which can  be maddening at times, but they're a delightful addition).\nYou do get to interview various characters and while there aren't necessarily any consequences for your choices, you might miss out on some details of the story if you don't ask the questions in a certain way or if you're too rough.\n\nMy outlook on the game is mostly positive but I do have a few complaints.\n\nThere are a few plot holes, things that aren't explained; and, there's a cliffhanger at the end that leaves room for a supposed sequel - and I do hope that it is completed and released soon because I want to know more about the story!\nAnd, it's a bit frustrating that you have the option to skip lock-picking if it's too challenging, but you can't skip puzzles - I felt that option should've been balanced.\n\nIf you're like me and craving the noir genre, I do recommend this game.","November 1, 2013","true","14.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Another is that some of the puzzles aren't exactly consistent when interacting with them. Occasionally a lock that needs to be picked will be missing a tumbler position, forcing you to start the lock puzzle over.

It's priced at $10 as of the writing of this review, and it's worth it, but getting on sale would be better!\n\nExcept for one point, the story was excellent, the feel of the game was great and very immersive in 1930s New York, the soundtrack kicked butt, the puzzles were intelligible (I knew exactly what to do most of the time, but there was just the right amount of difficulty in getting it done), and I thought the humor of the protagonist was fantastic, but I like dry humor. The connect-the-dots mechanic was pretty inventive, I thought and added a good detective story even better, IMHO. The mannequins were probably the worst part of the game because they sometimes looked or did things that weren't right, but almost all point and click adventure puzzles suffer from this. My second complaint would be all the Dannazionis that were liberally peppered throughout the game. It was a bit overused.\n\nTo address some complaints about the story being too linear or limiting in that I can't grab an object or do something now, but can later on when the story advances, I actually thought it made sense and, once again, is something most point and click adventure games do. I actually didn't mind because I viewed it as a story-focused game and that stream-lined it so that I could enjoy the story instead of getting caught up in picking up a bunch of useless stuff that I didn't need and wouldn't use.\n\nSPOILER ALERT AHEAD!\nThe one thing I didn't like about the story was the paranormal element that was thrown in regarding the girl. While she is basically the MacGuffin for Face Noir, there is this allusion to her being able to control time and dreams and that she is going to do something supernatural in the sequel. This kind of threw me out of the immersiveness that the rest of the game established so well. The supernatural really has no place in a good noir story. Read any of the hard-boiled detective writers like Raymond Chandler, Dashell Hammett, and Mickey Spillane that typified the detective/Noir writing and none of them ever got caught up in that stuff. I also thought that its introduction in the last 1/3 of the game kind of blindsided me after being so true to the hard-boiled detective genre for the first 2/3 of the game.\n\nI do look forward to Face Noir II, though.

The story's not bad - a little bland at first, but it keeps getting more interesting and twisty as it progresses, making it worth finishing.  If a noir point-and-click casting you as a PI in the 1930's sounds like it'd be up your alley, go ahead, but be prepared for the flaws mentioned below.  I should note, though, that it ends with a lot of plot threads left dangling in anticipation of a sequel.\n\nVoice acting's mostly decent, but some characters seem flat while others have exaggerated accents, and there are occasionally times when a character's voice noticeably changes from one sentence to the next (indicating that the dialog was probably pieced together from multiple recording sessions with inconsistent quality).  Despite having no support for widescreen, the graphics are overall excellent and work well to set the mood.  The quality of the graphics, does, however, make the terrible facial animation that much more obvious.\n\nCompared to many other point-and-clicks, the puzzle solutions are logical and realistic, which works well with the story.  But that doesn't mean it compares well in terms of making the solutions fair and reasonable - in fact, it does just the opposite.  Some of the hotspots are tiny and barely visible, but that's a minor problem since F1 will highlight them.  A bigger problem is that at least a couple solutions depend on knowledge that the player cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  For example, you'll need to know what a certain country's flag looks like, which would be fine if said flag were clearly depicted in-game, but it isn't.  Worse, the game expects you to do things in a certain order that isn't always clear.  If you've missed inspecting the object that you need to inspect in order to open up the dialog option that you need to take before solving the next puzzle, you'll be stuck and you won't know why you're stuck until you've looked up a guide.  It may make sense, but only in retrospect.","January 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Face Noir refuses to hold your hand through its puzzles, no matter how insanely obscure some combinations of items might seem.

It includes stealth sections in the same haphazard way that early FPS games handled platforming. For some, this will be a familiar and welcome return to the past, but most anyone who didn’t grow up combining items and pixel hunting will find nothing but frustration here.\n\nFull Review located at http://www.geekenstein.com/face-noir-review/.

The story is incoherent -- why does what starts out seeming like a film noir detective story turn into a Broken Sword rip off? -- the voice acting is poor, the interface is painful, the graphics are bad.  And it's broken.  If you don't have your Windows desktop set to 100% text size, the game doesn't display text properly.  So you don't see the instructions to puzzles.  That can be worked around with a walkthrough, but there's a point late in the game when you have to do a word puzzle that has missing letter because of this bug and therefore can't be completed.  I gave up at that point.  Resizing your desktop font requires you to log out of Windows, and when you log back in, all of your desktop icons are reset in  random bunch in the upper left.  This game's not worth it to me to spend 10 minutes reorganizing my desktop to finish.  Very disappointed in Phoenix Online, who did the localization, for putting this game out like this.  Not to mention, someone at Phoenix online decided to put a translated sign on a Hoboken, NJ police station (which makes absolutely no sense being in the game to begin with) that says it is in the "State of the City of New York."  The developers are Italian, so their ignorance of U.S. geography I guess can be excused to some extent, but what's Phoenix's excuse for allowing stupid thing like that (which pop up in weird incongruities in less ridiculous forms throughout the game) to be part of their lazy localization effort?","December 21, 2013","false","13.8"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","1"

Noir. But then some poor decisions in game design just made these flaws worse. The graphics aren’t too flash hot which was fine until there were a close-up of people’s faces talking. Nothing like the mechanical and rhythmic movements of individual’s mouth set in emotionless faces to really build suspense. The voice acting was pretty poor to say the least, lacking emotion, or at least the correct emotion. The game is originally Italian, so poor English voice-acting is understandable. This would not have been a huge deal if it hadn’t been coupled with the emotionless faces.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/03/21/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-face-noir/","April 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

This is a mystery game with basic contradictions in the facts of the case. For example, there's a police report that claims a character was found 'not guilty' on Dec 1932, for a crime they were originally arrested for in either March or May 1933 (another inconsistency). The dialogue is incredibly disjoined (half-clinical, half written-by-someone-not-quite-fluent-in-English), and their idea of making it "noir" is to repeatedly use the same two or three Depression-era or Italian-immigrant words (e.g., "joint", "Dannazione"). Also, when they talk, their models just chomp robotically for about two minutes longer than it would have someone to actually say what's being said. Textures on important characters are misaligned and then repeatedly shown close up (GOOD GOD PLEASE FIX THE LITTLE GIRL'S FEET, she looks like a cripple). Some of the puzzles are so contrived it's ridiculous. At one point you need to cheer someone up by finding some music on the radio, but there's like five frequencies with music and no hint as to which one she would prefer. At another point you need to get through a door with a barrel in the way, and the only way to do so is to pull a nail (one of 5, the only one you can pull out) from a pile of disused boats, then drive the nail into the barrel with your bare hands to drain the barrel of fluid so you can move it. Yup.","April 16, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Most of the puzzes are interesting and make sense, and there are a number of interesting mechanics that were deployed in a relatively effective manner. Ultimately, the poorly thought out "cliffhanger" ending makes this at best a 3/5 for me.","April 25, 2015","false","10.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I got this game in a groupees bundle about a week after it launched on steam .  The voice acting in this game is as bad as that fruit loaf your mother has sitting in her freezer with a note that states "Christmas 2003, Love Aunt Judy."  This is a point and click adventure with basically the most generic story ever.  It even has a private eye.  More like a brown eye.","November 28, 2013","false","6.1"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","1"

Felt boring and extremely slow paced.\nI tried to enjoy it, but I couldnt, especially when I cranked up something wtihin the game to increase something in the game and it gave me a BSOD. After that, I knew I shouldn't play this any longer as I do not want to reload everything again.\n\nThe devs inside steam will tell you to email their support, even though, they know the answer. Like someone said that they cannot make it go to windowed mode and tried the run options. The dev said to email support which is what he says for many issues with this game.\n\nI don't know, the pace is very slow and I guess it is just that, I probably do not like Point and Click games. I think that must be it.\n\nThe only good part about this is that voice acting. I thought it was done rather well.\nHowever, if you aren't into point and clicks, I would avoid it.\nIf you love point and clicks, maybe you would enjoy this.\n\nStill, I would not recommend this game.","April 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It's noir style means long-winded voice overs between scenes, and neither the voice acting nor writing is up to the task. Most of the puzzles are fine, but a few require objects to be placed in very precise patterns without the graphical cues or accuracy to make it clear why your solution does not work. A number of bugs plauge the game, one of which is game-breaking unless you realize you have to change a default Windows setting to get it to go away. The plot twists are fairly predictable, up until the end where it takes a twist to the absurd and goes in a direction that I personally found fairly undesirable. There are simply better point-n-click adventure games out there.","June 17, 2014","false","9.2"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inliquidwonder/recommended/244690/","inliquidwonder","InLiquidWonder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inliquidwonder/","214 products in account","I was close to leaving a positive review.  The story was curious, there's some delightful jazz in the soundtrack (real instruments possibly!).  But then I had one too many long, unnecessary minigame puzzles that involved walking for minutes at a time.  Too many times Jack Del Nero said "Dannazoni" or whatever his contrived Italian catchphrase was.  The pacing was just so stupidly slow at these less crucial parts that I couldn't take it anymore.  Instead of wasting another 5 minutes retracing steps for a lost item (thanks, FAQ), I am looking up the ending on YouTube and uninstalling.  So sad to see it come to this, but I have lost all patience.  Also - lack of multiple solutions to item puzzles is ridiculous.  Everything is linear, and it's a buzz kill.\n\nFeel free to try this if you have patience for inane puzzles and adventure game pixel hunting.  The lovely jazz soundtrack and curious story might even pull you through the terribly slow walking pace of the main character and inane minigames (there's even one that is SKIPPABLE if you fail enough!  SKIPPABLE, like with a Skip button.  Designers - if people would want to skip your minigame, chances are it's not fun or not done well, take your pick).","March 12, 2014","false","11.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

However be wary the ending is slightly abrupt less cliff hanger more oh its over, to be continued in the next game.\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\nThe Story, It was interesting and kept me intriged even if it did get a little left feild at the end.\nThe Puzzels, nice mix.\nThe graphics, all though I would of liked it to use more of the film noir style it take from with the heavy shadows.\n\nWhat I didn't\n\nThe controls, I felt when using the mouse during the puzzels it was very on or off. The hand cursor made some of the     puzzels fiddley the arrow cursor would have been fine. The abilty to run would have great, double click to run, after walking round the secne you've visited before can really slow down the gameplay. keyboard controls would of been a god send, trying to stealth with point and clicking can be quite infuriating.\n\n","November 8, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
