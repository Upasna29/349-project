Danganronpa takes everything up to 11, shows you what it would look like if you went to 12, and then skips straight to 15. Everything about it is enthralling and horrifying all at once. I lost a lot of sleep thinking about this game.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just sit down and play it straight through. Don't read anything else about it. Don't risk ruining the experience for yourself, because hot damn is it an experience. Everything after like the first 30 minutes is a game changing spoiler.\n\nI can come up with about 11037 more reasons why this game is great, but I'll spare you my ramblings. Just... just play it.\n\n*This is called comedic hyperbole. Please read my edits.\n\nEDIT 1: In response to some of the comments on this review, let me expand my discussion on the anime a bit. The anime is a direct adaption of only the most essential elements of the plot of the original PSP game. The result is next to nothing as far as character development, and the suspense and thrill of solving the crimes is completely eliminated by the investigation/courtroom montages that sort of just... exposit, with little of interest otherwise. I have absolutely nothing against the adaption as its own work or even against anime in general. It's just that when compared to the extremely detailed characterization every single character gets in the game and the satisfaction of actually having to solve all the crimes yourself, the anime falls flat.\n\nIn short, the anime is definitely not a substitute for actually playing the game. I hope this helps!\n\nEDIT 2: Well... yes, if you've watched the anime you'll have the plot spoiled for you. However, like I said, you still only know the gist of how each crime happened. You still have to actually do all the legwork to prove it, which is still a lot of fun in and of itself. At least I think so. Plus, there character events and bonus scenes that can't be seen by just watching the anime. So if you have any attatchment to the characters, then yes, I do think there is value in playing the game. If you just wanted the plot, well... you got it.","February 18","true","45.1"," 398 of 468 people (85%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","85","398","468","102","29"

Sounds like a mouthful? But this game manages to split these elements proportionally to make them enjoyable and add fuel to the evolving, amazing, storyline that will haunt you for years to come.\n\nOriginally a PSP title, with multiple ports for years to come, the PC version is more akin to a straight-up port than a HD remake. Which is fine, and understandable, because it isn't the games' aesthetics which make it one of the best adventure games I've ever played; but its story, characters and setting.\n\nAgain, spoiler-free, but you play as Makoto Naegi, an average high school boy finding himself trapped in a mysterious building one day with other students; aptly nicknamed given their personality and fashion. Not long in, there's been a murder and you are put in charge with finding out who murdered said person, by learning about the other characters, finding clues and going into a trial with them ala Ace Attorney. Speaking of - I feel Danganronpa is a strong franchise which can be compared to the Ace Attorney series as there are identical gameplay elements and quirky design choices.\n\nMoving on though, general gameplay consists of room-to-room movement, talking to characters in visual novel-esque, with their beautifully drawn portraits to keep you distracted from the text. During the trials, there are well-placed, reasonable and sensical QTEs that tie-in with how both the story and gameplay present themselves up until that point. Your quick fingers, your own intuition and feelings for the characters will make you feel confident, or weasel out of wanting to press those button propmpts.\n\nAnyway, for me personally, one of the best portions of the game is its atmosphere: its forboding, compelling, repressive and tense building was mostly on my part because of the direction the game goes. It... isn't your typical raincoat detective story, there's nicely used humour, a strange but loveable villain which is introduced early, whacky, bizarre, creative yet at the same time, reverse-stereotypical characters. But what did it for me... was the way the game progresses, what happens when each new day passes... what your consequence is for not finding the murderer quick enough. All the dread, mystery and tension is added as layers of fear, heh. At one point, I felt legitamately frightened to continue, but I did anyway knowing what would happen next was going to blow my mind.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game, BUY IT. BUY IT NOW. It will be one of the best adventure games you'll play, there is something for everybody in this game, big and small. This game is a masterpiece.","February 18","true","21.0"," 230 of 269 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","230","269","10","24"

However, this turns out to be one of its biggest strengths. The game strikes a good balance between rolling with the tropes and subverting them, constantly leading you into an 'obvious' conclusion and then pulling the rug from underneath you. Then, as soon as you start accounting for this, the game once again switches gears to keep you guessing. I encountered quite a few unexpected plot twists during my first playthrough of the PSP fan translation a few years back, which was a pleasant surprise given the predictable nature of most video game stories.\n\nWhile the story is still pretty fun even if you do know what's going to happen, if you are currently unspoiled, I suggest you try and keep it that way. Stay away from forums, don't look online for fan art and for God's sake do not listen to the soundtrack until you finish the game (I managed to spoil myself by reading the tracklist during my first playthrough).\n\nIn terms of replayability, I consider the game to be worth at least two playthroughs: there is a lot of clever foreshadowing that you will simply not get on your first playthrough hidden throughout the game and focussing your gift-giving and free time activities on different characters will reward you with additional backstory for them. As such, I'd say the current asking price is very fair, even for a six-year old port.\n\nAside from buying the game based on its merits, if you are at all interested in seeing similar games get ported from Sony's ill-fated handhelds to Steam, buying Dangan Ronpa is a good signal to companies like Spike Chunsoft that there is, in fact, a market for them. It's unfortunate for Sony, but thanks to Spike Chunsoft, I won't have to consider buying a Vita (TV) anymore to play the second installment of this series and I sincerly hope that other hidden gems will eventually make their way to Steam as well.","February 20","true","49.6"," 86 of 90 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","86","90","4","0"

After sinking in 40 hours (completionist) I regret NOTHING! Even after beating the game I chose to play part of it over again to befriend different people (thus changing my skills, which effects my "spec") to see how a new spec would affect trials.\n\nIt should be noted that this is NOT a visual novel. The community and even many professionals have that wrong. A visual novel is a game where it's ALL narration, with the occasional "choose what happens next" selection. This game is an ADV (Adventure Game). It has MANY gameplay elements including walking around the school, discovering new areas, befriending different people, giving them gifts to make them like you more, getting skills from those friendships and utilizing them in trials. And then within the trials themselves you play several mini games as well, including a DDR-style press the buttons to the rhythm, hangman (with a gun), and firing truth bullets to bring to light contradictory logic (so basically a logic mini game). You can even get a game over if you fail in the trials, not something you'd see in a visual novel. For completionists there is a full list of gifts you can get via an egg machine in the school shop and it's based on probability of repeat percentage which can be lowered by inserting more and more coins (which are found by uncovering secrets throughout the game - completely optional).\n\nAnyway, again, it's a GREAT game that's very fun through and through. There is humor that will make you laugh, interactions that will warm you, and events that will brutally break your heart and make you cry.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suavek/recommended/413410/","Suavek","Suavek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suavek/","995 products in account","I went into Danganronpa not certain what to expect. The only thing I knew was that it's an anime-style murder mystery visual novel with some social interactions and Ace Attorney inspired investigations and trials. I didn't even watch any of the trailers, to be honest. Perhaps that's the reason I was so invested when I've started playing the game for the first time. Because even though the story setting seems quite absurd, it's the overall presentation and a bunch of well-written characters that make Danganronpa so unique. Even when you're able to predict what will happen next, or who will die, there's a chance of a clever twist occuring in the meantime or afterwards, either changing your perception of some of the characters, or deepening the overall mystery surrounding the whole killing-game.\n\nTruth be told, Danganronpa is quite linear and there's really only one solution to any given mystery or puzzle. That said, the game hides it all well and allows the player to make some choices of their own during free time, and offers some optional conversations or activities. Plus, it's the overall story and the characters you interact with that are the focus here. The investigations are quite easy, while the trials themselves require either a bit of logical thinking, or just a couple of attempts to get it right (when the logic fails you...), but they're all presented in a very appealing style, which also involves some really awesome and varied music.\n\nI've played the game for the first time on the PSVita, but I got the PC version anyway and I can safely say that even though mouse+keyboard controls may seem weird at first, the port as a whole is quite good and should run on a potato (i.e. I'm running it fine on an ancient rig, 60fps, no issues whatsoever).\n\nStrong recommendation on this one, if you're in any way interested in murder mysteries with some grotesque anime weirdness. Just do yourself a favor and play with the original japanese voices, and not the awful english dub...","February 23","true","11.8"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","79","84","3","3"

Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is not your typical visual novel where you where everything always goes smoothly where no one gets into trouble or anything, it has the touch of mystery, horror, point and click and detective work all in the mix of this visual novel not to mention the story is very rich.\n\nThe StoryHope’s Peak Academy is home to Japan’s best and brightest high school students. The protagonist, Naegi Makoto (excels in Luck) arrives on the first day of class only to fall unconscious after he steps through the gates. When he wakes up, he meets up with 14 other students who went through the same experience, and they find that all possible exits have been sealed shut. Makoto Naegi and his classmates find themselves imprisoned in the school, cut off from the outside world and subject to the whims of a strange, murderous little bear named Monokuma a black and white robot bear who appears to be behind the whole affair, that they are playing a game and the only way for them to leave the school is to “graduate”. To do so he pits the students against each other, promising freedom to anyone who can murder a fellow classmate and get away with it.\n\nIt’s up to you to find out who Monokuma really is, and why you’ve been taken from the world you once knew. But be careful what you wish for—sometimes there’s nothing more deadly than the truth…\n\nCharacters all of them are interesting in many ways. Personally my favorite character in Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is Kirigiri Kyouko, she always has that mysterious and cool yet mature aura around her while always being level headed and face problems calmly that always seem so charming to me personally.\n\nAudio and Visual Elements Visual Elements – Many things to note here is that the backgrounds, CGs and character sprites used in Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc are very consistent with each other in turn made the whole visual novel as whole looks smoother. This is really a huge thing for me overall I absolutely adore the artstyle used in Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. I have played many visual novels where the character sprites are not consistent with the backgrounds at all and then in turn they do not blend in nicely causing them to not look nice and “smooth” at all.\n\nAudio Elements – Music is a very important factor to consider in a visual novel because music has a great ability to set the mood and make things flow from then on and Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc definitely has this executed perfectly. Each time the “phase” of the story chances, the BGM would change with it to set the mood and tension around the characters. Lets take for example in trial room where they would start the arguments to prove their points I absolutely adore what the BGM did there where it changes the atmosphere in a split second just with the power of music.\n\nTo sum upWill I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer yes, I would definitely recommend this awesome visual novel if you are the type of person who looks for gameplay in a visual novel as this definitely has loads of gameplay to offer and loves detective work with dark mysteries waiting to be uncovered and solved. Honestly I am not a fan of having gameplay in my visual novel I am more of the typer of person that prefers to just click on my mouse all day long, but Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc has so much to offer, it has a rich story interesting and fun to read through, has great music to offer and gameplay [If you like gameplay in your VN]\n\nClick here for the full review with more details.[azusantiara.com]","February 25","true","34.5"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","60","65","4","6"

You need some level, I would assume about 7th grade level, of reading skills. And, as reading goes, some people may get bored because reading is boring. If you think reading is boring, run. Run far away and live back into despair (see what I did there people who have played? Aren't I just magical.).\n\nWith this game, you will take part in a school life with a radically changing number of classmates. Why is it changing? Because a bear named Monokuma is dangling you and all your classmates lifes and reputations out the 30th floor window. Once murder is committed, it is your job to found out 'whodunnit' and use a very unique way of pushing your point.\n\nThe main feature here is the trials where you have to find out who killed who. Instead of choosing evidence and saying something is wrong, the game chooses for you by picking relevant evidence and having you shoot the contradiction. With a gun. Sounds simple? It gets more complicated but those are spoilers, but it does get more intense as time goes on.\n\nCharacters are tight as a simile. Unique characters all around, but I'll let you discover them for yourself. You'll get used to them in no time, as they are your classmates.\n\nMusic is kickass, just don't buy the soundtrack. It's all sorts of messed up. Although the FLAC is nice.\n\nOverall, I give it a solid number out of a larger number.","March 16","true","27.0"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","38","39","12","4"

Actually, when I saw Danganronpa on Steam, I was thinking of a joke due of the lack of good visual novels this times... BUT WOW. I can finally see what's a good ol' memory by now : That game rocks.\n\nWhat to say about it:    First of all, if you expect DGR being an action game or whatever (maybe not including Class Trials, if you haven't got 'the logic' like in a '  Ace Attorney  ' game this might become hardish for you: Mostly if you decide to play in Mean difficulty in your first run/don't know any type of resolving game.) then you are wrong.\n\nIn fact, DGR is a heavy based dialogue (that's normal, visual novel) but with a great enhancement by the plot:\nFifteen students destined to be the futur hopes in a prestigious school of Japan Hope's Peak Academy. Heh, when the MC was suppose to be the Ultimate 'lucky' Student; It turns out that in this place it's killed or be killed...Why so much pressure on that one? Well, to be honest, living in the same place forever might not bother some people , but all the hopes and dreams (There's no True Pacifist route right here, sorry) get flushed by maybe the most unexpected villain in a story: A talking plush Bear with a certain taste of 'Despair and Bloodlust';  Monokuma\n\nAnyway, your casual life in this school-trap is to search (for an eventual escape?) and act with people...Yep, there's a relationship system like Persona but less complicated  (you won't gonna pass 1 hour to search the most effective arcana to beat Margarette in this game)  and with an reward for it when you decide to interact withyour fellows : skills.\nWhat is those you might say, it's  a supplement help in the second part of the game: The Class Trials\nDepending on what difficulty you are, the harder you decide to take('Kind' to 'Mean'), well, the harder you got.\nBut what are exactly those Class Trials? Let's say there's a murder with all a mystery besides it, you, the MC of the story decides(and try his best) to find clues, then, when enough clues are found( It's automatic, you can't fail at searching the evidences), the trial starts(Oh boy!). No worry out there, a secretly placed narrator will help you through the procedure (I don't remember who much time he comes to help you, though. And I'ven't finished the game at this moment but, y' know)Through Non Stop Debates, Hangman's Gambits , Closing Argument and Bullet Time Battle, you'll see through the light of truth and so, the murderer...\nIf you don't manage to catch the 'fiend' by not being logic at all/By being a slow-pow, this guy will leave the school,seems cool? Well, maybe not for you, you are sentenced to death and not a normal death: A spectacular death (Afterall, the students are Ultimates;so the punishment). On other hand, if you caught the culprit after breaking him down to a final proof/exposure, you are spared for this moment...But not the murderer, duh.\n\nIn three words: Good old memories.\nAnd again, thanks for the devs to bring for all the fan of DGR that remake, seriously, thank you.\n(I would really hope the same think for DGR II ;and if possible, Persona3/4 Golden, but meh,not the same company after all)","February 19","true","41.1"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","49","60","5","0"

But as a tip: I'd play it on the hardest difficulty(Mean I believe) because sometimes things were a bit too easy(until the last few hours of the game, might I add.)\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nPROS:\n-Great characters, each with different personalities that get to shine.\n-Great suspense/mysteries.\n-Creative blend of Visual Novel and RPG\n\nCONS:\n-Glitches, glitches, glitches. If you've visited the discussions or read up about the port, you should know there's a few... quirks. I only experienced it in the last hour of the game, where the text went all wonky and flew all over the place, but I've heard there's more. I just saved, exited, and re-entered, and it was fixed. But still.\n-Risk vs Reward? As a minor spoiler, characters die in this game. A lot. Sometimes you might get attached to a character and spend more time with them-- Then they're gone. And you've essentially wasted your time, unless you plan on revisiting the game to make sure you unlock everything for each character for the sweet achievements before they beb.\n\nOverall, the only cons I found are miniscule at best. They definitely weren't the things that stopped me inbetween my 3 6 hour sessions to complete the game(in roughly 19 hours, which is apparently a fairly fast playthrough despite me not rushing.)\n\nShould you buy this game? Hell yeah! And the sequel is coming at some point in the near future to Steam, so you've got that to look forward to! Just make sure... You don't watch the anime. That stuff's awful.\n\nALSO: I'd recommend using a controller. It feels a lot better, especially when aiming during a majority of the game's gameplay segments.\n\n(Also Chihiro is best girl.

If you have played and enjoyed the Ace Attorney games just buy this game, you will love it. Ok actual review now.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is the best game I have played in I have no idea how long.\nIt has a great story backed up by fun characters and interesting gameplay.\n\nPros:\nThe story is simple, you are trapped in a school with 14 other students, and in order for someone to escape they must order someone else. Although from the outside it isn't complex is turns out to be an intense plot with many tricks and turns that surprise you and enhance the enjoyment.\n\nThe gameplay is focused around investigating events and trying to solve the mysteries put to you from life in the school.\n\nCons:\nIn between story events there is a "free time" where you can spend time with the characters and learn about them. This section feels quite bland at times with minimal reward. However it is skippable if you so wish\n\nI have a few audio issues where a loud ringing noise played and a single freeze. I hope these issues will be solved in the future but had little negative effect overall. The audio problem was solved by a simple opening and closing of the help menu.\nEDIT: a patch was released today stating that audio issues were fixed but I am unable to confirm if they match the ones I mentioned. I would assume so however\n\nOverall this is game is one I recommend to everyone and anyone that has any sort of interest in visual novels. The positives completely outway the negatives and is an absorbing experience from start to finish.","February 24","true","29.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","31","33","0","1"

So i was feeling pretty sceptic when launching it for the first time.\n\nThe beginning felt quite overextended, but when the first murder happened, it immediately got my attention.\n\nDuring the first third of the game i wished for it to be less linear in a form of something like affinity, which lets you affect the characters' behaviour, or some way to explore the school on your own to solve it's mysteries. But later i completely forgot about all that and now understand that it would be pretty hard to tie up those features with existing story.\n\nSo yeah, after the slow start it really got me immersed so i couldn't wait too see what's gonna happen next. Besides, the trials have some not obvious solutions and characters are well written.\n\nThe music plays a big role in creating the right mood for the moment, and does it well- when ♥♥♥♥ gets real and ＤＥＳＰＡＩＲ flows in the air, or when small rays of hope appear ahead, it enhances those emotions just right.\n\nOne downside i can think of is interactions during free time being a bit confusing- for example, you cheer the character up, when she is sad, give her the right present, but don't get report card update and skill points in return. This encourages savescumming and looking up the game wiki (big mistake, don't do that). All in all, my claims about Monokuma being unbelievably overpowered and confusing apocalypse still stand up, but boy what a ride that was.\n\nWhat an experience/10.\n\nMukuro best girl.","March 9","true","50.0"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","36","42","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimTheCactus/recommended/413410/","JimTheCactus","JimTheCactus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JimTheCactus/","130 products in account","Danganronpa is a highly stylized point and click mystery game set entirely in a single school, filled with a diverse cast of exceptional characters, decent game mechanics, an engaging story, adequate character art, great backgrounds, not quite enough different music, and astonishingly good localization.\n\n\nGame mechanics: 4/5Danganronpa is best understood as a mix up of four major genres: point and click adventure, visual novel, 2D shooter, and rhythm game. Moreover, gameplay is broken into two segments: free roam and Class Trials. During the free roam segments, you explore the school looking for clues in the style of a point and click adventure, or use the time to pursue deeper knowledge of the individual characters in the manner of a visual novel. The Class Trial segments, however, are more action oriented and have you either using a cursor or matching rhythms to make/refute statements.\n\nI found the free roam segments to be very well laid out, with important information well placed, but not spoon fed to you. I never really felt lost as for where to go next, and only rarely felt as though I’d been forced by the story to go somewhere rather than being allowed to find it myself.\n\nThe Class Trial segments were a lot less comfortable, however. Mystery games in general have a problem where you have to select what the scripter felt was the correct item to indicate a contradiction, and Danganronpa was no exception. It performs comparably with other games in its genera however, though that still left a few awkward moments where I was left trying permutations of options till I found the one they wanted. Similarly, the sync between my monitor and my sound is not especially good and the game does not have a mechanism for compensating this. As such, the rhythm sections were quite difficult, especially when they hid the visual cues.\n\nCharacters: 5/5Danganronpa is like most mystery games in that it’s highly focused on the characters, since “whodunnit” and why is crucial. To that end, Danganronpa has interesting, dynamic characters, and gives you lots of opportunities to explore their individual personalities though the main story line as well as the free time segments. All in all, the only character that I didn’t really feel stood out much was the protagonist, which is consistent with visual novel-style games as they’re necessarily a “John Everyman” so that you can relate to them.\n\nBeyond that, the characters stay in character. In mystery games it often happens that smart characters miss obvious things, or dumb characters suddenly reveal complex clues that would have required deep knowledge. Danganronpa does a good job of remembering who’s who, and the writers did an excellent job in making sure the right mouthpiece was used for each line of dialog.\n\nI’d go deeper into the specifics of the characters (as some are better than others,) but given the mystery nature of the game, you’ll just have to take “Overall, I quite liked them” as my answer and play the game to meet them yourself.\n\nStory: 4/5Danganronpa does a great job with it’s story. Each chapter feels complete and does a good job of giving the various characters their chance to shine. Moreover, the metaplot of the game is equally well told, and is introduced just fast enough to keep you interested. It does suffer somewhat from some brute force exposition issues at the end, but these are extremely minor and the rest of the game is exceptionally well paced.\n\nThe only real gripe I have is that the end left a couple of loose threads in the plot. That said, I know Danganronpa is actually just the very first game in a series, so I have good reason to believe that this is intentional, but given the poor access to Danganronpa games at the moment, this has the chance to be a problem in the long term if they choose not to port the other games.\n\nArt: 3/5Danganronpa has a very unique style that suits it’s storytelling very well, and overall the art is solid. However, it is not as stellar as many other elements in the game. The backgrounds were indeed stellar, and really showed off the game’s style, but the character art was a mixed bag. Several of the characters were highly stylized, and looked amazingly good. Others felt like they were done by the interns and some of their poses had fairly blatant anatomy errors or style violations. Overall it’s not bad enough to kill things, but it was enough that when I first saw them, it was somewhat distracting.\n\nSound and Music: 3/5Point and click adventures, especially long ones like Danganronpa (~40 hours for me,) can easily suffer from music overuse, and sadly that is the case here. I enjoy the themes, and the strong use of style dissonance (switching between morose and upbeat, nearly playful styles) does help to offset some of this. However, by the 20th hour, the main themes are starting to get pretty tired as there’s really only 4 or 5 of them. The switch up during the class trials is nice, and does help offset it.\n\nThe sound effects themselves are pretty much stock, and don’t stand out positively or negatively, which I usually consider as a vote for them since they’re largely used as background.\n\nDialog and Localization: 5/5To start with, I played through the game with the voices in Japanese because I’m a horrible hipster like that. With that said, the localization was astonishingly good. I’ve played a lot of ported RPGs so I’ve come to be used to certain problems with localized text, but Danganronpa was different. To start with, I didn’t see a single spelling error, bad text item, or piece of poorly translated text. That would usually be enough for me to consider it an excellent port. However, the localization team for Danganronpa has clearly gone above and beyond.\n\nNormally I have to depend on my study of Japanese culture and editor’s notes to infer what certain symbolism means in role playing games, and this can be especially important in games that depend deeply on cultural context like mystery games. However, the localization team adjusted just about everything that could possibly have required me to have prior knowledge, or embedded the necessary explanation into the text. Despite a few uniquely Japanese situations in the game, I never once felt that I missed something important because of something like misplaced chopsticks, or different fortune telling rituals.\n\nFinal ThoughtsOverall this is a solid game that will require a substantial investment of time to beat and rewards being thorough in your investigation. I’d recommend giving it a play if you’re into murder mysteries with a mixed up-and-down tone.","March 10","true","38.9"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battlechili/recommended/413410/","Battlechili","Battlechili","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battlechili/","174 products in account","You might be surprised to learn that this visual novel is an extremely wild rollercoster ride of twists and turns clocking at around 25 hours in length (maybe a little more, maybe a little less, depending on who you are).\n\nDanganronpa is a fantastic little gem of a game, and while I say its a visual novel and its genre is listed as such, its so interactive that the term feels almost disingenuous to what the game is actually like. Its true that you'll spend a significant portion of your time just reading text on the screen while looking at character portraits and listening to music, but the game is so much more. A good meat of the game involves class trials, where, in a sort of Phoenix Wright fashion, you participate in lengthy debates where you find weak points in people's arguments and present evidence you found to support your claims in an attempt to determine who the killer of each case is. This is done through various different logic minigames, some taking more thinking than others, but most of them basically requiring you to aim the appropriate truth bullets (evidence you found in the case) at contradictions that people say when they say them. Its a really interesting approach to how an argument is treated, and it makes the already fun idea of debating and presenting evidence even more fun. It can especially get rather difficult at times, as sometimes discerning the correct contradiction and why is difficult. Plus people's thoughts fly around the screen while they're talking, which sometimes try to distract and/or prevent you from taking aim at a person's contradiction. Its quite interesting.\n\nOutside of that, before trials you'll do investigating, finding clues that you'll use as evidence during these trials. And ignoring that, there are also moments of "free time" where you just spend time exploring the school and building relationships with other members of the game's colorful cast of characters.\n\nDid I mention the characters are great? Because they are. Undoubtedly, you'll probably have a favorite character or two die, and maybe have a character or two that you loath, but surprisingly even characters you might not like you might like later on as the game progresses, because the characters DO grow and change over time, something I find very appreciatable. Its somewhat sad that this is a game about killing though; a lot of character development in a way goes to waste so to speak, as you'll just end up seeing such a character die. Still, this also means you'll care all the more when it happens, which I think strengthens this game. Which is good, because when you have a game that's as story oriented as this one, its important to have a strong cast of characters to follow and keep the story moving forward, all while throwing a few surprises in its midst, and that the game does.\n\nThe fact of the matter is is that this game has a really strong story, and its all well planned out and uses details all throughout the game even from the very start with regards the direction the story goes in. I might recommend that players pay attention to EVERYTHING that happens in the game, because it might come up later, even if you don't think it will. In that sense, the game is very well written, something that Spike Chunsoft has always been good about doing.\n\nDisregarding all that, I think its also worth noting that the art style is both unique and appealing and the soundtrack is pretty pimpin', full of fun drumbeats and synths and even the light incorporation of vocals in some tracks as instruments of their owns (not for singing). Its fun to listen to, and helps set the mood.\n\nAll in all, this is a great title and you really should try it out if you want.","February 27","true","33.0"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

Really, I just massivly enjoyed this game and I'm looking forward to more Danganronpa being released on steam!\n\nIf you need a murder mystery fix, want to see high schoolers kill each other, and enjoy a well-paced story, pick this game up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/413410/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Danganronpa, it's basically halfway between Phoenix Wright (murder mysteries and trials) and Zero Escape (trapped in a school, some horror elements, lots of death). Though the gameplay is decisively closer to Ace Attorney than Zero Escape, no escape-the-room puzzles here, one single story path, no real branching narrative choices. I'm fine with that though, since the story as-is is quite good, both the murder mysteries themselves (well, most of them) and the overarching story.\n\nThere's a few characters, however, that are not so good. Won't say which ones I dislike to prevent any spoilers, but it's pretty obvious that they're scrappy characters. Not a huge deal, there's still plenty of good characters here, and there has to be since the drama relies on tension, worrying about who's going to die next and all. And yes, your favorite character probably will die. Tough luck.\n\nOne thing this game has that neither AA or ZE has is the free-roaming movement in the school, which is a pretty nice way to get the player more immersed. Hope's Peak Academy feels like more of a real place than the ship in 999 or the various locations in Phoenix Wright because you get to see all of it, every last bit. The art style is also pretty nice, the paper-cutout characters and the colorful scenery.\n\nReally though, it's hard to say more without ruining the experience; definitely check it out if you're a visual novel fan, especially if you like mystery and intrigue.","March 11","true","47.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZoeAlexandria/recommended/413410/","ZoeAlexandria","Little Miss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZoeAlexandria/","96 products in account","It's a game that draws you into its world of crazy characters and pepto bismol blood and then makes you sad every time a character you dislike dies.\n\nDangan Ronpa is a Visual Novel game with more gameplay than you'd normally see from a visual novel. Each chapter is composed of 3 parts. You have your 'Normal School Days' your 'Abnormal School Days' and your 'Class Trials'. The first part is always more of a storytelling part. You walk around the school and watch/participate in predetermined events and sometimes you get free time to "hangout" with whichever character you want where you'll learn more about them and maybe unlock a cool ability. If you've read the actual game description it won't surprise you that at some point one of the students ends up dead. That is what triggers 'Abnormal School Days'. This part is mostly an investigation and also where the more gameplay elements start to peek its head out. Now you need to search around the school (specifically places pertaining to the incident) and find all of the evidence you can as well as a few testimonies. You can't really fail this part as the third part of the game won't trigger until you have all the evidence, but running around finding the pieces to the crime and trying to solve it as you go is always pretty cool. Then once you have all the pieces it is the 'Class Trial' part triggers where you get to set abilities (which are things you might have gathered through your free time events with other characters) and then you play a few different minigames to try and solve the case. You'll shoot people's wrong claims with bullets and then solve a few other word puzzles. Eventually you'll find the killer (or get a game over and have to try the class trial again) and that's the best part of the game. Their execution. The moment that you watch something super crazy pertaining to their character's title, come up and kill them...and then you feel bad because if you're like me your favorite character always dies first.\n\nYou do have to go back and do free time events after passing the game to 100% it because obviously the killed person and the killer in chapter one aren't going to be around long enough to finish both of their paths and you probably won't finish any character's story unless you happen to start with one of the ones who die closer to end game or survive until the end. But it's easy enough to get their free time events without replaying the whole game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to anybody who likes mystery, story based, visual novel, or darker games. Anybody who knows me will know I've been recommending this game since the fan translation came out and I even chose to get a PS Vita over a 3DS just for these games.\n\nAs a bit of history about this game, it was originally released in Japan in 2010. A few years later some guy played it and thought it was "the best thing since sliced bread" or at least thought it was good enough that he was willing to translate the whole game for us as if it was a movie script. He put the screenshot of their face to the left, what they said to the right. Translated the whole game for the western audience. Dangan Ronpa got a pretty big cult following and soon after got an anime (don't watch it follows the story plotline but very bare boned and 100% spoilers) and then an English translation.\n\nWhich it deserved. And the Steam port, which it really deserved (because seriously most people weren't going to buy a PS Vita just for Dangan Ronpa).\n\nThis game is the reason I really enjoy visual novels, a very interesting story, with some pretty fun blood and gore, it was easy to get attached to the characters even though they were all based on some over the top stereotypes. The gameplay was fun, the story was what really held me in.\n\nPros:\n-the cast is very lively\n-the executions after the class trials are a lot of fun\n-the blood looks like pepto bismol\n-the class trials are fun to play out\n-the art style is interesting compared to most of the other games we get from Japan\n-there will be trading cards and achievements\n\nCons:\n-you need to replay stuff to get all of the free time events\n-there is only one path the game takes so for most people there isn't a lot of replayability\n-your favorite character is going to die\n-Monokuma's voice in English is pretty weird (one of the few characters I only like their VO in Japanese)","February 18","true","35.3"," 55 of 83 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","55","83","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/likchan/recommended/413410/","likchan","LiK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/likchan/","730 products in account","Tested out this port and it plays fine. This is my review from the Vita version.\n\nSo do you like the Zero Escape series? How about the Persona series? Or how about the Ace Attorney series? Ever wondered what would happen if someone combined them together? It would be DanganRonpa, yo!\n\nThe story was simply incredible. It was full of twists and unexpected moments. You play as one character who is trapped in some weird school and must work with a cast of characters to escape. I won't get into details but there are also trials where you must win to survive. The main plot was simply riveting from beginning to end. What really grabbed me was how much risk it took with its characters and setting. You just never seem to know what will happen next. The game plays around with your expectations all the time. Even when I figured out who the suspect was or how someone was murdered, the game would throw in multiple curve balls to screw with you. It was a lot of fun and kept me entertained. I never got bored with any part of the game. I was sucked into its crazy world. Some of the things that happened was incredibly morbid and disturbing. It definitely made me felt uneasy at times. There is a lot of dark humor that some people will enjoy. When the game wanted to be funny, it was funny. When it wanted to creep you out, it was pretty darn creepy. So good.\n\nThe characters were incredibly diverse and fun. They took your typical archetypes and totally messed around with them. I was continually surprised at how well developed and written they were. Most of them weren't what you'd expect from how they looked. Although, there was one stereotypical geek/otaku/nerd fat guy who encompassed all the negative sides of that trope. At least he wasn't dumb, sorta. But anyways, I really liked most of the cast. Most of them were very smart and very clever. In fact, some of them are even smarter than your character which was refreshing. I need to point out that it was very bold of NIS America for them to keep the original Japanese names. They could have gone the other way and made up English names but they didn't. I liked that.\n\nThe dialogue between the characters were very well written. I have to give NIS America HUGE props for the localization. I was super duper impressed! The dialogue was extremely natural and flowed really well. It felt like how people would speak in real life if they were put in these situations. Even the jokes were super well written. The lewd jokes in particular were funny as hell. I'm not sure who was in charge of them but they were biting and insanely well timed. Hell, even the cursing felt right for whoever was saying it in their situations. I laughed out loud quite often. I also liked the multiple references to other games and other forms of pop culture. Some are quite subtle while others blatantly mention specific product brands and/or names of real world people. It's a bit jarring when that happens but they don't date the game or make it feel awkward. If it weren't for the strong translation, I don't think I would've liked the game as much as I did. So once again, kudos to NISA for a job well done.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely stunning all around. Both the 2D and 3D art are super colorful and sharp. The 2D character art in particular is gorgeous. The character designs themselves are very attractive and well defined. There are several art styles that pop up but they're all beautifully illustrated. The character sprites don't have actual animations like with the Ace Attorney series but they are well drawn and very expressive. The event art (the painted scenes) is stunning and the occasional pixel art is cute as hell. The 3D parts of the school are also beautiful and very detailed. The FMV scenes are a mix of 2D/3D and really interesting. I really love the look of this game.\n\nI also want to point out the gore in this game. The blood has been colored pink for some reason. I assume they were done to stylize the murder scenes or make it less gorey for anyone squeamish about blood in general. Personally, I think it took away some of the horror of the crime scenes. I wish there was a toggle for it. Just a minor gripe.\n\nThe audio was equally outstanding as the art. I loved all the music in this game. The trials in particular had several tracks which pumped me up. Great soundtrack all around. I also need to point out the English dub. IT WAS AWESOME. Yea, I'm not even exaggerating, it's just that good. The voices felt shaky at first when I started the game but they only got better and better as the game progressed. I didn't really fall in love until the first trial where it was fully voiced and you could really admire their performances. Everyone matched their roles and they did a great job making all these characters come to life. They read their lines with gusto. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have liked the characters as much as I did. I became a fan of several voice actors simply because of this game. There was one character that totally floored me with their performance in particular. I won't spoil who though. *grin* Once again, great job NIS America.\n\nOverall, DanganRonpa exceeded my expectations even with all the hype from its fans. I loved every minute of it and was compelled to keep playing all the way to the end. Great writing, great story, great characters and great VO with fantastic art and music. It's a complete package and anyone who's into games like the Zero Escape and Ace Attorney series MUST play this.

The visual presentation was well done, the music is catchy, the story I felt was well constructed and the trial mechanics make the game well worth playing. I felt a majority of the issues I had with the game such as the chore of collecting, how the screen can get convoluted and the monotony of School Life mode, was more or less me venting and if you don’t have a Vita or PSP, give the game on PC a shot (pun unintended). I have high hopes going into Danganronpa 2, so here’s hoping they can keep the momentum going.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group","February 25","true","25.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","2"

I will go into detail without spoiling anything so don't be scared to read this review.\n\nIn Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, you play as Makoto Naegi who has won a chance to become a student at the nation's school for the very best students in the country. In this school you'll find other students that excel in different things such as being a national idol or being the ultimate biker gang leader. With your fellow students you will have to uncover murders and go to a class trial where you all together have to come up with a decision to who you think is the killer.\n\nThe class trials are sort of like Phoenix Wright in a way? Just more dramatic.\n\nWhen you're not uncovering mysteries, you're hanging out with your fellow class mates. You can choose who to hang out with and uncover their story about them more and more. Maybe find yourself a waifu or husbando. You do get to walk around the school like...If you've played it, Hotel Dusk. Hanging out with certain characters can get you skills related to them that you can use in class trials.\n\nPros:\n1. Interesting characters.\n2. Good humor.\n3. Very good balance between reading and interactivity.\n4. A fun 'what-if' mode to play after you beat the game. Go after your waifu!\n5. Kyoko\n6. The music is great. I believe you get a soundtrack with remixes if you buy the game right now.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n1. There are a few typos in the game. Only a few and they may have been fixed now.\n2. Hanging out with students in the main game, doesn't exactly change anything in the story. I'm fine with this but I noticed some people were expecting something to change from hanging out with their waifu.\n3. There was a graphical error that I think has been fixed now?\n4. While I loved the game, it is a bit pricy for what it is...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI commend you if you read through my wall of text of a review. I hope you found it interesting and if you're curious about anything then be sure to simply ask.","February 27","true","31.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

It's hella sweet to see it on Steam and PC port is excellent :).\n\nIn the story you play as Makoto Naegi, who gets a lucky chance to join Hope's Peak Academy, a school for talented people. Once he enters there, well he quickly notices that the place is pretty different than what he thought... Danganronpa has very likeable and funny characters xD. The cast will notice quite soon to be part of a crazy and dark game of survival. This game of despair is lead by a mysterious nasty bear called Monokuma, who btw is one of the BEST villains ever haha :D! The only way to survive out of there is to kill another student, without others finding out that who did it.\n\nThe soundtrack is really awesome with many cool songs. During the game, there is fps-freeroam in certain areas around the school and you can have conversations with the other characters a lot, to get to know them better.\n\nOne of the highlights of the journey, are definitely moments called Class Trials. It's when you have to find out the murderer with the others, blaming and arguing against each other in intense word battles. Trying to find out the guilty one is never easy and I love this about DR. You have to search for clues and complete puzzles to clear them and the Trials can last for a long time. The game keeps you guessing and addicted to the end.\n\nI think it took me about 30-40h hours to clear this on first time on PSVita, but it's been a while so I can't remember exactly and it does has replay value. A very nice bonus is that there is also the option to choose between English and Japanese voice acting, personally I looooove the Japanese VA it's WONDERFUL :D.\n\nThis journey will make you laugh, feel sad, surprised and care about the lovely, crazy characters.\nEveryone should definitely play this and Danganronpa 2 if can, because I think Danganronpa 3 releases this year and because Monokuma is beary awesome :).","February 18","true","35.9"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

The writing captivates and, while at times can seem unreasonable, positions characters against each other in unique ways. Some crimes seem thought out, meticulous, astute; others feel organic, sput of the moment, and honest.

It's p. damn good!\n\nGot introduced to this game when Onenronen started the quite legendary thread on Something Awful where he translated the game for his screenshot LP. At the time it was literally the only way to experience the game in any translated form and it did gain quite a huge cult following, thanks to Tumblr's involvement etc, and this eventually attracted Spike Chunsoft's attention and they eventually decided to release the game in the west.\n\nNow, few years later, I'm getting to play this game on Steam and having first hand experience with this small web phenomenon that I was checking up multiple times a week for many, many months... And the game's tight. Definetly recommend using the japanese audio instead of the english one, as the english one's pretty damn cheesy, and you will miss some quite notable voice actors - for example Shinji's VA from NGE is voicing the protagonist in this game, and the old lady who voices Doraemon does actually do VA work for Monokuma, that's quite a fresh and unexcepted from her, really fitting though!\n\nPlaying on controller, it might look or control a bit clunky at first, considering this was originally a PSP game, but other than that it works fine. Only had one crash and that was due to too much alt tabbing for matter of hours and it eventually didn't like that.\n\nBut yeah. Very fresh 'n quirky art direction (jeesh the cutscenes in this game!), music is fantastic and while the characterisation is bit tropey at times, the writing saves a lot and this game packs quite a bunch of twists and mystery for you to untangle 'n experience.\n\nI'd say give it a shot definetly if you dig murder mysteries and visual novels.

The Game is like a mix between the Phoenix Wright series and some "horror" elements from Corpse Party although not as graphic. It is a Visual Novel so you will be doing Alot of reading.\n\nThe only thing I found bad was using the mouse to navigate the menus (having to use mouse wheel to go up/down without using keyboard felt akward) but understandable as the gameplay section involves moving in a first person perspective, this gameplay element is also the reason for your mouse being locked to the window unless you alt+tab or close the game (even in windowed mode)\n\nAlthough it might seem pointless for a Visual Novel, it does run 1080p 60fps, the resolution upscaling is impressive without any (or little loss) in the quality dispite originally being on the psp's small handheld screen. Many options for window sizes and other graphic options.\n\nIf you have watched the anime already play this anyway trust me, its a much better experience and in my honest opinion much more enjoyable as nothing is left out (anime just kinda skips "little" details and skips right to the point)\n\nIf you dont watch anime I still recommend this game if you like the mystery/murder solving genre although liking anime may (or may not) make the experience more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all a great addition to your library and the good news is if you find yourself wanting more, Spike Chunsoft has already confirmed the Sequel: Danganronpa 2:Goodbye Despair to release on April 18th 2016!\n\nTL;DR Its Good buy it!","March 20","true","26.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There is much thought put into Danganronpa's story, as it is very fascinating in it's murder mystery plot and dark humor. If point an click adventure/visual novels are your thing, along with an Ace Attorney style court drama where you present evidence and do fun little mini games is exciting to you, then I recommend this game to you. It even has an optional "dating sim" type mode called free time where you can unlock more about each character to find out their information and backstory. They may seem like stereotypical tropes at first, but later on you find there's more layers to who they are and you'll get very invested. Again, if this type of game is your thing, then I highly recommend this experience to you and guaruntee it's worth your time and money.","May 4","true","38.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

That's about all there is to say. The plot of this game is gripping and paced excellently. Each character you meet is well written with their own quirks and personality traits, and you care about all of them. This is what makes the game so tense; you don't know which of your friends is going to die next. One day you could be talking to them in the laundry room and the next moment you find their body at the scene of some horrible murder. It's a grim experience, made even more so by the presence of Monokuma's insanity.\n\nThe gameplay itself is logic based, requiring you to listen to what each character has to say and work out the events of the crime. The mechanics whilst in the "class trial" sections of the game can be a little clunky at times, but it's still a highly satisfying experience. Finding that contradiction you've been struggling on for a little while fills you with a great sense of pride and the tension of what's going to happen next makes these segments highly enjoyable.\n\nThe sound design of the game is what I have the highest praise for. I've been listening to playlists of it's soundtrack since the game came out and every time Monokuma's damn theme hits I can't help but grin a little bit and sing along. Each piece of music is very well implemented and fitting for the moment, and the voice work is believable and well delivered.\n\nThis game is an experience, a pretty damn fun one at that, and if you enjoy cute anime girls getting murdered in brutal fashion, it should be right up your street.","February 21","true","34.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

The review might not be that good since it's my first one, so... Let's go down to business!\nThere won't be any spoilers on this review regarding any DR game, so you can read it without fear.\n\nThe Danganronpa titles are my favorite VN titles, having played it the first game thrice and both Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair and Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls and also planning to play them again when they get released on Steam.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc isn't a normal VN where you only have to read and pick options to lead you on a certain route, it has some gameplay that you don't really see on VNs, it basically has the School Life mode where you interact with other students and where you see the story progressing normaly, the Free Time[/spoiler] mode where you "take a break" and hang out with other studens and learn more about them and unlock useful skills that you need later on, the Investigation where you must find clues to uncover the culprit/killer of the victim who was murdered. The Class Trial takes place after you're done investigating the crime scene, there, you must put all the clues and hints together and try to narrow down the path to find the culprit who killed to victim, at least for me, that was the funnest part of the game.\n\nGameplay10/10\n\nThe gameplay is very good, specially the Class Trial with fun mini-games such as the Nonstop Debate, Hangman Gambit, Bullet Time Battle and Closing Argument. I highly recommend playing the game on Mean difficulty to enjoy more of them (don't worry, the PC controls are far easier to manage than the PS Vita ones!). The game also has a "free roam" mode where you can freely explore Hope's Peak Academy and even try your luck with the Monomono Machine to try and earn gifts for your fellow students.\n\n\nStory10/10\n\nI can't go into much details for spoilers' sake but the story is extremely well written, as the game moves forward you get more and more curious about the Academy and your fellow students, the games makes a good balance by giving hints and making itself more mysterious and having a very satisfying climax and ending. Although the game has a dark atmosphere it *will* provide you with some good laughter here and there, when Danganronpa tries to be funny, it manages to be really funny!\n\n\nSoundtrack10/10\n\nMasafumi Takada did an excellent job with the game's OST, every song fits perfectly well with the game's atmosphere, may it be during tense moments, funny moments and hype moments, I really recommend getting the game with the OST bundle.\n\nGraphics10/10\n\nThe graphics might be simple but on my honest opinion they fit the game really well even though the characters during the "free roam" mode are basically one-dimensional. The CGs are well drawn and the artstyle is unique, something that the official anime took it off.\n\nCharacters9/10\n\nAll the characters are very unique with very distinctive personalities, whoever some of them are kind of bland, whoever most of them will get a nice development over time and you may or may not be attached to some of them and fall into despair if your favorite one gets killed, be sure to invest your time on your favorite ones before something bad happens to them, upupu!\n\nFinal Score9.5 out of 10\n\nAs I said in the beginning, Danganronpa is a very unique Visual Novel with awesome gameplay features, it's definitely worth a shot if you enjoy mystery games, Danganronpa will deliver what you want!\nDo I recommend the game? Hell yes!","February 22","true","200.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexmax/recommended/413410/","alexmax","[UD]AlexMax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexmax/","281 products in account","I quite enjoyed this game.\n\nSomething you should know up front about this game, however, is that part of the enjoyment comes from the surprise you get when playing it.  And people are especially terrible at keeping the secrets of this game...secret.  If you have any interest in playing the game, I highly recommend steering clear of discussion forums, comment sections, YouTube thumbnails, Wikis and even other Steam reviews.  Imageboards are also a no-go, spoilers will show up in /v/ threads even when you're not looking for them.\n\nIn any case, the game is a "Whodunit" visual novel in the vein of games like Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape.  The conceit of the game is spelled out in its Steam store page, so I won't repeat it here, but if you've never played those types of games before, the experience is much like reading a good Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot murder mystery, except you play as the detective from a first-person perspective.\n\nThat's not to say that it's just a read-along story - this game gives you some autonomy.   In between murders and major story beats, you can choose to hang out with any of the remaining students and try to get to know them better.  But when a student is murdered, you also have examine the scene of the crime yourself, gathering as much evidence as you can by looking around the various crime scenes, and then debate with your remaining fellow students over "whodunit" during the class trial.  The debates are where most of the actual gameplay comes in - you must suss out contradictions in your fellow students statements based on your knowledge of the case though a variety of mini-games.\n\nThese games are kind of famous for having absolutely crazy stories with lots of twists, and this game doesn't disappoint.  There were a few things that I figured out ahead of my player character, but just as many things took me completely by surprise, a few even catching me completely me off guard.  The game is not short - Steam says it took me about 27 hours start to finish, but I was so fixated on the mysteries of the plot that those 27 hours flew by.\n\nThe art-style might lead you to believe that the game is aimed at anime or JRPG fans, but I enjoyed the story despite not being either - there were one or two scenes that were kinda "fancervice", but not enough to detract from the overall game.  The soundtrack is fantastic too.\n\nIf you're still not sure if you would enjoy this game or not, what I would recommend is reading or watching¹ a Let's Play of the game.  Reading or watching up to the end of the first chapter should be enough to tell you if this is the kind of game you would enjoy or not - there is enough to tantalize, but no major plot threads are resolved, leaving you to experience the best parts of the game yourself.\n\n¹ If you're watching, be careful to avoid spoilers in YouTube comments or thumbnails, and also ensure you're watching a play-through of the US PSVita or Steam release, so you get fully voiced class trials.","May 3","true","27.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

A friend introduced me to the series years ago and now having played through the game multiple times on PSP and Vita I developed a strong liking to the characters and the story that was developing over multiple games. That being said this games story can be slightly predictable and can sometimes fall into obvious mystery clichés that could deter some from continuing onward with your school life. I urge you to stick with it as this game gets deeper as the story goes on and does a few original things that I haven't seen done in other mystery style games or books. The characters are the driving force of this game though and they all have interesting quirks to go along with them. Most players will probably find themselves liking some characters and disliking some others for varying reasons although I believe that each character is extremely well written and have their own unique characteristics that make the interactions between them fun.\nNext we have the gameplay which revolves around three distinct sections. Free time allows you to interact with characters and give them gifts much like in a dating sim. Each time you interact with them during this period and give them a gift that they like, they will tell you more about themselves. If you do this enough with any one character you get a skill to help you during the class trials. Next comes the investigation mode in whioch you search the school for clues in order to solve the mystery of whodunit and piece together the mystery of the school and its inhabitants. Finally we have the class trials in which you do several puzzles that lead to the eventual solution to the case. Most of the puzzles  are fairly simple so you may want to play on a harder difficulty from the beginning in order to get a more challenging experience although it does get a bit more challenging in the later trials.\nTLDR: I would highly recommend this game but be sure to not have it spoiled for you before you play it and be ready for a healthy dose of reading.","February 21","true","7.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game itself is a visual novel with a little mix of social elements (kinda like two latest persona games) and Logic Debates (much like Ace Attorney court phases). You might not expect this from screenshots, but the game has a dark, sinister atmosphere, dont be fooled by its appearance.\n\nSpeaking of appearance, it has unique graphic style, characters and enviromment kinda "unfolding" themselves, looks pretty cool. Music is nice, especially main theme, helps a lot to build a suspense. Game comes bundled with soundtrack for now too. Voice actors did truly amazing job, bring life to characters (especially Japanese voicover, the best imo, but English did a decent acting as well).\n\nAlso game is pretty lenthy, expect 20+ hours at the very least, prepare for a LOT of text! Took me probably twice longer though, hehe.\n\nAlso last but not least, by buying this game you are supporting developers and may encourage them to bring more of their titles to steam. Titles like Zero Escape series! So you might consider to get this even if you already finished game on vita :)\n\nOverall, this is TOTALLY worth its price, you get a long game with intresting story and bright characters.","February 18","true","37.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You get invited to go to a highschool named "Hope's Peak Academy." But soon after you arrive, you realize that you-- and the other students-- are trapped inside the school. The only way to leave is by "graduating." And in order to graduate: you must get away with murder.\n\nLike I said, very fun game. My favorite part is definitely the class trials in which you and the other students go over clues in a case to try and find out who killed the victim. The class trials are pretty long but very fun.\n\nThe story and music are both great and I really love the art style. The Japanese voice acting is great as well (I didn't use English VA because I don't really like it). Also, there's quite a colorful cast of characters and I don't think there's one character that I dislike. (Kyoko = best girl)\n\nUnfortunately, I had already seen the anime series before playing the game so I pretty much knew who died.

If you thought Ace Attorney was full of great macabre humor, then you'll love Danganronpa as well. This game takes the macabre humor of Ace Attorney and pushes it to its limits by killing off your friends rather than someone you've never met before. I haven't felt this invested in a story in a long time so I've been playing this every chance I get until I finish the game.\n\nAnyway, the story is genuinely creepy with its mature themes combined with Japanese weirdness and its amazing soundtrack that never fails to keep the atmosphere tense. I highly recommend you try Danganronpa even if you don't like visual novels. Don't compare this to all those crappy "dating sims" you've seen on the Steam store for the past couple of years.

Saw it was released on Friday, purchased it and now my weekend just vanished. I enjoyed the game a lot - the characters were (mostly) all very interesting, the music was alright but fit the atmosphere well, the artstyle was very interesting even though it appeared low quality at first, and the plot progression was solid to the point where I never felt uninterested what would happen next.\n\nMy few complaints are that the game really holds your hand a lot (especially if you aren't playing on the hardest difficulty where it still does it anyways), giving you heaps of hints. At some point it felt like I almost didn't need to try myself to solve the mystery because of how many hints were being given directly to you by other characters. Also, if you've read mystery novels, you may see certain twists coming a mile away that may ruin the experience a bit, but despite all this I still overall enjoyed it.","February 21","true","30.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

This game is good to put it shortly. I will rank it on Gameplay, Story, Graphics, and Sound.\n\nStory: You are Makoto Naegi, a normal/average boy who got accepted into Hopes Peak Academy with the title of Super High School Luckster. You enter the academy and suddenly your vision goes black. you wake up in a classroom and meet the other students. During the confusion, a Black and White Bear arrives, calling itself Monokuma. The bear then tells the students that the only way to leave is to kill another classmate witout getting caught. While the format and basis for the plot feels very "edgy" it works well. the writers work these students into this out of this world experience very well. Combine that with the trials, which are very intresting and keep you engaged. It overall a good story, and highlight of the game.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is a combination of a visual novel and mystery game. You interact and hang out with students to learn more about them, and then the mystery  you search for clues in the school to find the murderer. Trials are almost half of the game, and this where you put all of your evidence to the test in finding out who the killer is. these segment can be at least an hour to two hours at some points. During the trials are minigames that i wont go into detail with, such as nonstop debates and panic talk. The gameplay is okay. It controls well, but not perfectly which can lead to mistakes that are not your own. the gameplay can also drag on for a while, as the game itself does.\n\nVisuals: Danganronpa takes things in an artstyle pleasing to the eye, with many character designs either fitting the character, look good, or both. the enviroments are a bit dark at certian points which can be bothersome. However, the most different change is the "Pink Blood" in which everyone has pink blood instead of red. It is really dumb and an excuse to make it so that teens could play it, which is very idiotic.\n\nSound: Voice Acting, especially in english, can feel very dull at points. While some have good performance, others feel like they put no effort into it, which is heart breaking. The OST is okay, with some good tracks, bad tracks, but mostly average tracks that may or may not fit the situation. This is easily the weakest part of the game.\n\nOverall Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a good game, with fantasic visuals and story, with okay gameplay and sound. I'd reccomend you get at a sale if you can, $30 is a bit too much.","February 18","true","41.1"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HashtagNiceShirt/recommended/413410/","HashtagNiceShirt","Nyxeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HashtagNiceShirt/","98 products in account","Danganronpa is, in simplest terms, a colorful murder mystery. Full of suspense, secrets to unravel, and mild horror elements. The characters are almost theatrically over-the-top and some are purposefully unlikeable, but just as many of them grew on me during the year I spent watching, reading, and playing anything Danganronpa related. They're an eclectic lot and some are drawn up in a tongue-in-cheek way. Those characters are perhaps a more polarizing aspect of this title.\n\nThe methods of interaction (interestingly, a first person exploration perspective) and day-by-day gameplay remind me vaguely of the Persona series (an RPG series, though Danganronpa is purely an adventure game with strong visual novel segments.) I was continually impressed by the quality of the writing. It is not as sophisticated as that of 999, but very engrossing. The trial scenes which are somewhat reminiscent of the Ace Attorney series are hectic and experiment with a variety of gameplay styles.\n\nThe only downside of note is also something of an upside. After beating the main story, a bonus minigame is unlocked called School Mode. I loved this little thing, it’s a simple but lengthy simulation game which involves collecting and crafting in order to level up characters and attain hidden scenes with them- as well as “clean up” interactions that you might have missed during the main game. My only problem with that minigame is that it is designed to be played multiple times in order to get all the various endings and character dialogue. Some of this material, I feel, should have been integrated into the main story instead of hidden in the late game of a surprisingly deep bonus minigame. If your interest in the story and characters is at the same level as my own, I highly recommend pursuing that to 100% completion.\n\nThe visual design really stands out- the backgrounds, the little cut-scenes, they have a twisted fantasy storybook quality that I rarely see. The characters are a bizarre lot, but well-drawn and reasonably emotive. The style of them will not be everyone’s cup of tea, but easy to adjust to given the length of this game. The music is sublime, I would seriously recommend even just the soundtrack to everybody, and certainly anyone who is an avid enthusiast of game music.\n\nWhat makes this game such a crazy perfect fit for me is that along with the eclectic art style and rousing music, I found the gameplay to be crazy addictive and storyline very hard to put down. A few of the trials seem to drag a bit, but the game only gets better and better. The last quarter or so of it was so hard to tear away from. Overall, very easy to recommend.","February 21","true","119.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What minor bugs existed at launch have since been patched by the very attentive porting team at Abstraction Games. This wasn't just some port-and-forget job, and you can tell as much by how vigilantly the developers monitor the community forums.\nUnfortuantely, you only have the option to choose between M+KB and controller controls, with no way to rebind either. I personally don't mind this so much because I found both control schemes to be very comfortable (and Danganronpa feels like a game made for M+KB), but it's worth mentioning anyways for the people who care. At the end of the day this is basically a visual novel, so you won't have to worry about your KtD ratio going down the gutter.\nAs for the game itself... without giving too much away, Danganronpa is a mystery game. If you enjoy critical thinking and whodunnits, you're right at home playing this. Even if the genre is unfamiliar to you, DR's quirky characters, unique art design, and catchy music should be more than enough to reel you into its exotic, hopeless universe. A definite buy.","February 26","true","45.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/recommended/413410/","strider_rider","Strider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/","105 products in account","Hope's Peak Academy is the top tier high school of Japan where every student aspires to go, the students are hand picked by the school categorizing them as the best of their fields, except for your own character Naegi who only got in by chance (like his talent for entry literally is just being lucky). Except when he sets foot into the school he blacks out and finds out he's locked in. Danganronpa is a "whodunnit" murder mystery game set in a high school where students are forced to kill each other under coercion by the headmaster - an evil teddy bear through motives and incentives, without being found out in order to "graduate" and leave the school or be confined within the walls of the school until the day they die. Following the murders, an investigation period is allowed where the other students will have to find evidence to use against the culprit during the class trial, where a debate among the students is held to present evidence who the culprit was. The class trial ends when the culprit is found guilty or otherwise, if so the culprit is executed, otherwise the rest of their "class" is executed and they are allowed to leave.\n\nIn terms of the story and the overall concept, I think the game does very well in those departments. It's usually never long between every murder, so the paranoia you may have against your fellow students is ever present. However, the story is actually very linear, resulting in most interactions during trials having only one correct answer and investigation periods never end until you have found every single piece of evidence you were supposed to come across. There are slow days in between every murder of course where nobody has attempted to kill anybody yet, during these days, you are given "free time" to go and talk to your classmates and get to know them better. In addition to just conversing with your classmates, you are allowed to give them gifts which help progress your friendship and earn the rewards such as skill points or skills to use during class tirlas. These kind of play out like what one would expect from a virtual novel or dating sim (I suppose?), but do not have any effect on the character's disposition towards you outside of these sessions. Either way, you will have to sway your classmates to trust you during the class trials as Naegi is usually the first suspect during any murder for whatever reason.\n\nYour classmates are vastly different from each other as their expertise lies in different fields and thus can present some very interesting (or very annoying) personalities. As per the anime tradition, some of these fall into some typical stereotypes like the fat anime nerd, the japanese biker with the weird pompadour hair (why does this always prevail), the small petite loli girl, including your own character being the soft-spoken protagonist (outside of class trials). Your classmates include a stellar cast of Japanese voice actors such as Megumi Ogata (Shinji Ikari from Evangelion), Akira Ishida (also from Evangelion, Kaworu), Takahiro Sakurai (X from Megaman, Cloud from Final Fantasy), Kappei Yamaguchi (Ranma from Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha), Yoko Hikasa (Mio from K-ON!). the headliner Noboyo Oyama (Doraemon!!!) and others! You won't get to know them all because they'll die, but you'll know them well enough through the free time events! (Byakuya Togami is my favorite, arrogant rich boy persona and all, but he's not coddled or ignorant) The game's story does build on the characters and unfortunately most of them won't survive, be prepared to lose favorites and learn to not hate your least favorites so much.\n\nThe game allows you to walk in 3D around the school when going from place to place (not in the rooms themselves though), the backgrounds are extremely 2D despite this and may actually not have anything visually aesthetic to look at most of the time. The character models are also purely 2D, so if you were to tilt your camera angle in any direction they would appear like cardboard cutouts. It threw me off a little at first but in the end I paid it no mind. It's an interesting style really, the backgrounds of rooms and such drop in and come together when you enter, like a pop up book unfolding. Character art is good enough, nothing that sticks out very much but nothing that is underwhelming. There is an unlockable gallery that allows you to unlock character art and other art, I assume this is a typical visual novel feature but some of the art is pretty cool. I'm not sure how much emphasis virtual novels place on their music but Danganronpa has an unlockable gallery with music, so I would assume it's proud of its music. No doubt the music is impressive, the game goes on for a pretty long period of time but I didn't get tired of the music at all. During your class trials, the music is a bit more upbeat to emphasize the action part of this game and it does that well enough.\n\nDuring the class trial sessions, you are presented various mini games that you will have to answer correctly in order to advance to the next stage, most of these are 2D shooting ones where you aim for sentences with inconsistencies or contradictions using your "truth bullets" (evidence). There are multiple sentences that can appear highlighted and you must match your shot to the right one. As I have mentioned since these have only one correct answer and the bullet graphic can only fit so many words, the usage of the bullets and where you shoot them is entirely up to interpretation and can get pretty frustrating especially when you figured out the mystery yourself. During this session, when you are presented your bullets you should read them over again to understand how to use them. Other games you are up against are a game of hangman, a rhythm game involving your argument against your classmate where you will have to follow the tempo of their statements and shoot them down, and a picture puzzle of sorts that summarizes the case all of which include an element of mystery and puzzle which you would still have to solve. The case summary picture puzzle is actually presented with manga art (which looks very good tbh) and presentation, so don't forget to go from right to left! During all of these games, you start out with 5 lives with a skill to add on another 5, answering any of these wrongly result in a loss of a single life, however answering correctly may also restore a portion of your lives back.\n\nLast but not least is the localization, I suppose the text translation over to English is not terrible. There are some things I read in the direction translation by the author of the LP of this game some 3 years back that are apparently completely lost in translation such as references to Japanese culture and lifestyle and honorifics that some of the characters use to refer to others which would be hard to translate into English. But it's not entirely a 4kids butchering of the text, so on that note the game does okay in terms of translation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/recommended/413410/","strider_rider","Strider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strider_rider/","105 products in account","Hope's Peak Academy is the top tier high school of Japan where every student aspires to go, the students are hand picked by the school categorizing them as the best of their fields, except for your own character Naegi who only got in by chance (like his talent for entry literally is just being lucky). Except when he sets foot into the school he blacks out and finds out he's locked in. Danganronpa is a "whodunnit" murder mystery game set in a high school where students are forced to kill each other under coercion by the headmaster - an evil teddy bear through motives and incentives, without being found out in order to "graduate" and leave the school or be confined within the walls of the school until the day they die. Following the murders, an investigation period is allowed where the other students will have to find evidence to use against the culprit during the class trial, where a debate among the students is held to present evidence who the culprit was. The class trial ends when the culprit is found guilty or otherwise, if so the culprit is executed, otherwise the rest of their "class" is executed and they are allowed to leave.\n\nIn terms of the story and the overall concept, I think the game does very well in those departments. It's usually never long between every murder, so the paranoia you may have against your fellow students is ever present. However, the story is actually very linear, resulting in most interactions during trials having only one correct answer and investigation periods never end until you have found every single piece of evidence you were supposed to come across. There are slow days in between every murder of course where nobody has attempted to kill anybody yet, during these days, you are given "free time" to go and talk to your classmates and get to know them better. In addition to just conversing with your classmates, you are allowed to give them gifts which help progress your friendship and earn the rewards such as skill points or skills to use during class tirlas. These kind of play out like what one would expect from a virtual novel or dating sim (I suppose?), but do not have any effect on the character's disposition towards you outside of these sessions. Either way, you will have to sway your classmates to trust you during the class trials as Naegi is usually the first suspect during any murder for whatever reason.\n\nYour classmates are vastly different from each other as their expertise lies in different fields and thus can present some very interesting (or very annoying) personalities. As per the anime tradition, some of these fall into some typical stereotypes like the fat anime nerd, the japanese biker with the weird pompadour hair (why does this always prevail), the small petite loli girl, including your own character being the soft-spoken protagonist (outside of class trials). Your classmates include a stellar cast of Japanese voice actors such as Megumi Ogata (Shinji Ikari from Evangelion), Akira Ishida (also from Evangelion, Kaworu), Takahiro Sakurai (X from Megaman, Cloud from Final Fantasy), Kappei Yamaguchi (Ranma from Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha), Yoko Hikasa (Mio from K-ON!). the headliner Noboyo Oyama (Doraemon!!!) and others! You won't get to know them all because they'll die, but you'll know them well enough through the free time events! (Byakuya Togami is my favorite, arrogant rich boy persona and all, but he's not coddled or ignorant) The game's story does build on the characters and unfortunately most of them won't survive, be prepared to lose favorites and learn to not hate your least favorites so much.\n\nThe game allows you to walk in 3D around the school when going from place to place (not in the rooms themselves though), the backgrounds are extremely 2D despite this and may actually not have anything visually aesthetic to look at most of the time. The character models are also purely 2D, so if you were to tilt your camera angle in any direction they would appear like cardboard cutouts. It threw me off a little at first but in the end I paid it no mind. It's an interesting style really, the backgrounds of rooms and such drop in and come together when you enter, like a pop up book unfolding. Character art is good enough, nothing that sticks out very much but nothing that is underwhelming. There is an unlockable gallery that allows you to unlock character art and other art, I assume this is a typical visual novel feature but some of the art is pretty cool. I'm not sure how much emphasis virtual novels place on their music but Danganronpa has an unlockable gallery with music, so I would assume it's proud of its music. No doubt the music is impressive, the game goes on for a pretty long period of time but I didn't get tired of the music at all. During your class trials, the music is a bit more upbeat to emphasize the action part of this game and it does that well enough.\n\nDuring the class trial sessions, you are presented various mini games that you will have to answer correctly in order to advance to the next stage, most of these are 2D shooting ones where you aim for sentences with inconsistencies or contradictions using your "truth bullets" (evidence). There are multiple sentences that can appear highlighted and you must match your shot to the right one. As I have mentioned since these have only one correct answer and the bullet graphic can only fit so many words, the usage of the bullets and where you shoot them is entirely up to interpretation and can get pretty frustrating especially when you figured out the mystery yourself. During this session, when you are presented your bullets you should read them over again to understand how to use them. Other games you are up against are a game of hangman, a rhythm game involving your argument against your classmate where you will have to follow the tempo of their statements and shoot them down, and a picture puzzle of sorts that summarizes the case all of which include an element of mystery and puzzle which you would still have to solve. The case summary picture puzzle is actually presented with manga art (which looks very good tbh) and presentation, so don't forget to go from right to left! During all of these games, you start out with 5 lives with a skill to add on another 5, answering any of these wrongly result in a loss of a single life, however answering correctly may also restore a portion of your lives back.\n\nLast but not least is the localization, I suppose the text translation over to English is not terrible. There are some things I read in the direction translation by the author of the LP of this game some 3 years back that are apparently completely lost in translation such as references to Japanese culture and lifestyle and honorifics that some of the characters use to refer to others which would be hard to translate into English. But it's not entirely a 4kids butchering of the text, so on that note the game does okay in terms of translation. Though there are some parts that might not seem especially impressive because of the lack of emphasis in the English definitions. Some other things also irk me such as replacing the Japanese text on the graphics into English with a very poor choice of font in some cases, hand written notes for example where the text looks plain awful or others that probably don't look as aesthetically pleasing like outside the bathhouse putting the word "BATH" in the dullest font you can imagine where the Japanese calligraphy should be.

When they say that the game adds so much more character devolpment than the anime, they are 100% right and in NO WAY should anime be a substitute for the game!\n\nTo say Danganronpa is a visual novel is an understatement. I mean it is, but there is so much interaction than simply reading and making choices. The Danganronpa franchaise is a mystery itself, still being unraveled by the community (or at least the English part, anyways). If you've ever played 999 or Zero's Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, you will very much like DR:THH.\n\nDanganronpa is a cross between Battle Royale (if you haven't seen it, I recommmend it) and Pheonix Wright (again, I recommend the series). The included summary of this game on its store page is pretty much all you need to know without spoiling anything. I would HIGHLY recommend you play with the Japanese audio since, in my opinion, the English is like nails on a chalkboard, especially Monokuma's.\n\nOverall, I'm incredibly happy this got a PC port and I'm thrilled to play it on my Steam Link!

Easily in my top 10 games of all time. I don't think I've ever wanted to buy a game for every single person I know, quite like this one. It's like a Visual Novel mix and mash of Phoenix Wright, Persona, and its own variations and quirks on the genre. At first I thought the twists and cases would end up predictable, but once you get through the first case (basically an unlabeled tutorial case) things get way crazy, and crazier and twistier as you progress through the game.\n\nI thought the 5-10 minute choice timers were a bit on the long side until some of the later cases where I really had to sit there and think about it and work it out in my head for fear of losing one of my precious hearts.\n\nBasically, the more hours that you spend in this game, the more you will love it. It only gets better. On top of that, most people consider the 2nd game (coming out on steam as well, by the say) an improvement over the first and I can't even wrap my brain around that because I am totally in love with this game.\n\nAlso, the music is pretty dang boopin. The OST included is typical of an OST accompanied release, it's missing a lot of the songs, so you'll have to find your favorites elsewhere, but wow they NAILED the soundtrack here.\n\nI'm sad that steam only lets me give one thumbs up and not two.","February 24","true","33.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Peli on tosin ollut jo niin pitkään ulkona toisilla alustoilla että todennäköisesti tiedät vähintään jotain siitä tai pystyt helposti löytämään siitä informaatiota joten en kuluta aikaa sen kehumiseen.\n\nPorttaustyö on niin hyvä että kaikki valitukseni on syynäämistä (ei dualshock nappeja, näppäinprompeissa on aliasointia, ei näppäinten uudelleenasetusta, hiirellä on ongelmia objektien katsomisessa verrattuna ohjaimeen, 60 FPS lukko, Vita tyylinen tallennus arial fontilla ja ilman animaatioita, etc.) ja tottakai koska peli oli aiemmin PSP ja Vita yksinoikeus se näkyy osassa pelin elementeissä, mutta ei yhtään mitään järkyttävää.\nPäivitin PCGW artikkelin sisältämään kaiken informaation: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Danganronpa:_Trigger_Happy_Havoc","February 18","true","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For starters it's in 1080p though it seems to be upscaled from the Vita resolution of 960x544. Despite that it still looks excellent with settings maxed (and it's really not a taxing game)\n\nThe other benefit is that it runs at a smooth 60fps over the Vita's 30fps. Not entirely necessary for a game of this type but it just makes the whole experience that little bit smoother and enjoyable.\n\nSo get out there, solve some murder mysteries and try not to let the despair get to you!","February 18","true","8.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

First, the characters are fascinating, but a bit exaggerated at times. This shouldn't be a problem for anyone who watches a lot of anime, but it may annoy some people. They develop well over the course of the game. Second, there is not much "gameplay" to speak of. The game falls more in line with an adventure title where you interact with the environment on a pretty basic level and talk with the characters.\n\nIf those things didn't deter you, then you should give this game a shot. It's hard to explain much without possibly spoiling what makes the game so great. As mentioned previously, the characters are original (albeit still a bit exaggerated) and are much deeper than they may first appear. The mystery takes many twists and turns that kept me playing, and when I wasn't playing I was thinking about it. Even after completing it I will probably still be thinking about it up until the sequel gets released on Steam in April.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.","March 17","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pop up backgrounds and furniture were an interesting concept, however rotating the screen around got tedious after a while, and really just became a nuisance.\n\nThe audio is pretty good too. Not much to comment there, cause it's all original, but I like it all.\n\nThe character models and personalities are fantastic. Each character has a distinct personality to them. No 2 characters are alike.(Well, maybe a couple here and there, but the majority aren't). It goes to show that even though someone may look like something on the outside, on the inside, they can be an entirely different person.\n\nFinally, the gameplay. A lot like Phoenix Wright, because you go to different areas, finding clues (Truth Bullets) and Testimonies (Accounts). In between trials, you get free time, which you can use to bond with the other characters. But choose wisely, because you never know if the person you bond with will be the next one to be killed...I got lucky and that never happened :3.\n\nAfter someone has been murdered and you found all the clues, you go on to a class trial. The one main problem I have with this is that there are WAAAAAAAAAY too many components. The first trial, it's basic. Testimonies, counters, proof, account of what happened. Then during the next ones, you get a bunch of added difficult things that block the easy path, which REALLY gets confusing after a while. However, after you get used to it, the challenge is actually amusing and fun. So I guess it's not really that bad after all.\n\nThe plot is...mindblowing. It's like something expected, however with a bunch of other twists and turns that will leave you shocked and aspired. Well worth the 33$.\n\nAll in all, this is a great port of a great game. I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes Phoenix Wright, or just likes law.\n\nSolid 9.75/10. Couple tidbits here and there, but overall, amazing.\n\nCan't wait for the next one!

That's when my brother bought the game for me as a birthday present- and after playing through it I can say it is worth every penny he spent.\n\n100% Achievements for this game took me roughly 45 hours. Forgetting that this is a port for PC and focusing solely on the game itself here- it is in depth, very cleverly written, and for anyone who didn't watch the anime when it came out (which I did ;_; ) then the plot twists are unforseeable and exciting.\n\nI love the artwork for this game, especially the animated cutscenes. That and the vast amount of character expressions and sound effects- and just the amount of text in general, it really shows why the game file is as large as it is. A LOT of work obviously went in to this game, and I think that's something that is lacking in a lot of todays games, VNs especially.\n\nOnly a few complaints here to be made by me; as others have pointed out, each class trial takes 2-3 hours (reading speed and decision making skill dependant), and I couldn't see an option to save midway through a trial? At one point I had sat for an hour in a trial and realised it was time to go to work, but of course couldn't save. So I closed my laptop and hoped for the best when I returned. This brings me on to my second problem- it would appear that leaving the game stationary for a couple of hours can freeze it. I took a nap while playing on my first few days of owning the game too- on waking up the game was frozen and I'd lost an hour and a halfs progress.\n\nThe school mode feature at the end was a nice touch... It game me a chance to wind down from the fast pace of the main story and bid my farewells to all the characters. Although, 100%ing the game requires you to play through the entire school mode game several times, this can get tedious and repetitive. I'd  say it's worth it in the end thoguh- if you're paying £20 for a game you don't want to miss out on loads of special character endings and presents just because the going gets tough, right?\n\nAll in all- bloody loved this game. Possibly even the best (Most attention holding and generally enjoyable) game that I have played on Steam to date. Sign me up for the sequel!","March 11","true","48.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An average high school student who becomes enrolled in a prestigious academy full of exceptional students through sheer luck. All is not as well as it seems however as Makoto and his classmates quickly find themselves locked within the centre of a high school death game with no means of escape. That is unless they can murder one another and get away with it while the remainder of the class try to discover the identity of the killer in order to save themselves from the harsh consequences of getting the suspect wrong under the ever watchful eye of the school's headmaster, Monokuma.\n\nThe gameplay of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc focuses upon the elements of investigation, class trials and the interaction between the characters during the entire progression of the story. During investigations it is up to Makoto and his fellow classmates to try and discover "whodunnit" and escape punishment. This is achieved through a point and click-esque system whereby you will search the school for clues, match statements with classmates and otherwise try to formulate evidence in order to take to the class trial. The class trial is where this evidence is steadily materialised into a clear image of what has transpired through the use of debate with a constant back and forth attitude whereby a lot of the enjoyment of the game comes from. Seeing the incident at hand, having a theory about it, developing the evidence and then creating your case is an immensely satisfying experience which will give you that "I KNEW IT!" feeling time and time again. Makoto can also interact with his fellow classmates during "free time events" during the story whereby he can get to know them better by seeing their viewpoint on things, viewing their own personal backstories, gift them presents and gain skills which can be put to use during the class trials themselves or in daily school life.\n\nOverall you will find many twists and turns throughout the course of the game which will leave you shocked, bewildered and utterly amazed as the plot unfolds. Several mysteries are there to be discovered within this game and it is an extremely entertaining adventure to wrap yourself in if you're a fan of a good storyline. I would recommend this game to anyone who is even a little bit interested in the concepts highlighted within this game as it delivers on them wholeheartedly. I, myself was initially put off by the visual novel-esque style of the game at first but having since played the game I have discovered that this misgiving was entirely unfounded and the game should not be discredited for that fact alone. It stands as an incredible entry point into the visual novel style and is something I wish to see more of in the future.\n\n**** On The Psychological Horror ****\n\nFor those who are curious on how much "horror" is within this game and are wondering whether it may put you off of this title, I will talk a bit about it briefly to help you with your decision.\n\nThe game contains little to no aspects of gore, you will see no guts and/or organs around the place. Even during the investigations at crime scenes. In addition, all blood is pink to help eliminate the gore factor as much as possible. They're also no jump scares or outright scary scenes which are present solely to get a reaction out of you. You will also not encounter environments which are inherently repulsive or make you want to vomit such as walls covered with blood and/or bodies. All aspects of terror and tension within the game are created via the storyline, the general atmosphere of the game itself and your own imagination. You may find that you are uneasy, "on edge" or maybe even creeped out by simply walking around the academy. This is perfectly natural given the overall theme of the game itself but that is the extent of it. Overall I wouldn't worry about it to much unless this is something that you don't think you can deal with.","April 14","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoy every character, from there designs to their stories. I am just an average gamer, so I can't really give a crital review on this game. Each chapter gave new hope and new despair(I actually felt the feelings through the whole game.) From the freetime to the Class Trails I enjoyed every moment with my fellow classmates at Hope's Peak Acadmey. If I had to have one complant about the game is the main story felt a little shorter than I was wanting it to be, this might be due to me playing through 5 chapters in one sitting.

An average high school student who becomes enrolled in a prestigious academy full of exceptional students through sheer luck. All is not as well as it seems however as Makoto and his classmates quickly find themselves locked within the centre of a high school death game with no means of escape. That is unless they can murder one another and get away with it while the remainder of the class try to discover the identity of the killer in order to save themselves from the harsh consequences of getting the suspect wrong under the ever watchful eye of the school's headmaster, Monokuma.\n\nThe gameplay of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc focuses upon the elements of investigation, class trials and the interaction between the characters during the entire progression of the story. During investigations it is up to Makoto and his fellow classmates to try and discover "whodunnit" and escape punishment. This is achieved through a point and click-esque system whereby you will search the school for clues, match statements with classmates and otherwise try to formulate evidence in order to take to the class trial. The class trial is where this evidence is steadily materialised into a clear image of what has transpired through the use of debate with a constant back and forth attitude whereby a lot of the enjoyment of the game comes from. Seeing the incident at hand, having a theory about it, developing the evidence and then creating your case is an immensely satisfying experience which will give you that "I KNEW IT!" feeling time and time again. Makoto can also interact with his fellow classmates during "free time events" during the story whereby he can get to know them better by seeing their viewpoint on things, viewing their own personal backstories, gift them presents and gain skills which can be put to use during the class trials themselves or in daily school life.\n\nOverall you will find many twists and turns throughout the course of the game which will leave you shocked, bewildered and utterly amazed as the plot unfolds. Several mysteries are there to be discovered within this game and it is an extremely entertaining adventure to wrap yourself in if you're a fan of a good storyline. I would recommend this game to anyone who is even a little bit interested in the concepts highlighted within this game as it delivers on them wholeheartedly. I, myself was initially put off by the visual novel-esque style of the game at first but having since played the game I have discovered that this misgiving was entirely unfounded and the game should not be discredited for that fact alone. It stands as an incredible entry point into the visual novel style and is something I wish to see more of in the future.\n\n**** On The Psychological Horror ****\n\nFor those who are curious on how much "horror" is within this game and are wondering whether it may put you off of this title, I will talk a bit about it briefly to help you with your decision.\n\nThe game contains little to no aspects of gore, you will see no guts and/or organs around the place. Even during the investigations at crime scenes. In addition, all blood is pink to help eliminate the gore factor as much as possible. They're also no jump scares or outright scary scenes which are present solely to get a reaction out of you. You will also not encounter environments which are inherently repulsive or make you want to vomit such as walls covered with blood and/or bodies. All aspects of terror and tension within the game are created via the storyline, the general atmosphere of the game itself and your own imagination. You may find that you are uneasy, "on edge" or maybe even creeped out by simply walking around the academy. This is perfectly natural given the overall theme of the game itself but that is the extent of it. Overall I wouldn't worry about it to much unless this is something that you don't think you can deal with.","April 14","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think thats a good thing??)\n+The characters have cool hair  (How does Celeste's hair work)\n+The voices for all the characters\n+Puhuhuhuhu\n+Stupid puns and lowkey inapropro jokes\n+Have fun figuring out Kyoko\n+Class trials actually force you to remember things (A minus if you're a lazybutt, I guess)\n+Aoi and donuts\n+You can gift characters hand bras and thongs or cora cola and bird rice.\n+Puhuhuhuhuuuuu\n+The feels\n+You can now happily play knowing that a part two has been planned for release c:\n+Unique plot. Like who would've thought on making a bear trap innocent students in a school and force them to murder each other in order to escape.\n+Puhuhuhuhuhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\n+"Freetime" lets you choose which characters you want to know better, one by one\n+There are both expected and unpredicitable plot twists, you just never know if and when\n\n-Takes much too long to advance through the story. It gets repetitive eventually through the later chapters.\n-Your favorite character will probably, just probably, die a gruesome death, and you can't do anything but sit there and watch :-)\n-Some deaths are quite graphic for an anime artstyle with pink blood\n-Don't forget to save. If your comp freezes up during a death scene and you didn't save anytime during the trial, have fun redoing everything!! (Says someone who had that happen twice. c:)\n-That cute girl is actually a guy. And that guy becomes a computer.\n\n\nTips:\n>Watching the anime first will most likely ruin the game for you, as there are not much significant differences.\n>Run everywhere, that shift key is your best friend. Unless your trying to get from floor to floor, in which case, use the map to telport across the floor.\n>Don't get too attatched to any character :'D\n>Don't skip through too much, otherwise you may miss important things you'll needa know for the triail. Unless you plan on yolo-ing it, which works too.\n>Unless you're trying to complete character report cards or trying to get the achievements, I wouldn't bother with trying to get the right items for each character. But if you do, google a guide instead of gifting random gifts.\n>During freetime, you can use the f2 map to locate specific characters. (the map through tab does not work) This is helfpul when you're trying to get closer to specific characters instead of just running around and talking to the first character you see.\n>Skipping freetime is not recommended unless you're lazy and just want to get to the end of the game, in which case I don't even know why you're bothering playing.\n> Don't ship Sayaka and Makoto. Just. Don't.\n\nTL;DR : Play it for the cute bear, despite being despair thirsty, it's adorable.

I love this game.  I need more of it in my life.  The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult, the characters had me engaged from the beginning all the way through the end.  I loved the art style of the game as well.\nSo many people want to compare this game to Phoenix Wright.  I think that does both games a disservice.  Each are their own games, and to compare them to each other will leave fans of both games wanting for aspects of the game being compared.  This game to me is NOT Phoenix Wright.  And Phoenix Wright is not Danganronpa.  The only thing they have in common is that there's a trial involved.  That's it.  No "OBJECTION!" no "HOLD IT!"  and Phoenix Wright doesnt have the everyone's lives are on the line fear factor.\n\nAs for the characters that I loved, Monokuma is just darlingly evil.  It has that creepy toy vibe you get out of old horror shows like the Twilight Zone.  In fact I think this plot would fit swimmingly in an episode of the Twilight Zone.  So I dont think of this game as a puzzle game, a trial game, or an RPG or dating sim.  Honestly, this game feels like a horror game to me, just not in the same vein as many of the horror games we presently experience.  Monokuma is like those beautiful yet creepy dolls in old horror shows.  And the plotline of kill or be killed?  What could be more horror than that?  And finally, the punishments?  Definitely something out of a horror movie.  So it takes horror aspects and makes them more paletable than chasing zombies through an old asylym\n\nWhy are you still reading this review?

But it doesn't seem like it's been hastily bolted together, or forced. Every aspect has the excact amount of things that it needs, without going unnecessarily overboard, very minimalistic actually, to move the story along. Because that's what this game's about: the story.\nWhich is fantastic, and although some plot points could be seen as a teeny bit... well, anime, and the sheet definately has a few holes, it was incredibly engaging and interesting, most everything makes perfect sense, and it's very well crafted. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this.\n\nThere are a few gripes I have with the game, but they're very minor. One is the main menu system/basic controls; it's very awkward at first, as the navigation is keyboard controlled, and selecting things is left click on the mouse. There's no option to rebind the controls, and I havn't looked into rebinding them outside of the game.\n\nBasically, it's a good game. Highly recommend it.","April 11","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's fantastic.\n\nImagine a dating sim/visual novel in which the any of the characters you cozy up to could be murderers or murder victims at any point, and you're not far off.\n\nMost of the gameplay follows the standard Phoenix Wright formula - lots of investigation and talking to colorful characters in between solving and arguing over murders. When in the courtroom, you listen to a conversation over and over and try to pick apart the contradiction with one of your argument-as-metaphor "Truth Bullets," but Danganronpa adds something deceptively simple that makes the whole courtroom scene so much more tense than Phoenix did:\n\nA timer.\n\nThat's it, that's all it needed. A ticking clock. And it becomes so much more satisfying to shoot down even simple arguments. Add a fantastic soundtrack and you've got a desperately engaging experience.\n\nThe writing and setting is good enough to suck you in, give you a big enough mystery in a surreal nightmarescape of a high school to work through obtuse and unrebindable controls and minigames that don't explain themselves wonderfully on the first go. You can work past that. You're going to have to if you want to find out what's under Hope's Peak Academy, and I sure as hell want to find out.","April 30","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

God if i just knew what a gem i was missing. For people who played ace attorney series or 9 hours 9 persons 9 doors i can nothing to add just buy it. But for others who never watched an anime, played visual novellas and keep wondering who the fukc are all those geeks with anime avatars giving this game almost perfect 100% score i will try to elaborate)\nVisual novela in most cases is living embodiment of story driven game played as the book with pictures in the background and music. But the biggest problem is quality- overwhelming quantity of them are made as eroge. You read a tremendous amount of text to finally get that girl that you saw on the scrennshot. That sums up in brief 90% of all visual novels) But there is  always an exception when some autors try to step up from  genre boundaries. And thus we can see the appearance of titles like fate stay night/clannad/ umineko and ext. Their overall quality of plot/ charachters is so high, that they get immediately converted into anime/manga and its paper counterpart.\nDanganronpa on the other hand same as ace attorney or 999 series is def among the best. But unlike others top notch novels those 3 share 1 thing in common. They actually have a gameplay elements which are trials, investigations and puzzles( mostly 999 series). And this mishmash between heavy text focused story and gameplay create such a huge profound immersion into the game that even best recreational books wont be able to deliver, Especailly in this particular one. Trials. That are well made. always keep up with good story and where you actually can try and recreate whole situation of how the murder was unfolded.\nOverall i could spout for a few pages about this game, but il be brief. I loved it and i highly reccomend it.","May 29","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basically, this goes deeper into characterization and stuff, but I guess that's to be expected since the anime was relatively short. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of visual novels, but found myself captivated and enthralled by it, and, despite already knowing the outcome to each case, it was still enjoyable nonetheless to compile the evidence to each trial. So, people who have watched the anime and are uncertain as to whether they should invest money here, take heed: if you liked the anime, this game is not a dissapointment.\n\nThat being said, that are some minor things that are offputting. The sprites, mostly in cutscenes, appeared with white edges around them, which detracted away from the overall theme of the setting. Furthuremore, the controls during the trial could've been better optomized to make it feel smoother and whatnot - I found myself repeatedly playing through certain scenes because of controls alone. Despite these, however - I don't think these glitches took away from what really drives this story: the story itself.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of mystery, this game's anime series, visual novels, or just good story-telling in general, this is worth a playthrough.","February 19","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(The Wiki in its entireity is not spoiler tagged!!!)***\n\nTLDR: One of my absolute favorite games of all time, perhaps only surpassed by this games sequel, which has been also confirmed to be coming to steam! if you like games like Phoenix Wright give this a try, no doubt about it. If you've played the Vita version before, the PC version is better in that it has up to 4K support, 60FPS, KB plus Mouse support that works better than expected.\n\n\nDanganronpa is, in my opinion, visual novels done right. The game doesn't have much in traditional replay value, but that didn't stop me from getting this version immediately.  It's well written enough that you don't get bored when the game goes full on text mode, but has enough interactivity to be a "game" and it breaks up the pacing enough to keep things from getting stale.\n\nBut that wouldn't matter if the story wasn't interesting or well written, but thankfully, it absolutely is. I could explain why the mystery is so intriguing, the mechanics make a whole lot of sense in the context of the story,  but those would be spoilers in themselves. If you enjoy a good mystery, anime in general, or just love crazy characters to get attached to then try it.

Then you get knocked out on walking in, and suddenly you find yourself trapped in the school (with metal sheets screwed over the windows and gun turrets blocking the exit) alongside 14 other students.\n\nThen, you are informed by your supposed headmaster (in the guise of a creepy duo-tone bear thing) that you are all trapped there forever.  UNLESS you can literally get away with Murder.  Yes that's right.  LITERALLY.  The only way to "graduate" is to murder a fellow student and get away with it.  Further, the mastermind assures you that if you can figure out whodunit in each case, only the killer gets executed (in an ironic way, relating to their theme).  But if you can't figure out who the killer is and pick the wrong person...They get let off the hook and are allowed to leave the school and everyone else dies instead!\n\nWhat follows is a story of trust, betrayal, deception, and a hunt for the truth.  Oh.  And Despair.  LOTS of Despair.  ...So much Despair.  ;_;\n\nGameplay is divided into 3 segments.\n\nDaily Life / Free Time, where story stuff happens and you get to roam the school and chat with the other students to become friends (and in so doing, learn "skills" that are super useful and give you a serious edge in the other segments of the game).\n\nDeadly life / Investigation, where you find out a Murder has occured and you need to look for clues as to who the culprit is.  Once you've gathered all the possible clues, it's time for...\n\nClass Trial.  Where you engage in non-stop debates and need to "shoot" your evidence (represented as "truth bullets") into the right statements as the other characters make them (requiring timing and accuracy as well as logic, since the dialogue progresses on it's own!), do "complete the word" minigames, standard "present the right evidence" segments, memorizing statements to fire them back at people, shooting and destroying distracting "white noise" statements" and eventually short rhythm-game battles where you force an uncooperative character to shut their pie hole and swallow that decisive evidence they just wanna deny away.  It's amazingly fun.\n\nFinally, it has a fantastic cast of characters, who while being kinda arch-typical or over-the-top at times, are also very likeable/hateable, and fun to play off of.  As well as the most outrageously hateable villain I have ever seen.  GOD I hate that freakin' bear and want to-(*trails off into a million horrible fates*)\n\nNow then, I have to add a new school Regulation!  "Not playing this game after this review interests you will be counted as not completing homework, and will be punished appropriately!  BY DEATH!"","March 7","true","31.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Menggabungkan genre Visual Novel, Misteri, Detektif, Dating Sim, bahkan sedikit FPS kedalamnya, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc menjadi salah satu game paling seru & menegangkan.\n\nCerita (10/10)Tidak ada alasan untuk tidak memberi nilai 10 untuk segi cerita. Dibangun dengan sangat matang, cerita Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc benar2 sangat sulit ditebak, asalkan kita belum menonton animenya yang sudah dirilis 2013 silam.\n\nKita bakal disuguhi kasus yang begitu rumit dan tricky untuk dianalisis. Cuma pada kasus pertama kita diberi petunjuk yang begitu jelas untuk diungkap, namun jangan harap bisa mengungkap kasus kedua hingga terakhir dengan mudah. Semua clue begitu membingungkan hingga "Class Trial" dimulai.\n\nGameplay (9/10)Seperti yang dikatakan sebelumnya, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc menggabungkan genre Visual Novel, Misteri, Detektif, Dating Sim, bahkan sedikit FPS kedalamnya.\n\n20 menit pertama, kita akan melihat gameplay standar Visual Novel yang linear & membosankan, namun selanjutnya kita bebas untuk bermain layaknya game dating sim (atau lebih mirip social link pada Persona 3 & 4) kita bisa menghabiskan waktu dengan seorang karakter, mendapatkan info personal tentangnya dan mendapatkan skill yang berguna pada "Class Trial". Kita bisa memilih dengan siapa kita menghabiskan waktu. Kita pun juga bebas menjelajah sekolah dengan mode first person.\n\nSeiring progress cerita, kita mendapatkan sebuah kasus misteri pembunuhan & kita wajib mengungkap kasus tersebut. Kita diminta mengumpulkan petunjuk dan kesaksian setiap karakter (layaknya game point & click ala Telltale games) semua petunjuk & kesaksian yang mengarah pada kasus akan menjadi senjata kita sebagai "Truth Bullet".\n\nSelanjutnya diadakan "Class Trial" untuk mengungkap siapa pelaku dibalik kasus tersebut. Semua karakter akan beradu argumen untuk mengungkap setiap aspek misteri dalam kasus melalui nonstop debate. Beberapa karakter akan mengungkapkan argumen lemah dalam debat. Tugas kita cukup menembak argumen lemah yang tidak sesuai dengan "Truth Bullet" yang kita miliki layaknya genre FPS (walaupun sebenarnya yang kita tembak hanyalah kalimat).\n\nTerakhir kita menyusun semua aspek misteri menjadi sebuah satu kesatuan adegan saat terjadinya kasus tersebut. Pelaku  & semua yang dia lakukan terungkap, "Class Trial" selesai & kita akan kembali menjalani kehidupan sehari2 dengan mode dating sim.","March 23","true","66.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Além da parte de visual novel, temos a parte de gameplay (que são diversos puzzles, minigames) durante cada capítulo, que entram em conjunto com a exploração e investigação do jogo.\n\nO port é decente?\nGeralmente eu tenho medo de responder essa pergunta... mas... SIM! O port é excelente. Foi bem trabalhado, 1080p / 60 fps / dual audio / sem slowmotion / nenhum crash.\nNão tive *e espero não ter* nenhum problema com o jogo.\nEntão se sua dúvida é se o port é bom, a resposta é: sim.\n\nEntão, vale a pena?\nSe você está disposto a viajar em uma acid trip, com personagens caricatos e bem trabalhados, em uma história de ~terror~, com um clima de suspense em cada minuto. Esse com toda certeza é o jogo que você está procurando.\n","February 19","true","61.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It also gives you the opportunity to make mistakes, but the results are immediate, and only harmful in the murder trials (which you can instantly re-attempt). The music and mixed art styles are vivid and wild, it varies from cute and cool to macabre.\n\nSometimes the trials give you vague terms to match up with one another, but with patience you can figure them out. The other students will also start arguing over obvious facts they should already know, this is partly explained by them getting emotional or being stupid, but it was frustrating to have to explain that something was wet because a bucket of water was thrown on it, especially when everyone saw it happen.\n\nGreat game, well worth the price.","February 20","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All the while goaded on by a malevolent cartoon bear.\n\nIt's a hybrid between visual novel and adventure game, with a cast of absurd characters who you actually get pretty attached to over time, ratcheting up the tension of wondering who's going to off who next. Whereas the court sections in Ace Attorney are fairly static affairs of "present evidence here", in Danganronpa they're comprised of these ridiculous minigames, like firing your evidence at opposing statements in an on-rails shooter, or playing a rhythm game to out-argue your opponent. It's nuts, and it's awesome.\n\nMasafumi Takada's soundtrack is a real gem too, it's an absolutely fantastic blend between the creeping dread pervading the grim atmosphere and high-energy electro beats during the court sections. Though unfortunately the soundtrack on Steam doesn't seem to contain all the tracks of the game, rather a few extended mixes of scattered tracks.\n\nDefinitely one of my personal favorite games, had me hooked the whole way through.","February 19","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It also gives you the opportunity to make mistakes, but the results are immediate, and only harmful in the murder trials (which you can instantly re-attempt). The music and mixed art styles are vivid and wild, it varies from cute and cool to macabre.\n\nSometimes the trials give you vague terms to match up with one another, but with patience you can figure them out. The other students will also start arguing over obvious facts they should already know, this is partly explained by them getting emotional or being stupid, but it was frustrating to have to explain that something was wet because a bucket of water was thrown on it, especially when everyone saw it happen.\n\nGreat game, well worth the price.","February 20","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If they are successful, everyone else in the school is executed and the murderer gets to leave. If they are found out, only they are executed (But everyone else has to still stay). If no one kills anybody, they are isolated within the school building for the rest of their lives.\n\nHas a pretty good story, characters and while the gameplay is sound (besides the annoying mini-games) it is a bit easier than Ace Attorney.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPS: Took me about 21 hours to beat so it's quite long.","March 4","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At the time I just wanted something with a lot of plot, so I decided to pick it up while it was on a slight sale. Never have I been more happier to have discovered it.\n\nDanganronpa is an Anime style Visual Novel with heavy gameplay in addition to its strong sense of plot, making use of smart action that compensates for the amount of story and dialogue within the game. Split into 6 different chapters as well as an Epilogue and Prologue, the story begins with Makoto Naegi, the Ultimate Lucky Student, entering Hope's Peak Academy for the first time only to find that nothing was at all what he had imagined. A school meant for the 'Ultimates'(High school students that each had a special trait, such as the Ultimate Programmer), and meant as a symbol of hope to the world, Makoto wakes up on a strange desk to an unsettlingly empty school. Thrown into a deadly struggle against none other than his classmates, he must survive the brutal killing game while trying to find the killers of the murders, all the while attempting to discover what has occured within the school that led to the barred windows and the mysteirous dissapearance of any sign of living life.\n\nThe gameplay consists of walking around a school, and then using a point and click system to interact with objects and people. Dialogue has been translated very nicely, with close to no errors anywhere within the thousands of lines of dialogue. Throughout the game, the player will also be able to interact with his school mates and learn more about their history and abilities, as well as progress the game further by learning more about the events that happened in the school. After a murder has been committed, the player's enter Investigation phase, in which they must try to find as much relevant evidence as possible. After that, the player's will enter the Class Trial, the main action of the plot in which the player's initiate discussions with other characters in order to find contradictions and to discover who the true murder is. They play multiple different minigames(Includig rhythm games and hangman's) in addition to the main debate game in order to progress and discover the trail in the case.\n\nThe story itself is brilliantly handled, starting the player's off with nothing given. Mercilessly pounded by murder after murder, the story uses cold hard truth and dark events in order to give the story a deathly and hopeless feeling, all the while revealing slowly the reason why any of this is happening. For me, it had me obsessed, furiously clicking through the dialogue in order to find out the identity of the killer or to discover the history of the school. All of the murders and cases presented throughout are also completely unexpected, with major misleading clues that will guide the players to false ends and false trails, surprising me every single turn of the way.\n\nSo should you get this game? If you like solving mysteries and games with a very large emphasis on story as well as an intricate gameplay system, then I would highly recommend this to you, even if you do not particularly enjoy the anime art style. For those who have played visual novels before, or have watched anime(or read manga), than this game will definitely come as a pleasant surprise.","May 9","true","25.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

The game is able to be a interesting visual novel sort of deal, but still have its own uniqe gameplay ideas that I havent quite seen before in a game. If I had to describe it in a whole package (being story and gameplay) it would be tough but I would say think something like a mix of: Pheonix Wright, 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors/ Virtues Last Reward and Persona 3/4. So if you find yourself enjoying any of these games even in the slightest I would say that Danganronpa is a absolute must buy.\n\nStory The story of Danganronpa is one that is kind of hard to explain so bear with me here. It stars a group of 15 highschool students who were all selected to go to a prestiguious school called "Hopes Peak Academy". To get into this school there is only one requirement. Be the best at whatever you may do, weather that be the best writer or the best baseball player it dosent matter even if you just got into the school but a lucky random vote. This is where our main character Makoto comes in, he was selected at random and deemed as "The ultimate lucky student".\n\nMakato quickly learns however that he was not as lucky as he thought. He passes out just seconds from entering in the school, he wakes up in a abandoned class  and soon realises that himself and 14 other students have been trapped in the school by a psycotic bear with only one way to escape. Kill one of your fellow classmates and dont be caught. This story creates alot of tension and mystery as you will be wondering who will be killed next as well as alot of suspence when you are trying to figure out who killed who.\n\nThere are still issues with this story however. While the game is long in its own right with so many characters that they were trying to individualy build up, it feels a bit crammed since in most cases we barley know anything or have any kind of a connection with a character before they are killed off. For example for the first 3 or so deaths they were my faverioute characters in the story at that point. Now you would probably think that I would be sad because my faverioute characters dies right? Well I found myself as more mad then anything because the characters hadent been fully fleshed out yet and It felt like somewhat of a cheap shot for them to do. It feels as if they wanted to make a cast with 8 characters in it but realized they needed some to die so they created 15 with the extra 7 characters just being for slaughter.\n\nAnother more minor problem with the story is that it takes a while to actually get good. (Depending on your reading speed) it will take around 2 hours for the first interesting thing to happen, being the first murder, but if you can stick around the murders are a hell of alot of fun to solve. Another problem is the game feels like it has kinda all over the place pacing. This is because the game is broken up into a few different sections being: Free time, Investigation and class trial. These sections all have a very different pace with the Free time (in which you interact with other characters for bonuses) feels to few and far between because these are the only scenes where the characters actually have much kind of development and they only happen maybe a dozen or so times in the game. Investigation is a regularily long process of gather information about the murders and seeing how they happened but these are kind of puzzle peices that wont be put together for a long time. Finally we have the trial bits where evreybody works together to put together the puzzle to find out who did the murder. The problem is with this is that the trial bits were the only parts that stood out as really interested and I feel that the free time and the investigation sections at times felt like they dragged on a bit with there sometimes being no clear direction of what you had to do. However the trial bits are a ton of fun, I never left my computer once durring a trial section because it was just crazy entertaining to watch go down so it makes up for it and then some due to alot of the gameplay ideas.\n\nGameplay The game is broken up into a few different sections being: Free time, Investigation and class trial.

Its atmospheric and can help build tension or exitement in situations where it is appropriate, it is overall a good fit for the game and it is generally catchy and entertaining.\n\nOverall Verdict Overall I belive that Danganronpa is a game that while certainly is not for evreybody, it has its own appeal in a niche audience. If anything that I said in this review even slightly interests you then I cannot recomend it enough because even though I have written alot of words for this I still feel like this game is something that is rather hard to sell. Regardless I think that evreybody should check it out, trust me you wont regret it.\n\nOverall score: 8/10","May 11","true","22.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I was kinda spoiled because I saw the anime first, but I like the game a lot more since it dives deeper into the histories and personalities of the characters (particularly during Free Time). The mechanics are fun, the art style is unique and eye-catching, and the over-the-top characters and events definitely keep things interesting, especially *name removed for potential spoilers* It gives you the option to use a controller, but the mouse works just fine for the Investigation and Trial segments.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this game, but I'd wait for another deal or price drop. Ironically, I think I bought it the day before the Anime Weekend sale, so I got it full price when I could have saved a few bucks. Even without a sale, though, if you have $30-ish and you're a fan of anime and its many over-the-top tropes, this game is definitely up your alley.","May 13","true","28.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a visual novel mystery adventure game, similar to the Ace Attorney series. However in my honest opinion, this game is the poor man's version of the Ace Attorney (AA) series.\n\nThe game is about 15 teenagers, trapped in school where their only means of escaping is to murder other teenagers trapped under the watchful gaze of Monokuma, a derange psychopath remote controlling a mechanical bear. It's up to the main character, Makoto Naegi, to find out the murderer when a murder happens, discover the mysteries of the school and escape.\n\nThe characters are very colourful and well diverse (except for the main character who is self-aware to be completely average and have absolutely no special traits or talents whatsoever). Thankfully the supporting casts are not as boring but since this is a murder mystery game, players might not have the chance to fully know some of the characters. In fact, there's literally only 3 characters including the MC that are fully capable of running an investigation. The others are basically dead weight. Some are more likable than others but most are completely useless. Even worse, one of the characters who survived the whole game is a comic relief who brings absolutely nothing to the game other than making stupid and bad jokes. I assure you, the jokes are not funny and it honestly makes me question the devs decision to keep the character alive.\n\nGameplay, as I mentioned before, are similar to the AA series, only not as polished. There's an element of dating sim in the game but sadly underdeveloped. I appreciate the first person mode but it honestly doesn't do much to add to the game. The murder mysteries are inferior compared to the AA series and the clues are either too obvious or too vague. Nothing is more frustrating than not knowing what exactly the game really wants.\n\nThe ending sucks, too. The games tried so hard to give a fulfilling ending with it's plot twists and all but I found it to fall short. Honestly it kinda makes me a bit depressed in the end.\n\nOne thing people should know about this game is that there's little to none replay value. Once you've beaten it, that's it. Unless you like reading mountains of texts and re-solving the same murder, you probably won't replay this.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a good game, so I'm giving it a thumbs up. However compared to the AA series, this game is clearly not as good.\n\nRECOMMENDED: For anyone who enjoys the AA series, visual novel games or solving mysteries.\nNOT RECOMMENDED: For those who doesn't enjoy anime-styled visual novel games.","February 23","true","19.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

If you are found guilty in the ensuing class trial, the master mind kills you. If the class trial gets it wrong, everyone but the killer dies, and the killer goes free.

While it is certainly flawed, if the basic concept intrigues or excites you, this game will deliver the fundamentals you want.\n\nEst play time, 20 hours\n\nYou are trapped in a school with other students, and the only way to escape is to kill someone without getting caught. If you are found guilty in the ensuing class trial, the master mind kills you. If the class trial gets it wrong, everyone but the killer dies, and the killer goes free.  Overtime, the group struggles both to stay alive as individuals, escape as a group and figure out the overarching mysteries surrounding this school and their imprisonment.\n\nEach chapter will have 4 basic componenets:\n\nA barely interactive cutscene sets the stage for the chapter and advances the story.\n\nFree Time, in which you attempt to woo students with gifts in order to learn skills from them and more about them.\n\nInvestigation: A body has been discovered, you must explore to find hints and interview other students.\n\nClass Trial: You must use the clues to deduce the killer through a series of minigames, including spot the contradiction and a rhythm game to deal with irrational students.\n\nDanganronpa has two great strengths: the cast and the mysteries.  Everyone (except the protagonist) is colorful, and generally bounce of eachother in interesting ways that change over the course of the story.  The murder mysteries can generally be relied upon to be more than meets the eye, and each one fits in with the emotional mood of the story at the time.  The General Mysteries over-arch through the plot nicely.  Both types of mysteries manage to construct a sidewinding path that you must take to deduce them while remaining simple enough in execution to not be unbelievable, to an extent.\n\nUnfortunately, while the fundamentals of this game are good, there are faults even here.  The writing occasionally takes a nose dive, and the prolouge and epilouge are almost painful to sit through.  The Class trial minigames grow tiresome, as once youve solved the whole mystery, you wont see why youre stopped because you cant hit some spinning dialogue text in time.\n\nFurthermore, this game is the patron saint of petty annoyances.  The vending machine in which you can only buy a random present one at a time, the habit of teleporting you back to your room only to ask you to go out again, the lack of an inter-floor teleport late in the game, and other minor issues stop this game from being as immersive as it could be.\n\nConclusion: A solid 7/10, this game keeps you coming back with its excellent narrative and setting, despite its several minor failings.","February 22","true","24.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes, there is text, but... that's about where the visual novel aspect ends.\n\nIn Danganronpa, fifteen students including you are trapped in a school. The only way out is to kill someone and not get caught. But of course, the benevolent you wouldn't do that. Despite that, others are not as kind-hearted. Once every chapter, someone will kill someone else (or some variation of that) and you along with the other survivors must find the culprit using evidence obtained from the crime scene.\n\nThere are 3 phases for each chapter:\nDaily Life Phase:\nIn this phase, you simply interact with the other survivors. You get to know them, their personalities, and most importantly, their motives to commit murder. By interacting with them, you can unlock special abilities for use in the third phase.\n\nDeadly Life Phase:\nThe murder(s) has happened. You must investigate to find evidence that may lead you to who did it. Cooperate with others and do self-investigations to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nClass Trial Phase:\nIn this phase, you use evidence you've found along with others' evidence to find out who the culprit is. These are actually quite long and demanding. There are MANY things you do in this phase, but the gist of it is that you have to use evidence you have collected to correct false statements that others make. This can happen in a large number of ways such as directly "bullet refuting" by shooting their false claims with correct ones, hangman to find words, and many others. In the final part of the trial, you must complete a comic that will tell what the murderer did from start to finish by dragging (admittedly hard to interpret) icons into missing segments of the comic. Doing this correctly will result in the trial finishing.\n\nAt the end of the trial, once the correct murderer is found guilty, then the murderer will be executed, and the phase cycle will repeat and the story will progress.\n\nYes, this is a detective/mystery game, and a BRUTAL ONE. If you don't like challenge, then you might want to pass on this one. However, if you DO like mystery/detective games then this one is right up your alley.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr\nThis is a detective game in which you must find out who killed who using evidence. Once someone inevitably kills someone else, you must find out who did it by gathering evidence at the crime scene and presenting the evidence at the trial by "bullet refuting" (i.e. correcting) others' statements to find the culprit. If you like that sort of thing, then this is right up your alley.","March 3","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This can be heartbreaking at times because you favorite character can always end up dead or even be a murderer.\n\nAs a person who has never really played nor liked visual-novel games such as this I can say that if you like mysteries and/or logic puzzles then you should definitley pick this game up.","February 27","true","41.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is much more in debth than the anime (shocker right?) which gives characters the right amount of time to shine and have buildup.\n\nI'll try to keep this as brief as possible because you're probably wondering if the game is worth your time. Yes, it totally is, but here are some pointers:\n\n-If you have played and liked the Phoenix Wright games, you're going to have a field day with this. It's basically Phoenix Wright on steroids while snorting Dr. Pepper (I don't know...).\n\n-If you're into reading, this game has a lot of it. It's basically a visual novel.\n\n-If you're into quirky characters, the design and personality of all the characters are great. You'll hate and you'll love, but just as intended.\n\n-If you're a massochist, well not really. This game won't break your balls like Telltale loves to do, but they do allign on crushing your hope.\n\nYou can sort of tell what you're getting from the trailer and screenshots. And boy is it worth it.","February 23","true","20.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Buy this game.\nDo you think £1 = 1 hour? Buy this game.\nDo you like to have fun? Buy this game.\n\nIt's basically a Murder Mystery game, throw 15 Teenagers into locked school, the only way out is to kill someone without being found out, If the killer wins they get to leave and everyone else dies, if the killer is found, only the killer dies and they return to their life trapped in the school. You spend your time investigating and trying to find out who killed who and talking to everyone.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Phoenix Wright, You talk to people, investigate areas, find evidence, then you get taken to a trial where you work out among everyone in the school who killed who. Although there's also a "Daily life" part where if no one has been killed and your not investigating, then you go around and talk with whoever you want.\n\nLots of reading involved (as it is a visual novel and a game stuck together) but there is voice acting in the important parts of the story. If you've watched the anime and liked it then you should still get this game. It goes into far more detail about the characters and trials than the anime did.\n\nI liked this game, it has about 25 hours worth of gameplay (for the main story) and even more for the extra stuff. It's a little on the easy side so if you buy the game, play on "MEAN" settings,\n\nSum it all up: Story is great, Soundtrack is great, 25+ Hours worth of content,","February 23","true","29.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, it gets more complicated than that. You can present one of several pieces of evidence against key words or phrases to "shoot down" someone's argument, but sometimes you have to memorize a key phrase and use that to shoot down something else they've said. There are also phrases that will pop up to block your evidence, which you also have to shoot down carefully without causing damage to a timer that runs throughout each section of the trial.\n\nThe other part of the game is socializing with the other characters. By spending time with them and giving them gifts that they like, you unlock Skills or Skill Points which will make trials much easier to get through, either by increasing your Focus meter, how much damage you take when you're wrong, and other things. It also helps to develop the characters, who are mostly enjoyable but never really break out of the confines of their particular trope: there is the otaku; the goth lolita; the biker gang guy; the martial artist; the obnoxious affluent person; the ditzy but well-endowed girl; and a few others.\n\nFor all its tropey characters, though, the plot has twists and turns to spare. You might think you know which way a trial or the plot is going and then it takes a left turn. For better or worse, Danganronpa finds some bizarre ways to subvert the player's expectations.\n\nIf you enjoy adventure games or visual novels, pick this one up. You won't regret it.","February 25","true","25.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, there is text, but... that's about where the visual novel aspect ends.\n\nIn Danganronpa, fifteen students including you are trapped in a school. The only way out is to kill someone and not get caught. But of course, the benevolent you wouldn't do that. Despite that, others are not as kind-hearted. Once every chapter, someone will kill someone else (or some variation of that) and you along with the other survivors must find the culprit using evidence obtained from the crime scene.\n\nThere are 3 phases for each chapter:\nDaily Life Phase:\nIn this phase, you simply interact with the other survivors. You get to know them, their personalities, and most importantly, their motives to commit murder. By interacting with them, you can unlock special abilities for use in the third phase.\n\nDeadly Life Phase:\nThe murder(s) has happened. You must investigate to find evidence that may lead you to who did it. Cooperate with others and do self-investigations to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nClass Trial Phase:\nIn this phase, you use evidence you've found along with others' evidence to find out who the culprit is. These are actually quite long and demanding. There are MANY things you do in this phase, but the gist of it is that you have to use evidence you have collected to correct false statements that others make. This can happen in a large number of ways such as directly "bullet refuting" by shooting their false claims with correct ones, hangman to find words, and many others. In the final part of the trial, you must complete a comic that will tell what the murderer did from start to finish by dragging (admittedly hard to interpret) icons into missing segments of the comic. Doing this correctly will result in the trial finishing.\n\nAt the end of the trial, once the correct murderer is found guilty, then the murderer will be executed, and the phase cycle will repeat and the story will progress.\n\nYes, this is a detective/mystery game, and a BRUTAL ONE. If you don't like challenge, then you might want to pass on this one. However, if you DO like mystery/detective games then this one is right up your alley.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr\nThis is a detective game in which you must find out who killed who using evidence. Once someone inevitably kills someone else, you must find out who did it by gathering evidence at the crime scene and presenting the evidence at the trial by "bullet refuting" (i.e. correcting) others' statements to find the culprit. If you like that sort of thing, then this is right up your alley.","March 3","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I entered not knowing much, I knew it was on the PS Vita or something, and that this is a pc port, not like remake so I wasnt expecting it to be super super graphically amazing, but I just wanted something with a good story. Now, this game on a whole is one of the best games I have ever played. The story had me hooked within the first 5 minutes, and since then I have basically only been thinking about Danganronpa. The art style is fantastic in my opinion! Now sure as I said its not a remake I dont think, so the graphics are not like new triple A games or anything, no, instead it has a very interesting art style that still works great despite the blurriness of the cutscenes, some objects etc. The story in this game is both messed up and amazing at the same time. The whole investigating part I thought was amazing! Sure it was like quite linear, the class trials only really start when you have all the clues (I think anyway, only played through once but I have not failed any trials so I assume that I had all the clues for it), and in my opinion a more non linear approach could have been more interesting, but, that said, it was still absolutely amazing! Hmm, I suppose I should do that 1 to 10 scale for different aspects of the game, here goes:\n\nGraphics: 10/10 - I know people will disagree because of the quality, but the art style which is technically graphics, is brilliant in my opinion, its unique and will forever be in my mind as one of the best art styles in a game in my opinion.\n\nStory: 9/10 - Now I know I said about how amazing this story is, it was AMAZING, but there were a few parts that I was... Less keen on. The ending of the game was a little... I dont know, it worked, the ending was amazing! I still feel like all adrenaline-y from it so it was REALLY good! But it also felt a little... Open? Not expected? I cant say why really without spoilers, but it was a good end.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 The gameplay of it was amazing, a combination of point and click, visual novel, detective investigation was brilliant! One slight complaint, nearer the end of the game I did encounter a few bugs, like with the preparation for the 5th investigation case thing, I couldnt click on the rubble without it clicking the body, and to get the rubble debris thing, I had to turn the camera a lot to click it, slight bug but nothing major! The gameplay itself though was absolutely fantastic!\n\nPerformance: 10/10? I dont know about anyone else, I had no performance issues for this game, 60fps constantly, no drops, didnt seem particularely demanding, then again, my computer is pretty good so I would be suprised if there were issues with this sorta game.\n\nPhew, I have rambled enough x3 I am sure no one will read this anyway but if anyone did, uh, thank you for reading? Buy this game, its really good, I genuinly would recommend this game completely to anyone~ I cant wait till Danganronpa 2 comes to pc now :3 I hope its not tooo to far in the future, I will cling to the hope it isnt too far and fight the despair of waiting and hoping ;3","February 28","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although it seems some of the twists can be figured out early , even when you think you know the answer the build up to that answer is really what makes the game great. Even the first case (don't worry, no spoilers here) threw me for a loop and I think really set up the rest of the game. The design of the game as well, which is extremely important to a visual novel, is beatufilly designed. The graphics themselves arent super amazing in a "state of the art" kind of way, but they way it is drawn and designed really brings a unique feel to the game and some cutscenes really just keep your grey matter spinning.

You won't regret it.\nYes I liked this game. Why? Because it was what I expected, and yet not what I expected, at the same time. First off, I don't watch a few lot of anime tv shows. But I have seen Attack on Titan, and this game reminded me of it, a bit. Mostly just the blood and violence of the show, though the show is probably more violent, while this game is more dark, grim, and kind of sadistic. I'm not saying this to deter you from the game. I just want you to understand that, before you play it.\nSecondly, this game did a really good job of making me like the characters, and also be invested in finding the truth, just like everyone else in the game. Who died first, was pretty predictable though. But the end, was not what I expected. And the game made it pretty easy to win, and find the truth for each case, though they did get harder to figure out.\nOverall, I'd give it a 9.5/10.

It is well-written, engaging and the character development is neat. Some twists are unpredictable, while others are easy to anticipate beforehand. I have got immense satisfaction from playing and completing this game.\n\nPros:\n-Cool Story\n-Neat character development\n-Does not look too shabby for what is essentially a PSP game\n\nCons:\n-Some fourth wall breaking stuff, that simply seems out of place\n-Tedious gameplay. It would have been much better served with Phoenix Wright or Devil's Attorney style dialog based combat, instead of rhythm games, timing based point and click games, etc.\n-Some hit detection issues with the aforementioned timing-based point and click games.\n-Framerate chugs in certain areas of the game for me (Intel i74710HQ, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 850M with 4 GB of RAM)\n-Mid-trial game glitch, wherein the video stops playing but the audio keeps going, requires a restart to correct. I would recommend saving often. Particularly egregious in Chp 5 and Chp 6 class trials.\n\nOverall while the list of cons seems too long, I would admit that except for the gameplay part, most of it is nitpicking and maybe an issue with my setup. None of the bugs encountered are game breaking\n\nI am not a fan of VN adventure games like Telltale's games, Life is Strange, etc. Haven't played any of those games to completion, but somehow this title stuck a chord with me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI stopped playing Rise of the Tomb Raider for this game and to be frank I would gladly trade the RoTR PC port with its atrocious characters, 'dialogue' and middling gameplay (doesn't have the story, charm, verticality, set pieces of Uncharted neither the technically proficient gameplay of Vanquish) with a Steam port of Danganronpa 2.","March 4","true","21.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are constantly suspicious of everything, while desperately needing to figure out who is lying, why, and just what exactly even happened.\n\nThe music is great, and really enhances the mood, especially during the courtroom scenes.\n\nThe game is oozing with that great style some Japanese games especially seem to have, and the anime aesthetic is well-drawn and a lot of fun.\n\nIf you dig visual novels with some great flair, and love mysteries, shell out for this one!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wokkylokky/recommended/413410/","wokkylokky","Amber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wokkylokky/","511 products in account","Okie I just finished the game about 5 minutes ago. I entered not knowing much, I knew it was on the PS Vita or something, and that this is a pc port, not like remake so I wasnt expecting it to be super super graphically amazing, but I just wanted something with a good story. Now, this game on a whole is one of the best games I have ever played. The story had me hooked within the first 5 minutes, and since then I have basically only been thinking about Danganronpa. The art style is fantastic in my opinion! Now sure as I said its not a remake I dont think, so the graphics are not like new triple A games or anything, no, instead it has a very interesting art style that still works great despite the blurriness of the cutscenes, some objects etc. The story in this game is both messed up and amazing at the same time. The whole investigating part I thought was amazing! Sure it was like quite linear, the class trials only really start when you have all the clues (I think anyway, only played through once but I have not failed any trials so I assume that I had all the clues for it), and in my opinion a more non linear approach could have been more interesting, but, that said, it was still absolutely amazing! Hmm, I suppose I should do that 1 to 10 scale for different aspects of the game, here goes:\n\nGraphics: 10/10 - I know people will disagree because of the quality, but the art style which is technically graphics, is brilliant in my opinion, its unique and will forever be in my mind as one of the best art styles in a game in my opinion.\n\nStory: 9/10 - Now I know I said about how amazing this story is, it was AMAZING, but there were a few parts that I was... Less keen on. The ending of the game was a little... I dont know, it worked, the ending was amazing! I still feel like all adrenaline-y from it so it was REALLY good! But it also felt a little... Open? Not expected? I cant say why really without spoilers, but it was a good end.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 The gameplay of it was amazing, a combination of point and click, visual novel, detective investigation was brilliant! One slight complaint, nearer the end of the game I did encounter a few bugs, like with the preparation for the 5th investigation case thing, I couldnt click on the rubble without it clicking the body, and to get the rubble debris thing, I had to turn the camera a lot to click it, slight bug but nothing major! The gameplay itself though was absolutely fantastic!\n\nPerformance: 10/10? I dont know about anyone else, I had no performance issues for this game, 60fps constantly, no drops, didnt seem particularely demanding, then again, my computer is pretty good so I would be suprised if there were issues with this sorta game.\n\nPhew, I have rambled enough x3 I am sure no one will read this anyway but if anyone did, uh, thank you for reading? Buy this game, its really good, I genuinly would recommend this game completely to anyone~ I cant wait till Danganronpa 2 comes to pc now :3 I hope its not tooo to far in the future, I will cling to the hope it isnt too far and fight the despair of waiting and hoping ;3","February 28","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although it seems some of the twists can be figured out early , even when you think you know the answer the build up to that answer is really what makes the game great. Even the first case (don't worry, no spoilers here) threw me for a loop and I think really set up the rest of the game. The design of the game as well, which is extremely important to a visual novel, is beatufilly designed. The graphics themselves arent super amazing in a "state of the art" kind of way, but they way it is drawn and designed really brings a unique feel to the game and some cutscenes really just keep your grey matter spinning.

Once every chapter, someone will kill someone else (or some variation of that) and you along with the other survivors must find the culprit using evidence obtained from the crime scene.\n\nThere are 3 phases for each chapter:\nDaily Life Phase:\nIn this phase, you simply interact with the other survivors. You get to know them, their personalities, and most importantly, their motives to commit murder. By interacting with them, you can unlock special abilities for use in the third phase.\n\nDeadly Life Phase:\nThe murder(s) has happened. You must investigate to find evidence that may lead you to who did it. Cooperate with others and do self-investigations to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nClass Trial Phase:\nIn this phase, you use evidence you've found along with others' evidence to find out who the culprit is. These are actually quite long and demanding. There are MANY things you do in this phase, but the gist of it is that you have to use evidence you have collected to correct false statements that others make. This can happen in a large number of ways such as directly "bullet refuting" by shooting their false claims with correct ones, hangman to find words, and many others. In the final part of the trial, you must complete a comic that will tell what the murderer did from start to finish by dragging (admittedly hard to interpret) icons into missing segments of the comic. Doing this correctly will result in the trial finishing.\n\nAt the end of the trial, once the correct murderer is found guilty, then the murderer will be executed, and the phase cycle will repeat and the story will progress.\n\nYes, this is a detective/mystery game, and a BRUTAL ONE. If you don't like challenge, then you might want to pass on this one. However, if you DO like mystery/detective games then this one is right up your alley.\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr\nThis is a detective game in which you must find out who killed who using evidence. Once someone inevitably kills someone else, you must find out who did it by gathering evidence at the crime scene and presenting the evidence at the trial by "bullet refuting" (i.e. correcting) others' statements to find the culprit. If you like that sort of thing, then this is right up your alley.","March 3","true","26.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I bought this game, I stopped playing all other games and kept playing and playing this game until I saw the story through, which took about 20 hours, and it was VERY much worth it.\n\nI'm not much for long reviews, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf you've played Persona 3 or Persona 4, the art style will be familiar. The graphics are definitely not the selling point, but the art style is quite interesting and some people may like it quite a bit.\n\nThe selling point is the trial system where you put together evidence to figure out who the murderer and possible accomplice is. It is somewhat similar to Gyakuten Saiban / Phoenix Wright, but it uses minigames to apply evidence.\n\nWhile the students are busy trying to either kill or find the killer, there is the larger mystery that overshadows the school. Why was this set up in this way? What is going on? Is there any hope for escape? Or is there only despair?\n\nOn another note, as a strict anime sub fan, I was turned off by the fact I couldn't completely turn off the English voices, so I ended up playing the game with no sound (I'm *that* picky), so I can't review the sound at all.\n\nHTH!","May 2","true","22.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game has some of the charms of both games and gameplay of both games. But they feel watered down to me. The characters never felt as interesting to me as they did in Persona. And the trial/investigation gameplay didn't feel quite as fleshed out and have odd-feeling minigames. The trials themselves are quite a bit different than Ace Attorney games, so be ready for that. But they're still enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a fan of investigative 'visual novel' style games, this is worth checking out. It's a good time despite the flaws and slight story issues.

I was at Chapter 3 trial (which really hinted towards Hifumi killing Taka). Genocide Jack is the most annoying character in the entire game, and Toko herself isn't much better. Both really annoying anime character stereotypes. At this point, they'd already killed off the most interesting characters in the game (in my opinion), Mondo and Chihiro, and the only real characters of interest left were Kyoko and Byakuya. I liked Celeste but then she showed some kind of split personality, or something, and all I could think is that she'd turn into another Genocide Jack. Most of the other characters are bland and have very little to them aside from their Ultimate talent.\n\n** SPOILERS FINISHED **\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I really did. But it started to get ridiculous and then deleted my save. I'm upset, to be honest. I really hyped this game up and I was disappointed by the laziness of this port.\n\nEdit: Why did people vote this down so much? Did me saying your waifu Toko is ♥♥♥♥ really hurt your feelings this much? Or was it my legitimate complaints about the save issues and this being an overall bad port? Either way, good job fan boys for voting my review down when I did have a point to make.","February 27","false","15.6"," 28 of 109 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","28","109","2","4"

Just know that if you're like me and watch a few anime series here or there, this may not be the game for you.\n\nWhat I will do is list the reasons Trigger Happy Havoc wasn't worth my money (and maybe yours too).\n\n1. The price. $30 US is a steep request for something based almost entirely around still images and text boxes. There are other games like Shovel Knight, Stardew Valley, and Valkyria Chronicles with much more content and for less cash.\n\n2. The story and characters. This is a very Japanese-style story. If you're looking for detective work in similar style to things like Columbo or Dragnet, look elsewhere. Plus, the students' personality tropes are nothing new to me. They actually became a little grating as the story pressed forward.\n\n3. The Steam fan-base. While this may not be the case for everyone, this wasn't a happy experience for me. At early launch, I'd made some comments about the less-than-perfect port (don't worry, they've been patched). I received a dozen-or-so comments within the day, telling me how much of an idiot I was or asking why I hadn't fixed the problem myself. I know what you're thinking, "What's the big deal? It's the internet. This happens all the time." Yes, you are definitely right about that. Unfortunately for me, the circles I've run in that appreciate Japanese animation have always been super caring and friendly towards fellow fans. After that experience, I didn't feel comfortable commenting on the forums or asking advice for certain difficult sections. I essentially felt it was  their  game and not mine anymore.\n\nIf you're like me and you don't mind hearing spoilers, the best suggestion I can give, is to look up Trigger Happy Havoc's plot. Most people suggest you keep your mind blank until playing the game itself, but it's the thing I would've done knowing what I know now.\n\nThanks for listening.","March 12","false","11.5"," 19 of 85 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","19","85","2","3"

My review is targetted at people who have seen it, so you may wish to stop reading. If you have seen the anime, don't expect anything new from this.\n\nWhen I got this game, I looked and saw that tons of people were recommending this game after saying that it gives way more than the "watered down" anime and I was very excited. I loved the anime; if this is the anime plus more like what, say, Utawarerumono did, then I'm all for it. Sadly, that was not the case at all. The plot is pretty much verbatim what the anime was. Even worse, anyone who has seen the anime immediately knows the solution to every single case in the game, which is a major problem when the game is supposed to be a mystery. The game does technically have more content than the anime, but it all boils down to the level of Support Conversations from the Fire Emblem series. You might learn something interesting from one or two of little dialogues with the fourteen other characters, but most of the conversations are just cementing whatever stereotype the character was introduced as. It's not like befriending character A is going to prevent them from murdering character B two days from now. Oh, there's also a completely non-canon bonus mode at the end which gives you free reign to go gather all the support conversations while playing a...worker placement minigame of all things. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game by any means, but it's definitely not a good way to spend your time if you've seen the show already.\n\nBasically, if you haven't seen the anime and are still reading...what are you still doing here? I told you this review wasn't for you, but I still think this is a series you should check out. It's a very nice mystery storyline with an interesting method of figuring out the truth. If you HAVE seen the anime, this is just the same thing with the same characters, dialogue, plot, and execution, but with still character sprites instead of full animation. I suppose if you absolutely need to know every single detail about all the characters that the anime producers decided they didn't have time to include, then go ahead and play the game...actually, just go read the characters' wikipedia entries or something; you'll save money and time.","March 10","false","36.5"," 13 of 83 people (16%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","16","13","83","2","5"

I went in and bought this game with the mindset that your choices affect who lives and who dies, and there's nothing telling people like me otherwise so it's a logical assumption to make seeing as that would be the only way for a game of this type to be interesting for everyone.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The game decides what happens no matter who you decide to get close to (gifting, unlocking special dialogue etc). For some people that's not going to matter since everyone has their own preferences when it comes to which characters they like, but in my case I'm at a point in the game where all the characters I cared about are no longer around; leaving nothing but characters that I'm not interested in. AT ALL.\n\nNow even this would be fine, but in that case I'd like there to be an option to attempt getting out asap because as said, I'm really not interested in conversing with the remaining characters so that would just make it painful to continue playing the game until the end. Unfortunately, such an option is not available either.\n\nSo, if you're like me and think "Ah it has a VN tag and there's choices that you can make", be warned: They don't make the impact that you'd want them to make on the story. If this is not a problem for you then by all means, follow the positive reviews instead.","February 21","false","22.4"," 43 of 188 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","43","188","2","13"

Lets start making Steam a better place!)\n\nSo far, so good! The story and characters have captivated me and it didn't take long to do at all, while some ideas may have been done before this game, it takes those ideas and prances off with them while whistling a merry tune. It's a great read. The trials are a bit funky though, with varying gameplay styles that seem to be thrown in with no thought and sometimes idiotic characters that feel the need to repeat not only key elements of the case but also their typical shocked reaction way too much. It's also annoying that they seem to only figure things out 3 hours after you figured it out yourself, but I can forgive and forget with that one.\n\nSo, probably the best visual novel I've ever played... but it's still a visual novel, 99% of the game could be presented via any other form of media and not lose anything. Perhaps it's an excuse to overprice the product, I don't know, it just feels like I would enjoy this more if it was constricted to a comic/manga or there was more of a "game" here.\n\nHowever, the port is pretty bad, the controls are stiff, textures are still low resolution, all the options are in a launcher, bugs, sound glitches, etc etc. It's not great.\n\nSo it's a sort of neutral ground for me and I sure do wish there was a neutral option, but since this is currently sitting at a 99% rating I'll just leave it as negative, just to even it out a little, at least until the bugs are fixed any way.\n\nEdit: After finishing the game I'd just like to add that while the story was still captivating, there were some low and drawn out points and the "rhythm" minigame got more and more annoying, since with a few skills, it was just a case of "press rb, spam a, spam y, repeat" There was no need to pay much attention. Overall, really good, but I hope the sequel is better. Still won't get a recommend until the bugs are fixed though, speaking of which, the longer I played, the more I seemed to encounter them, which put a downer on the whole experience.\n\n\ninb4 "change it to openGL" I tried, same issues.","February 19","false","37.1"," 118 of 526 people (22%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","22","118","526","17","41"

I was turned on to Danganronpa after it released on Steam and I saw it was developed by Spike Chunsoft who was also responsible for 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, both of which I'm quite fond of despite their respective flaws. Even though Danganronpa and the Zero Escape games do not share the same writing talent, they do all feature Japanese anime styled characters and have similar-ish themes.\n\nIn Danganronpa, you play as Makoto Naegi - an average student who was nevertheless accepted to an elite high school academy that only admits students considered to be the best at what they do. During his first day of school, Makoto blacks out and when he comes to he finds that he is one of several students that are trapped in the high school. All the exit doors have been barred and the windows sealed. The high school is deserted with the exception of the students and a creepy remote-controlled teddy bear who calls himself Monokuma. Monokuma tells the students that the only way to escape the high school is by killing another student without getting caught. As the days go by, various murders eventually take place and it's up to you as Makoto to gather the evidence and solve each crime\n\nAfter investigating a murder scene and gathering evidence, a "class trial" takes place where the facts of the case are deliberated. Here, you'll often need to catch other students either misstating a fact or outright lying and support your cause with pieces of evidence from the case that contradict what a classmate is saying. This is where Danganronpa is most game-y and most separates itself from being just a pure visual novel. It's also where I feel this game is at its worst. The evidence puzzles seem to usually fall into one of two categories. Either the puzzle is so painfully obvious that it feels unsatisfying to solve or the puzzle is so contrived and obscure that you have to trial and error your way into the game's very specific line of thinking. The latter is particularly frustrating when the game tries to railroad you down one particular line of thinking when other possibilities seemed just as plausible to me. There are also weird rhythm game sections during the class trial that feel weak and forced. I appreciate that the game was trying to break the monotony of just reading text forever, but I often found these sections to be more frustrating than exciting\n\nThe strength of Danganronpa lies with its storytelling. It's probably unfair to compare this with the Zero Escape games even if it's the same developer, it's a different writer, but I'm going to do so anyway. I felt Danganronpa had a pretty good cast of well written characters - probably a stronger cast than any of the Zero Escape games. If you like wacky high school anime characters, Danganronpa is your game. But I found the mystery of each murder and the overall mystery of the high school much less compelling than anything written in the Zero Escape games. The Zero Escape games had me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out "whodunnit" and how it was possible and the revelation of those mysteries was always mind-blowing. Danganronpa's murders seemed a little too random and contrived. The revelation of its mysteries was always weird and wacky, but in a way that was often too unbelievable.\n\nSummary\nDanganronpa was fairly solid - good enough for me to await the release of its sequel on Steam. But I can't recommend this game without a caveat. It's still probably unfair of me to compare Danganronpa to another game not even in the same series or by the same writer, but I feel these games are similar enough to warrant me doing so: If you haven't played 999, do that first. If you have, then know that Danganronpa sacrifices a focus on a compelling and well thought out mystery in favor of more character focused moments full of anime melodrama and silliness.\n\nFor more reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 14","true","50.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bug has been fixed since then, and I can now in recomend this game without feeling like I'm needlessly setting people up to rage.\n\n\nDanganronpa is a visual novel about a perfectly ordinary boy who gets accepted into a top tier high school and proceeds to have fun adventures with all the quirky characters he meets there. The quirky characters are also being forced to kill each other by a robotic teddy bear, and you have to solve the murders in Ace-Attorney-meets-light-gun-shooter trial sequences that end with brutal executions. Very Japanese.\n\nThe visual novel bits are half way inbetween over the top drama and standard high school visual novel fair. You have all the standard tropes: talking with people and giving the presents to increase your relationship status, multiple choice answers in which the correct choice tends to be blindingly obvious, watching your character jump between incrdibly strong willed and a total push-over as the plot demands, peeping on the girls in the bath, and having the possibility of everyone in the school developing a crush on you. That being said, I find I can stand them in here a bit better than in most similar games I play. Maybe it's that the  characters are just more interesting than most. Or maybe it's the fact that you don't know who will die at any time that makes seeing them interact so enjoyable.\n\nThe trial scenes are the meat of the gameplay. They also feel like they're about five different games mashed into one. You have spelling bees, picture matching, and what is essentialy an ace attorney segment, on a time llimit,  in a shooting range. Even if you know the answer and what to do, it's pretty difficult to accomplish everything perfectly the first time around. Fortunately, the game tends to be pretty forgiving with mistakes, although achievements require you to do some flawless runs.\n\nAlso, the plot. Can't say much of anything without spoiling a lot of things, but know that it's good. Plenty of twists, some creative motivations, and enough insanity to tide you over any boring bits.\n\nThat being said, this game is far from perfect. The trial scenes tend to be overly complicated, incorperating way too many mechanics into acomplishing what should be a relatively simple task. The English translation of the game, while generaly good, has a few moments where it has trouble getting across relevant information (As an advanced warning, the answer is schizo. This will make sense when the time comes to enter it in, and no sooner.). And the port has created some bugs, one of which was bad enough that this review was marked as negative until a while after it was patched.\n\nI stand by my assesment from the old review that this game is "good". Not for everyone, and not perfect, but good.\n\n8/10\n\n\nOld review:\n\nThis is a good game.  I really wish I could give it a positive review. But, at the moment, I can't.\n\nA few chapters into the game, my save files all vanished. Thus far, I have been unable to retrive them by any means. If you check the discussion page for the game, you'll notice multiple people are facing this problem, and that it has happened to several people multiple times. Considering this is by no means a short game, I can't in good faith recomend anyone buy it untill after the bug is fixed.","February 22","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I was turned on to Danganronpa after it released on Steam and I saw it was developed by Spike Chunsoft who was also responsible for 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, both of which I'm quite fond of despite their respective flaws. Even though Danganronpa and the Zero Escape games do not share the same writing talent, they do all feature Japanese anime styled characters and have similar-ish themes.\n\nIn Danganronpa, you play as Makoto Naegi - an average student who was nevertheless accepted to an elite high school academy that only admits students considered to be the best at what they do. During his first day of school, Makoto blacks out and when he comes to he finds that he is one of several students that are trapped in the high school. All the exit doors have been barred and the windows sealed. The high school is deserted with the exception of the students and a creepy remote-controlled teddy bear who calls himself Monokuma. Monokuma tells the students that the only way to escape the high school is by killing another student without getting caught. As the days go by, various murders eventually take place and it's up to you as Makoto to gather the evidence and solve each crime\n\nAfter investigating a murder scene and gathering evidence, a "class trial" takes place where the facts of the case are deliberated. Here, you'll often need to catch other students either misstating a fact or outright lying and support your cause with pieces of evidence from the case that contradict what a classmate is saying. This is where Danganronpa is most game-y and most separates itself from being just a pure visual novel. It's also where I feel this game is at its worst. The evidence puzzles seem to usually fall into one of two categories. Either the puzzle is so painfully obvious that it feels unsatisfying to solve or the puzzle is so contrived and obscure that you have to trial and error your way into the game's very specific line of thinking. The latter is particularly frustrating when the game tries to railroad you down one particular line of thinking when other possibilities seemed just as plausible to me. There are also weird rhythm game sections during the class trial that feel weak and forced. I appreciate that the game was trying to break the monotony of just reading text forever, but I often found these sections to be more frustrating than exciting\n\nThe strength of Danganronpa lies with its storytelling. It's probably unfair to compare this with the Zero Escape games even if it's the same developer, it's a different writer, but I'm going to do so anyway. I felt Danganronpa had a pretty good cast of well written characters - probably a stronger cast than any of the Zero Escape games. If you like wacky high school anime characters, Danganronpa is your game. But I found the mystery of each murder and the overall mystery of the high school much less compelling than anything written in the Zero Escape games. The Zero Escape games had me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out "whodunnit" and how it was possible and the revelation of those mysteries was always mind-blowing. Danganronpa's murders seemed a little too random and contrived. The revelation of its mysteries was always weird and wacky, but in a way that was often too unbelievable.\n\nSummary\nDanganronpa was fairly solid - good enough for me to await the release of its sequel on Steam. But I can't recommend this game without a caveat. It's still probably unfair of me to compare Danganronpa to another game not even in the same series or by the same writer, but I feel these games are similar enough to warrant me doing so: If you haven't played 999, do that first. If you have, then know that Danganronpa sacrifices a focus on a compelling and well thought out mystery in favor of more character focused moments full of anime melodrama and silliness.\n\nFor more reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","March 14","true","50.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You. Need. This. Game.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a port of the PSP/PSVita game, and it is beautiful. The voice acting generally breezes over, but it's still good. The character design and motives make sense especially in a bleak, hopeless environment like this, and the cases and trial mechanics hold this giant, adorable teddy bear together, to the point where the seams are nearly invisible.\n\nThe stuffing comes in the form of the story. The story is very enigmatic, and unravels slowly throughout each trial, each meeting and every step you take. The main antagonist is never who you were expecting--nothing is. The murderers are never who you expect them to be, and YOU are not what they expected. You can interact with various characters during what is known as FREE TIME, where you aren't investigating and you can build trust with whoever you'd like. Granted, certain characters' will react differently to your actions. You can also provide gifts to characters during FREE TIME, which will also allow you to build trust. Every character is eccentric in their own way, and that's what really makes them fun.\n\nWithin my short time playing this, this has become my favorite game of all time.

It's been waiting. All for you.)\n\nMaybe perhaps one of your friends started acting odd, speaking about murders and how they'll never fall to despair.\nIn most cases, after spending time with them you probably started thinking of 777 ways to avoid your next enconter with them.\n\nDont worry, they're not crazy. You don't have to avoid them.\nMost of the times.\n\nPlease be careful.\nᵗᶤᵉ ᵗʰᵉᵐ ᵘᵖ ᵒᶰˡʸ ᶤᶠ ᵃᵇˢᵒˡᵘᵗᵉˡʸ ᶰᵉᶜᵉˢˢᵃʳʸ\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWell no matter the method of how you got here to Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, allow me to explain to you the wonderful, Hopeful things you will experience.\n\no You will experience an intese, focus engulfing game that will leave you on the tip of your toes at all times.\nThere will be twists and turns every second. Whenever you try to guess or come to evidence supported conclusions the only thing you will find yourself having is more unanswered questions. More intense, completely overpowering questions.\n\no All the characters that have been poured into Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc support the game in every way. Unlike unimportant side characters in multiple other games each character here is an important indivdual with a personality that effects all the others in a unique way. No matter how they may end up at their final moments.\n\no This game can infact be very stessful, just as every game can be. The main hair pulling gameplay are the Class Trials.\nBut do not worry, there is no need to fall to despair so quickly. You will always have help, you may change the difficulty or use the many spectacular provided game guides. So seriously, have hope.\n\no Despair filled upon despair. That is a majority of the game itself. If you have a fragile heart please be cautious while playing through the amazing story. Again, no need to worry. It's alright, there is a second word besides Despair that is the main focus of this game.\nHope.\nAnd if you cannot grasp the concept of Hope overcoming any and all Depair, after completing this game- that is all that your new strengthed heart will be filled with.\n\no Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is flawlessly made with clean artwork, breath snatching clips, and ontop of it all- it records all of it and you can go back and view them at anytime.\nScreenshot it, show it off to your friends- print it and put it on your wall. You can do all of that with this game, any moment of it.\n\no After the main story, you can choose to enter a mode called School mode. School mode allows you to go into a alternate story, and through this one unlike the other that follows a major plot- you will be able to relax and get to know each character and have a deeper understanding of who they are.\nYou will also be able to play through a mini game (Tedious but worth every second.) while you are going through, so you don't get overwhelmed with all the character interactions.\n\no  This game is spectacular and one cannot compare the greatness of this game to any other.\n\nThere is so many more amazing things and pointing them out would take far too long.\nI very much encourage you to find the rest on your own.\nBesides the ones i've provided, i'm positive you will find 77+ more reasons.\n\nIf any people are like me, they will check the reviews before they purchase and play the game.\nThat is my drive.\nThe reason i felt i needed to write this long review is with the hope that people who are checking it out -people with doubt- will read this and it will boost their confidence about playing the game.\n\nThis game has helped me in more ways than i could ever possibly list.\nEven after i've finished everything there is to do with this game, and with every other Danganronpa game- I will always continue to love the things it has blessed me with.\nI want to pass on all the blessings and lessons to every person out there.\n\nIt's not perfect, it's emotional and confusing.\nThe gameplay can at times be hard.\nYour favorite characters most likely will end up dead.\nThe save files can get a bit confusing, as well as the achievements.\nIt can get so complicated you have to stop for hours at end just to process what the heck happened.\nThe long 50+ straight hours consumed to finish the story mode will infact take loads of time from your life.\n\nEven so,\nYou will never regret, even with the tiniest fiber of your being- playing this game.\n\nPlease take the step to purchase and begin Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, in the end it's nothing but absolutely amazing in all its flaws.","May 12","true","82.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games like Phoenix Wright at least has a nice reveal of the actual culprit and tying everything up without dragging it unnecessarily.\n\nI didn't encounter any issues with the PC port except for the occasional frame drop when the game switch to another characters on screen.\n\nAlso the game runs at 60FPS with up to 16x MSAA for jaggy-free despairful gameplay nyohohoho.","April 3","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You often can't leave an area till you have collected all its respective clues, so there's little chance of having to painstakingly backtrack for that one little thing you missed in order to progress, if you dislike this unfortunately you cannot turn it off. You can press TAB at any point to highlight all interactable objects in sight (an entirely optionable feature that you can avoid if you wish).\n\nThe trials are a similar contradiction-objection! deal. It's filled with a lot of evidence-themed minigames that ends with a fill-in-the-blanks comic strip to replay the events. Combined with its catchy music and ever-present countdown timerit often gives the impression of a hectic, heated debate.\n\nOverall it's not bad, you'll probably find a lot of the cases are obvious with a typical Scooby Doo twist, that said there are enough little twists to be discovered during each trial to keep it interesting as well as the motivation to discover more of the overarching storyline.\n\nA final plus in my books.

The premise is that a bunch of high school students are trapped in a kind of cage match, being heavily encouraged to get away with murdering a fellow class mate so that they alone can escape. Whenever the corpse of their fellow students are found, a Class Trial is had to try and identify the guilty student. Failure to correctly identify the murderer results in all of their deaths save the murderer who gets to escape.\n\nWhile this is not a particularly difficult game even on the hardest of settings, although there are a few times when I was scratching my head at trying to figure out what they wanted me to do, I didn't mind this all that much. Indeed I feel like the actual gameplay of the class trials to simply be a somewhat mechanically satisfying way to make you a part of the Class Trials. I very much enjoyed the many twists and turns the trials would have. Although sometimes some of the “facts” you need to convince some of your more dull witted classmates are facepalmly obvious at times, they quickly move on to more interesting questions.\n\nThere are certain aspects of the “game” which are pointlessly unpleasant, but are completely optional and don't really matter all that much. Specifically I wish the entire matter of getting “presents” and the gifting them to your fellow students was simply removed entirely. Also the post-game content of the “School Life” game is a waste of time. But despite this, the actual story of Danganronpa is very good and I really enjoyed the journey through multiple murder mysteries. It channels the same sort of vibe that that the also excellent 9 Hours, 9 People, 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward also have. I can safely say that if you enjoyed those two games then you will also enjoy this game.","March 9","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is that a bunch of high school students are trapped in a kind of cage match, being heavily encouraged to get away with murdering a fellow class mate so that they alone can escape. Whenever the corpse of their fellow students are found, a Class Trial is had to try and identify the guilty student. Failure to correctly identify the murderer results in all of their deaths save the murderer who gets to escape.\n\nWhile this is not a particularly difficult game even on the hardest of settings, although there are a few times when I was scratching my head at trying to figure out what they wanted me to do, I didn't mind this all that much. Indeed I feel like the actual gameplay of the class trials to simply be a somewhat mechanically satisfying way to make you a part of the Class Trials. I very much enjoyed the many twists and turns the trials would have. Although sometimes some of the “facts” you need to convince some of your more dull witted classmates are facepalmly obvious at times, they quickly move on to more interesting questions.\n\nThere are certain aspects of the “game” which are pointlessly unpleasant, but are completely optional and don't really matter all that much. Specifically I wish the entire matter of getting “presents” and the gifting them to your fellow students was simply removed entirely. Also the post-game content of the “School Life” game is a waste of time. But despite this, the actual story of Danganronpa is very good and I really enjoyed the journey through multiple murder mysteries. It channels the same sort of vibe that that the also excellent 9 Hours, 9 People, 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward also have. I can safely say that if you enjoyed those two games then you will also enjoy this game.","March 9","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far I've played 999 and its sequel and Danganronpa and I'm sitting here writing this waiting on Danganronpa 2 to unlock (5 more hours).\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe storytelling is the reason to play any game by Spike Chunsoft.  This isn't just a bit of fluff either, where drops of water in a desert taste sweeter, with the trappings of an epic tale (but still lacking some intangible element).  No.  The developers here have a keen sense for what makes stories compelling and have obviously worked hard to make those guidelines apply within the boundaries specific to the video game as a unique medium.\n\nI used to be in agreement with Roger Ebert who famously once said that video games couldn't be art.  The very nature of storytelling itself is at odds with the inherent nature of gameplay -- one demands that we examine choices taken and the other demands that we have some sembelence of choice ourselves.  This is what made Bioshock so compelling and successful and indeed the only other example of great storytelling in the medium, because the developers understood this tension between traditional storytelling norms and the specific constraints placed on them by the medium they're working in.\n\nTHE GAME\n\nIf you're in it for the story then great!  The gameplay is fun too, but you should know up front that all the Spike Chunsoft games (or at least the ones I've played) are more like a storybook with a game attached.  If you're afraid that might mean the gameplay is a second thought then don't run off just yet.  The story is absolutely the prime focus here and takes up the lion's share of 'gameplay' time but the game aspect is crucial and, for my part, extremely well developed.\n\nIt's not a secret that Danganronpa was developed as a graphical novel first and then gameplay was developed to add to it but, without giving too much away here, the gameplay seems like it was designed with the meaty aspects of the storytelling in mind.  I mean, I don't know, but for the themes that the story was trying to get across I felt the gameplay reinforced those themes in a way that made it more real feeling than simply reading it would (or listening to the voice acting, as it were) and I find it easy to believe that this was every bit intentional.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nPractically speaking there are 3 parts of the game:  Story time, exploration/friend making, and investigations/trial.  If you're not listening to the actors or moving between stages you're walking around the school and "making friends" or you're looking for clues and then participating in a trial.  The friendship building sub-game earns you powerups you can use during the trial phase and requires you to find/earn special coins to randomly obtain items that you'll have to figure out which person likes and give it to them at the right time -- overall I didn't like this aspect too much but it's easy enough to look things up online and I found that it didn't venture too deep into spoiler territory; it's forgettable but also interesting to hear the deeper backstories of the different players.\n\nThe trial has different phases and mini games.  Some are more or less frivolous but not without purpose; they allow for a pacing that lets the trial build and build to a big climax.  With decent twitch skills on the PC you could easily set both difficulty settings to high; one makes it a little more difficult to click targets (I think it increases reticle drift and the amount of blocking 'blue text' items that appear), the other gives you more options to select between when trying to resolve a question.\n\nTHE MOOD\n\nI figure if you still aren't sure if you want the game or not you're not sold on the gameplay (which, again, is really fun but supportive of the story rather than the other way around) and you may need to know what the game feels like.  Some people may find it kind of a spoiler but I figure it's unavoidable if you need to know about the mood, right?\n\nSo, -spoiler warning- etc.  Although not really.\n\nThe setting of Danganronpa is similar to Battle Royale or The Hunger Games -- a situation that pits young adults/children against one another in a zero sum fight to the death.  The rules for Danganronpa are a more patient, however, and the game plays out more like a series of whodunit cases where the trial determines the perpetrator of a murder.\n\nThanks to strong character development you'll find yourself with affections for the characters, carefully developed, until they betray you in some way.  The roller coaster of emotions is evocative of Game of Thrones in that it seeks to build you up only to tear you back down again.  Only difference here is that this despair is overtly celebrated and you'll find yourself intrigued with how the game invites you into the cyclical trap of hope and despair exactly as it says it will.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI really can't recommend this game enough.  There's a bit of 'made for PSP' to the edges of the game world but like most things it's overcome with tremendous style and a real passion behind the project.  You'll be "watching" more than "playing" but the strength of the storytelling is paramount here and the gameplay flows with and (more importantly) reinforces the storytelling.  There are precious few games that are like this, you need to play it to truly understand.\n\nIf you've made it this far please throw a like on the review .. I appreciate each and every one of them.  Thanks :)","April 18","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You. Need. This. Game.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a port of the PSP/PSVita game, and it is beautiful. The voice acting generally breezes over, but it's still good. The character design and motives make sense especially in a bleak, hopeless environment like this, and the cases and trial mechanics hold this giant, adorable teddy bear together, to the point where the seams are nearly invisible.\n\nThe stuffing comes in the form of the story. The story is very enigmatic, and unravels slowly throughout each trial, each meeting and every step you take. The main antagonist is never who you were expecting--nothing is. The murderers are never who you expect them to be, and YOU are not what they expected. You can interact with various characters during what is known as FREE TIME, where you aren't investigating and you can build trust with whoever you'd like. Granted, certain characters' will react differently to your actions. You can also provide gifts to characters during FREE TIME, which will also allow you to build trust. Every character is eccentric in their own way, and that's what really makes them fun.\n\nWithin my short time playing this, this has become my favorite game of all time.

It manages to be silly and serious at the same time, while adding in its own twists and turns to The Visual Novel Formula. Think of it as a mashup of Pheonix Wright, Battle Royale, and Survival of the Fittest. The game will keep you on your toes with very unexpected twist and turn that the story takes. Also a word of advice, DO NOT up anything about the series, as I literally looked up the title of this game and I was spoiled by an image that google gave me which turned out to be a major plot spoiler. Despite this spoiler though, I am still getting a lot of enjoyment out of the game. Also, 30 dollars is an extremely appropriate for the game. So far I am about halfway through the came as I just completed Chapter 3 and I have three more chapters and I believe the epilogue to go and I have already spent about 15 hours into the game. Before the first 3 chapters there was a great prologue as well. So should you buy this game? Yes, if you are a fan of murder mysteries, Visual Novels, or just looking for a great story that will keep you on the edge of your seat and provide you with awesome unique characters and plot with very zany twists, then buy this game and enjoy it! I will be buying Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair as soon as it comes out on April 18 and also Danganronpa V3 (The Upcoming 3rd Game) Whenever that comes out in english as well!","April 1","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I cannot say how ecstatic I was to see this game come to steam. However, I have many complaints about the port.\n\nThe controls are clunky,  awkward, and not well explained. It took me a few minutes when I started a new file to realize that you can only save AFTER you've gotten past chapter one. Many of the trial's mini games were horribly explained (I wanted to make sure that the controls were what I assumed them to be) but, I realized that anyone who was new to this game would have a hell of a time figuring out what the HELL the instructions meant.\n\nThe localization of this game changes a few of the character's names; giving them nicknames rather than their full names. This, and the fact that the characters are no longer refered to by their last names, destroys quite a lot of context and characterization that the original had. (ie; hearing Hagakure call everyone "name-chi" to show how laid back and unprofessional he is.)   Hearing Ishimaru being called "Taka" was something very annoying that I never adjusted to.\n\nThe grammar in the dialog is very awkward at times, and hard to read.\n\n\nThe dub is mediocre at best, some voices fit very well (Celestia, Asahina), some are decent (Kirigiri, Mondo), and some are cringe-worthy (Togami, Naegi, Chihiro)\n\n\nWith these things in mind, know that the actual game itself is FANTASTIC and a wild adventure.\n","April 9","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am now officially behind on ... everything.\n\nThe game is fantastic. It's twisted and creepy in all the right ways. It provided enough information that I would find myself solving the mysteries before the protagonist was dragged through the plot points, but it was clever enough that I couldn't be quite sure and was excited to find out if I was right or not.\n\nMy primary nitpick would actually be the bullet mechanics of the trials. The rhythm game was also not fantastic - I'd find that the beats on the screen were not actually synched with the beats of the music track...\n\nStill, would absolutely recommend this game.","April 10","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anathema-/recommended/413410/","anathema-","nh.Anathema-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anathema-/","290 products in account","This review will be free of story spoilers because really that's what you should be here for, the story.  So far I've played 999 and its sequel and Danganronpa and I'm sitting here writing this waiting on Danganronpa 2 to unlock (5 more hours).\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe storytelling is the reason to play any game by Spike Chunsoft.  This isn't just a bit of fluff either, where drops of water in a desert taste sweeter, with the trappings of an epic tale (but still lacking some intangible element).  No.  The developers here have a keen sense for what makes stories compelling and have obviously worked hard to make those guidelines apply within the boundaries specific to the video game as a unique medium.\n\nI used to be in agreement with Roger Ebert who famously once said that video games couldn't be art.  The very nature of storytelling itself is at odds with the inherent nature of gameplay -- one demands that we examine choices taken and the other demands that we have some sembelence of choice ourselves.  This is what made Bioshock so compelling and successful and indeed the only other example of great storytelling in the medium, because the developers understood this tension between traditional storytelling norms and the specific constraints placed on them by the medium they're working in.\n\nTHE GAME\n\nIf you're in it for the story then great!  The gameplay is fun too, but you should know up front that all the Spike Chunsoft games (or at least the ones I've played) are more like a storybook with a game attached.  If you're afraid that might mean the gameplay is a second thought then don't run off just yet.  The story is absolutely the prime focus here and takes up the lion's share of 'gameplay' time but the game aspect is crucial and, for my part, extremely well developed.\n\nIt's not a secret that Danganronpa was developed as a graphical novel first and then gameplay was developed to add to it but, without giving too much away here, the gameplay seems like it was designed with the meaty aspects of the storytelling in mind.  I mean, I don't know, but for the themes that the story was trying to get across I felt the gameplay reinforced those themes in a way that made it more real feeling than simply reading it would (or listening to the voice acting, as it were) and I find it easy to believe that this was every bit intentional.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nPractically speaking there are 3 parts of the game:  Story time, exploration/friend making, and investigations/trial.  If you're not listening to the actors or moving between stages you're walking around the school and "making friends" or you're looking for clues and then participating in a trial.  The friendship building sub-game earns you powerups you can use during the trial phase and requires you to find/earn special coins to randomly obtain items that you'll have to figure out which person likes and give it to them at the right time -- overall I didn't like this aspect too much but it's easy enough to look things up online and I found that it didn't venture too deep into spoiler territory; it's forgettable but also interesting to hear the deeper backstories of the different players.\n\nThe trial has different phases and mini games.  Some are more or less frivolous but not without purpose; they allow for a pacing that lets the trial build and build to a big climax.  With decent twitch skills on the PC you could easily set both difficulty settings to high; one makes it a little more difficult to click targets (I think it increases reticle drift and the amount of blocking 'blue text' items that appear), the other gives you more options to select between when trying to resolve a question.\n\nTHE MOOD\n\nI figure if you still aren't sure if you want the game or not you're not sold on the gameplay (which, again, is really fun but supportive of the story rather than the other way around) and you may need to know what the game feels like.  Some people may find it kind of a spoiler but I figure it's unavoidable if you need to know about the mood, right?\n\nSo, -spoiler warning- etc.  Although not really.\n\nThe setting of Danganronpa is similar to Battle Royale or The Hunger Games -- a situation that pits young adults/children against one another in a zero sum fight to the death.  The rules for Danganronpa are a more patient, however, and the game plays out more like a series of whodunit cases where the trial determines the perpetrator of a murder.\n\nThanks to strong character development you'll find yourself with affections for the characters, carefully developed, until they betray you in some way.  The roller coaster of emotions is evocative of Game of Thrones in that it seeks to build you up only to tear you back down again.  Only difference here is that this despair is overtly celebrated and you'll find yourself intrigued with how the game invites you into the cyclical trap of hope and despair exactly as it says it will.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI really can't recommend this game enough.  There's a bit of 'made for PSP' to the edges of the game world but like most things it's overcome with tremendous style and a real passion behind the project.  You'll be "watching" more than "playing" but the strength of the storytelling is paramount here and the gameplay flows with and (more importantly) reinforces the storytelling.  There are precious few games that are like this, you need to play it to truly understand.\n\nIf you've made it this far please throw a like on the review .. I appreciate each and every one of them.  Thanks :)","April 18","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every class trial and investigation kept me on the edge of my seat. The voice acting and art style was well made. Each trial had an unexpected conclusion which I loved. It has quite a lot of gameplay elements including walking around the school, discovering new areas, befriending different people, giving them gifts to make them like you more, getting skills from those friendships and utilizing them in trials rather than just read the text for hours. Yes there is a white visible line during trials but then again the game is a PSP port. Overall, you will have a great experience if it is your first run and you do not know anything that happens further into the game.

You often can't leave an area till you have collected all its respective clues, so there's little chance of having to painstakingly backtrack for that one little thing you missed in order to progress, if you dislike this unfortunately you cannot turn it off. You can press TAB at any point to highlight all interactable objects in sight (an entirely optionable feature that you can avoid if you wish).\n\nThe trials are a similar contradiction-objection! deal. It's filled with a lot of evidence-themed minigames that ends with a fill-in-the-blanks comic strip to replay the events. Combined with its catchy music and ever-present countdown timerit often gives the impression of a hectic, heated debate.\n\nOverall it's not bad, you'll probably find a lot of the cases are obvious with a typical Scooby Doo twist, that said there are enough little twists to be discovered during each trial to keep it interesting as well as the motivation to discover more of the overarching storyline.\n\nA final plus in my books.

The story, despite some plot holes and incoherence, succeeds to keep you coming back to the game until the very last chapter, where the predictable ending brings a disappoining final point to an otherwise entertaining manhunt.\n\nThe latter does not impact the quality of the game, as you will have been through many thrilling plot twists and revelations through the previous chapters, as the characters unveils their secrets and fantastic trials are held to convince one of them of murder.\n\nThe soundtrack, while not really versatile, is excellent and wonderfully used to create a great oppressing atmosphere.\n\n8.5/10","April 9","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a nice murder mystery plot that does keep you guessing after the inital part of the game. Don't be put off by it being labeled a visual novel, it's not really a typical visual novel where all you do is read text. It's more of a point-and-click adventure game with some visual novel elements. The story takes about 20-25 hours to complete so long as your not rushing.\n\nOn the downside, the controls aren't super intuitive, especially with M+K. Additonally, towards the end of the game there's a good bit of dialogue that flashes back to earlier parts of the story and it can get a bit annoying. If you're only playing for a bit each day then it's not quite as noticable but if you're doing a long play session it may be irritating.\n\nOverall, well worth a purchase if you like mystery/detective games.","May 7","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a whole package, the game is pretty lenghty as I clocked in 27 hours just for the main game. That is me already rushing through the game as fast as possible... with only one moment in the game that forces me to use GameFAQs.\n\nSo if you're a fan of whodunnit game and managed to avoid reading/watching Young Detective Kindaichi and Detective Conan, the game plot is pretty solid although... it is pretty predictable for me.\n\nJust be warned though, the final "boss" battle is super draggy (around 2 hours) as the writer goes all out on beating around the bush once the final "boss" got revealed. Games like Phoenix Wright at least has a nice reveal of the actual culprit and tying everything up without dragging it unnecessarily.\n\nI didn't encounter any issues with the PC port except for the occasional frame drop when the game switch to another characters on screen.\n\nAlso the game runs at 60FPS with up to 16x MSAA for jaggy-free despairful gameplay nyohohoho.","April 3","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
