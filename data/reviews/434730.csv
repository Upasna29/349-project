In some of the rooms are traps, to check a room for a trap you have to throw one of your shoes in the room. As the shoe is lost once you've thrown it in a room with a trap you can only check two rooms with traps (you have only two shoes), if there are still other traps you have to find another way to check them.\n\nThe menu is a bit confusing, for example you can adjust the mouse sensitivity not under controls but under "General", where you can also change the language (currently is only english availabe).\n\nIn Singleplayer you play - surprise, surprise - alone, you also have only two shoes to check traps with.\n\nIn Multiplayer you can play as a team - with this you can stay all together or spread out, but if you do so you'll get lost for sure so better stay together ;-)\nYou have more shoes to check the rooms for traps ofc (every person has two)\n\nOn difficulty hard are more traps than on easy but it's not like a trap coming suddenly killing you, you just need a bit more time to go through the rooms that's all.\n\nThe game is currently Early Access, you can also see this on some points, but right now it's still worth a try.","February 4","true","0.4"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","50","52","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0Bennyman/recommended/434730/","0Bennyman","0Bennyman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0Bennyman/","718 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, What exactly is Half Dead? Half Dead is a SinglePlayer/Multiplayer game which pits you and others (I presume, the multiplayer server list is currently bugged and I haven't tried it yet I am correct, that is what you do and the multiplayer is now fixed 1 day after this review) in a maze of random traps and you have to work your way through to find the Green button, how do you do this? Well you have 2 feet don't you? And what goes on feet? Shoes, so you have 2 shoes which you can fling into rooms and if there is a trap then it will activate it, if you spring a less deadly trap then you can quickly run it and grab it before the trap activates, if not and the room gets sealed off then unforunately you're down to 1 shoe. In its current state, and only because of how cheap it is, I would reccommend you check it out but mainly if you're Okay with playing it now for about 15 minutes if you can't get the multiplayer to work since Singleplayer isn't currently very exciting but it shows the concept of what the game is and allows you to get ready for Multiplayer.\nYou can now play multiplayer and it is much more entertaining, especially watching your friends or others run into a trap and get burned alive.\n\nI would hope for Multiplayer there would be a way to be the trap setter, sort of like Fable Legends, but of course with rules and limits so you can't encase the players with sealed traps. This would create more unique experiences and would be pretty fun to watch people run about your maze.\n\nI would also like to see maybe traps that are sealed but you can get out of so some aren't certain death but it would be hard to get out of, maybe random variations of each trap so you can't tell what to do straight away if you already know how to escape one of them.\n\nThe game is in the sort of stage that Who's Your Daddy is in where the games concept is there and it functions, Multiplayer apparently does work but like I said it's buggedMultiplayer Works fine!, but there is still a tonne more to be done with the game and if the developer works hard this game could be a very fun Multiplayer game and there's no reason why this won't get more popular over time.\n\nI give the game an 8/10 for now in hopes the developer will continue to develop and expand on this great idea, I imagine my review score getting much higher if development goes well. I will update my review when I can and hopefully when big changes are made and also hopefully when the game fully gets released.","February 6","true","1.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It bothers me so much.\n\nHalf Dead is a game similar to the 1997 film Cube, about a group of survivors navigating their way through a dangerous set of trap rooms. You and your friends are trapped in the maze of rooms, trying to reach the room with the exit, but if you are caught in a room with a trap, you most likely die. However, each player is aided with two shoes, which you can throw into rooms, testing if there is a trap present.\n\nAt this point, Half Dead hardly counts as a game. Most games follow the same formula: Throw shoe into room, wait for something to happen. If nothing happens, go into room. If something happens, don't go into room and wait until it is same to retrieve your shoe.\n\nThere's no strategy at all. You throw your shoe into a room and hope it doesn't blow up. From what I can tell, there's no pattern as to which rooms have traps versus which rooms don't. in the film Cube, there was a pattern to which rooms had traps. The graphics are fine, but it gets so laggy on public servers that you can barely get above 10 FPS. Not to mention the lack of traps.\n\nHalf Dead feels like a really good game that needs to have more variety and be much less random. At this point, I can't recommend it.","February 12","false","0.6"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","23","40","3","2"

But don't worry, you have two shoes that can throw around and clear booby traps with, but you will probably lose them in one of the very first rooms, like I did and have to cross your fingers that the next room holds the green "dance" floor.

There really isn't anything to this right now after you get the basics.  Only a few traps and it's basically "throw shoe in, see if trap, if not trap continue, if trap wait it out (unless its a cage trap in which case your shoe is gone and you cant go in that room ever again), find new room".\n\nMy impression from the trailer wasn't about shoe testing, but I thought the game (and this is probably my fault) was going to be about surviving skillful and trixy traps (like falling floor tiles, simon says, lazer jump rope), not sacrificing clothing to the death gods until you have to play the virgin.\n\nIt's fun and funny for a little while, but since it's not much more than random guessing a few quick decisions, it has almost no replay value despite being randomly generated...just too few trap types that (some of which) don't even matter that they are different since you aren't trying to survive them specifically but get them to activate and wait them out or run past them regardless of which trap it is.\n\nNon core complaints that will likely be addressed before releaseIt bugs me a little that there is no music slider at the moment.\nThe movement is very weird, though kind of funny how you can even accelerate in the air.\nHead bobbing trying to make things feel real, but it just makes me feel barfy if the movement is so sudden.\nI feel like this kind of trappy game would benefit from not being so bright and randomly reflective, so it feels more like a prison than a space station.\nThe sensitivity is not easily tested since it's different in spectator than playing and you have to leave the server to change it.\nIt might be a better move to cover the players face's since honestly...soul patch man and souless woman make the game feel lower quality than a nice looking space helmet which doesn't draw too much attention.\nI might be able to think of more things, but my friends and I want to play something else now so have a nice day and I hope to see some classy updates for this game.","February 18","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

All i could think while playing it was i should ask my friend if he "would like to play a game?"","February 4","true","1.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","1"

So I'm just gonna call it square.\nSquare is a game where you are put in a room with doors to other rooms which have more doors to more rooms but sometimes these rooms have traps which you must avoid by not going into that room. You can outsmart the traps (sometimes, it doesn't happen always) by throwing a shoe into them. If they trigger, it's a trap! If they don't it's probably safe, or is it?\n\nMy main issue is there isn't much meat to it. A game of this caliber being in early access doesn't necessarily work very well, it would if it had a plethora of traps and content in it to begin with, but that's the issue. There isn't\nSo my verdict for square is an 8/10.\nGood for like 5 minutes before you get bored and forget about it.","May 14","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With a group of people it is fun for a few hours. Especially with the right impatient goofballs playing with you.\nAfter a few hours it does begins to get kind of old.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/434730/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1476 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionThis game is basically a newer and improved version of the cult 1997 film called Cube, this game feels like a newer up to date version of that film. It’s a first person, sci-fi game which has a variety of different rooms which could have the possbility of having something horrible that wants to kill you in that room.\n\nGameplayThis game is basically a first person survival game. Your goal in each run is to find the exit which is in a specific room whilst you avoid not getting killed by all of the traps that you encounter in the rooms before that exit room. A mechanic that you will want to use as much as possible is being able to throw your shoe into the room to see if there is a trap in the room. Sometimes this will save you from your death rather than running into the room straight away. Obviously you only have 2 shoes to use, so using your shoes wisely, or should we call it luck, is going to be essential for each run that you play fo this game. You are able to play with friends if they own this game as well, if not then you can go on the servers that the game provides. The only problem there is that because this game is still in Early Access is that there aren’t really anyone on these servers yet, so playing single player might be the only way to play the game for the moment if you haven’t got a friend who can play the game with you as well. It can be rather funny sometimes when you are both trying to find the exit floor before you both lose your shoes to the traps that occur in almost every room. Something else that is funny about playing with friends is that you can watch them die from traps in sometimes comical ways, such as being burnt alive, getting eletrocuted and such as you just stand there and watch them die. Unless of course you are the one dying then you will just be annoyed while your friend laughs at your comical deaht. Although, after a while of seeing your friends die or yourself die it does get old pretty quicly, and just becomes rather rage enducing than anything else. I am hoping that they add a bit more variety of traps and possibly more advanced mechanics rather than just being able to throw your shoe on the ground.\n\nThe graphics in this game aren’t really much to talk about. Each room is pratically the same as the last, except it’ll have a different trap in it once you set the trap off. I do like the suits that you wear on your character, although you can really only see that if you are playing with other people. I would like to see possibly different coloured room, rather than the same room over and over again, because for me it did get a little boring to see the same room over and over again.\n\nPros+ Funny to watch die sometimes, although gets old rather quickly\n+ If you have friends who have this game it’s fun to play with them rather than single player\n+ The graphics are nicely presented, although get rather boring after a while\n+ It’s fairly simple to play\n+ For the amount it’s asking for right now, it’s definatly worth it\n+ The game is definatly worth the money it's asking for\n\nCons- Sometimes the run can be purely luck based\n- The game has a great concept, but theres a lot more that needs to be added/low content\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsFor the game being in early access it seems to have the potiential to be a really fun experience for everyone, espically with others. But for the time being there is low content in the game, and it does get a little repetitve if you play for extended periods of time. I really like the concept of the game, and hope that the developers will add loads more content to make this game really good when it comes to full release.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 21","true","1.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Add features like pushing other player into their death!\n- More traps - These traps are okay, but need more of it and diferent variation to allow player to have a small chance of surviving.\n- Random blocked door - to get to the other side of the door, they must enter from a different way.\n- Multiple floors - More of it.\n- Small hints - not an obvious hint, but hints to make the players analyze the room ahead before entering. Hints that quite hard to identify  (Maybe make it random?).\n- Destructable shoes - Shoes should be destoryed on the activation of the trap. Maybe some traps doesn't complete destroy the shoe.\n- Different Model for the player - we need some variety.\n\nIm looking forward to what this game has to offer in the future.\n\nI recommend this game. I mean like come on... Its cheaper than a candy bar.","February 10","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like a good horror / gore movie check out Cube and you will understand this game a little better.\n\n"It's a long ♥♥♥♥ing way with one boot." - The Renz\n\nThis is a fantastic deathrun / survival / Cube remake. For early access this one is well worth the money. Get a few and pass them to friends and attempt to survive to the finish.\n\nThere are a good number of traps to start with and a few will catch you off guard. It's when you feel most comfortable that one will tend to get you. The hardest setup we found was Hard on 8x8 Standard. As this places the exit randomly it seems. The long 30x3 is hard, but also easier as you know the direction in which you must go to complete the mission. So if difficulty is becoming an issue go back to standard 8x8 on hard for better times.\n\nSuggestions:\n-More traps in the future please\n-Add sound for movement as well as a detection method of traps so players can attempt to walk and not activate a trap.\n-Add a sound meter to go with the top so you know your detection level.\n-Add a body detection, so throwing a boot will not activate the trap until the player is in the room.\n-Steamworkshop down the road? If you add this as an option I am sure the community will chip in and make tons of traps, rooms, mods, etc.\n\nFantastic job to the devs, nice to see some care put into a game before a release.

These cubes look all the same and your job is to get through these cubes and reach the end. The catch is that some cubes have traps in them. You have two shoes you can throw by pressing "G". Throwing shoes into a room with a trap in it will set off the trap without harming you. I really enjoy this game and I hope it becomes a full game. I've ran into a huge issue with the game though. My main concern is that I get around 5-15 FPS no matter what graphical setting I put it on. When I first bought this game, I tested single player out and it ran at 120+ FPS. My computer is an ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop with an i7 Intel processing core and an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 860 graphics card. The graphics were set to medium by default, so I figured "I have a pretty beefy laptop, I'm sure I can turn it up to the highest settings." I turned the graphics as high as they could go and I loaded the standard single player world. This is when the FPS dropped. I quickly exited to the main menu so I could change the settings back. I then set the graphics as low as they would go, thinking it would be cool to see a game running at (random estimate) 500 FPS. When I went back into single player it still ran at 5-15 FPS. I checked my settings to make sure I set it to the lowest FPS, and it was on the highest settings. I put it on the lowest settings again and tried it again to no prevail. I've tried deleting the game, restarting my computer, and even verifying the integrity of the game cache, but nothing will work. This also happens on multiplayer. If this problem can be fixed that would be great, because other than that I haven't seen any other issues (except maybe add more content like different traps and create a level designer)","February 12","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it has so much potential. Random rooms with trap, multiplayer and throwing shoes. But I would like to see more traps and variation of it.\n\nHere's what I would like to see in the future update:\n- Competitive Multiplayer - Who gets to the finish point wins. Add features like pushing other player into their death!\n- More traps - These traps are okay, but need more of it and diferent variation to allow player to have a small chance of surviving.\n- Random blocked door - to get to the other side of the door, they must enter from a different way.\n- Multiple floors - More of it.\n- Small hints - not an obvious hint, but hints to make the players analyze the room ahead before entering. Hints that quite hard to identify  (Maybe make it random?).\n- Destructable shoes - Shoes should be destoryed on the activation of the trap. Maybe some traps doesn't complete destroy the shoe.\n- Different Model for the player - we need some variety.\n\nIm looking forward to what this game has to offer in the future.\n\nI recommend this game.

These cubes look all the same and your job is to get through these cubes and reach the end. The catch is that some cubes have traps in them. You have two shoes you can throw by pressing "G". Throwing shoes into a room with a trap in it will set off the trap without harming you. I really enjoy this game and I hope it becomes a full game. I've ran into a huge issue with the game though. My main concern is that I get around 5-15 FPS no matter what graphical setting I put it on. When I first bought this game, I tested single player out and it ran at 120+ FPS. My computer is an ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop with an i7 Intel processing core and an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 860 graphics card. The graphics were set to medium by default, so I figured "I have a pretty beefy laptop, I'm sure I can turn it up to the highest settings." I turned the graphics as high as they could go and I loaded the standard single player world. This is when the FPS dropped. I quickly exited to the main menu so I could change the settings back. I then set the graphics as low as they would go, thinking it would be cool to see a game running at (random estimate) 500 FPS. When I went back into single player it still ran at 5-15 FPS. I checked my settings to make sure I set it to the lowest FPS, and it was on the highest settings. I put it on the lowest settings again and tried it again to no prevail. I've tried deleting the game, restarting my computer, and even verifying the integrity of the game cache, but nothing will work. This also happens on multiplayer. If this problem can be fixed that would be great, because other than that I haven't seen any other issues (except maybe add more content like different traps and create a level designer)","February 12","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
