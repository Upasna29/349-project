It's been on steamdb for more than a year!\nAnyways, Ground Control II is an RTS game made by Massive Ent. (who made World in Conflict afterwards) and initially released in 2004. The key feature of the game is that you don't build bases here, you earn points by killing enemy troops and capturing control points and call in reinforcements to the landing zones you captured.\nThe game doesn't have a lot of units and only two playable factions, but every unit has an alternative mode that can drastically change its capabilities (a standard NSA trooper can turn into a heavy rocket trooper that is very effective against vehicles, but can't move); two identical Viron (the second faction) units can meld together to form a unique third unit (that has an alternative mode as well). So the game offers a lot of freedom as to how you use your soldiers.\nThe highlight of the game for me has always been the campaign. I would go as far as to say that it is at least on par with campaign of Startcraft II. It has cool cinematics, very neat sci-fi aesthetic and surpisingly good story. I am a casual RTS player, so this game is one of my favourites because of it. Not to mention that the game still looks gorgeous. I remember how astonished I was as a kid by sky reflection in the water. The music is very good and extremely fitting as well.\nOne thing needs to be mentioned however, ONLINE MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD. You can still play locally though.\nAs for this version of the game, it works fine on a modern system, but has no improvements over original release (not even Steam features like cards and achievements, which is a shame).\nThat being said, for 5$ it's a steal. Buy it, have a blast with campaign (it's pretty long) and it would be well worth it already.","July 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 109 of 115 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","109","115","4","16"

Infantry units are supposed to get beaten by tanks, but their secondary ability (once activated) allows then to even the odds abit.\n\nI did enjoy playing as a 12 year old and I still enjoy this game from time to time!\nGet it now before the sale ends!

It made the C&C franchise look like the tired, worn out beast that it was & was a match for it's contemporary; Rome: Total War every step of the way on graphics, right down to looking in the eyes of individual troops.\n\nThrow in a simple resource system, truly beautiful environments & a really atmospheric story line that from minute 1 you're convinced is destined for tragedy & defeat for you & your people... In fact, I got really attached to the characters throughout, something a lot of story-based games struggle to do, never mind a strategy game!\n\nThe game play stands up to close inspection as well; whether you're defensive or aggressive, infantryman or tank-man, there are units to suit all styles. You even get to control an alien species who can combine two of the same unit to create a totally new one. It's even reversible, so offers real tactical flexibility.\n\nThe only downside is that you still can't play as the 'evil' faction in the multiplayer, despite the game offering just as much detail & info about the units as your own.\n\nBasically, it's a truly superb RTS & all fans of strategy games should own this fabulous addition to the genre.","April 13","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not a ton of continuation of the original game however which initially disappointed me until I played and completed the game.\n\nOver the years, I have played this game continuously.  The graphics, even today, are great and better than a lot of other RTS considering the age of this game.\n\nUnits have a primary attack mode and a secondary.  Utilizing the secondary does come at a cost to the unit, though.  Infantry has rifles in primary mode and rockets in secondary.  In secondary though they lose mobility.  Every decision about a unit comes at a cost.  Be wise.\n\nThis game isn’t about gathering resources but is about spending your command points wisely and deploying the necessary units to complete the mission.  You want be overwhelming your enemy with a superior number.  You will be overwhelming them with superior weapons and firepower if you deploy your units correctly.\n\nI will recommend this to anyone who enjoys an RTS game.  Definitely get this it is worth a couple of bucks and if you’re like me and so many others you will be playing this 10+ years down the line.\n\nStill waiting for Ground Control 3.","March 1","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's amazing the in-game graphics have held up this long, and it's nice to simply watch all the little effects pop up here and there. The dropship and resource mechanic is appealing too, giving the game a much faster feel than games like Starcraft or Command & Conquer.\n\nOf course, as someone who has played the original Ground Control, how does this fare? It's a bit of a mixed bag to be honest. On one hand, the sequel really improved in some areas where I found the original to be lacking, especially in the speed department and general streamlining. Of course, it also lost a bit of its personality, doing away with or belittling  some of the original game's features that made it standout amongst its contemporaries.\n\nStill, Ground Control II is a good game and definitely worth a look for any RTS fan.","October 14, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Integrated graphics card of Radeon design.\n\nYou know how I got it to run?\n\nI disabled the Steam overlay, and when I ran it the first time I ran it as an Administrator, which helped out quite a bit. But it still wouldn't start.\n\nSo I went into the Windows settings on Windows 10 and enabled drivers and updates for Legacy software (Which yes, that IS A THING you CAN do with Windows 10,) and after reading a few of the guides on the guides page in Steam, I got it to work.\n\nBear in mind that that Lenovo was bought at Wal-Mart, on the clearance rack, for $100.\n\nAnd it runs. The ORIGINAL Ground Control too. No emluators or anything. It. Just. Runs.\n\nBefore you read anymore bad reviews and think that people who "can't get it to run but have never played it before so it must be crap and the developers are crap too because this game should be able to run and play on my 4K ultra machine blah blah blah.....\n\nTHIS GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2004.\n\nThe ONLY game to get an update that hasn't been a COMPLETE remastering that basically meant you had to pay for the entire game as far as I know is Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. (Before you ask about the new EA Star Wars: The Old Republic, yes, I know it is free. I have an account and regularly play it, but I like my classics better.)\n\nThis IS NOT a bad game. It takes some finnicking, but once you've gotten it started, you're literally half-way there.\n\nAnd for those complaining that there isn't multiplayer support:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~XXXXXX (READ THE DETAILS PAGE A BIT MORE THOROUGHLY) XXXXXX~~~~~~~~~~\n\n*Multiplayer notice: Because Massgate is no longer operating, playing over the Internet is no longer possible. Playing through a LAN is still available.\n\n^The above was taken literally a half-mousewheel-down from the About the Game/Key Features Menu^\n\nRemember that not all computers are the same. But before you discredit a very amazing game, that is literally older than most of the kids that are in Middle/High School depending on where you are, go to Wal-Mart and check the clearance rack. Most computers that are running AMD Dual-Core processors are generally going to run a lot more of the older games than a 4K Hyper machine will.\n\nOverall? Really good game, just gets a lot of flak for being too old to be viable to update anymore. Yes, there are a couple of bugs here and there, but c'mon. 2004? This game ain't half bad for being a 2004 game.","May 17","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
