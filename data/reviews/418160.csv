It does not have alot of depth but you can certainly find a challenge here. If you prefer a more casual game, you can always play on easy mode. For 4 dollars you cannot beat this.","November 9, 2015","true","10.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I'm unsure if they're new maps or the same redone. Either way they're basically new to me. Since i've forgotten the many map layouts. Cheap price, Highly recommend if you enjoy basic tower defense games.","November 29, 2015","true","11.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm not sure if it's actually easier than Garden Rescue, or if I've just gotten better at playing. Overall I found it challenging on higher levels, but not frustrating.\n\nIt's a pretty basic tower defense game, so people with more experience in the genre might not enjoy it as much, but it's cute and fairly priced.","March 2","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Thus, it simply goes for a Sunday stroll right to the target and, instead of picking it up and going back through all of the towers again, it eats its target and you get defeated.\n\n\nAnd if you do get past this part of the game, eventually you will get to a map that has no room for any more than 4 towers that when attacking, will be able to actually reach the target enemy. Upgrading them would help, howeveer you NEVER have enough money to actually do so. Also, you need twooers for ground and air, so that makes it two towers each, unless you try to use the tower that is supposed to hit land and air target, but again, you never have enough money to but this!\n\nGame developers are totally clueless these days. Why bother making a game with difficulty levels, if the easy level is so hard that you lose casual players. You may as well just have hard mode and label it as such for HARD CORE PALYERS ONLY, that way the casual players will not waste time and more importantly money!\n\nIf you really must buy this crap, ensure you check out the youtube videos on how to complete the levels. Showing such tactics as selling towers to make money and room for different types of towers, only to sell these to go back to the original type of towers. If you have to resort to this type of tactic when playing in easy mode, then the game is just pathetic.\n\nSo, as for me, the developers can stick this stupid game up their rear end sideways!\n\nDO NOT BUY!!!!","February 25","false","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was surprised that the hardest difficulty required multiple restarts. It was more challenging then I expected.\n\nYou have a few towers to start with and unlock more as you win levels. Towers have 3 different upgrade levels and there are power ups that you can pick up from enemies which are crucial on high difficulties. Most of the money auto generates from the trees much like in Plants vs Zombies with the sunflowers. You can also pick up money from the occasional enemy.\n\nIt's simple, fun, and addictive, and feels a lot like Plants vs Zombies even though the mechanics are quite different.\n\nA great TD game to add to your collection. 8/10","January 15","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
