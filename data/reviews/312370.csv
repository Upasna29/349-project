I'm a huge fan of 40k and Final Liberation.\n\nThe biggest problem is all of the games tactical potential is completely obliterated by the missions railroading you into stupid objectives to complete in an entirely arbitrary number of turns. This is not a game where you get to devise your own strategies and carry them out. Most of the mission objectives are "go from one end of the map to the other end of the map in 14 turns" or some variation there of; want to try out a gun line? Too bad. Want to try an infantry heavy force and engage in some building-to-building combat? Too bad. Want to soften up the enemy first with artillery and then use your cavalry to route them? Too bad. All you get to do is move your units to the highlighted hexes, and if you don't do it in 14 turns, you get the privilege of doing it over until you do it just the way the game wants you to.\n\nHere's another issue: the unit cap. You're limited to an arbitrary number of units, and none of the units have any sort of variation in the number of squads that you get for the slot they take up. Essentially there's very little balance between the unit variety, with some being just flat out better than the others, and point cost is rarely an issue past the first few missions; long story short, why would you ever, ever, EVER take infantry in the late game? Rheotorical question; you wouldn't, because the game sucks.\n\nOh, the deployment zone sucks too. It's just a random sprinkling of hexes you CAN deploy in adjacent to a bunch of hexes you CAN'T deploy in with absolutely no logic differentiating between the two.\n\nIf the guys at Slitherine aren't too busy developing spread sheets for the D-bags on Deadliest Warrior to plug fake stats into so they can test who would win in a no-holds-barred brawl between an Apache Warrior and an Apache Gunship for science, here is a short list of things you can do to fix your crappy game:\n\n1.) F*ck the turn limit\n2.) F*ck the unit cap\n3.) F*ck the deployment zone and FIRE whoever came up with it\n4.) Have an actual campaign map, and give the player some actual agency over what they're doing (this is optional, since it would require actual game development and I'm sure you've got spreadsheets to make or something)","October 17, 2015","false","18.7"," 590 of 676 people (87%) found this review helpful 96 people found this review funny","87","590","676","96","22"

Factories churn out endless warmachines, fearsome weaponry and galaxy conquering spaceships, while billions of recruits are press ganged into the Imperial army. And all for praise of the Emperor on his death Throne who cares not for his Worship.\nYet, you survive.\n\nThe Orks come to Armageddon. And come they do in their relentless Waaaaargghhh! , generation after generation.\nThe WarBoss is always mighty, his intellect canny, his instincts brutal but insightful. He will outthink you. His puny gretchin will overwhelm your finely trained, brutalised imperial forces if you allow them too close. His Ork Boys will cleave your powerful superhuman Space Marines from head to toe, ripping the geneseed from their bodies with massive fangs. His mighty clanking warmachines will splitter and splutter seeming an inch from disaster, and then somehow pound your Titans and Hive Cities within an inch of their miserable existence.\nThen, the brutality and carnage truly begins!\n\nCan you, mere human, stand before the might of the Orks in the 40k universe?\nYou will soon find out!\n\nAbout the gameplay:\n\nA great adaptation of W40k, done from the perspective of the tabletop game and from a more strategic viewpoint. Maybe Warhammer 40k Epic is the more apt comparison, rather than Dawn of War or the tactical fightfest of today's W40k.\nAkin to Panzer General and one must appreciate in a similar mindset.\nThe breadth of units available is very impressive, with every conceivable variant available for your selection.\nDeployment and careful marshalling of resources is key as well as playing to each unit's strength while being mindful of the end strategic objective.\nThe land is bleak and harsh. The enemy relentless and overwhelming. You must always be a step ahead or be utterly destroyed. There are plots within plots from which you must choose the storyline progression as each campaign scenario develops onward to another.\n\nThe Imperium of man must not fight these Xenos beasts on their own terms but carefully, meticulously plan and plot to ultimate victory.\nOh, it will be bloody. There will be many losses.\nMay the Emperor protect you, Lord General!","December 16, 2014","true","2.4"," 108 of 128 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","108","128","7","0"

A beautiful fantasy version of the Panzer General genre from SSI back in the days, when this genre was actually driving.\n\nWarhammer 40,000: Armageddon actually reminded me of this game. It transports the engine of the recent Panzer Corps into the Warhammer 40.000 universe. It even offers a nice, cheesy story to put the campaign into, where you lead the planetery defenders into their fight against the WAAAGH hordes attacking their planet.\n\nThe gameplay is typical for the genre, with the interesting thing, that many units offer different weapon choices to use in a fight. Also much importance is on the range of these weapons, as units can die fast. This hurts especially with experienced ones, which you can include in your permanent corps through the campaigns.\n\nThe game is still improved by it´s creators, who just released a gratis add-on dlc Untold battles too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/recommended/312370/","archy18","Archy Senpai [RTOZ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/","1440 products in account","Unlike some others, Armageddon is an absolutely wonderful addition to the family of Warhammer 40,000 games out there, alongside titles such as Space Hulk, Kill Team, Storm of Vengeance, Space Marine, and of course, Dawn of War. Warhammer 40,000 involves an entire galaxy, filled with planets, humans, daemons, and xenos, but no game has really encapsulated the sheer scale of Warhammer like Armageddon has. As such, it would not be fair to compare this game to vanilla Warhammer 40,000; Epic or Apocalypse would provide a much better comparison. It should be noted that Armageddon is used here not because of its definition, but because it is the name of a very significant planet and campaign based in the Warhammer universe.\n\nThe game features tie-ins to the long-standing lore of Armageddon, specifically the Second War for Armageddon. Characters such as von Strab, Yarrick, Dante and Ghazghkull Thraka make this game absolutely wonderful to fans of tabletop Warhammer, and some of us still have very fond memories of the battles fought on the tabletop revolving around Armageddon. This game is not about beautiful animations or fantastic looking backdrops. It is a gritty look into how a conflict over a very polluted yet industrially powerful planet could end up. The graphics do not look fantastic, that is true, but they do their job very well - they display your units, where they are, and what they should do. If you are looking for incredible, visceral combat, Armageddon will unfortunately not provide that, but Armageddon does provide deep, insightful large-scale army battles, with many unit types represented.\n\nSadly, at this point, to be honest, the game deviates a fair bit from the lore - particularly if you are following the campaign, you could find your army mostly consisting of Titans, Super Heavy Tanks, and units of Terminators and Land Raiders - all of which are in very short supply, in terms of lore. And... as a pretty low-ranking Imperial Guard commander, you're leading Space Marines and Titans??? Furthermore, for the purposes of balance, I understand why all units can harm other units (Shoota Boyz and a Titan?), but lore purists will find this troubling. And even if you aren't, you may require some pretty significant Suspension of Disbelief.\n\nEither way, the campaign is great fun and offers a considerable amount of replayability. There are a lot of units, and learning how they interact and when and where they are efficient, and where they can go and what they can do can prove to be difficult, but the end result is worth it. At least for me, it was; and for you too, if you have the patience. The wide variety of units and the varying effects were quite intriguing to watch in action. There is a limited RPG element to the Campaign too, where EXP you gain on your units/vehicles carries over and offers limited benefits, but is lost if your unit dies.\n\nFinally, but not least, the fully supported modding ability through the in-game Editor is absolutely brilliant. Not only are you able to create your own maps and scenarios, but it is fully possible to create new units, even new races. Absolutely love this game; if you are interested in this type of game and/or the setting, it is well worth the purchase.","January 15, 2015","true","46.2"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","48","60","3","1"

This Hex/Turn-Based Strategy Wargame from The Lordz and Slitherine is probably one of the best Warhammer games I've ever played and easily one of the better Wargames available on the market. It brings back fond memories of Final Liberation's combat system with an unbelieveably exhaustive list of units made for both the Orkz and the Imperium of Man (Steel Legion, various Space Marine chapters including Blood Angels and Ultramarines) and even features a simplistic yet superbly voiced campaign mode that really draws you into the conflict for Armageddon. Each unit features differing weapons, art assets and each has it's own strengths and weaknesses (aka, Basilisk is ungodly terrifying at range but terribly vunerable if engaged in melee with a Big Dredd). While this isn't a new Dawn of War, it is no less a great game from the Warhammer 40,000 franchise and shows a promising future for the universe.

This game is not an attempt at making a direct adaptation of the popular tabletop game by Games Workshop, though it is set in the same universe, nor is it an attempt at making a spiritual successor to Final Liberation (an old PC game), which some reviewers seem to indicate was what they expected it to be. This is Panzer Corps with a 40k coat of paint (Panzer Corps in turn is like a modern update on Panzer General 2, which had its own 40k version called Rites of War).\n\nGraphics & Sound\nAt first glance 40k: Armageddon is not an impressive looking game. While the sprites are relatively detailed, and the maps look good, the sprites look like they hover above the map. The game does not fare better in motion, with very simple looking animations for firing, and no animations for movement.\nThe sound is equally underwhelming. It does its job, but nothing about it really stands out. The weapons sound like what they are supposed to be, for the most part, but for a game world known for having oversized guns, almost to the point of self parody,  one would expect there to be a bit more to the sound effects of those guns.\nBut while nothing looks & sounds particularly impressive, everything looks like what it's supposed to be. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the 40k universe will be able to identify most vehicles and units and figure out what they are armed with by just looking at them. And this ease of identification is very important to the game, as there are a lot of different units to keep track of.\n\nStory\nThe story in the game is not given center stage, instead it just serves as a reason for why you're fighting on Armageddon. It follows the second war for Armageddon, one of the most important wars in 40k history. If you're familiar with 40k lore, you'll likely know exactly what's going to happen, so the story will offer no surprises. To anyone not familiar with 40k lore, the story will likely feel poorly explained. This is not something that really hurts the game though.\n\nGameplay\nIt's in the gameplay department that 40k: Armageddon really shines. Before each battle, you're allowed to put together an army consisting of imperial units (at first only Imperial Guards, but later you also get access to Space Marines). And there's a staggering amount of units. The game boasts over 300 different units in total, between the two sides. With so many units, you're given a lot of freedom to design a force that suits your playstyle, and the upcoming scenario. And the vast majority of all units feel useful. Someone could probably figure out which units are the optimal ones, but there don't seem to be an glaring balance issues (take note GW).\n\nThe battles are played with a simple IGOUGO system, meaning that you take your turn to move all units, and then the opponent takes its turns to move all units. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, and are armed with different weapons, so like in most other games of this type, the trick is to use the right units against the right targets. Infantry in good defensive positions are hard to dislodge without melee units, tanks need anti-tank weapons for you to effectively deal with them, and so on. Certain units are able to support other units when they're being attacked, and making good use of terrain & choke points is often important. Nothing about the gameplay is groundbreaking, but it is well made, the scenarios feel challenging but fair and the game is a joy to play.\nEvery mission has a turn limit. This is something that a lot of people seem to dislike, but without the turn limit, the game would probably have become too easy. Personally I've always had several turns to go after each level, and the turn limit has never interfered with my playstyle, but anyone who turtles a lot might run out of turns.\n\nClosing thoughts\nWarhammer 40,000: Armageddon is a really good game, and it's a really good 40k game. It does the license justice and is often more consistent with how it presents things than the official writers for GW, who often contradict core portions of the lore.\nThe only reservation I have is about the price. Niche games are often more expensive, as they expect to sell fewer copies, but the price point of 40k: Armageddon makes it a hard sell to anyone who don't already know that they will like the game, and the screenshots make the production value look rather low. A lower price point would probably attract more customers who would be willing to take a risk at the game. Because it is a good game, a very good game, and it is a game with a lot of content. Don't be surprised if beating the main campaign takes over 20h. Fans of Warhammer 40,000, and fans of games like Panzer General should give this game a try. As for everyone else, it might be worth waiting for a sale, or trying the demo for Panzer Corps to see if they like these types of games (Panzer Corps is a slightly more complex game than this, but it's still similar).","February 26","true","18.9"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","50","66","2","5"

I was very excited about it when I first saw it.  I would love to say it's a good game, and it has alot of good things (which youtube and steam reviews are posting no small portion of).  I certainly won't say it was a bad game, but without repeating what other people have already said, I have some problems with it because I felt largely disappointed with this game.  Let me begin with its virtues, while trying not to repeat what everyone talks about in depth.\n\nPros\n1) A present plot of sorts taking place during one of the major campaigns in 40k history (I didn't mind the voice acting too much)\n2) Nearly all inclusive by way of units (Forge World and Games Workshop both)\n3) Almost all Imperial Guard units are Steel Legion themed (some crews are still Cadians)\n4) Very classic and well structured game mechanics\n5) This game can be played without ANY space marine support (which I largely found inferior to fielding more Imperial Guard hardware).  Finally a game that doesn't cater to GW's "space marines are what it's all about" theme.\n6) The weaponry works fairly true to canon and tabletop standards (a Punisher gatling cannon is good against infantry, but does nothing to vehicles).  Basically, if it'd work on the tabletop, it'll work here (and vice versa).\n\nCons\n1) Beyond the dialogues between missions, the plot is absent to the gameplay.  I would have liked some cutscenes (at least a closing one).  Instead, the campaign ended and it just sent me back to the main menu.  Additionally, they added some elements that seemed rather unnecessary (such as the inquisitor showing up and trying to "recruit" you).\n\n2) The forces you can assemble lack a sense of proportion to the realism of the 41st Millenium.  In the final mission, I fielded approximately 10 Reaver titans, 8 Basilisks, 9 Steel Legion infantry units, plus the "command group" of Yarrick, 2 chapter masters, the drill sergeant, and the detachment of Ultramarines.  For easily the later half (if not 2/3 starting in part 2), the titans and basilisks took up the VAST bulk of the fighting with infantry moving up only to capture objectives.  I didn't feel like titans were rare assets, or limited in number available to the war waging across an entire planet.\n\n3) By way of the Factions (Imperium and Orks), the armies/clans within them are almost completely left out.  They mention extensively about how you're part of the Armageddon Steel Legion, but they make no mentions to the Ash Waste Militia, Hive Militia, or even Jungle Fighter regiments that Armageddon maintains in its PDF (the best they get is Hive Gang Militia units, which are hardly regimental strength).  Stormtrooper companies and every Ork clan (like Goffs, Evil Sunz, Snakebites, etc) are completely left out.  Variances between the Space Marine chapters are minor at best.\n\n4) While a hex based game brings back ALOT of good memories for us long termed gamers, for a 2014 game, I expected better graphics, unit models to face all directions (that was mentioned in another review).  Aircraft function like aircraft, not another ground unit who's only unique feature is they can move over impassible terrain like rivers and mountains.  A more prominent role for the VIP's of the campaign (Dante, Yarrick, Ghazghkull, etc).\n\nIn short, Warhammer 40k: Armageddon is a nice game, excellent in how it even breaks from the Games Workshop ultimate sanction for space marines and their typical themes of Cadian uniformed guardsmen praising the Angels of Death for saving them.  They incorporated almost everything a 40k player (particularly an Imperial Guard tank player) could want for their army.  The game mechanics can be said to be reasonably good.  However, this game has no feel of being new.  I would have expected to see this game as it stands back in 1995 (give or take), not 2014 (almost 20 years later). It also still needs some work to get completely in tune with the 40k lore (like Imperial Guard regiments, Ork clans, etc).  I was hoping for a GREAT game, but found a decent one instead.  Even with it's 20 year retro and my minor grievances regarding 40k lore to game practicalities, I'd still suggest people have a go at it.","December 9, 2014","true","22.3"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","34","47","0","0"

Those expecting the second coming of Dawn of War (technically, third, I suppose) will be sorely disappointed.  Those looking for a solid, turn-based strategy (TBS) game on a hex-based map will likely be quite pleased.  Fans of the WH40K fluff will also be pleased, as you get to personally participate in the major events that make up the 2nd War for Armageddon.  Personally, I'm loving the game thus far.\n\nIn terms of raw gameplay, the game itself is very much an old-school wargame.  It's somewhat similar to games like Steel Panthers, although it's perhaps not quite as granular in its depiction of combat as that series.  I haven't played the Panzer General or Panzer Corps games, but I hear it's similar to those (Panzer Corps especially, which is no surprise since they're made by the same company).  Anyway, it's a TBS game on a hex-map.  Units are allowed one movement and one firing action per turn (although you can move more than one space, obviously, and units with multiple weapons will use all of them, if they're in range).  Alternatively, you can reinforce a unit, or recover morale.\n\nAt this point, I've only played Act I, but there is a good variety of units available.  It can actually be a bit overwhelming at times, and you may find yourself turning towards both the game's manual and the online message boards for information on the difference between a Leman Russ Vanquisher and a Leman Russ Conqueror.  Once you learn what the different units do, though, you realize that you can build a very specialized force (or a very general-purpose force, if you want).  On the surface, the game may seem fairly simple to veteran wargamers, but there's depth to be found as well, in terms of different terrain effects (Line of sight, cover), units that support each other (meaning that, when the supported unit is attacked, the supporting unit will retaliate as well as the attacked unit), and all the usual rock-paper-scissors (or infantry-artillery-cavalry, I guess) balancing you'd expect in a wargame.  I found that, while initially bewildering, once I understood my options better, I really appreciated the variety, even as it sometimes made it difficult to decide what units to bring in a given scenario.\n\nYour core force will gain experience as you play, and you can change experienced soldiers into different unit types within the same class (so a bog-standard infantry unit can be upgraded to a harder hitting unit) over time.  You'll want to do this, as the difficulty ramps up and you find yourself facing tougher challenges that require a more specialized response.  Understanding what the different stats mean will help with this.  I recommend looking at this thread from Slitherine's (the developer) board: http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=3827148.\n\nStory-wise, for fluff fans...it's the 2nd War for Armageddon, with you playing as the Imperial Guard.  You can probably guess what you do in it.  For those unfamiliar with the WH40K fluff, the story is fairly typical of the in-game universe.  You have a planetary invasion by an enemy force (Orks in this case -- no chaos or eldar so far, but we can hope for DLC...).  You play the primary campaign as the Imperial Guard -- the "grunt troops" of humanity, rather than the elite Space Marines, at least at first.  (After the first Act, you can start playing as the Space Marines, and get access to Titans as well.)  You have a LOT of vehicles to bring with you (which is your major strength), so you can really enjoy some combined arms action.  Anyway, aliens invade, incompetent planetary governor puts everyone in peril, and it's up to the Guard to save the day or at least hold out long enough to be reinforced/relieved.  Missions are a nice mix of assault, defense, and maneuver, and sometimes a bit of all three in the same mission.\n\nI'd say the only other major caveat (aside from this being a TBS game and requiring you to actually learn how to play it) is the graphics.  Look, this isn't a AAA whiz-bang graphical cornucopia.  The game isn't designed that way.  Your units don't animate, really (although you have the animation of different types of weapons firing and such).  This isn't Total War, where every individual trooper is animated and doing his own thing.  That said, the sprites in the game are perfectly fine for what they are, and look sufficiently detailed.  I have no complaints about the graphics, but I knew what I was getting in the game and had no illusions about the graphics.  The hand-drawn panels and backgrounds that serve as the "cutscenes" between missions, however, look lovely.  Again, though, they are static and not animated.  Voice acting is perfectly fine for the game.  It's not Oscar-worthy, but it gets the job done perfectly well.\n\nOn the whole, I really enjoy the game, but I'm also a fan of the fluff and of games of this sort.  For my money, it was definitely worth the price I paid.","December 9, 2015","true","183.1"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","36","53","2","0"

Exactly, how warhammer 40k video games should be played!  Bonus points for telling the story from an IG perspective, but I'm personally a bit biased towards that. ;)\n\n-The mechanics are solid.\n-The veriety of units is amazing!\n-The models look really good, if you like 2 sprites and what not.\n-The meta between scouts (vision), tanks (armor), infrantry (control), and artillery (range) is pretty cool.\n\nI think some people might complain that the game doesn't warn you that a unit has not fire and could fire before you end your turn.  But, on the flip side of it, I can see that it could be annoying if I deliberately have my unit hold fire (so that it's not shot back), and the game needlessly reminds me of it.  So, all good.\n\n10/10","December 6, 2014","true","33.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I can't tell you whether it's any good or not, I can only say that, at the easiest level, this is a lot of fun.\n\nThe full price is ridiculous, but the Steam question is, "do I recommend this game?" to which the answer is yes, just don't buy it full price. I got it in a sale, including most, but not all, the DLC.\n\nThere are lots of different looking units, but once you find the ones you like, the ones that suit your style, then you'll wind up with a lot of them, and no real reason to delve into the differences between the ones you don't use.\n\nthe dramatic script is a bit teenage, voice acting is pantomime standard, but to be honest that's what I like. I like to be able to hiss at a badly drawn cardboard villain.\n\nI am not, in real life, a hex based, table-top, fluff-obsessed , hobbyboi, who can tell the difference between a weirdboy and a painboy from behind, in the dark, at ten paces. I just don't care. (but if you do, this is not the review you are looking for) However, the higher levels of difficulty seem to be unfair, and consequently, not as much fun for the less-than-dedicated player, like me.\n\nIt's a fairly old looking game, the graphics are a bit ... well ... boring really, but I still play Heros of Might and Magic III, (not the HD version neither) and this has that same "one more turn" thing going.\n\nSo yup, I'd recommend this game if you're a  a lonely, rich, tabletopper, with an eye for detail and many, many empty hours to fill. Otherwise, get it in a sale, set it to easy and drift along with the story whilst enjoying crushing Orcs under the stompy feet of your Imperial Titans.\n\n","January 5","true","86.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

If you like Warhammer 40K, then you should love the story, and if you aren’t familiar with the series, it’s still really good. Game play is great, very straight forward and easy to follow. Lots of units and variety, with no clear dominant unit. Get a lot of powerful titans and watch yourself lose a lot.\n\nThat said, it does have some problems. Sometimes the dialogue is confusing and it can be glitchy (instant healing enemies for no reason, won’t read a save file, etc.) on both my computers. The game won’t show you how many turns you have to complete a mission until after you deploy. And, you are forced to use your units from the previous mission. This isn’t a big deal until they give you a mission where an armored column is the most effective, then next mission you need a lot of infantry, etc. The map editor is very limited (I.E. you can’t pit steel legion against steel legion, only the other forces). However, worst of all, there is no skirmish mode.\n\nI would love to see them open it up so that you could say pit Ultramarine against ultramarine. Especially an AI controlled opponent, so you don’t have to wait a long time on your opponent and can practice various strategies.","November 11, 2015","true","43.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

If this is a deal-breaker for you, don't bother with this game. That said, the sprites look very nice and explosions and other effects are are good too. The graphics are very clean and functional, you won't have to guess if a unit is in cover or has LoS blocked.\n\nSound effects are good, but music is disappointing. I switched to Dawn of War soundtrack after a few hours. There is some voice acting in the campaign and it's been fine so far.\n\nGameplay is similar (not identical) to old 40k titles like Rites of War or Final Liberation. This is a very loose adaptation of tabletop 40k rules. There are some balance issues that I hope will be adressed, but I haven't seen anything gamebreaking so far.\nThe game only has 3 factions, but the number of units they have is mind-boggling, including weird/obscure stuff like hive militia or space marines with grav guns. Very nice. Some options that I thought would be there are missing (for example sentinels can only have lascannons, no flamers, no multi-lasers etc).\n\nAI seems alright so far, although it's sometimes a little too passive.\n\nCan't really comment on the editor yet, it seems really simple to use.\n\nIs it worth the price? If what I wrote sounds like the type of game you've been waiting for, then go for it. If you're on the fence, or don't have much experience with this kind of turn-based games you might want to wait for a bigger discount, this game is not for everyone.","November 27, 2014","true","36.0"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

I find it hard to complete matches.  If you play this game thru PBEM, and you start to lose, either surrender or just keep fighting.  The current trend of ignoring your turn eternally once the match is starting to tilt away is just bad sportsmanship.  I lose matches, and always give them the satisfaction of the victory screen that I want to see when I win. IJS\n\nANYWAYS, they just added the first DLC scenarios.  FREE.  Lordz is working hard to make this game great.  I stopped playing for awhile to try and thin my library backlog a bit (50+ hour rpgs that I decided to play thru all this winter)  as of this update on Feb 24, 2015, This game is WAYYY smoother interface wise than it was when I first played it.  NO, they won't make it a 3d graphics dynamo, but any missing feature has a chance of being put in.  The devs obviously care for the game and the community surrounding it.\n\n\n50 HOUR MARK... 3 weeks after release and there has already been a second patch.  The devs are on the forums, both here and at slitherine, listening to us about what we want in the game.  They have added numerous features like tooltips and info screens.  They have been and are going to continue with balance, and both Slitherine and Lordz personnel has stated that the game has an immense future.  DLC in a slitherine game is what it should be.  No cosmetic features for sale here.  No removed content.  Full campaigns!  I also have taken to the WH40K "fluff".  Intriguing.  After studying up on this war, they really do a good job at faithfully recreating the feel in the game.\n\n30 HOUR MARK...  Multiplayer thru PBEM is fantastic!  The community is great!  The written scenarios are very well done.  Very fun.  Some question the lack of epic feel of the 2nd war for Armaggedon.  The late midgame maps seem pretty epic to me!  Titans, heavies, troops everywhere!  Don't overcommit or you'll get flanked!  Now I am thinking about WH40K TT again...well, this is close enough for only for 40$.  I LOVE this game!\n\nMy Warhammer experience is very limited. Limited to watching a couple games for a few minutes in the mall.  Strategy games are my favorite kind of game.  Especially turn based.  Time to think is the great equalizer.  I'm getting old.  My fps skills are not what they were, and pales in comparison to those of some kid who skips classes to play 12 hrs a day.  At least some of my steam hours are spent sleeping at a title screen because my kids tired me out before I even got game time in.\n\nI picked this up during the steam sale at a great price because of a steam glitch.  I have no interest in Warhammer per se, but I recently discovered Slitherine after being a console guy for the last 7 years with no gaming rig and a 360.  I played Hell, Battle Academy, and Panzer Corps as well.  All similar turn based table/board like wargames, however very different.  Of the 4, Warhammer has been the most fun so far.\n\nSince I never read any warhammer, the lore is generic to me.  I have no emotional attatchment.  I do think the atmosphere is very cool tho.  There are a redicuous amount of units in this game.  groups of similar units with slight variances seem like reskins, but they make ALL the difference in the tactics of each scenario.  Especially on the harder settings, The slight edge in defense might mean one more turn alive as a stopgap, bringing you that much closer to holding your objective till that last turn.  The one with a tic less def and more range attack would help in an offensive situ.  The game plays kinda similar to panzer general (same dev, maybe this is a beefed engine).  While that game is more historic, this one will provide with the thrill of holding a chokepoint against a HORDE of slowly advancing enemies.\n\nTypical Slitherine mechanics are present.  Zones of control are there, but left invisible.  You will just notice that you cant move thru an enemy rank to flank, you need to skirt it.  Not very prudent in a limited turn scenario.  With the turn limit in play, you need to improvise.  This isn't a group up on individual enemy unit type game.  You will need to multitask.  The UI isn't fluffy.  It is servicable.  Everything is there.  Lots of mousing for tooltips over tiny buttons.  However, this isn't an RTS.  You don't need efficiency.  The UI almost encourages you to slow your roll and THINK.  EVERY TURN counts.  This isnt a click end turn fest like a civ game.\n\nIf it seems I'm gushing, I may be.  I am not a Matrix fanboy.  I never bought the games because they are pricy.  Lately, slitherine and some others have realized that the market has room for them at a slightly reduced price point.  They realized that early adopters of software, especially complex mechanics like these, will be beta testing to a degree.  No amount of beta possible for a smaller outfit like them could get all the balance issues.  I don't mean bugs.  I mean tweaks.  The hundreds of playstyles converging on the forums will induce changes in the game from both the developers, who frequent the forums, and the mod community.  Editor is included.  I already love this game, and it WILL get better for a while.  Moderately priced dlc scenarios will be coming I'm sure.  Usually they are full campaigns.  If they keep them at 10-15$, I may buy them all.  More than that well see.\n\nIt seems this game is aimed at the warhammer TT fans.  Possibly the older crowd.  It has been said that this game looks old.  It does.  It plays smoothly however.  The graphics are just fine for a digital boardgame.  No, not late 90s.  Go put a late 90s game in and change the res to 1080p without a mod and see how good the models look.  Pretty graphics games are often like many models.  Beautiful, but try to have a 20 minute conversation with them that has any complexity to it.  My first girlfriend was gorgeous, but a box of rocks.  I swore never to make that mistake again.  I digress, slitherine makes games that are repops and adjustments to a longstanding hobby.  Many Warhammer fans may be used to the flashy 3d RTS games.  This isn't one of those.  This is for those fans who maybe desired a digital table top game that you could play without a friend and a ride.\n\nIf you are a warhammer table top fan get this game now.  Don't worry about the whining about animations etc.  If you are a slitherine fan or wargamer, get it.  Great take on the Panzer Corps angine.  If you don't want a complex wargame, and need flashy direct x 11 graphics, save your money.  Or don't.  You may not know what you like if you don't try it!  The one bad thing I have to say, is that the manual is very brief.  It barely covers the basics, and the deeper mechanics of the ruleset go unexplained.

A few rough edges, but nothing that you really even care to be bothered about, since all the other bits of the game are gold. Also, the rough edges should be pretty easy to polish with a few patches. Namely the lack of assault animations (sort of the biggest of my griefs), enemy turn speed slider, and somewhat vague manual (the stats are pretty straighforward once you look into them though).\n\nHaving progressed a bit futher into the game, I also love the differences in types of scenarios presented, they are starting to branch out from what I got used to playing Panzer Corps.\n\nStrongly recommend for everyone who liked Panzer Corps, and loves WH40k. If you're just a WH40k enthusiast, a word of warning though. This is not the tabletop game, nor can any game ever be (probably.) Things work with their own set of rules, however the units and their uses are easily recognizable from the original lore.","November 27, 2014","true","173.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

There is no denying it, it feels almost as if it's not even a GW game.\n\nTool tips are poor at best, even though information is given still not sure whats it's about!\n\nGretchin with 80% accuracy? really? did you guys even know what a gretchin is like in the game and yet he has a 80% accuracy and gets a range and melee attack? They had blunderbuss's and that 1 attack range or 1 attack melee not both. kinda stupid gretchin fighting as good as rough riders.\n\nGraphics look rather dated.\n\nUnit list? If i have the resource points to buy something why can't i? Why would you limit the number of units a person can have plus combine a resource manager? If i want to swarm with conscripts why can't i? why do i have ot say hey well your useful but since i'm limited on how many units i can your not good enough when there are better.\n\nMission objects. WTF are they? Was falling back south to the second continent when i had to do a jungle defense. turn 8 i get told defeat. No orcs had made it through my line, they hadn't captured any bases past me and i hadn't pushed forward.\n\nI reload the map and restart it and it DOES NOT give any mission objectives. I click continue when i'm defeat and it prompts me to start from the every 1st mission again. Do you realise how annoying it is to be told your defeated when you have no idea why?\n\nExperience? No idea how this plays out or how to earn it.\n\nScouting with rough riders or scout tanks is a damn nightmare, haviong fog of war and no option to use move points they haven't been used it just a waste of troops. Don't know how many times a rough rider unit moves forward half way it's possible move and run into orks and then died as sure you only moved half your possible distance but now you can't move anymore. This mechanic makes scouting pointless might as well turn fog of war off.\n\nwhy no tool tips when you hover over orders, you realise how much hassle it was to work out how to repair units?\n\nSupport units, how exactly do they work? as this is no mechanic i know of in 40k.\n\nArmy size small.\n\nMap size tiny to what i thought they would be.\n\nYet once again i get lured into a death trap of a game due to the GW symbol and to think i was giving this a go due to Blood Bowl 2 being put back. Damn you BB.\n\nLet just say friends of mine have asked for a review on Monday on what i think and so far i'm giving this a 3/10.\n\nsure it's a turn based game and i like that thing, but it plays nothing like 40k from which it's drawn.\n\nNow as for the limited Armies to pick from, can't say how Highly Disappointed i am!!!!!!\n\nOrks and Imp Guard really? Now i've read this forum and i see dev saying hey this is all the IP rights we have. Well guess what either your screwing us or GW is as i know Black Templars and Salamanders codex 1st came out with the release of Armaggedon. Eldar craftworlds also came out, i still have the Armaggedon Codex in my games room if you want to try dispute that one with me.\n\nPlus there was also chaos, so really this is a rather poor pathetic attempt to suck money out of GW fans with a sub standand game that has only the title and unit names are from the 40k GW universe that this is suppose to be planned from.\n\nNow how exactly does 1 get a refund since this is nothing like what i expected to get when i paid my hard earned $30US for.\n","November 27, 2014","false","3.8"," 54 of 95 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","54","95","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesunsets/recommended/312370/","thesunsets","General Hoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesunsets/","28 products in account","Hi Steam-community,\n\nThis review has two sections.  The first section is the brief summary, the second section is more intense and detailed.\n\n\nSection I\n\nThis game is really amazing! It surprised me with how good it is.  Sorry for the negativity, but I must honestly say that I was not going to ever buy this game.  It took me around two months to decide, I almost did not decide, then as soon as I did I had instant buyer's remorse.\nI had a low opinion of the game (without playing it) because I watched youtube videos of people reviewing/talking about the game, and because I read reviews of the game (on the steam community, mostly).  I can most thoroughly state that these negative, very negative, and polemical reviews lack a fundamental understanding of these games and have the wrong expectations of what the game means.\n\nAs for the game, it is so awesome!!!! To explain in simple terms:\n1) Essentially, this is a Warhammer 40,000 version of Panzer Corps\nA) Panzer Corps, for those who do not know, is a re-make and grand extension of THE classic strategy game, Panzer        General\n2) Very complex, detailed game\n3) the most realistic Warhammer 40K game made so far: 40K games are not known for realism ;)\n4) near endless hours of replayability\n5) more difficulty levels then the average gamer could actually need :-)\n6) Armageddon belongs to a rare category of game called "strategy", this is not an RTS game\n7) so many units\n8) tons of subtle differences between unit types\n9) a distinct lack of disturbing gameplay (♥♥♥♥, torture, mutilation)\n\nTo summarize, try this game! It is great.  The game is really rewarding for those who do not consider "strategy" to mean the same thing as "real time strategy".  This has been the absolute best purchase I have made for a game on steam that I originally thought was absolute horse droppings.\n\nCheers!\n\n\nps......more specific information below:\n\nSection II\n\nWhat does this game not have:\n1) sexual themes, including:\n--misogyny\n--semi-pornographic scenes♥♥♥♥♥♥ences\n2) extreme violence/gore/torture\n3) constant flashing/strobing lights\n\nWhat the game does have:\n1) numerous DLC's\n2) really great graphics (for this type of game)\n3) fun and involving missions\n4) huge number of units\n5) great maps\n\nBest comparisons:\n1) Go, Chess\n2) Hearts of Iron (but more intuitive)\n3) Civilization IV (but more complex)\n4) Warhammer 40K (actual 40K, the miniatures, not a video game like dawn of war)\n\nThis game is essentially a Warhammer 40k version of Panzer Corps, Panzer Corps is a re-make of an older game called Panzer General.  Panzer Corps is the most intensive and complex strategy game that I have ever seen, while at the same time being very fun, historically accurate and easily playable with an incredible number of difficulty settings.  Armageddon plays just like Panzer Corps, but with a Warhammer 40k setting.  This game also is a more rookie-friendly adaptation, being far less complex and easier to learn to play.  Veterans of the Panzer Corps games who also like 40K will find this to be quite fun, but this game does not fairly compare to Panzer Corps and is really a simplified version of that game.  Of course, compared to most "strategy" games out there on the market, this game is still head and shoulders above the crowd.\n\nThe best way to think about games like this is as a massive, and far more complicated, Chess board.  One moves pieces around, on a turn by turn basis, and then the opponent does so.  Humans players are completely irrelevant: the AI is more then enough and actually the vast majority of people that play these games is not capable of beating the best AI levels anyway.\n\nTo be fair to the game, a review of this game really ought to be at least 18 pages because there is so much to say about this game and how it works.  Please excuse this brief review! Do what I did, roll the dice, purchase the game and find that "old-school" strategy games were really popular and famous for a reason.\n\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n\n","March 5","true","28.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Finally, while the base missions tend to fit my playstyle pretty easily, theres also a easy to use scenario creator (dont remember what its called), so you can make your own scenarios to fit a slow advance or whatever you want.\n\nObviously nothings perfect, and i wouldnt say this game is for everyone. Missions can get very challenging rather quickly and almost every missions starts off with being outnumbered by what feels like 1:100. Personal problem is a lack of space wolves but cant really complain because i dont really know the details of their license.\n\nSo to kinda sum it up, It's a fun but frustrating game that involves quite a bit of forethought before making a move and I would kill for a bit of customisation but I know how difficult something like that would be to add if they were even allowed to do it in the first place","January 18","true","10.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It's got Space Marines, it's got Orks, it's got trenchcoat-toting soldiers with laser guns, and it's got Titans. Game mechanics are solid, and challenging without being frustrating. The campaign is fun and interesting, although they really should have hired a better editor for the dialogue, preferably one that knows 40K lore; there were several misspellings and misuse of key terms ("exterminatus" is not the faux-latin term for executing insubordinate officers, it's the term for annihilating PLANETS).\nThe graphics are laughable, but we're not here for shiny next-gen pictures. We're here to listen to laser guns go "pew pew!" and watch little numbers get smaller.\nSo on the whole, this is solid. But there were some very odd design choices made as it was being developed that bear noting. It's okay that the game doesn't perfectly mimic the tabletop game, but some decisions in the design are just bizarre. They're mostly small things, though. Jump infantry can't leap over obstacles and enemies (which is the whole point of their troop type). Some unit models clearly have weapons like power fists or turret sponsons that aren't registered on their unit profile and therefore don't fire with the rest of the weapons. The game gives us dozens of variations of Leman Russ battle tanks, but apparently doesn't feel like putting the same effort into infantry options; there are a lot of weapons and options in the Imperial Guard and Space Marine infantry list that are simply unavailable to the player. Not a huge deal, but kind of galling when the player is flummoxed by the sheer variety of armor. And for some reason a Space Marine Predator is tougher than a Leman Russ battle tank, when it should be the other way around, but that might be a little to esoteric a complaint.\nSpeaking of infantry, the game's campaign mode has absolutely nothing like the force organization chart that is the staple of Warhammer tabletop games. Compounding this flaw is the fact that your army is primarily limited by an absolute number of unit slots, and that each unit takes up one slot whether it's a pack of Conscripts or a Baneblade. As such, as the game advances, the player is able to - I might even venture ENCOURAGED to - build an utterly unbalanced army full of titans and superheavy tanks and elite infantry. There's essentially no reason to keep weaker units around; as you get access to Space Marines you'll inevitably swap out your Steel Legion infantry, because... why wouldn't you? Space Marines are better in every way, and during later missions the Orks field very few units that Steel Legion infantry can effectively fight, no matter their experience level. The only advantage of older infantry units is their cheap point cost, but you're given enough points at the beginning of each deployment phase to buy most of, if not everything that you want (you do want to save some for ordering replacements). And once they're on the field, the tougher and better-armed units usually pay for themselves by being better in combat. I would have preferred a more nuanced and balanced approach.\nThese problems are unlikely to be fixed, as they're probably embedded too deeply in the game. But none of them are deal-breakers and the game is still a lot of fun. Purge the xeno!","January 10, 2015","true","32.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

The gameplay appears similar, but it is only superficial. It lacks some of the bits that make PG/C great though it is hard to define what those are. Sure the UI is slightly deficient and there are some unit balance issues, but the problems seems more fundamental than that.\nIt is hard to build raport with your core units as they easily get wiped out, and unit replacements only dilute experience. There seems little value in keeping those last few remaining figures alive. Almost all of your experience will be wiped out anyway and the cost of replacement is on par with a new purchase.\nI cannot comment on multiplayer since i have not played it yet (I'm not ready to recommend this to my friends yet), but the campaigns while maintaining the Warhammer ethos, don't ignite my grognard passion. There seems little to reward your victorious efforts. There are no bonuses to early victory. And your forces are sure to be in tatters due to the sheer volume of enemies and will therefor be no better than green recruits for your next mission.\nWhile this game may rise to greatness after a few more patches, tbh I have little faith the dev team will take it there. I think they have made some design decisions that they are not willing to revisit that are key to unlocking this games potential. They will continue to tweak the game in its current form, but that special sauce will continue to elude them.\nI think the common answer to what people think of the game will continue to be "It's OK".","December 11, 2014","false","27.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

It uses the engines of Panzer but it is played in the world of 40k. It's a tactical game in a grand campaign through which you go from mission to mission. It's a good plot with quite a few surprise in there.\n\nThe good news: the engine is solid, the AI is good, it mounts good offense and counter-attack. The scenarios are well designed and provide a good challenge. It provides overall a good gameplay experience, which is key. Unit variety is incredible (in the hundreds).\n\nThe bad news: the units graphics are not well animated (almost no animation) and the soundtrack is minimalist. Titans are too small, they should have been bigger.\n\nThis is a must for any wargamer that loves the 40k universe. The sheer joy of finally playing with super-heavy tank and Titans is reward enough.\n\nIt's still early but it looks like the community will be active on this one and design other 40k factions and scenarios/campaign to add to the overall gameplay experience and durability of the game.\n","January 7, 2015","true","119.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Not mainstream, so if you fancy high graphics and are unaware what panzer ganeral means, watch some replays before buying.\n\nVery good conversion of the Panzer Corps series into Wh40k universe. There are the traditional elements of core force which gains experience and carries on from scenario to scenario in the campaign. Units are divided to different groups (infantry, vehicles, tanks, artillery, air etc) each of which have tens of different units that you can unlock and upgrade to as the campaign progress.\n\nNew things (apart from the setting and units) are that each unit can have multiple weapons with different stats. Also attack usually lead to counterattack, which gives more weight to attack range (no counterattack if target is out of range). Units have health and are very varied on how many individuals there are in the unit (the unit strength counter). For example goblins can have as much as 40 unit strength when tanks usually have 5.\n\nGame feels much more fluid than Panzer Corps and the graphics have also been improved a bit. Very enjoyable gameplay experience so far. Greatest + to the game from difficulty, on average difficulty I seem to get overrun by orcish hordes, not totally but unit casualties are hard to avoid. AI seems very capable in attacking.\n\nMinor complaints come from some missing UI elements. What is morale? How many points does reinforcement of unit take? How far can a unit see?\n\nVerdict: 9+","November 30, 2014","true","89.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Not just a mod of the outstanding Panzer Korps, but a completely fresh and unique game. The good stuff from PK is retained... the campaign core units gaining experience and upgrades as they progress together. But the scale is now very tactical with each unit having a variety of weapons systems with their own characteristics such as power, range and armor piercing ability. This makes for a more fluid war of movement and less of the grinding attrition. Further, the tried and true formula of each unit having 10 strength points and only elites getting one or two more is tossed out. Armored units are powerful and well protected but have few strength points.

Warhammer 40,000 Armageddon is everything we love of the Games Workshop universe with over the top imagery and bombastic campy inspiring writing coated in the finest Slitherine sauces of stats and modifiers.\n\nMissions are difficult and require proper use of troops and reinforcement resources along with tight timing and luck. Each individual soldier etc shown represents hundreds of units if not thousands. Truly mass carnage worthy of Warhammer 40,000 Armageddon.\n\nBattles feel like a blood drenched death cloaked Warhammer 40k campaign of purified rage with huge losses by both you and the enemy. Many units have multiple weapon systems which fire at different ranges such as bolt weapons,flamers hitting at closer distances while canons, artillery and lasers fire further. All of this is wonderfully displayed on the interface showing weapon type, range and damage with red meaning the weapon is out of range and green is within a weapon's range adding even more strategic depth to combat as one decides how to best engage the enemy or not . It feels great to know exactly what weapons are firing at any given moment thanks to the great ui.\n\nNo broken up disembodied scenarios here. Everything feels connected like a Dreadnought's crushing fist from its metal mechanical combat structure. A most blissful engaging gaming euphoria.\n\nGraphics are done really well with stunning detail where one can zoom in to indulge in the visceral imagery of units. The user interface is a veritable wealth of information showing things like weapon damage, range, chance of hitting and possible damage, type of weapons carried etc. By clicking on units I was taken to a screen with mesmerizing artwork which displayed all the strengths and gear of the current unit.\n\nOn another note it was a pretty cool moment to see in the tutorial mission for Warhammer 40,000 Armageddon the seedier side with the obviously corrupt official making his self aggrandizing speech before the start of the scenario. A shocker to see compared to the strict iron will society of the space marines we mainly see in video games. I always thought Commisars were strict with fanatical military discipline. The voice acting in these scenes are excellent bringing home the over the top campy extremes of the Warhammer 40k universe.\n\nMusic and sound effects explode like a doomsday orchestra shaking the senses with sonic devastation across the brutal battlefields.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Armageddon has been compared to Slitherine's masterpiece Panzer Corps but after playing both one will see they are different beasts with their own unique character.\n\nWith the patch update of 2-13-15 we even get to play with the brutish thumping Ogryns while enjoying a ton of new added audio effects such as unit death sounds and more dramatic music at the start of turns, after a victory or defeat.\n\nAs of Patch 108 June 2015 am loving the new tutorial tips explaining individual game mechanics as one comes across them. Excellent work and reminds me of reading modifier tables on the fly from table top game manuals while playing seeing what effects what and why. Cheers :)\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Armageddon is a must buy if your into table top gaming and if you loved past games in the series such as Warhammer 40,000 Final Liberation.\n\nWarhammer 40,000 Armageddon a tense turn based strategy wargame from Slitherine whose forte are tabletop style games created for the digital gamer.

Nothing wrong with that, I loved Panzer General, and I love Warhammer, so having them both in one package, not bad.\n\nThe campaign is pretty much similar also, it is a chain of scenarios with a occasional branch where you can choose one of two battle options.\n\nThe Units are pretty much treated also similar as in Panzer General/Corps. Before battle, if you have points you can upgrade to other models, if available, or you can purchase new ones. The units all heal complete from battle to battle.\nThe units do gain experience, but I have not seen yet if and what affect this has on the unit itself.\n\nThe manual is very basic, and could have been done better. It does not really explain what units support fire each other and such. But I suspect in no time there will be player made pages that give this information.\n\nOverall the campaign is fun, but I suspect that once you played it through once or twice it will not have much replay ability. The game counts on its multiplayer battles to keep people interested.\n\nI personal would have loved a map type campaign to give a more strategic feel and more replay capability. The problem with stringed scenario campaigns is always that they are quickly done and no reason to do them again.\n\nOverall this game is recommended by me for anybody that likes the 40k theme and or the panzer general type of game play.","November 26, 2014","true","63.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/recommended/312370/","deidaraakatski","Mrepitome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deidaraakatski/","282 products in account","TL;DR below\n\nI just want to start off and say, to all those reviews that said the voice acting was bad, was so very wrong. In fact, I was impressed with the amount of detail that went not only into the voices, but the actual text itself was just as good.\n\nNow, I want to give a fair warning to those reading this review, it will only be useful if you had the same impression I had before buying the game, and if you can accept a bit of bias here and there, because I don't critique games very harsh like some other users might.\n\nSo, I will start off with my first impression, and the very first place I go to any new game, is the options menu. It probably sounds stupid, but you can probably gauge how much work was put into the game if the option menu has a little bit of wiggle room. What I mean by that is, if it's very flexible, then that means a lot of work and detail was put into the game. (I will use W40K:A to refer to Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon by the way). W40K:A has a nice set of options for  a game that heavily relies on sprites and decals. The only graphical control in the option menu you are allowed to adjust, is the unit glow, and the hex-grid of none, light, or heavy. The unit glow is basically just a little bit of glow around the sprite/unit. You have control over the volume of the music, speech, environment, and effects. Control over combat speed and movement speed. The ability to watch or skip AI movement and combat turns, and some other little game options that otherwise helps the player suit the gameplay to his or her needs. Lastly, of course you can change the language, which is specified on the store page. However, you cannot change the resolution, you are given the option to go to full screen or windows mode (by default its full screen) but the resolution is more than likely using your screen resolution. For example, you just freshly installed W40K:A on Steam, you launch the game, and you brought to the main menu of the game, the resolution of the game is going to be the resolution of your settings on your desktop. If you have your resolution at 1600 x 900 on your desktop screen, then the game is going to use that resolution. There is no way to change that in-game unless you change the mode to windows mode, which in that case you can probably re-size it by dragging it around.\n\nNow that we got that over with, let's take a look at the tutorial. It is very detailed, so much that I was getting bored with all the text that kept popping up every time I clicked something on the first tutorial mission. So your covered, its very detailed and thorough. You can also click on various icons on the UI [user interface] if you aren't sure what it represent, and an overlay will explain in detail what it is, and what it does. The game is very self-explanatory, the only background I have with Wargames is probably Commander: The Great War and a little bit of Panzer Corps demo. Well I have other games published by Slitherine but that is besides the point. The only part you'll need the manual for is the combat, because theres little modifiers in combat that won't be explained in the game, which for the most part, isn't really necessary to know anyways because if you're a casual player, your not going to be paying attention to that anyways. Therefore, is the game newbie friendly, the answer is yes.\n\nNow we have finally come to the exciting part, which is gameplay. W40K:A is very fluid, and the animations are very impressive. I can't really stress my impression on how the animations look during the combat, it just looks great. It's very smooth and pleasing to look at. Now, there is a turn limit, but in some scenarios that turn limit will not do anything except maybe change your rating after you win that level. Heck, requistion points [used to buy more core forces] don't even depend on the performance of the previous level, as said in the tutorial. Now, maybe there might be a few levels here and there in which you HAVE to meet the victory hexes or else you might fail the level, I haven't completed the whole game yet, but at it's core, it's a Wargame, with a heavy focus on tactics and strategy. Now that doesn't mean it's not newb friendly, because it's very newbie friendly, you can still complete the scenarios any way you want, it just means you might feel weird about the turn limits because you aren't "seasoned" to Wargames yet. Every time you complete a level, you'll get to bring those core forces with you, granted that they survived. They will gain experience points after so many rounds of combat, and they will gain little stat boasts that will rival units in later scenarios. It sort of like a snowball effect, you're sort of babying certain units, crafting and molding them into your ultimate killing machine to face off in the grand finale of later scenarios where the difficulty will spike up with seamingly impossible victory objectives. At certain points, you'll probably spend your requisition points on upgrading them to the next tier. Requisition points are not dependent on your previous performance or gameplay, every scenario has a set amount. Therefore, the core forces you choose in the scenario before seems to be of some importance, as you'll likely be spending the points on adding units that seem useful for that particular scenario. If, for example, there is a lot of trenches and bridges, you probably want to buy some artillery units if you don't have any in your core forces, and the rest of the points is probably spent on upgrades and other things you want to tailor your strategy to.\n\nAs mentioned, this is just a casual review, I'm not a certified game reviewer/game journalist who has this giant criteria in which I grade games by.

Goodbye.\n\nEDIT: Recommended if you like units walking through each other, no dying/fighting animations, imagining close combat, hex-based everything. Recommended if you like your strategy gaming in a very abstract, units-on-hexes, board-game style. If you're cool with "this graphic represents such and such", then this might be the game for you. The game is entirely 2D, and ENTIRELY mouse-click-driven. You will click on everything. Except that one menu that you can only use the ESC key to get out of. But you can't use ESC to leave any other menu, all the rest you have to click Ok to leave. Click an icon to bring up a menu - then move the cursor to the menu to click Ok. What year is this? 1992? I thought it was 2014, my mistake.\n\nBut maybe you're cool with that.\n\nHonestly not terribly impressed (other than voice acting, setting, characters so far). I don't want to go off on a rant here, but... It's essentially a 40K skin on their previous products. You'll be doing a lot of clicking. Clicky, clicky, clicky. Click to end dialogue. Click here after reading lots of text (f... that). Click in this small little box for next unit. Click over there to end turn. Click click click. And click some more. No mouseover tooltips with shortcut keys on buttons. Graphics are what you would expect from a 40K skin on a Slitherine port, except the character portraits which are rather ...damn, nice. You're allowed a maximum of units, and buying more is a pain, you can't queue up units or buy more than one at a time usually. Then one dies and you can buy and deploy another, which magically appears in your deployment zone. If you're looking for immersive simulation-style gaming, THIS IS NOT IT.\n\nThen again, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. You may love it or hate it. I bought it because I'm a 40K nerd with a decent job and I'm old and don't spend much money, and maybe that means I'm a sucker who paid too much for something I should have researched more about. But it's 40K and I am just desperate for my fix.

My overall impression of the game is that it is fun to play without being overly taxing or difficult.  In many ways it has a similar feel to the old 'Final Liberation' pc game.  It is fun to get to play with the 40k units including the big tanks and titans, but for the price I was hoping for something more tactically sophisticated and challenging rather than a game where piling all your units in is more often than not successful.\n\nThat said I'll play it through and maybe even set up some pbem games because I like the 40k universe.  I strongly hope that the game will be patched soon to fix some of the glitches, which while they don't completely break the game, do mar the experience and prevent any level of immersion.\n\nIntitially I gave this game a negative review, but on playing for more hours I appreciate the game more.  It possibly fell foul of my heightened expectations for a 40k strategy game.  To credit the developer they have already patched the game too which has addressed many of the issues.\n\nI do still think the game may be somewhat too pricy but as a niche product it does appeal strongly to 40k fans.","November 27, 2014","true","61.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

And that's pretty much what it is. I didn't really look for anything other than the campaign, so that's what this is based on.\n\nThe story is fairly simple, but effective in giving some motivation to the battles and making them feel slightly more than (yet another desert covered with orcs). The game gets larger and more interesting as the story progresses, as does the range of troops, which allows, I suspect, for an army built to your preferences.\n\nThe experience system for the units seems pretty rudimentary, but coupled with the (rising) price of replacing your (steadily upgraded with better options) troops, means that you'll find yourself trying to shelter and retain that veteran unit instead of letting it die. I started off with a swarm of Imperial Guard, and finished with a Titan Squadron backed up by artillery and Terminators :)\n\nI'd have liked a cinematic of some sort, other than the game intro, but that's no biggie.\n\nAs far as gameplay, loading, and operation are concerned, this game played very smoothly.\n\nAs a simple but entertaining wargame, this is solid.

Do not expect flashy animations just a hex grid, lot's of units and the tactical fight to secure key objectives.\n\nI'm no WH40k expert, never played the tabletop. I just happen to like the computer games based on this universe, so I have general idea about the units, but didn't know there were dozens of tank variants available. It's great, but at the same time can be very confusing for "normal" (see not WHk40 fanboys), because we have hard time figuring out what does what.\n\nThe problem is, the units have no descriptions. Just 2 or 3 sentences to describe the units. Because I'm pretty sure us "normal" people have no idea what's a nova cannon and why should I use a tank with it. Why should I take baneblade instead stormsword?\n\nSecond thing that did surprise me a little, is that several models use Cadian troopers instead the featured Steel Legion. I mean sure, it not a game breaking thing. But considering how much the game costs, I fail to see why there are no proper models for all units. It's like you order a pear pie and get apple pie. Doesn't matter if both taste great.\n\nNow I come to the thing that bothered me probably the most during my gameplay. I always felt that in WH40k there are milions of imperial guardsmen fighting and that single space marine is worth ten thousands of them. Now I did not have that feeling in this game. There is no unit caps for elite units, the costs of better units is not that higher, so eventually you just field a bunch of titans, along heavy tanks and artillery and complement that with space marines.\n\nSomething inside me was really bothered by this. Same goes for the enemy as the campaign progresses. Instead milions of orcs, you meet a bunch of elite orcs, tank busta spam (probably because the designer though player will use mostly vehicles) and orcish vehicles. No orcish horde of sluggas and low orcs that would swarm you and give that "orky thing" feeling.\n\nI personally would prefer higher total unit limit and way higher costs for vehicles and especially spacemarines. Together with caps on elite units and way lower restriction on number of basic units. For example that 3 units of sluggas would take just 1 slot etc. Some change that would make low "tech" units viable later in game. Also the important melee combat aspect of WH40k felt a little underwhelming to me. Even assault marines felt like fodder to me.\n\nSpeaking about units, it is really nice you can rename and check history of your units. But for some reason I didn't feel much attached to them. Even in ol' panzer general, units got medals. I noticed that Panzer Corps game has heroes in units, so why not here? No elite replacement as well, so really hard to keep "elite" force with so much dmg going on. All in all, Instead some sort of attachment, they were just fodder to me. No reason to keep them alive, when they lose most experience anyway and I can always buy new unit.\n\nMy last "complain" is about the scenario design. Maps are nice, objectives are fine, I dislike the fact that low tier units vanish after certain point, making your low tier units useless and the enemy force less diverse. What I missed most, was some kind of secondary objective that would make the missions much more interesting. For example rescue surrounded guardsmen, or save lone baneblade which would get you a core unit faster. Or simple objectives like capture this secondary point (warehouse) and get extra requistion points. Something which would introduce some kind of risk vs. reward element.\n\nPatching seems to be at good pace and a lot of stuff was adden since launch, but I had to wonder about some balancing changes (1.04) . For example some of the Salamander vehicles got support trait, whilst the very same vehicles in other chapters do not have it.

Simply put, this game is lazy.  Lore is scarce but accurate.  Art, fair for it's breed.  Gameplay, not even the crudest attempt at innovation has been made - it may in fact be a step or two backwards from other, older hex based games.  The game mechanics and the most basic meaning of some unit stats are left entirely undefined, even in the manual they bothered to slap together, never mind the near total void of mouse over/click tool tips.  Sound and voice work is... ok, uninspired.  Credit for a vast array of unit variations true to GW Forge World.  Not 100% but far closer than you are likely to see anywhere else.\n\nI strongly believe any 40K fan site with a handful of volunteer modders could do a vastly superior job if handed the same license.

There are no unit animations aside from firing, there's none of the tactical flexibility generally available in Warhammer 40k, and the game seems to have no real way to allow such flexibility.  For instance, I can't fly over rough terrain with my Vulture Gunship (a flier) because the ground is apparently too rough and thus impassable.  Some of the missions, even on normal mode, are too hard... the second mission pits you against about 10 times your numbers of orks and you have to somehow get two units through the massive army to the other side of the map... but unfortunately there's no easy way to do that since you have a living, nigh unkillable wall in front of you exerting zones of control that limit your movement so that you can't actually move past them before they redeploy to block your progress again.

From the old (Turbographic 16 console) "MIlitary Madness" to the Pc's "Panzer general" series, "Fantasy general", and all of SSI's games ending with "general". Few games nowadays come out with such an older gaming style. (apparently hex based strategy games came out of the 60's with board games before my time)\n\nTo see such a game such as "Warhammer 40k Armageddon" come out is such a pleasure. Every thing Ive always wanted in such an older style game. And to make things even better, its in the Warhammer 40k universe. With a ton of vehicles and units to purchase with decent graphics along with a story. How could I not want this game?\n\nHowever, at its first price near 40 bucks, I was somewhat hesitant to buy it. (Cause you know us old arm chair generals tend to be cheepos or tight with their money) But, being since it was Warhammer 40k I couldnt resist. (Now I actually wonder if the creators of the specific game were actually targeting older middle aged men who are board game players or the actual fanatical 40k fan) Thus the larger price tag on a style of game that is quite old.\n\nAll in all a great game whether your a lover of turn base, hex based stragey games, or a 40k fan. You may love this game.","April 26, 2015","true","53.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The downside is that heavy units usually gets really good and you can annihilate the enemy by throwing cannon fooder at the AI, however basic units will rarely survive for long.\n- Each mission have a limit over how many units you can own/deploy, this means that the game quickly becomes about massed armored assaults whyere infantry have little real purpose except standing behind the armor and grabbing the objectives.\n- Most of the battles is about grabbing X amount of objective spots, I found that a little dull. Especially since they are usually placed that it means you also have to annihilate the entire opposing force.\n- Enemy command units while tough have a nasty habit of parking themsleves in the open on the front line to be fairly easily desposed off. With grand commanders like no wonder the AI have such poor tactics.\n- Killing the enemy commander have no real effect on the battle.\n- Enemy commanders fail to have significant impact on the battle. Yes I am really annoyed at the pointlessness of them.\n- Each battle is LONG so if you want a full battle beware it will take probably between 1 hour and 1h 30m to play one battle.\n- Some unit variants seem to have no purpose.\n- It is not always clear what effect a tile will have on a unit.\n- each weapon have a ton of statistic, but little to enable you to decide if it is a good or a bad unit when you are starting out.\n- a minor point but I was really sadden that there was no option to customize your titans considering how many options other units has this seems like and oversight.\n\n\nOverall the experience despite the flaws is overall good and very engaging, I have played several games like this over the years and this is in many ways one of the better ones and overall really well designed. The only real issue I have is that it doesn't feel (visually and mechanically) like a recent game, but rather as a game that could easily have been made 10+ years ago.\n\n(and because I like the idea of scores!)\n\nArt: 6 (it's good and fits but it isn't impressive)\nCombat: 7 (lots of option everythign feels meaningful, however the AI and focus on heavy units brings the game down a bit)\nInterface: 5 (clear and with a lot of options right at your fingers, as long as you already knows what everything means)\nStory: 7 (it's a warhammer 40k story it's about war, fits well but could use a bit more... life).\nVoice acting: 8 (surprisingly good)\nLevel design: 7 (excellent level design with interesting challenges to overcome, only downside it is a design that mostly make things difficult rather than enabling certain units to really shine).\n\nOverall: 7 (or 6.7 if you want to be exact)\n\n\n","March 27, 2015","true","62.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Me and my brother are old school WH40k fans and fight a long and endless "tabletop war" between orks (me) and marines (him). So this game was a no brainer to buy when we heard about it.\n\nBeing a fan of Final liberation i can say that it is very similar in many aspects and i like it. BUT! This game with it`s cool drawn units has no movement and death animations at all (something that old Final Liberation HAD!), has no decals like craters and burns being left after barrage (something that even Steel Panthers of old 90th had). So i was a bit dissappointed by the high price and the lack of "technology" behind it.\n\nNext, multiplayer - it is PBEM and it has no turn replays! So you have to recall everything that was prior to the current turn and burn your brain imaginating what caused the outcome. Multiplayer feels like being wired in as the last and heavily untested feature. Also we were promissed to have a hotseat mode. There is no hotseat in the game right now.\n\nI would recommend this game to WH40k fans, but be aware that it has little difference from what you get on the table, except for miniatures producing sounds and fancy shotting effects.","November 26, 2014","true","48.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

My problem though, which I also found in elven legacy, comes in how the unit types progress. In elven lgacy losing veterans felt so bad that you would never let yourself lose a single unit [to the extent that you would just have to save and reload consantly]. This game less of that problem, but instead you find that early unit types, though in many ways the coolest and most flavorful [I bought the game so I could slaughter orcs with imperial guardsmen], are incapable of standing up lategame. This in many ways makes sense in universe, but I wish that having a balanced army payed off late game. Insead I found myself just usig math to decide who was the biggest, most powerful unit, and I just bought them. I want eery single unit in the game to be a sidegrade, no upgrades. That way, I can find myself enjoying every freaking unit, because lets be honest, warhammer is freaking awesome! Anyways, I would've also liked to have played as the orcs, and there to've been more races, though I have no doubt that they have such things in the works.","December 20, 2014","true","73.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Thankfully strategy games have been on the go since the dawning of computers (i am going back to my Spectrum 48k days). I have played many GW games on the PC, from Space Hulk, to Dawn of War, and now this beast. I also have a love of tanks and the huge monstrous titans portrayed in 40k. So, yes, I am a tread-head and this game serves me well. It starts of gently, then suddenly it throws you deep into it (I noticed that on the first Titan mission, and like in the old board-game days I kept forgetting to move the damn thing). The graphics serves there purpose. As of yet in a physical miniature 40k game (I can’t say from 2010 onwards) I have never seen a model move (to the people complaining about graphics)... The sounds are good, serving the purpose of a war-game. So yes, in a nutshell, this game is great, and has, although not to a collecting level, brought me back to the 40k universe! I hope the developers release more expansions, beyond Armageddon (such as a Chaos incursion and ooooh a Tyranid invasion!!!).","December 30, 2014","true","164.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

You really need to have the whole game world in your head to enjoy this or you could be a bit lost and wonder why these folks are so intent on undoing each other.

It feels very much like the tabletop game while being just differnet enough and the unit selection is great. The game itself I highly recomend. There are quite a few mission where I really had to think in order to win, which is exactly what a stratagy game needs to do.\n\nHOWEVER, the game is very buggy. :( I've put in about 20-30 hours of gameplay and it's crashed my computer 4 times and crashed the game 11. (It does autosave every turn so at least you don't lose a ton of play time.) Also there is a bug that if you restart a level while on an opponant's turn you can't finish you deploy step and start the mission over.\n\nOverall, I did still have fun and I don't regret my purchase. But the high level of annoiance with the bugs takes what I feel should be something like a 8.5-9/10 to a 6/10. Tenetive recomendation for now, but once they fix the bugs (if the do) then you should get it for sure.","April 23, 2015","true","121.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Multiple unit choices for the Imperial Guard Steel Legion, the Orcs and the three Space Marine Chapters (Blood Angels, Ultra Marines and Salamanders). Plenty of tank types and/or variants is where this game shines as there are many different weapon types and load outs depending on the tank type.\n\nThis game is set during the Armageddon campaign of 40k lore where Commissar Yarrick first takes on Ork Warlord Thrakka at Hades Hive. The game sticks mainly to the cannon lore, but there are one or two surprises along the way. You eventually get to use 'hero' units towards the end of the game. (Sorry but no spoilers - if you want to know, play the game!)\n\nGraphics are a bit dated, but the game is using a dated engine, but this can be forgiven as the game play is pretty solid. You get a tutorial campaign, then the main campaign which is broken down into three acts. There are extra missions which you can play if you get tired of the main campaign and a recent free dlc has added an additional 5 extra missions that can be played.\n\nMP is good depending on who you are playing, but i feel that MP needs to have some kind of time limit in the case of players who aren't making any moves over a period of time. IMHO i feel that a player should forfeit a match if they haven't made a single move within a 2 to 4 weeks time. An option to force forfeit in MP would be appreciated from the devs. :)\n\nOverall i rate the game 7.1 / 10.","March 10, 2015","true","39.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am glad I didn't miss this game, it's a well executed game, and a welcome return to the classic hex turn based games. The fact that I love the Warhammer world certainly helps. I haven't played through the game yet, but I certainly will. But as good as I think this game is it does have some points that need improvement. Save games doesn't follow the storyline. By that I mean that if you save a game, you can't simply press continue and think the game will load up the latest save, and continue from there. No, it will instead reveal *all* chapters to you, and you choose where you want to play from. Nice gesture, but not so much on the first playthrough. All of a sudden you need to pick the chapter you were last time (and it's not certain you'd remember that) moreover it will start at the beginning of said chapter. Probably not what you want. Instead, you need to load the save and the save isn't named the text you gave it, no it's named after the place and time you saved it. Again, this isn't all that clear to a user. No, please fix so that a continue selection means just that, it will continue from whence you saved last. Also, please bring the naming into savegames, I typically (and I know others do too) save a temp file, that I want to use when I *don't* want to store a specific time and place. Seeing that name helps. Also, please don't let users see all the chapters on the first playthrough, it isn't helping the game at all. It breaks the story, it is like a kid winding the movie to the action scenes, skipping the booring (but oh so essential) 'talkie bits' :) But besides that, the game (at least to me) is good and very enjoyable.","November 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"
