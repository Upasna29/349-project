However this wont stop it from being good. I do recommend the game, it's not as good as the first one but still a great game.\n\nLetter from an employee that worked on this game:\n\n"Well, I would like to shed some light over the development of this game... Working with Mercury Steam -and I would like to tell this anonymously- is about an everyday frustration. Here's to every guy that has experienced hell during the development of this game, but especially to those who have led this to the mess that Lords of Shadows 2 is:\n\n- Kojima had little to nothing to do with the development of the first game, he came by, set a seal, visited the studio, signed some things and that was it. He had even less to do with Mirror of Fate and LoS2.\n\nThe vast majority of this team is aware that the game we've done is a real piece of ♥♥♥♥ that has nothing to do with the first one's quality and production values... Nobody is surprised by the low reviews we've got.\n\n- If there's someone to blame here, that's Enric Álvarez. He is the person who has led a broken development based on his personal criteria, completely overlooking programmers, designers and artists. Despite his nice look to the press, often considered as some sort of creative "visionary" in the looks of David Cage and Molyneux, this guy has serious problems. He is a mean and naughty guy, and since the "success Lords of Shadows 1" his ego has grown to the point of not even daring to say 'hello' when you meet him in the hallway.\n\nHis distrust to his own workers is enormous. Most of the development team often found out features of the game through press news, rather than from the studio's head - unbelievable. And there is no corporate culture here at all... this is just a handful of people working blindly and at the disposal of an alleged visionary.\n\n- The studio's internal structure is archaic, still based on the old partners of the Scrapland days. I'll give you an example so you can see the full picture: the studio's signature engine (one with many flaws) was solely coded by two guys, one of them being a founder of the company and Enric's confident. Access for the new programmers to the source code to update or refurbish the engine is denied, so things are still done in a 10-year-old fashion.\n\n- Many of the studio founders are people with zero abilities for running a studio. Often here newbie developers know more than their own bosses. This structure only leads to a slow, messy and absurd development process, with the end result of Lords of Shadows 2 being a perfect example of what happens due to that.\n\n- Absolutely every design idea has to be monitored, taken away and mutilated by Enric Álvarez. Several game designers have grown tired of this and have abandoned the studio.\n\n- The art direction for this project has been erratic and beheaded. After Enric dismissed every idea and core decission from our main art director for the previous projects, he decided to just leave. It was a battle of egos unleashed by Enric (something that he has carried over with since his times in Rebel Act). Our now former art director is still working in Madrid, now with the Tequila guys making RIME.\n\n- Many others have just turned to other studios offers, sick of the situation here. Almost every month we see fellow devs packing up and getting out of here looking for a new job abroad -that's sad-. It's amazing how the biggest AAA game developer in Spain is not even willing to make its workers a counteroffer. This company does not think highly of its talented workers and their good work. There has never been any kind of salary bonus or anything that remotely resembles it. Not even a single "Good job team!" acknowledgement.\n\n- The production management for this project has been terrible, way often the heads of each department dismissed every production deadline and imposed their own criteria. As a result, the development was delayed for six months, and that investment only came out of MercurySteam's pockets.\n\nMany can't help comparing this situation to something similar that already happened in a company in which many of us worked: Pyro Studios (the team behind the Commandos saga). The QA department is treated like cattle, with shameful wages and almost everyday bullying.\n\n- Expectations for our future are quite bad... with a publisher like Konami really upset after the mediocre game we've made.\n\n- After completing Lords of Shadows 2 MercurySteam has fired 35 workers, and it's embarrasing that no website or journalist is talking about that. More firings are expected to come in the following days.\n\n- And finally, because not everything is bad in here, I wanted to say that the real team behind this company is an incredible bunch of people. If all those guys who are not allowed to be promoted due to our Jurassic studio leads had the chance to set the course of the company, our future would be so bright. There's just so much passion and talent here, more than I've ever seen anywhere else, but it's completely held back. I really hope that those who read this understand what we've lived here. Someone has to say this so it is not lost in time after the game's launch.\n\nThank you for reading me."","January 15, 2015","true","14.1"," 201 of 216 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","201","216","8","4"

You've undoubtedly seen the low reviews from people who claimed poor graphics. These claims are groundless, and trampled by some of the screenshots you can uncover in the community hub for this game. The graphics are staggeringly good, and some areas have such incredible photorealism that you have to look twice just to make sure you're looking at a texture.\n\nThe free-form camera works great. No longer can whiners throw a fit that they can't see elements of the battle, as you can now rotate 360 degrees in virtually every setting. It not only grants you a breathtaking view of the scenery; it allows you to tactically view your surroundings and analyze your best moves mid-combat.\n\nPlatforming and quick-time events have been significantly altered to combat the same list of complainers who hated them in the first game. Platforming now directly shows you where to go, and no longer forces you into long-winded movements where every step is a new jump. You now streamline climb like spider-man over most surfaces, and the ones too far grant you a swift, and simple jump to the new object. Quick-time events have been cut in quarters. No more cinematic sequences where defending yourself during a movie becomes normal. They're limited to combat, and the rare gameplay-to-cinema segue.\n\nControls are as easy as they were in the first game, with a few minor improvements. Button rotations have made combat noticeably smoother, and grant the player less hectic moments of desperate survival. Moves now have instant-cancellations, (another complaint from the first game) which allow the player the freedom to be as quick and reflexive as they want to be. If you die in combat-- you're just not up to snuff that round. No more blaming the devs.\n\nThe music. What can I say? I've never been so excited to tear into a new game just to hear the musical composition behind it. Oscar Araujo does it again with a score so moving and epic that it pulls players back into its immersive world of magic and demons with a slew of trumpet blasts and harmony-driven pieces that are sure to win over even the most jaded action-gamers.\n\nThere's never been a better time to jump into the world of Castlevania. I loved this game's predecessor, and I can still hold firmly to my nostalgic love of a classic Castlevania devoid of all the work MercurySteam has pumped into it in recent years.\n\nHowever, the "Lords of Shadow" series has brought life into a franchise that has desperately needed fresh-blood (forgive the pun).\n\nI strongly urge anyone to pick up this title, even if you're only looking for a new action-game. The battles are challenging; you'll be forced to reconsider how you take on countless enemies that you think you know well enough from the first game.\n\nThe story is moving. Piecing together questions and answers from both the first game as well as Mirror of Fate, LoS 2 brings about a conclusion that is sure to yield an uproar from the masses for more of this tale.\n\nYou are no longer a pure-hearted man. Gabriel has become a ruthless, violence-embracing monster who is indifferent to suffering and who will stop at nothing to obtain the freedom he desires. Many of his choices in the game will makes fans of the holy-hero cringe as he shows how his transformation into the Prince of Darkness has affected his moral judgment.\n\nThis game is worth your money, and it's worth your time. If this game stretches even HALF the length of the first game, then it's going to be a ride you'll never forget.","February 25, 2014","true","15.0"," 516 of 663 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","516","663","0","42"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/239250/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 continues the story of Gabriel Belmont and his transformation into the dark lord; Dracula.\n\nUpon starting the game you'll immediately be plunged into an epic battle as Dracula's castle is besieged by the Brotherhood of Light. During this time you'll be trained in the art of combat, mastering Dracula's three weapons as well as evasive maneuvers. The weapons vary and each of them fill a specialized role.\n\nAfter the initial opening, you'll be unleashed into an open world with two dimensions to travel between, Dracula's Castle and a modern Gothic city built upon its ruins. The art direction and audio is phenomenal, featuring an amazing cast of voice actors; Robert Carlyle, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Jason Isaacs to name a few. The soundtrack is also really well done, fitting the mood of the game flawlessly. The environments are absolutely beautiful, allowing plenty of room for exploration while searching for the various upgrades, lore and abilities.\n\nThe story, when combined with the previous two entries is engaging and helps propel you through the 15 hour game, although the ending is a bit abrupt as well as disappointing. Veterans of the Hack n' Slash genre will want to begin on the harder difficulty as it's a bit simple when compared to games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta. Between, fighting, exploring, puzzle solving, and platforming there's a lot of fun to be had.\n\nWhile the stealth segments seem to be a major complaint for a lot of reviewers, they don’t detract from the overall game. I’ll admit that I was skeptical at first since stealth really has no business being in a Castlevania title, but they play out similarly to puzzles opposed to traditional stealth missions. They’re also few and far between.\n\nThe menu system is highly polished and will document every type of creature you fight against. It also acts to manage your upgrades and abilities as you level. Plenty of Lore and backstory is provided along the way from diaries as well.\n\nWhile it'd be nice to have a triple A classic Symphony of the Night experience, LoS2 is great in its own way and playing as “The Dragon” with this new take on the legend is a blast. Don’t believe some of the critics, Lords of Shadow 2 is a must-play.\n\nFor a longer and more detailed review, here’s a video my friend and I put together:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUW5McQYaCE\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent Art Direction\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ All-star Voice Acting\n+ Balanced Gameplay\n+ Large open world to explore\n\nCons:\n- Dracula doesn’t feel evil enough\n- Disappointing Finale\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","March 7, 2014","true","17.6"," 148 of 172 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","148","172","0","10"

Time to see if I can put into somewhat coherent paragraph or two as to why that's the case.\n\nLet's start off by saying I was one of the people who enjoyed the original Lords of Shadow for what it was – not necessarily a creatively original masterpiece, but a game of astounding production values, competent writing and tight narrative punctuated by stellar voice work and lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it was a very meaty game which lead to some even saying it was too long for its own good. Fast forward to sequel and you can see it basically falters in each of these categories.\n\nInterestingly enough game seems to swing between two polar opposites with its visuals because on one hand you have this classic Castlevania look comprised of foreboding yet mystical gothic castle to romp through, as well as its assorted menagerie of beasties to but heads with and solve painfully few puzzles compared to the first game, but on the other you have to contend with extremely bland modern-day warehouses and science laboratories ad nauseam alongside some fairly uninspired enemies ranging from more classical demons and Satanists to, what really should've been more interesting that ended up, futuristic soldiers and cybernetic abominations roaming the streets. But honestly, it's this weird disjointed narrative that undoes the game the most in my mind because you can clearly tell there was meant to be more there instead of just going from A to B and meandering in-between retreading locations with nothing but brief radio contacts from time to time. And lastly – game is simply short compared to the first one and that probably ties into my previous point. Rumors abound regarding game's troubled development were apparently well founded.\n\nThat's not to say game is bad because, as you will have most likely noticed despite my continued rambling on regarding its negatives, this is marked as a positive review overall. It's still Lords of Shadow and if you liked the original you'll probably like this considering you can overlook its weak story. Gameplay feels familiar and skippable QTEs are god-sent, both of which are points in game's favor for me, not to mention combat and item system was expanded and enemy variety despite their designs actually means you'll end up facing quite a bit of different behaviors. Story establishes the mood very early on as one of Dracula's somber and more resigned journey, one profoundly personal despite all other events that unfold over the course of the game. Had it been properly fleshed out and Robert Carlyle's more subdued performance given time to develop, occasional hamfisted melodrama notwithstanding, it would've been a much, much better final product. I also heard some nay saying about mandatory stealth sections in the game to which I say it's about time to drop hand-holding. Barring for one section involving leaves and crazed Satyr these were a welcome diversion for me and fitting considering MC's condition story-wise.\n\nOne last caveat I feel should be posted is that playing the original game and Mirror of Fate is recommended before tackling the sequel.","July 28, 2015","true","14.8"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","58","62","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/recommended/239250/","sweetzz","Sweetz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/","320 products in account","As a huge fan of Lords of Shadow 1, I sadly find myself rather disappointed in the sequel.  It seems like every change they made to the gameplay is for the worse.\n\nFirst let's talk about the much lamented stealth sections.  They truly and unequivocally suck.  They are relatively infrequent and certainly not insurmountable, but they simply are not entertaining, often annoying if not outright frustrating, and aren't even logically consistent with the rest of the game. One moment you're ripping the heart out of a monster the size of a building, the next you're hiding from two grunts with guns. I can not fathom the developer's reasoning behind their inclusion to the game.  Who played Lords of Shadow 1 and thought "You know what would make this game better? Insta-fail stealth segments!"\n\nThen there's the combat.  I found the combat in Lords of Shadow 1 quite satisfying even it could be simple at times.  It seems they wanted to up the challenge here, but they did so by making the enemies get staggered less, attack at a much faster rate, and having more attack you simultaneously. The problem with this is not that it makes the game too hard, but you need to guard or dodge so frequently that you rarely have time to execute anything more than the most basic attack combo.  Several of the more powerful attacks have such long windups or leave you open so long that they're nearly useless.  As a result, I'm finding the combat to be less varied and far more tedious than the first game.  Too much time is spent dodging and not rattling off impressive combos.\n\nThere are also little bits of level design that make me wonder at what point the developers stopped asking whether it was fun in favor of just coming up with tasks for the player to do (much like the stealth sections).  For example there are several timed switches where you'll hit a switch to open a door, and as you get close to the door several enemies will appear.  Spend time fighting the enemies (and likely you'll have to) and you won't make the door in time.  So you walk back to the switch, hit it again and this time you can cross the area unmolested.  It's the most egregious form of repetition to pad playtime and makes no sense in a game that's sufficiently long regardless.  It's the kind of thing that makes you feel like the designer isn't respecting you as a player.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, even the camera is disappointing.  Some reviewers whined about the fixed cameras of the first game, when the problem was just a few bad angles.  They switched to a controllable behind the back camera here, and while it's perfectly functional, the game has lost the epic vistas and panning shots of the first game that you only get with fixed (or more accurately: not player controlled) camera angles.  As a result, despite environment design that feels roughly on par with LoS1, the game has lost much of the grand feeling of it's predecessor.\n\nNow on the plus side, everything that doesn't have to do with the mechanics of the game are at least as good as the original.  The art design and aesthetics are great even if you don't get to appreciate them as much with the narrow camera.  The characters and cinematics are absurd, but in a way that feels fitting and not like it's trying too hard - though it can get close at times.\n\nTaken by itself, the game isn't awful, I still found it reasonably entertaining on the whole.  It's just that everything about how it plays feels worse than the original and it's especially disappointing to see so many mistakes made by the developer after the success they had with original.","April 17, 2014","false","16.1"," 173 of 241 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","173","241","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/239250/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUW5McQYaCE&list=UURLmXiAxqgzAGPO64W78sSg\n\nMercury Steam's hack and slash take on Konami's long running vampire slaying franchise proved to be a bit divisive by rebooting the franchise's lore and staying away from the loot gathering of the massively successful side scrolling titles starting with Symphony of the Night. With Lords of Shadow 2, Mecury Steam is drawing their controversial take on the franchise to a close, putting players in the worn out boots of Dracula himself as he faces off against Satan and his army of minions. Attempting to inject a bit of metroidvania design and hopping back and forth between Dracula's castle and modern times, is this the compromise between the side scrolling titles and the foundation laid by Lords of Shadow?\n\nAfter a recap of the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, players are treated to an epic prologue that has Dracula defending his less than humble abode from a tremendous siege which culminates in an encounter with his son, Alucard.  The game then flashes forward a thousand years to find a very weak Dracula awakening in a cathedral in modern times greeted by Zobek. Zobek offers Dracula the chance to end his cursed existence in exchange for the death's of Satan's acolytes. In typical video game fashion, Dracula must regain his lost powers and battle a few inner demons in addition to Satan's minions. While the sections that have Dracula revisiting his castle provide some appreciative depth and introspection, the plot unfolding in modern times is rather underwhelming and even a bit silly. The game is at it's narrative peak when it recaptures the spirit of Gabirel's sober journey in the first game, reflecting on Dracula's numerous sins and the decimation of the Belmont family.\n\nPerhaps the largest change to Lords of Shadow 2 comes in it's structure. Dracula moves between present day and his castle and, eventually, players can revisit areas previously explored. It makes the game more metroidvania-like thank it's predecessor but hoping back and forth between the two areas leaves the geography feeling fragmented and backtracking only becomes available much later in the game making this still feel somewhat like a linear level based affair. Combat remains largely intact from the previous games with light and dark magic now complimented by two additional weapons: the chaos claws and the void sword. These along with Dracula's shadow whip can be upgraded by purchasing various moves and utilizing them. It's a system that rewards using your entire move set and is an excellent addition to a genre where many rely on a couple effective all purpose combos. Relics have been added as consumable items that give Dracula the ability to restore his health, transform into a dragon for massive damage and gain extra experience.\n\nTragically, the gameplay does take a major step back when it comes to the puzzles. Standing in for the first game's brain teasers are a gauntlet of stealth bits that have Dracula posessing enemies, cowering in the shadows and transforming into a rat in order to navigate small cracks and crevices. Most of these are easy and don't feel rewarding in addition to being at odds with playing as a powerful and feared vampire. A couple of the stealth sections can prove to be frustrating and one visit to a forum exposes one pre-boss fight stealth section as a stopping point for many. Boss fights are also completely unchallenging which is a shame since Lords of Shadow provided an excellent difficulty balance.  Fortunately, those who invest in the DLC will be treated to gameplay and puzzles that are more in line with the original Lords of Shadow making it an excellent piece of content for fans even though it's narrative additions are minimal.\n\nOn the PC, Lords of Shadow 2's beautiful art direction is showcased by higher resolution textures and runs silky smooth at 60fps. Despite the fact that it doesn't offer the lastest graphical bells and whistles, this Direct X 9 title is more than pleasing to look and all of it's details can be appreciated since the fixed camera of the first game has been ditched. The Castle in particular is a stunning place to be and it becomes almost frustrating that the entire game doesn't take place there since the modern city seems a bit bland in comparison. Enemies can also be a bit bland and repetative but the bosses generally make up for this minor short fall. The soundtrack to Lords of Shadow 2 is also magnificent with beautiful somber orchestral compositions and delicate piano pieces. It adds a huge amount of ambiance to the game and is perhaps this year's best soundtrack.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is unequivocally not as good on the whole as it's predecessor though it shows a few major improvements that are easy to appreciate. It's a lengthy experience that offers superb combat, excellent visuals and a top notch soundtrack. For a Castlevania fan, it generally outweighs the lame stealth segments, repetitive enemies and underwhelming open world design. Even for it's biggest detractors, the Lords of Shadows games are proof that Castlevania can exist in three dimensions.","September 10, 2014","true","22.7"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","55","70","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/majorparsnip/recommended/239250/","majorparsnip","Parsnip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majorparsnip/","1561 products in account","So, I actually liked it a lot more than I expected. The overall impression of it everywhere seemed to be very negative (regardless of what you think about metacritic, 58/100 doesn't exactly inspire confidence), but I ended up liking it quite a bit.\n\nThe combat is fun, even though it sometimes feel like the enemies have too many unblockacle moves, so instead of sync blocking you are dodging maybe more than I would prefer. Still, Dracula is nimble and there are enough new moves doled out every now and then to keep things interesting all the way through. Void and Chaos powers replace the light and dark magic from the first game, but more in name than function. You still get orbs from keeping your combat focus going, in order to fill out those magic meters, and one of them is more powerful and the other one is less, but heals with every hit landed. It's essentially the same system as the first LoS, but some very minor differences. Probably the biggest difference with combat is not even directly related to combat, but it's the free camera. And they handle it well, the combat camera is smart most of the time (unlike say, the camera in MGRR), and doesn't get in the way. All the finishers take too long though, I get it, you are Dracula, but suck that blood a little faster, thanks. But overall, good stuff.\n\nPresentation is probably the most uneven thing in the entire package. Environments and locations can be gorgeous, but they can also be ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Boring sewers and industrial plants, but also gorgeous gothic (or something) architecture and fantastic vistas. Dracula seems incredibly tiny in this world too. The grand scale of everything works well in the non-industrial setting, big majectic doors and windows etc, but in the industrial setting it just looks comical. Music is the same, Araujo does some good work with some tracks, but others are just a big meeh. I remember reading an interview from him where he says that he didn't really have a lot of freedom in the end, that he had tried to approach the music from other angles but was told that it needed to be more cinematic. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. The story is really really dumb, somewhat poorly written, but it does its job of pushing you towards your next objective.\n\nThe worst part are the sections where they probably thought that they should add some variety in the gameplay design or something. Obviously the much talked stealth stuff is one part of that. They have absolutely no place in this game, they are just poor. But they are also really easy and short, so I'm not sure how the press was so badly hung up on them. Yes, they suck ♥♥♥, but it takes like 2 minutes to go through. The elevator action section is dumb as well, again, not because it's hard or anything, but a timed switch to restore power in order to use an elevator is not fun. And I imagine the director had played Uncharted and told that we need something like that, heart pounding set pieces. The results are absolute ♥♥♥♥. There's one section where the floor falls under you, push forward and push A for awesome. The entire train section is hot garbage, but especially the part where you dodge the roof lights or whatever. And then there's the QTE's, which you can turn off from the settings. If you played LoS, you'll probably remember that most boss fights had some easy quicktime event sequences in them, sometimes in the middle or in the end, and usually if you failed the boss would gain a little health back, rinse and repeat until you were quick and timely enough. That's still here, but if you turn them off, it will just play that whole section as if you were successful. And I very much recommend it. What does it tell you about this hot feature that they added an option to just disable them?\n\nThe game is very linear, but it has a hint of that non-linearity with all the secrets you can find. That speaks to me in some primal level and I can just get lost in the world, just running around and looking behind every corner and such to find everything. It just speaks to me man. Of course I would recommend you do this only after you get all your powers back, can't get them all without all your powers. There's also some combat challenges, and I played through couple tiers of them... but didn't bother with the rest. It gets into a little more complicated stuff than I have patience for (you can only hit this dude while he is frozen, while simultaneously killing smaller dudes every 20 seconds etc etc). For me it takes the fun out of it.\n\nSo overall, I'd say my experience with the game is positive. I paid ~20$ for it and I'd say it's worth at least that if not more.","August 27, 2014","true","34.3"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","40","51","0","3"

Weaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/connorjweaver/","624 products in account","Well if you're here then probably you have already looked up some "professional" reviews about this game. And most of them call it inferior to the series or just simply say it's mediocre. This game made me to stop listening to these reviewers. I didn't really want to buy it, but I fell in love so hard with the story they presented in LoS1 and MoF I needed to know the conclusion and I felt like I wouldn't be satisfied if I just simply watched it on YouTube. So here I am amazed by this fantastic game...\n\n+CombatIf you are coming from LoS1 (if not then please play it before this one) you already know the basics. They basically tightened it up, made it much more responsive and fluid then it was. There are new moves and combos, too. And this time we get a much more "user-friendly" skill page then in LoS1.\n\n+Story and narrativeThese were the second biggest positives I encountered in this game (the 1st one is ofc the combat). Of course there are plot twists, and most of them hit hard (you know it's good when your jaw drops). There are many interesting characters; there will be some who you'll hate and many who you'll love. It made me care about a side-character in ~20 mins and when it turned out he may die I felt really bad. But the ultimate peak for me was the Toymaker. It is that kind of rare time in gaming when a good story and a well-imagined narrative meets. I won't spoil it for you, you have to experience it by yourself. And most importantly it got rid of that bad narrative element that they used in the 1st game, which made up every little thing so dramatic that it felt like it just changed the whole world, but in reality it had no impact on anything.\n\n+CameraThankfully they got rid of the fixed camera presented in the first game. Don't get me wrong, fixed camera can work pretty well (like the old Resident Evils), but a high-speed action came certainly doesn't need it. Surprisingly it's also dynamic. So like when you're just walking, it comes quite close to you (kind of like RE4). But during combat it goes much further so you can see better.\n\n+PlatformingJust like the combat, they kept it and made it better. Thanks to the accurate controls it's much more fluid and if you failed a lot of times during platforming in LoS1 (like me) than fear no more, it's much better. A little bat swarm will always indicate where you can jump to and during climbing you can (optionally) highlight where you can climb to.\n\n+SoundtrackI know it's subjective, but it's still amazing. It's not that kind of music that you will download and listen to regularly. It just fits so well the game, that it greatly boosts its already good atmosphere. It's epic and beautiful at the same time. And when it needs to be, then it's emotional.\n\n+BossesThey are pretty diverse and just enough challanging.\n\n+DesignThe graphics are good, but the design is the thing that's important. When you're in the castle dimension it's simply breathtaking. Every little detail in every little painting and statue and thing in the castle...Everything feels just in place, that I risk that even in 8-bit it would still look beautiful. Now about the modern dimension...For a city design it looks good, but I couldn't wait to get back into the castle from the modern world.\n\nAnd the list could go on and on (good portray of Dracula, references, etc.), but let's talk about some not that good aspects of the game.\n\n+/-Stealth segmentsNow this is the most criticized part...I don't hate them but neither love them. It's all about if you mind being taken away from the fast-paced gameplay and use your brain and patience a little bit. But the biggest issue with these is the fact that mostly there's only one way to do them! But people hate it like it's all over the place but you have to be stealthy like 5 times in this game...But I loved the parts when I could be a rat, it still really gave me the feels of being smarter and more powerful then my enemies.\n\n-No detailed mapYou get 2 kinds of map in this game: one that shows the districts and one that shows your surrindings.\n\n-Rare bugsI encountered two kind of biggie bugs during my playthrough and I looked up if anyone else has encountered them and I didn't find anyone, so they must be really rare.\n\n\nIn conclusion: As a fan of Hack 'n' slash games and the first two LoS games I have to say that this is a must have. The game is very well optimized, so no worries about that. It has it's bad moments, but they're still mediocre at worst.\nI love this even more than the 1st one actually. The story and drama feels kind of weak if you don't really care about it, but once you start to think about what just happened you'll be amazed. Don't listen to the critics (probably Konami just didn't pay for good reviews), this game deserves much more than that (8/10 minimum).\n\nP.S.: I feel like it's needless to say about this kind of games, but a controller is strongly recommended (I played with a Steam Controller and it was very comfortable and precise).","February 12","true","17.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","2"

However, as a follow up to Castlevania LoS, it is terribly disappointing. My recommendation is based on the game itself, not my disappointment as  a sequel to the original.)\n\n\nLet's start with the GOOD. The combat has been refined in a very nice way and thusly feels a bit more responsive. As in the last game, with the points/experience that you receive from defeating enemies, you can use that to buy additional moves for your weapons, but this time, you have the addition of the chaos claws and void sword AND they have their own moveset on top of the same function as shadow and light magic respectively. Thusly, giving you many combo possibilities. Dodging is smooth, although I would have preferred a roll like the original, or the turning into smoke like Laura in the original game as well. I'm glad for the addition of the free rotating camera that was lacking in the first game.\n\nPlatforming has also been improved and is much smoother than before.\n\nThe graphics, very,very nice. However, it seems a bit of a waste since the most of the environments are dank, dark and very similar; unlike the original game where there was a lush forests, autumn ruins, icy castles, dark dungeons, crazy grand canyonesque platforming. Just wasted potential overall, but a great graphics engine nonetheless.\n\nNow for the BAD: STEALTH, man oh man, this game never needed stealth to begin with so I don't know why it's even here. Not that I mind stealth, it's just done very, very poorly in this game. The stealth sections were very tedious and boring. It was repetitive and not necessary to the game.\nSpeaking of not necessary, the section where you have to hide from Pan's brother so you don't get one-shotted....ridiculous! You're freaking Dracula, the prince of freaking darkness. Satan is even scared of you in the game, yet, you have to hide from this guy? Again, since this was a stealth portion, it was terrible and necessary.\n\nThe modern setting, I'll admit that I was excited to check out a modern setting in LoS, but honestly, it felt so out of place, especially the robots and commandos in exo suits. The sections you get to go back to the castle felt much more appropriate and epic.\n\nThe story, the story this time around, lacked a sense of urgency and purpose. This is probably partly due to that you're now Dracula and you don't care weather thousands of people live or die. I through most of the game, it felt as if I was just trudging along just getting through the game, instead of feeling like I'm making real progress. The story lacked any real revelations, twists or turns, like the original had. It was very one track and lacked anything with real substance. There is no internal struggle like in the first game, any real tragedy with character investment, the story felt like it had a beginning and an end but missing pieces in the middle, not necessarily plot holes, but more so they needed to add elements to make it really interesting.\n\nOverall, the game is ok with some flaws. I did have fun with the combat, especially in the intro of the game, but after that, it felt like it was all downhill from there; lack luster story, repetitive environments, terribly implemented stealth. Sadly,  Castlevania LoS 2 just couldn’t meet the standards set by the first. As a huge fan of this series, I'm hugely disappointed. As a gamer, it's a “not bad” game.\n\n7/10","November 10, 2014","true","17.6"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","41","56","2","0"

I was also one of the few who defended Lords of Shadow 1 when it really alienated the Castlevania name. I enjoyed the first game a lot, and I was really excited with the idea of a second game.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend this title. It does have great ideas, and I love NWO references (like a reptillian creature, and that a pharmaceutical company is in leagues with Satan). In any case, I'd like to think that this is the Simon's Quest for the Lords of Shadow series. The gameplay is okay, but it has no idea what it wants to be. It wants to be a hack/slash adventure, yet it wants to be a platformer, and yet there are stealth sections which ultimately hurt the game. As a customer, I wanted the Castlevania that built on Lords of Shadow 1, not whatever this is currently.\n\nThe game falls VERY flat in the end. I was not satisfied with the story, despite the massively epic build up from E3. With that said, I don't recommend the game at full retail value.

Both settings provide a nice contrast with each other and are fun to explore\n\n+ The first major difference from the original is the ability to control the camera as opposed to having a fixed camera in the first game.\n\n+ The second major change is all the levels are interconnected with each other. This provides for a much more immersive and seamless experience with gameplay.\n\n+ Combat is more refined than the original and just as fun. You have light magic that does less damage but heals you whenever you damage an enemy and chaos magic that does significantly more damage but is slower and has less range. Effectively dodging and switching between your magic meters is fun and engaging. If you played the first game, the combat should offer little surprise to you. One key difference is by using attacks over and over again you can increase your mastery of a certain weapons making them stronger.\n\n+ Boss battles have always been a highlight for this series and this game is no exception. Bosses are unique, well designed and will require you to use all your techniques in battle to defeat them.\n\n+ the game has plenty of collectables scattered throughout the world\n\n+ The game features 16 optional challenges to further extend your game time. Each challenge has a series of objectives that has to be completed in order to complete the challenge.\n\n+ option to disable quicktime events\n\n\nThe Average\n\nThe story is not awful but it didn't really do much either. It doesn't help that most of the dialogue spoken by the villains is bad.\n\nThis game has some REALLY annoying enemies that will test your patience\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nFor some odd reason the developers decided to include stealth sections in the game. I like stealth games and I like it when developers try to mix up the gameplay but this was just a bad effort. The stealth sections feel very out of place and are not always clear in what you have to do making for some really frustrating trial and error. It also feels very odd that you play a badass destroying most enemies in your path only to reach a section in the level where you have to avoid enemies.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game fixed two of my biggest gripes from the first game. The fact that the levels are interconnected and the ability to actually control the camera make for a much better gameplay experience despite the awful stealth sections. I was a bit baffled that reviewers panned this game pretty badly as I think this game improves the first game in many ways. If you enjoyed the first game then there is no reason why you shouldn't love this game as well, unless of course the modern day setting doesn't appeal to you.\n","July 12, 2015","true","40.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","25","30","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toarueirei/recommended/239250/","toarueirei","eirei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toarueirei/","341 products in account","Some spoilers ahead:\n\nFinishing Lords of Shadow 2 left me with a bitter aftertaste.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the game, you will be forced into stealth missions, evading generic vat-grown monstrosities in high-tech labs. The game's combat system, one of it's greatest strengths, is mercilessly defenestrated here, and as you find yourself sneaking behind an invulnerable guard for the fifth time, you start to wonder at what point it was that you stopped having fun.\n\nBut then you cross over into a castle area, and the familiar atmosphere coupled with the excellent swordplay (whipplay?) makes the game seem like a worthy sequel once again. The combat is fast and fluid, with the accelerated orb gain (compared to the first game) playing a great part in that. The platforming is much more forgiving, although the inclusion of (even more) platform highlighting was really not needed.\n\nAs soon as the game manages to realize you're having fun, however, you encounter the acolytes of Satan. These unfortunate excuses for characters that seem to have been created by pulling edgy tropes from a hat will casually wipe the floor with you - that is, until you use a clever trick to defeat them. Unfortunately, this is a sign of things to come, as well as one of my biggest issues with the game. You are Dracula, the Prince of Darkness. You've ruled this Earth from the shadows for centures, while Satan cowered from you ever since his last defeat. Well, it sure doesn't feel like it, since you'll spend most of your time in LoS2 running away from large fights and powerful enemies. Gabriel Belmont feels no more powerful than he was in the first game - weaker, in fact, due to the fact that you start the game with no skills or abilities.\n\nStill, I went on with the game, hoping that the story would make it worthwhile. I cleaved my way through research facilities and desolated city streets, castle ramparts and dungeons. The narration was served to me in droplets, as if the whole story was an afterthought - an idea that I haven't quite managed to fully dismiss. Eventually, after maybe 12 hours of gameplay, the story started going somewhere. A major revelation was shown, and it had me genuinely interested.\n\nThen it abruptly ended. There was a boss dull boss fight, set on an epic stage only to serve as a distraction from its lazy design (I'll use this opportunity to coin the term "forced epic"). It was over, Dracula said a cheesy one-liner and the credits rolled. That was it. The cluttered mess that the story had become turned into a Gordian knot not even Dracula's Void sword could sever, and it seemed like the developers didn't even bother trying. No shocking twists after the credits, not this time, only a lingering feeling of disappointment. There's a certain sense of irony that the only distinct feeling this game managed to evoke in me, that of sadness, was not over Gabriel's fate, but rather over the missed potential that this game had once held.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a game as empty as its protagonist's soul. Avoid it, especially if you were a fan of the original.","March 13, 2014","false","15.3"," 62 of 97 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","62","97","3","3"

Maybe.....\n\nAfter giving Castlevania Lords of Shadow 1 a glowing review, it really pains me to give this a thumbs down.  I was really hopeful that this sequel would follow in its footsteps as a worthy successor. Unfortunately this game is marred by a clunky camera system, weird game mechanics that don't always work right and an irritating save/checkpoint system that punishes you heavily for failure by making you repeat the same sequences and boss fights over and over again until you get them exactly right.\n\nBy contrast, the first game's checkpoint system was much better in saving your progress (even during boss fight stages) and all the artifacts and items you picked up you kept after you got them. If you died at a particular place, you would just restart at that place with all of your previous progress saved. Not here, you're forced to proceed a great deal further in most instances in order for everything to be saved. Make a mistake and you're going all the way back to the beginning of the sequence or fight. It's just frustrating and not fun.\n\nThe story is just OK. Nothing that really draws you in and connects you to its ficitional world like the first one. The levels take place in a bizarre alternating transition between the past and present which makes the game feel like a cross between its gothic horror roots and the futuristic setting of Doom 3. In the modern levels Dracula will be operating elevators, powering modern machinery and battling mechanized bad guys that are equipped machine guns, grenade launchers and electronic counter measures, it just feels out of place. The main characters aren't as memorable nor do they stir up the same level of emotion as Lords of Shadow 1.\n\nIt's also much harder to go back to previous levels and pick up many of the artifacts you'll need to make your character strong enough to face the tougher enemies in the late game after you unlock the special powers required to get to them. There isn't an individual level selection system like the first game. Instead you have to select a previous location and then find a special room which allows you to teleport to an area of the that location where you think you might have left something behind. It takes way more time to do and just means more repetition of the same convoluted areas over and over.\n\nI'd say it's worth picking up only on sale and only if you're a fan of the first one (having completed it) and Mirror of Fate and have an interest in the story. That's alot of ands. At the time of this writing, I haven't finished it and I intend to see it through but after 15 or so hours I'm getting ready for it to be done.\n\nOverall 5/10","June 26, 2014","false","19.1"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","6"

The story was really not the game strong point this time around.\n\nThe music of course was amazing as usual and really brings out the game, alot of the symphony and the epic music world music makes you feel really pumped playing it, Even if you're walking through an empty hallway. The voice acting is great along with returning Patrick Stewart. Has a very epic sensation to it and goes really well with the game.\n\nGameplay  The fighting and combat is fast and action packed, fighting enemies is sort of like a puzzle and requires strategy and thinking You cannot go in mashing, I tried and ended up looking like a fool and getting ripped by the mobs. You'll have to think the game revolves around your shadow whip, Vorpal blade which heals when you hit enemy and your Chaos gaunlet  which breaks defense when you use it against certain enemies along with dodging and guarding mechanic.\nThe game itself has alot more jumping puzzles and Puzzles itself. This time along with some stealth which is medicore. There is alot more platforming. The real treat is that also the world is a bit more explorable this time around, with many sections of the future + past at the same time.\n\nUsed an xbox controller for this game, tried the keyboard and didn't work too well for me, also note the port had Xbox showing buttons popped up which needs to be fixed for players. This time the camera is also no longer in a fixed position, it is  now controlled by the player though could be better if you could actually hit a button to face your enemy.\n\nThe graphic itself has HD textures given to you, which is great but doesn't change the fact that it was  A PORT. though still a great game and looks quite decent. The level design looks phenominal, the detail put into it if you look carefully and how the buttons and switches in the game works the way they do, The future might look a little bleak and grim maybe a  bit different than what many expects but did look ok.\n\n\nTLDR\n\n+Good music and voice acting\n+Great environments design\n+Fast action paced combat that requires players to think before mashing\n+Lots of puzzles and platforming\n+Boss fights were really fun, and bosses look cool very unique.\n+ Not a linear game this time around, has explorable areas that can be revisted with warp points.\n\n\n\n-Story was mediocre\n-The stealth sections of the game was mediocre also can be very fustrating at certain points for some.\n- Could had offered more than just looking for items in the  world, sidequest could had been great.\n-No multiplayer, no real replay value of any sort except finding the stuff you haven't found or playing harder difficulty.\n-Unescessary qtes on buttons.\n- Game was way too easy even on hardest difficulty you could choose in the beginning.","February 26, 2014","true","15.9"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","36","57","0","2"

Everything different from the first episode is for the worse. First of it, the cyberpunk setting feels cheesy, and the designs cheap.\n\nThe very structure of the game, wich is now a real metroid-vania, will just have you spend hours in long, frustrating trips across the area. No real maps, not enough shortcuts, and no real way to help you create a mental map of the whole place (not like dark souls for example). Plus you'll have to endure excruciatingly slow scenes designed to hide the loading away from your righteous wrath. Tons of them. It's what I remember the most about the whole game experience.\n\nThe combat is still good, yet not as good as before. The new beautiful FX will quite often hide important informations on enemies, resulting in a punch in your face, and the sad disappearance of your focus bar. And the combat sessions have been fragmented in shorter fights, wich doesn't allow you to make this focus bar really useful. What were they thinking ?\n\nEvery new feature, like stealth, are absurdly bad.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad game, it's still beautifully crafted, challenging and the core fighting gameplay is still good. But everything else seems to have been designed by a drunk guy. That's really sad. And you'll have to endure hours of this ♥♥♥♥ between every neat fight or exploration of cool (or less cool) places.

But luckily there is a castle, so I guess it's not all bad.\nOkay, half a castle.\n\nYou play as Dracula...What, really? Yeah, you play as that guy you've been beating up since the 80's. Now, when I played Lords of Shadow I explained that I am not familiar with Castlevania outside of a little bit of Symphony of the Night. Now that I've played more than an hour of the original games I have a better understanding of the series. And now I come to you saying that Castlevania: Lords of Shadow as a series feels more like a fairly competent fan fiction than it's own universe.\n\nAfter an annoying tutorial sequence, you wake up in the DISTANT FUTURE OF 1999, at least I think it's 1999. Dracula awakens form his long slumber looking much like I do after a Saturday night, minus the incredibly handsome. After getting beaten up by a large T-rex looking monster, you are saved by a man in armor  who's wielding a suspiciously Japanese looking sword, lets just call him Scrungus Humungous for now.\n\nSo Scrungus takes you back to his master Zobek, who is Patrick Stewart but also a jerk. He tells you that Satan is using his Acolytes to revive him so he can dominate the world. Zobek tells you that if you can pull Satan out of hiding and defeat him, he will give Dracula the eternal rest he longed for.\n\nSo yes, this game is about Dracula fist fighting Satan.\n\nI should probably explain the game now.\n\nMuch like the first game, LOS is a action beat-em-up much like God of War. You have three weapons, a whip, a sword, and your dukes, but your dukes are on fire, how rad is that? Both the sword and your fire fists are on a meter of sorts while your whip is good to go at any moment, not unlike a whip in that weird teachers basement.\n\nYour enemies come in different shapes and sizes, with a nice touch that they all have lore and back story to them. But other than a few special moves they all attack the same outside of the very few bosses you run into. Standard attacks can be both blocked and countered, leaving the enemy open for a critical attack. But every now and then, or more than often, all the time, the enemy will use a heavy attack which you will have to dodge. Outside of a few items and changing weapons on the fly, that's about as complicated as combat gets.\n\nSo I'm going to say some bad stuff now.\n\nLike I said before, I finally got familiar with Castlevania as a whole, and now a lot of elements just leave a bad taste in my mouth. Outside of Dracula originally being Gabriel Belmont (Spoilers by the way, if you've never watched any of the trailers), the Belmont lineage kind of gets turned into that soup the weird lady hands out down town. Dracula and Alucard (That's Dracula backwards) are both Belmonts and the rest of the lineage kind of takes a back seat.  Actual spoilers by the way.\nYou actually DO meet another Belmont named Victor, but he dies roughly 10 minutes after you meet him, so whatever.\n\nThis is honestly kind of stupid, in the original series, Dracula was a man named Mathias Cronqvist, so not only did they change who Dracula actually IS but they also flat out replaced him with their own new character for the series: Gabriel.\n\nWhat was the point of this? I'm not in the fanbase but did anyone actually ask for Dracula as a playable character? It doesn't add anything because your best healing is the same healing you used in the last game because Dracula biting fools doesn't really cut it. If they really wanted you to play as a Vampire why didn't they just have you play as Alucard as you did in Symphony or that other part of Mirror of Fate? Alucard already plays better than his father does in the DLC and has a more interesting set of skills.\n\nDid they think that people really liked Gabriel so much as a character that they wouldn't want to move on to another Belmont? Perhaps continue the narrative in another way that doesn't include reusing an original character you made specifically for your reboot? It doesn't really even feel all that Castlevania like, really, outside of a few name drops and shout outs from previous games.\n\nAnd for a game with as much padding as Lords of Shadow 2, it sure as hell is rushed at the end. And by that I mean it just kind of ends, it's all over and then Dracula goes to take a nap. I'm not kidding, that's how it ends. Roll credits. I've watched bum fights with better closure than that.\n\nShould you play Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2: The Reckoning: Fury Road?\n\nThis is actually hard. Because the game has a really strong start but then kind of fades away at the half way point. A lot of plot points are just kind of shoved aside or hand waved before the game comes to an end and it drags on just long enough for the combat to become frustrating and boring. Just like my sex life.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's nowhere near as offensive as other reboots like, lets say, DmC, or my sex life. I just feel like it could have maybe cut out a lot of the fat and busy work and focused on it's strongest point.\n\nJust like my sex life.\n\n\nLOS2 is getting pass, but just barely, I would get it while it's on sale at five bucks or less. It's not great, but it's nowhere near as offensive as a lot of other reviewers made it out ot be. If you absolutely NEED a vampire game right at this moment, though? You can get the Legacy of Kain series for much cheaper.\n\nFortressmania 2: Kings of Shade gets 3 badly voiced sections from Symphony of the night out of 6.\n\nDracula backwards is Alucard.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","March 17","true","15.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","15","20","11","2"

The combat has been improved,  and finally you have control over the camara so you see all the gorgeous structures. With lots of boss fights, and boy the boss sure are alot of fun! Especially the toy maker. They aren't the most orignal bosses, but like I said..they are fun to battle with. Also I find myself enjoying the puzzles, there are actually very few puzzles. The platforming also has been improved...it feels more natural to me..too bad they didn't put any sort-of challenge within the platforming area's that often, the challenges that are within the platforming bits  were fun. But! this game is not perfect, in the beginning you have a few stealth sections which are terrible. They are not difficult or anything, just annoying..ESPECIALLY the last one! that one just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.  Also believe or not..there are two hide-seek moments, the first one was hilarisch and put the big smile on my face, seeing as the person who was looking for me couldn't find me...and the thought that the great Dracula had to hide..was funny to me. BUUUTTTT the second one I didn't like.

The voice acting was excellent. I mean Patrick Stewart voiced a character can hardly go wrong. ButI hated the ending, I thought was going to be something emotional and deep but..no.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nobodynoproblem/recommended/239250/","nobodynoproblem","Nobody No-One","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nobodynoproblem/","243 products in account","This game is a mixed bag, and by no means outright terrible. There are however many flaws which strike me.\n\nGameplay in and of itself, with the exception of the glaring annoyance of nonsensical stealth sections is decent enough, and all of the provided mechanics are put to work equally in the combat and in exploring the world itself. This works well enough though it doesn't appear to me to be anything revolutionary or exciting.\n\nStealth sections very much break the established flow, despite being short and ridiculously easy to get past they are at odds with the rest of the game, disabling your ability to perform any attacks short of stunning opponents and trying to escape. It doesn't make sense when the game plays up the fact you're a character with ridiculous combat ability, and you're regularly destroying enemies twice the size or so of the guards in the stealth section which utterly wreck you in seconds if you get caught. The mechanics the stealth sections use, possesion and transforming into a swarm of rats don't seem to be used to their utmost. Particularly possession, why not allow the player to actually do something with the apparently invincible guard they're controlling aside from use an eye scanner to open a door?\n\nAs for turning into a group of rats, when the rat you're controlling dies - you possess the next rat in your entourage.  If all the rats die, you die.  This is used to -some- effect in the first stealth section where you have to navigate tunnels and avoid hazards, keeping your other rats alive. As well as again later on very briefly.  I don't particularly like this kind of gameplay, but the idea was good and for the effort spent in making it functional it seems very underused.\n\nThe game world itself is nice looking and well designed in most respects but it's fairly linear, it does allow backtracking throughout though mainly for the purposes of revisiting past areas with new abilities to grab missed collectables, which is more in tow with the series prior, although likely not quite as interesting. If you like collecting lots of crap (increases to various gauges, unlockable challenges, item limit upgrades, artwork) and trying to 100% games, that's a pro and you might enjoy it. The upgrade system for the main set of combat abilities is good, and offers some interesting options.\n\nEnemies are fairly varied, interesting and the bosses are pretty fun. Though the hardest difficulty is locked until you've beaten the game. One flaw is that enemies and bosses (and anyone in combat with you) will quote the same 3-6 lines of dialogue over and over as you fight them to the point of it becoming annoying.  I like about as many of the character and enemy designs as I find unappealing, even then knowing that the ones I do like aren't very memorable and don't actually get that much focus.\n\nStory is a big no sale for me, which is a shame because signifigant portions of it could be considered competent and plenty of time has clearly been spent on it. The main setting is uninteresting and feels generic as a plot point (despite the actual work which went into designing it.) Most of the characters motivations seem either generic, pointless, obvious or some combination of all three. The best segments are generally spent in the castle sequences, but the whole premise behind that is fundamentally pretty simple and renders itself unnecessary on the whole. There's a lot of background information in the journal which updates with entries on your abilities when you get them, and each enemy type/character when you kill/meet them respectively. This is nice if you like these kind of details.\n\nPC controls work well enough, although onscreen prompts still use controller buttons which is lazy. There is a contextual control reference dropdown bound to F1 which shows what action, what button it's mapped too and what key represents that button, which is at least something. Being provided with a HD texture pack and features like being able to disable QTE's is great. Even if I found this game average I feel at least somewhat vindicated in supporting it for providing things like this.\n\nIf you're sensible, You'll wait to get this until it's on sale or gets a price drop. It's entertaining, stable and more or less what it presents itself as, but no grand masterpiece unless you're a person who'd particularly enjoy the areas where the game excels and be capable of enjoying it despite its problems.","February 27, 2014","false","8.1"," 57 of 102 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","57","102","0","0"

The characters are enjoyable, the boss fights are true highlights, and the combat remains the meat of the game. We finally get to explore Dracula's castle in a modern 3D environment that does it justice, there are too many instances where a new area makes you pause just to admire the scenery. It is like the level designers took the concept art (which always looks so much better) and then implemented it literally, and somehow made it even better. I like the anti-hero that Gabriel became, even if they fumbled a bit in justifying how he got to that point.\n\nThe original LoS had puzzle sections which some players did not care for. LoS2 eliminates those in favor of "stealth action" puzzles, which even fewer people cared for. Whoops. There's about three or four of those sections in the game, and they're really not as big of a deal as they're made out to be, but they do remain pretty funky standouts. The biggest error LoS2 makes, which I haven't really seen mentioned anywhere, is being a wildly lavish game that was hamstrung by console design. There aren't any loading screens, but there are enough terminal areas where things are being loaded in the background that it's painfully obvious what's going on. At least there are no chupacabra levels.\n\nIt's clear the designer's hearts were in the castle levels. The modern era is "fine", but really lacks anything interesting. And monsters shouldn't have guns, they break your concentration meter easily and are barely telegraphed.","October 25, 2014","true","38.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

Without knowing until after I finished this Lords of Shadow series follows an alternate timeline from the others in that series, and without playing Lords of Shadow 1, I enjoyed it a lot. The game catches you up to the story of Lords of Shadow well, and I enjoyed the plot and flow of the game.\n\nGameplay (fighting) is pretty hack-slash with comboing using the whip, or sword/chaos claws but is quite simple. I've read people compare it to God of War, but having not played that series I wouldn't know. I wasn't expecting anything amazing in combat but I did find it fun to play despite not a huge variation in enemies. At least most of the enemies weren't annoying, but I did dread getting into fights. There was a fair bit of platforming, some stealth missions which I hated, and some nice simple puzzle-solving. There as good flow and variation during the story to keep it fresh.\n\nExploration in this game is pretty lacking. Missions/the story is pretty linear/guided, and unless you wanted to upgrade your weapons/skills (not necessary if you played on an easier difficulty like me, I just wanted to play this game casually) there was no point in re-visiting areas. You can access 'new areas' in levels with upgraded abilities later in the game, but there's really no point unlike in Castlevania:SotN because you won't be getting new weapons/skills/etc. doing so. Don't expect some Skyrim/TES bonuses from going off the beaten path\n\nVisually, this game is pretty good. Nice background scenery, the castle looks beautiful. The modern city is kind of 'meh', but I did appreciate how the game looked. Some of the audio tracks are great too, but you will run into a lot of the same music.\n\nOverall, I had fun with the game and enjoyed it for what it was. I admitedly got frustrated with some parts of the game and would just quit playing 10 minutes in if I couldn't advance through the story fast enough to do other stuff but my yearning for knowing what happened in this game kept me coming back. I won't be playing it beyond the story mode and doing a NG+ mode or anything like that. Buy it on sale for 10-15 dollars but I wouldn't pay full price for it.","December 21, 2014","true","16.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It was not the best Castlevania game. And in some aspects it did not beat LoS1. However after first part in city  it got more interesting. Rat parts and stealth parts are utterly boring and stupidly easy. Combat is great, mastering skills is fun, looking for secrets also. Enemies in the "flashbacks" or what it is are great, some familiar characters. Story is pretty decent, some suprise moments towards the end. Music was kinda disappointing though, only 3-4 tracks were on par with Los1. Overall  I would say - if you can overcome some boring parts mostly stealths and real world fights, game itself is fun.\n\nPros:\n- weapons, amount of skills\n-story, suprise characters\n-flashbacks\n-secrets\n-bosses (mostly flashback ones though)\n-graphics\n-atmosphere\n-some awesome levels and "puzzles" (theater <3)\n-option to disable QTE's\n\n\nCons:\n- RIP logic puzzles\n-you dont feel like being most powerful being in the world...\n-annoying as ♥♥♥♥ robots.\n-rats\n-dungeon keys... if I knew it, I would be full of them ffs!\n-no baba yaga musicbox level :(((\n-small spoiler - on of familiar bosses was on steroids lol\n\nOverall 8/10\nI hope new game plus shows secret locations, because there is no hint in which area did I miss some.\n","January 22","true","20.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Really now, many gaming magazines (see Edge #d0uche_detected) have underrated it... (4/10). Even "Octodad" or "The Banner Saga" got a higher score than LoS2... I can only assume that they were trying to elicit attention through these means... anyway --> TO THE POINT!\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, The Dragon Returns! :O \o/ Such a good game... but how come it has so many opponents this time, in contrary to its predecessor? lel.. Well, let's begin with the reasons I deem this game worthy of its money:\n+ Gorgeous Graphics\n+ Satisfying durance\n+ Wide variety of actions, skills, collectibles, missions, enemies etc.\n+ Very well contemplated and made plot (they have taken really good care of it), plus there is an awesome plot twist!\n+ The combat mechanics (endless moves, powers and upgrades)\n+ THE PROTAGONIST! Anyone who has played LoS 1, can definitely recall Gabriel being... uuhm... TOO QUITE! Honestly, he scarcely spoke, we knew almost nothing about him or his personality. Unlike that, this time, Gabriel (or what is left from that ♥♥♥♥) starts to reveal who he really is, his character, his desires, and generally he now IS appropriate for a protagonist. (Moreover, his voice actor, Robert Carlyle, has done an undoubtly good job "incarnating" dracula)\n+ Yup, MANY stunning bosses ^^\n+ The soundtracks ;3 (#♥♥♥_yaeh)\n....But, there is always the other side...\n- A number of fans maintain that they face several problems (like the game can't start, or gets stuck at a certain point of the game). Also, in spite of the aforementionted problems, EVERYONE may face glitches (small or B I G ones)\n- It could become monotonus at some point, especially when you get to roam the same area over and over again...\n- The enviroments you play in... (yeah it's a whole new era, and yeah no more majestic forests etc., BUT, it is the plot that demands that! You are no longer Gabriel, but a creature of the night, you live in the 21st century, you can't move with the sunlight. The very game itself has "darkened". This is the reason some fans don't even consider this "negative" point at all, while others miss the old castlevania enviroments)\n- Despite the fact that there are many boss battles, some of them end really quickly, and it is not that difficult to understand how to defeat them.\n- There are TOO many (and a bit complicated) moves in the combat system, that you just don't have time to remember, use and make good use of them (some are just beautiful and expensive, nothing more, nothing less)\n- The final boss battle... (relatively short and easy to cope with)\nTo sum up, this game has both various advantages and disadvantages. But I would still recommend you to purchase it, it is really stunning, fun, and worthy of your time. Yeah, it is true that there are some disturbing drawbacks, but the advantages still surpass them.\n\n\n***(This review is based on my personal view on this game.

A feeling of being on an grandious, epic, adventure through ancient lands and fairy creatures as well as monsters. It's was not the most ideal re-imagining of the Castlevania brand, there were the low's but also the high's, and the high's outweighed the low's IMO... that is until they actually continued from the epilogue and explained it.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is an oddly excellent example of a game who's budget coupled with one man's over-confidence(from the success of the first game) turned arrogance, effectively ruined any ounce of a future this particular franchise ever had. There is quality here, don't doubt it, it's just found sparsely between thick stretches of game-design that will utterly boggle the mind, how Enric Álvarez, the series director who, literaly, stood for every gameplay design and story sequence in LoS2, how he ever convinced himself this was good.\n\nThe combat is more of less the exact same, apart from a few weapons, with an added options to turn off quicktime-events.\n\nThe game is split up between modern-times, where you travel through a city which was built around Dracula's grand castle, and past times, before humanity apparently conquered the dark prince, a mystery you will only solve a half-hour before the credits roll. Execution is everything. The story telling, the characters, the level design, the various game mechanics, the leveling system to the weapons... all of it is just horribly miss-matched and all over the place. There are stealth sections equiped with enemies in god-mode. You simply aren't able to fight them and they take you out with projectiles in two hits. These sections are numerous and extremely tedious. You're supposed to be Dracula, taking on Satan himself... but you are apparently a small ant compared to this simple mob. Laughable. PR said that they were going to fuse the first LoS with SotN(one of my favorite games ever) and the thought had me riveting with saliva. I could even see it in front of me.\n\nI loathed the story almost completely. Resented every aspect of the modern levels. Not a fan of this Alucard either apart from purely visual perspective. He even retconned the story from the first game in a pretty stupid way. I bought this at full price day one. I did not listen to reviews.

No doubt about that. Also I would love to like this game but it's decent at best. I'm pretty sure they made it as irritating as they could. I'm going to list the MAJOR grievances I have with this game.\n\nEXAMPLE: At one point in the game, you have to ride an elevator. So you kill a bunch of enemies and go to the elevator to find out it has no power. Then you go back to the entrance and start the generator. All enemies respawn and you kill them again. When you're finally at the elevator there's still no power since the generator has a timer >: ( So back to the entrance again and start the generator AGAIN! Then back to the elavator a final third time. Frustrates me to no end.\n\nThe game constantly pulls this sort of thing.\n\nEXAMPLE: You see a powerup just out of reach. You move through the entire area of jumping puzzles and climbing to get to the top. That's where the way to the powerup is found and you have to jump down all the way to the beginning to get it.\n\nUnnecessary and long cutscenes is also gravely irritating. I love cutscenes when they tell story and fill a purpose.\nWhen you fast travel you get a 15 sec cutscene when he "opens" the device, a second cutscene (10 sec) when he enters, and a third (10 sec) when he exits. That is not fast. When you enter the shop there is a annoying cutscene every time.\nTo be fair though you can skip the cutscenes by entering the pause menu and selecting skip cutscene but that is also slow and annoying.\n\nOh! I broke my keybord in half in pure rage recently when playing the challenges in this game. You don't get full health or magic between tries. You don't even get back the levels of hp and mp you had when you entered the challenge if you retry. And the goals in the challenges are not set to be fun. They are set to be as irritating as (un)humanly possible.\n\nAnd the chupacabra character. I seriously want to punch the creator of that guy. I'm dead serious.\n\nOther than that it's a pretty decent game. Combat is mostly fun and the whole idea with the castle(won't say more) was actually great. The lore is a good read and the existance of dodo birds is a great relief for any perfectionist. Also the freedom to run around the city and castle however you want (after you've unlocked the area) is a welcome change in the series.\n\nOh! Also the story is pretty bad.\n\nIf it's on sale and you're bored, buy it.

The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. It was released late February 2014 in both North America and Europe and on March 2014 in Australia. A Japanese release was released on September 4, 2014. A downloadable chapter has also been released in March from the same year.\n\nGameplay\nAs in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Shadow Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. Lords of Shadow 2 features a movable camera, something that was not available in its predecessor.\n\nMy opinion\nThe game is fun, but it's optimized poorely. The controls with keyboard are pain in the ♥♥♥♥ and FPS drops make it even more worse and PLUS horrible stealth mechanic ruins most of the fun. I fixed of the problems by using Razer Onza controller. This game has a good plot which I don't want to spoil, but if you're unfamiliar with the previous game- don't worry, there's a short re-cap in the start of the game.  The slasher elements make the gameplay live and interesting and the level up system doesn't award those who use only one combo, which makes you use different variations of attacks. The game is great for the money that are asked for it.\n\nWould recommend to:\n*Fans of Slashers\n*Fans of Vampires\n*Fans of games with great story\n*Fans of lags/horrible controlls/bad stealth\n\nWould not recommend to:\n*Old fans of Castlevania (Way before the first Lords of Shadow was released)","November 6, 2014","true","1.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrustle/recommended/239250/","scrustle","Scrustle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrustle/","79 products in account","Lords of Shadow 2 is a very good, but not quite a great game. It has some flaws, but it has fun gameplay and a rich atmosphere. It's mostly a character action game with some open world elements.\n\nFirstly, the good stuff. Most of the time playing this game you will be either in combat with enemies, or exploring the world. Combat is very fun and engaging, albeit not the deepest of the genre. It can't rival the likes of Platinum's work, but still creates a fun system that keeps you wanting more. It has a nice rhythm to it as it requires you to always keep an eye on enemies and properly timing blocking to keep your combo up, which is crucial for the "Focus" system. This system is also what gives you the power needed to use two of the three main weapons. These two weapons also have special effects, such as freezing enemies or burning away their armour, but break your Focus. It creates this flow to combat that feels very fluid and back-and-forth, meaning you can't get lazy and just endlessly wail on enemies without opposition, especially on higher difficulties. The different weapons also feel distinct from each other outside of their special effects. They each have different range, speed, and power, and there are plenty of combos in each weapon that all have a use in different combat situations, which are unlocked in an RPG style experience system.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game is also great. Everything has a dark and intricate look to it, with stunning Gothic architecture and really interesting world and boss design. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with a sweeping orchestral sound that fits the melodramatic and dark feel of the game. This makes simply being in the game world and moving around it a lot of fun. It does a good job of helping you soak in the atmosphere, both in and out of combat. The kinaesthetics too, are fantastic. The weapons all have a very satisfying feel to them. A sense of power and impact, but also vibrancy. They leave trails colour that arc around in the air as you swing your weapons, or explosions when they hit enemies. Some of the more powerful moves are especially impressive in how they surround you in a storm of whirling lights that destroys everything in the area.\n\nThe structure of the game world is pretty interesting as well, and quite unique for the genre. Unlike the first game in the Lords of Shadow series, this game is set in two moderately sized open-world areas. It is somewhat inspired by the traditional Castlevania style of level design, but isn't really the focus of the gameplay here. Yet it still manages to achieve this feeling of place to the game world. You can explore around the worlds seamlessly, without any loading screens, and many areas are connected, and sometimes loop around on each other. This also aids the sense of atmosphere to the game, and gives the game much better pacing than the first as well. Here, you're not thrown back to the main menu to sit through a long loading screen every fifteen minutes. It's nowhere near as dense and maze-like as the older Castlevania games, or something like Dark Souls, but for what it brings to the type of game it is, it's a great addition.\n\nThere are also some areas of the game which are clearly lacking, though they are not anywhere near significant enough to ruin the experience.\n\nFirstly, there are the much lamented stealth sections. These are pretty bad, but not game-breakingly so. They feel half-baked and somewhat forced in to the game, by taking away your ability to fight while entering a stealth section. The mechanics of the stealth sections are also shallow, and it’s not exactly clear when you are detected or not. When you are, although it's not an instant failure, it might as well be, given that you will be attacked by enemies that can kill you in two hits or so, even with all the health upgrades. But even so, these sections are relatively rare. They make up only what is probably 5% or less of the actual main story. On top of that they are all incredibly short and easy. All they require you to do most of the time is sneak to the other side of a small room. Usually that involves nothing more than distracting one enemy, or possessing another. Additionally, once a stealth section has been cleared, you will never have to do it again if you return to the same area.\n\nAnother problem is the story. It's a confused mess of underutilised characters and poorly explained plot devices. This game was set up as a big finale to the Lords of Shadow story, and unfortunately it mostly fails at that. There are a lot of characters in the game which don't get as much time as they need to really make the impact they could. They often appear only as bosses, given a short introduction and forgotten immediately after. While the boss fights themselves are fun, from a story perspective they feel like they are being given the short straw. There are also some elements of the story that are fairly crucial to the plot which aren't explained well at all. For example the Mirror of Fate, from the game of the same name, also plays a prominent role in this game, but its significance isn't explained here, and its role seems unrelated to the game it was introduced in. But despite this, there are a few good moments. A conversation or two that hit on some interesting points, although they are never explored as they could be, still bring out some good character moments. Even so, the story isn't a huge part of the game. It can be mostly ignored, and it's not as if the series had a particularly great story to begin with. The best part of the story was mostly the tone and feeling of it, which in both the previous games and this one, are mostly achieved through the aesthetics.\n\nSo overall, Lords of Shadow 2 is a pretty good game. Far from perfect, but certainly undeserving of the baffling critical mauling it got. If you were a fan of the previous Lords of Shadow game(s), then this should be right up your alley as well. It's far from the best game in the world, but much like its predecessors, it is a flawed gem.\n\nAs a side note, I recommend that if you have played the first game, but not Mirror of Fate, you should also play that before this one. The stories are quite closely connected, and as previously mentioned, this game expects you to be familiar with it. Although it’s not as good as LoS2, MoF is short and can be beaten in a day if you focus on only the main story.","April 2, 2015","true","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very much a "bigger, better, more" sequel. An open world connected by shortcuts, more weapons and spells to use, and the addition of new relics and items to toss about. Unfortunately, the story and lore about about as mishmosh and nonsensical as the first games if you give them even a second thought, so if you're looking for a compelling addition to the Castlevania chronicles, like the first game, you're going to be sorely mistaken.\n\nFor being "the epic conclusion" to the Lords of Shadow saga, very little is actually concluded.\n\nLuckily, the combat is smoother, faster, more fluid, as are all the platforming aspects. While the trappings and aesthetics are lacking, underneath beats the heart of a solid, fun action game. Like the first game, I feel like if it had been called anything buta Castlevania game, the story would get a pass.

Just check the user metacritic/steam reviews which you'll find overwhelmingly positive.\n\nPros:-\n* Gorgeous art style with large and stunning vistas - IMO the biggest draw of the LOS series.\n* Combat is fluid and satisfying with great variety in combos/powers/special moves\n* Presentation is top-notch. Right from voice acting to cutscenes the game is very polished\n* High quality orchestral music. A bit understated, but sets an epic ambience nonetheless.\n* Misc-  Great boss battles /decent in-game lore/some very creative sections (eg: toymaker)\n\nCons:-\n* Flow of the game is often interrupted with excessive camera cues/ superflous cutscenes/etc. To be fair this happens less as the game progresses though.\n* Stealth sections albeit few, are insipid. Particularly annoying are the Golgoth guard sections where the mighty Dracula is rendered powerless and has to solve uninspired puzzles to progress further in the game. IMO the other stealth sections (incudling the widely derided Carmilla/Agreus ones) were actually pretty decent.\n* The story is inconsistent, some parts are evocative and well done, while others just don't add up. There's often a sense of confusion and dissonance in the plot.","March 13, 2014","true","36.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Completley reminicent to the God Of War series.\nGood characters/voice acting. I personally enjoyed watching all of the cut scenes.\nPartialy destructable enviornment. Cans clutter and such.\nChallenging boss fights.\n\n\nNegitives\n\nIt wants you to play with a game pad. The game does not seem to be designed for a mouse and keyboard. Every Single Time there is a quick time event the UI will come up telling you to spam things like the left trigger to an Xbox controller. Made me have to consult the key mapping way way too often.\nClaims to be partly open world when it really is not. You get to revisit previously traveled to destinations. Mainly rooms and hallways in a completley linear path.\nDracula does not act like Dracula. You find yourself with menial tasks, and small obsticals that make little sence. You're supposed to be the Prince of Darkness.. Satan is concerned with how powerful you are.. but hold on I have to run down stairs to turn on a power switch to activate an elevator to go to the next floor. Tell me that's somthing a Vampire Lord would do.\nSilly stealth sections. Again, knowing forwell that Satan fears you, you decide to morph into a rat and sneak around a guard or two, here and there. Must be one hell of a guard.  Insta kill if they find you btw. On that note, you never face them in open combat.\nInvisible walls. If a spot is not game essential, you're not going there. Don't expect an Assassins Creed style of play here.\nThe game holds your hand the whole way through. The camera will usualy show you exactly where you need to go, how to get there, and have either a glowy thing waiting for you or a char shouting to you with explanations. Yet, some parts you just havent the foggiest bit of a hint of where to go.\nLow replay value. There are elements present to keep you busy after the main story is over, however I can't see entertainment value lasting with that; or starting a new save; albite there are always diffrent difficulty levels if you're into that.\nThe only way to die in this game is in a giant explosion of blood. The enemies almost always blow up, or burst into blood. I think that greatly takes away from the feel of it.\nAnother game that likes to kill off just about everyone. You catch onto the trend of: Oh a new guy. Guess he's the next boss..  but this ones my opinion, maybe you just like all that murder.\n\n\n\nOne list seems to be bigger than the other. Hrm.\n\nSo to wrap up, The game has a solid foundation, and is fun; 15 ish+ hours gameplay. However there are some problems that sound like somebody put money over quality. I may have been nitpicking but this is a $60.00 game, and theres another $10.00 or so worth of DLC.\nNothing is perfect, but if you're going to put somthing out at full price don't do it half ♥♥♥♥♥. Regrettably, that seems to be what this is. They came so close but just didn't go all the way.\n\nAs I said up top; Sure I'll recomend this title.. but not right now. This is somthing that you will enjoy playing, but not with the current pricetag/greavences.\n\n\nP.S.\nIs it just me or do the DLC costumes just look like a recolored version of what he's already wearing??","March 26, 2014","true","16.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I was looking forward to this game ever since the first trailer came out on the E3 2012, so I can say that I pretty much had high standards for it.\n\nI was a bit afraid that MercurySteam won't be able to exceed my expectations, but I am happy to say that they did. The graphics look great, much better, than, for example, the new Thief's graphics imo, and don't forget that this game wasn't even made for the so called next-gen consoles. Sure, lot's of critics say that the modern day-chapters don't look as good, and the lot of grey metal becomes boring over time, but I think that that's exactly the point. And the reason is that Dracula is a very complex character, the best one created in a long time, he lost everything, his love, faith, son, etc, and that's what even the modern setting implies: if you compare Dracula's castle in the past with the city that is built upon it in the present, you can also see that he even lost the home he had had for centuries. His castle became barren, empty, just like he himself. Maybe I overinterpret things, but I still think it's a great metaphor.\nThe music is awesome, seriously, while I was playing, there were times when I just stopped moving around because I wanted to listen to the music till the end.\nGameplay's also great. Sure, Castlevania includes elements from the God of War and Devil May Cry series, but it combines the best elements of these games, so players really have nothing to complain about.\n\nSo all in all, I can recommend this game for everyone who looks for an intensive hack 'n' slash with a great and complex story with unexpected twists.

Gameplay wise the arcadish mission selection approach has been replaced by an open world with transitions from the present, modern age  to the medieval ages.\nThere's also a stealth mechanics introduced in the sequel, which is largely criticized by many people.\nBut is this new feature really THAT bad? I think not, while it certainly breaks the pace of the game, the number and difficulty of these segments are LOW, that it shouldn't bother many people. And certainly not a reason not to play the game because of these parts.\n\nThat being said, this game is a very solid and entertaining entry in the franchise, which also concludes the Lords of Shadow trilogy!\n\nPROS:\n- Graphics are gorgeous, and performance wise the game is very well optimized!\n- Soundtrack is excellent, and so is the voice acting!\n- The game design also well done in Lords of Shadow 2. This includes the architecture, level, creature and boss designs.\n- Combat is easier, than Lords of Shadow 1, but still very satisfying.\n- Boss fights are easier than Lords of Shadow 1, but at the same time very entertainining.\n- Platforming segments are more fluent this time.\n- Lot's of content and collectibles providing huge replay value.\n\nNOT PRO, BUT NOT CON EITHER:\n- Due to the newly introduced open world approach, the arcadish level selection feature is gone in Lords of Shadow 2. This means boss fights cannot be replayed, unless you start a new game!\n\nCONS:\n- While the story is good, the story-telling is not so coherent as it was in the last game.\n- Some characters weren't introduced properly (lack of screentime)\n- Xbox button prompts, and console HUD. This wasn't an issue in the prequel, so there's no excuse here!\n- The difficulty decreased signifantly in all aspects. This includes platforming, combat and boss fights as well.\n- Puzzle elements were mostly removed from Lords of Shadow 2. It's a pity, the prequel had some nice puzzles.","March 1, 2014","true","71.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

If you're a fan of action games, exploration games, or loved the first Lords of Shadow, there is plenty here to be happy about. However, if you were NOT a fan of the first game, there is little reinventing of the wheel here to pull you into the franchise.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nThe exploration from the modern areas to the realm of Dracula's Castle is fluid. Dracula moves very intuitively, response time is great, and once the game really starts to open up its areas you really get this sense of a large scale fluid world. The negative here would be the platforming, or lack there of. Platforming in LOS2 is mostly just wall climbing from grapple to grapple. It can feel a little dull at times.\n\nCombat: 9/10\n\nThe combat system from the first Lords of Shadow returns, but with a HUGE overhaul. It has been streamlined to perfection in almost every area. The pace at unlocking skills feels perfect, the variety of Dracula's weapons is interesting enough to keep combat feeling fresh, and the combinations of moves Dracula can perform make combat easily the most enjoyable experience of LOS2.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nContinuing where LOS1's ending left off, the story of LOS2 is a great epic. There are moments in the story that had me jaw drop, the highs are fantastically done. However, there are low points. There are a few twists that you can see happening a mile away that occur, and there are two specific points in the story that really bring down the overall score. Without spoiling for those who haven't played, the two negatives I attribute to story are in the case of a character being VASTLY underused, and the game's ending.\n\nMusic: 9/10\n\nIt's awesome. Orchestral awesomeness. The somber tones, the high symphonies, everything. It's not classic Castlevania, but it deserves praise all its own.\n\nGraphics (PC): 8/10\n\nEven if there is occasional tearing and the odd lightning hear and there, LOS2 is very pleasing to look at. The game looks great.\n\nOther notes: As many have read, there are *stealth* sections in this game. I am not even going to dignify them to allow a drop in score, because they are NOT broken, NOR are they impossible. They slightly disrupt the flow of the game in some parts, but if you utilize ALL of your abilities (Shadow Daggers, Bats, Mist form, Possession) and use your brain, these sections are laughably easy. The most infamous response to these sections have been from Kotaku, who's reviewer got stuck on one particular section for FOUR hours. I completed the same section in less than two minutes. Use your abilities, and these sections are trivial.\n\nOverall: 8.75/10\n\nLOS2 is a great game that is sadly being underplayed by major media sources. It is NOT game of the year, sure, but this is a solid title that can stand on its own and a wonderful edition to the Castlevania franchise. Mercury Steam should be proud of LOS2, because they made a good game. I enjoyed my 14 hour playthrough, and will continue to play it for 100% and achievements.","February 26, 2014","true","21.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

If not, go check out that game first before you buy LoS 2, since this game relies VERY heavily on the backstory from the original LoS.\n\nFor those of you who have played the original LoS and finished the game, your next question is probably going to be: how does LoS 2 compare to the original?\n\nI was a very big fan of the original LoS, and my review of that game gave it a 9 on 10, with high praise for its beautiful landscapes and art direction, for its incredible musical soundtrack, its professional voice acting, and for its ambition in telling the origin story of Castlevania. I felt its weak points were the holes in the story that sometimes just didn't make any sense, and the odd puzzles that forced you into a puzzle menu to play the associated minigame.\n\nLoS 2 retains all of the things that I felt made LoS a wonderful work of art, and also retains the higher resolution graphic textures that are unique to the PC version. It still runs easily at 120 fps for those who are using 120hz monitors and want to lock the VSync to the refresh. No screen tearing, no artifacts, just beauty. But be sure to disable the motion blur in the graphic settings (setting it to LOW is 100% disabled).\n\nThe game looks stunning, the backdrops and scenery are jaw-dropping, the animation is superb and flows like water. New weapons in the game have their own detailed animations and combos, and open up a whole new God of War-like variation to weapon variety that wasn't present in the first LoS. The music is modernized but retains the original LoS theme throughout many of the compositions, keeping true to the original soundtrack (the composer is the same as the original LoS, so he knows exactly how to bring back variations on the old tunes).\n\nIf you were a fan of the original, then I strongly recommend buying this game. In my opinion, this game is as good as the original, if not better in a number of ways. It isn't just a brand new story slapped on top of the old one, but rather it builds entirely on the story from the first LoS and gives it a full tribute in everything that it does. It is a very worthy sequel to the original game.\n\nAs a final score, I give Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 a rating of 9 on 10.  The only reason it did not score a 10 on 10 was due to the introduction of a new stealth mechanic that wasn't entirely fleshed out enough. Thankfully it isn't used that frequently, but it can get frustrating when you're in the mood to kick ♥♥♥ and you're forced into a medicore stealth mode.\n\nI'd also like to thank Mercurysteam and Konami for releasing this game on PC, and for releasing it at the same time as their Console launches! They have shown us PC gamers a great deal of respect. Thank you!","March 8, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a sentence, this is an excellent third person action game, with very nice and enjoyable combat mechanics, which is what matters to me most in this kind of games.\n\nOnce you get a good feeling of the combat system (might take a while though), defeating hordes of enemies becomes very satisfying. Comparing it to the benchmark -in my opinion- of the category Batman Arkham City/Origins, you don't get to feel as invincible as Batman (although you're supposed to be even more badass), but the combinations and the options you have in the battle are more engaging.\n\nMost of the critics seem to point out how it is unfit for Dracula to be in a modern era context. Some others seem to dislike the story ending. Let me say that, although this is my first Castlevania game (since the original one on SNES :P ) and I didn't follow the earlier episodes, the story seemed to me to be brilliantly scripted, especially due to its clever ending (no spoilers), where everything is explained.\n\nIf you are like me and are searching for a third person action game in the style of Batman Arkham series, where nice combat mechanics is your priority, then I think this is a game you will enjoy.","April 6, 2014","true","75.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there are a few issues that detract from the overall experience, they are not serious enough for me to not recommend the game. Some key points follow.\n\nThe combat system is an evolution of the one in the first game, with significant refinements that make for a very smooth experience. For example, you can dodge and parry attacks even in the air. While the skill trees for each of the weapons may seem labyrinthine at first, if you put some thought into how they're structured and how each of the moves are executed, you'll start to realize how elegantly designed Dracula's moveset is. Gone are the difficult-to-execute combos in the first Lords of Shadow; you now have a broad range of attacks that are easily performed with plenty of versatility for nearly any combat situation.\nSetting and environmental design is generally excellent. Both in the castle and in the city, there's a great sense of scale, and the level of detail put into the environment is absolutely incredible. Overall, it's designed in the open-world "Metroidvania" tradition, with plenty of exploration and discovery. Many level design cues have been taken from the Assassin's Creed series, which isn't a bad thing since I've always liked their level design; likewise, when not in combat, Dracula himself handles a lot like Connor from Assassin's Creed III. However, it is not completely flawless; ...\n...in particular, some of the stealth sections need improvement. While the ones involving Golgoth Guards aren't exactly bad, Agreus's maze and Carmilla's blood curse puzzle are questionably designed, leaving the player very little room for error which can lead to frustration.\nThe story is good, but not great. Dracula as a character has some very nice background but scenario design can be a bit better and the ending is a bit too open-ended.\nAgain, neither of the last two points are enough to take away my recommendation. It's sad that these (relatively minor) flaws in an otherwise well-executed game led to such negative critical reception from several expert reviewers. Playing as the Prince of Darkness himself has been an unforgettable experience for me and I ultimately enjoyed the game.

Using his Void Sword, Shadow Whip and Chaos Claws to create powerful combos you'll become invencible, and in this point I have a negative opinion to say: I'm not sure if is because I played the first game and know how the combat system works, but I felt the game much easier, even when I was playing in Prince of Darkness difficult (except fora some Kleidos Challenges - they made a great work in those challenges).\nThey made a open world game this time and they made great in my opinion. Was amazing when I started to play and everything was...normal and as long I kept playing I could see the world changing around me.\nThe fights, and in this point I have to say, they improved A LOT from the first game. Each weapon (Sword, Whip and Claws) has a different movement's tree and I just loved to use all: freezing smallers enemies and throwing them in the air with my Sword, breaking some shields and armors with my Chaos Storm and finishing them with my Whip was simply awesome, after all he's now Dracul and not just a simple human.\nWhitout no doubt a great game, not as much as the first one, but a great game. BUT like any game, this one has negative points too. Let's talk about bosses and enemies first.\nWe play as Dracula, but there isn't much fights to enjoy all our powers, and should have more since is an open world game AND (yes, I know we play in present days), but I felt a bit out of context when I needed to fight against Mech (like robots) and enemies with guns (WTF face that moment), like Dracul just dropped of in another world. And I didn't see those epics bosses fights as I saw when I played the first game. The bosses in my opinion were just normal enemies a bit bigger (except for four: SPOILER WARNING the fights against the two first acolytes, Zobek and Satan). You won't see an epic Titan or a dangerous Lord or some powerful Necromancer.\nWell, even with some negatives points and some troubles (I'm not sure if was 'cause my computer or the game só I decided do note talk about them), I still recommend to everyone to play this awesome and beautiful game.","April 3","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a great twist with the changing of time (past/present) through the game and the mulitple, over the top boss fights (I really like a game with boss fights). I would highly recommend this to fans of the series. Unfortuantely, if you have not played the first Lords of Shadow the story is a continuation and will not make sense.\n\nPROS: Beautiful graphics/music to match. Awesome environments in the past and present time spans. CRAZY boss fights! Better story than the first.\n\nCONS: Too many skills and weapon upgrades that are not necessary. I used about four out of each set.\nThe transport system to teleport from each part of the city is far and inbetween.\nFinal boss was a little underwhelming.","December 3, 2014","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not as good as the first one IMO, but good none the less. Combat Is extremely similar, which Is good since I loved the combat in the first game.\n\nGive it a go if you enjoyed LOS1, otherwise give it a miss. I'd also reccommend playing through on hard, definately adds to the experience. Soundtrack + visuals are pretty damn good, as are voices and locations. Enemy designs are also pretty kick ♥♥♥, though they lean more towards demonic rather than in the first game where you had random enemies (eg.

Stealth parts nearly ruins it, but the sound/visual quality is very good compared to other games. Story makes virtually no sense compared to the first LOS but the combat system is well worth the purchase, a lot deeper than other games, and along with a lot of collectibles make it worth a second playthrough.  Plays similar to GOW for puzzles/platforming to compliment the fighting which isn't a bad thing since there isn't that many games like this on PC.\n\nLike the first game though, took a lot of ideas from other games, but didn't really interograte them quite as well e.g. the pharmaceutical industry and the monsters; the failored light/shadow combat system (DMC), the stealth system (Dishonored), and the open exploration (Metroid-ish).\n\nEnding was slightly disappointing. Just seemed that the whole story wasn't well thought out enough plot wise. The DLC is worth a look too if you liked the main game.\n\nDoesnt deserve all the bad press it got, and definitely look forward to going through a second time with a better laptop to really indulge on the visuals. Difficulty has been nerved compared to the LOS.","June 19, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game holds up very well and takes advantage of the modern setting it takes place in pretty well.\n\nThat said, it does have flaws, but the main thing is you are not getting a buggy game. I found no bugs, glitches, or problems while playing.\n\nThe stealth elements could have been handled better, considering Konami funded this you would think they have *someone* who knows a thing or two about that.\n\nBut for what it is worth, the few instances of stealth were handled better than I thought they could have been. I did not find myself confused too easily by some of the stealth sections. But they were, at first, problematic due to the fact that they seemed forced rather than a natural progression of things.\n\nThat aside the artwork for the game is awesome, yes, the modern city sections of Castlevania seem out of place. But that is not a flaw to me. Dracula's castle is not Castlevania. The city which is named as such, was built on and around Dracula's castle. So the design changes from running around a beautiful old castle and its environments. To an open city that looks nice, but is not as nice as the castle, is not such a bad thing.\n\nI am not going to obsess over art direction when I want a game's story to make sense. And the story only makes complete sense once you are near the end of the game. At first I thought it was poor writing. But I suspect it was a bit of Play Mirror of Fate to get the full story/purchase our DLC.\n\nYes, I honestly feel that with the announcement of DLC. I think they *may* have cut story content just for the DLC. But everything comes together towards the end of the main game anyway.\n\nThe bosses are fun, the exploration is fun, generally speaking if you are on the fence about this and you played the original. You will LIKE the sequel. I personally love it, and love the way the game came together in the end in my opinion.","March 23, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I do truly believe that steam needs a better review system like a point based system like the metascore, and that could be disabled underneath the metascore and that would be up to date unlike some of the metascores. But enough about that onto the game.\n\nSo the big reason i got this game was because i loved the first one, it was a new take on the Castlevania story yet went back to the roots of game. The game was a linear platformer with linear progression and that was fine for me, the game had a fixed camera and i was also fine with that. But the thing that defined the game for me, was the amazing story with its incredible twists, the amazing art style and the puzzles and titan fights.\nAnd this where my issues emerge, mercury steam did a great job listening to the fans and on what they wanted changed, and in this case it was a bad thing(at least for me).\n\nThey changed the game substantial, for starters they took out titan fights, you climb one at the begining but thats it you just climb him thats the first and last time you see a titan. And the main reason it was taken out was because people complained in the first game that the battle were to tideous and long and that it was just a "Shadow of the Colusus" ripp off. So Mercury Steam took those out in order to make the "fans" happy. Well i wasnt happy to see those go.\nThey also took out the puzzle, again a large portion of the players didnt seem to like them, some because they found them "to difficult" and other because they "slowed down" the gameplay. Well i liked the puzzles, they did slow down the game play a bit, but i never found any of them to be to hard. i feel that they provided a good little mental challenge to the player, as well as reward i mean when you pass one of the puzzles that is deemed more difficult you feel pretty smart. But again Mercury Steam took these out to please fans.\nNow in Lords of Shadow 2 they actually replaced this with stealth section, which alot of people hated but i actually liked, everybody hates the agreus section i actually loved provide a bit of thrill, i remember hearing "I got you!!" and i was thinking "What from where" and then all of a sudden Bam!! i am dead me sceaming "Mother#####" that was fun(i am not being saracatic to clarify). And becoming a rat was just really funny and entertating.\n\nThe combat was somewhat improved it was faster and more fluid,sync blocking is way easier and the best part is that it is easier to fill the focus meter. Now the camera thats a tough one when i am fighting i dont wana have to worry about moving a camera in oder to see the enemy, which wasnt a problem in the game, yet having a free camera opens up for a lot of exploration.\n\nThe game has an mazing art style very gothic and a lot darker compared to the first game, now the small enemy design was great yet i wish there was a wider variety of enemys, because there wasnt many here, alot of the same enemys pop up in different areas, mainly those thorn guys, which made it some what boring, so thats one thing i didnt like,\nthe bosses had amazing designs they all looked great my favorite was zobek's incarnation of death, and the giant levaithan,\nyet again something was missing, variety of fighting most of the bosses are fought on ground like santans acolytes and even the final boss is mainly just a gorund fight after destroying the levaithan, which to me was really boring especially for a final boss fight, i legit was not statisfied when i figured out this was the last battle,(spoliers)\n\nWhen you fall to the earth after beating the possesed alucard, what i was expecting was a giant battle to insue all across the city aganist santan but instead we get another lame cutscene where dracula simply stabs santan with the vampire killer or his combat cross, and then we get some vague dialouge between dracula and alucard, and then we get some awesome ending score to playt them off and the end. It just left a bad taste the mouth, an unstatsifying taste, that could have been better.\n(end of spoilers)\nBack to combat and battle a feel that the titans where neccasary , in the first game defeating the titan provided a feeling of gradure to the character, i made gaberial seem more than a man, something i didnt get from this game, i felt like the "good" gaberial was and is stronger than dracula\n(another spoiler) a part i thought was really cool was your battle with victor, it was like dracula was fighting his old self which was awesome but something they could have expanded upon more story wise\n\nAnd that brings us to the story, long story short (haha thank you thank you ill be here all week), the story sucked so bad for me it was the fact that the first story was so good that i expected something even better my expectations were high and for good reason, yet the story not only fell short of expectations, but alot of others.\nI feel that they could have expanded upon so much, like dracula's stuggle with his own castle, dracula and his in self , they could have made not only fight his inner self but also his actual past self, and for that matter they could have made him fight all the people he killed in the first game like cornell, pan, the girl with the guardian titan, and so on. they could have added a little more to victors story and gave more purpose and so on.\nI could go on with the shouldve couldve games but we would be here all day\n\nso in the end the game for me was good but not GREAT!!! and thats my problem is with the game that it could have been so much better, i know usually sequals arent as good as the orginal but thats a norm we cant accept everytime a game comes out it should be better then the last one, and for me Lords of Shadow 2 barely misses the mark for being at least as good as the last game. I do truly feel that listening to the fans might have hurt this game they took alot of good content.\nSo i wouldnt pay 60 bucks for this game this is defintely like max a 30 dollar game for me\nits a story only game and when a game cant provide a concrete and amazing story and on top of that doesnt provide i solid and satisfying ending it doesnt deserve that full price.\n\nps: a new dlc is set to come out this month in a few days actually but from what i have read and seen is that you dont get any conclusion, and story takes place before LoS2, pretty much alucard wakes up dracula and leaves him behind his powers. So i am not sure if ill pick it up. Will you guys?\nAnd what did you think about the game if you played it?\nand if you havent and have any questions go ahead and ask in the comments and ill probably get back you quickly?\n\nThanks for reading!!!","March 22, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can now press the left Trigger to give you hints in form of red marks, which show you locations of your next "jumping spots". Some may call it unnecessary casualisation, I call it an improvement over a failed and frustrating attempt at Warrior Within.\nThe graphics seems fine and the framrate should be suprisingly high, even on older systems. Even with my GTX560, I had almost constant 100fps with maxed graphics.\n\nNow. I don't want to trash the game too hardly. It's still a solid one. But some new implementations are just godawful.\nIf you aren't full of ♥♥♥♥ and played LoS, you might remember these 10/10 atmospheric moments with top notch camera angles. If not, here some examples:\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/504701268327813669/0BDACD7E2C2093E4DB84A6B3FE0060A0E1C13892/\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/504701268255276858/55D677BEFBDC1758496B4A7DD00A72DBEA58453E/\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/504700993958600731/8DB1D822F258B352A896716A055BB75F361410F1/\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/504700993958546167/4317AEC029468B71D45767A6477C2756B3D04905/\n\nThey ♥♥♥♥ed up on these. You barely see them in the game. The only place that comes near of them ( Where young Alucard awaits you at the north tower ) lasted for maybe 5 seconds.\nAn even bigger dissapointment is the godawful story. I don't know which artistic ♥♥♥♥ wanted the series to go in this direction, maybe that hipser from Braid - I really don't ♥♥♥♥ing know, but its so awful it almost made me quit.\n\nWith a more or less "meh" postgame, I think I quit after the first playtrough and won't go for a hardmode 100%. The motivation isn't there.\n\n5/10, still recommend it for people who want to know how ♥♥♥♥♥ going to end.","March 2, 2014","true","30.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Combat skill trees are present.\n\nExploration is fun as well despite not being truly open world, it's still fun to find hidden secrets.\n\nThey bring back staple items like the hourglass that can slow enemies' movements, etc.  That along with destructible things like candlesticks that hide experience points or other goodies keeps it feeling like Castlevania.\n\nNot sure about the modern setting, but most of the environments don't reflect a modern look anyway, it still looks like dilapidated castles, etc. for the most part.\n\nThe graphics are not fantastic, particularly in the distance some of the meshes have very jagged outlines, even with settings maxed.

No more fixed camera, and there's a decent arsenal of subweapon to experiment with.  They way you level up weapons and techniques encourages variety in combat.  Unlike the first game the Light and Dark magic forms have their own weapons.  Void Sword and Chaos Claws once leveled up can be used long enough so you can experiment with them instead of just using them when you know you the extra health or damage.  Also since the game is open world it's much easier to backtrack and find secrets you may have missed on your first time through.  That was the biggest pain about LoS1 since you have replay an entire stage.  Though at least the chapters were divided up into multiple areas.\n\nHard to understand all the hate for this game, but I can understand some of it.  The story is a bit whacky, and the events that bridge the two games have their own 3DS game (which was ported to console and PC), but that game is really lackluster.  Kind of depressing since the summary they give in the beginning of this game is really interesting.  Almost wish that game would've been Lords of Shadow 2, then make this game Lords of Shadow 3.  My biggest complaint about the story is how they treated Victor Belmont.  I assume he's suppose to be Richter, but given that you meet him and 20 minutes later he sacrifices himself, I'm glad he's not Richter.  Really wish there was more of him in the game.\n\nEnvironments in the present day segments are pretty dull.  No real variations in it, just greyed out industrial areas.  The other parts of the set Castlevania's past feel alive.  Definitely feels like the devs had fun making those areas.\n\nEnemy designs also don't feel very varied either.  Boss design is on point though aside from the final boss.  *SPOILER WARNING* Final boss is Satan inside Alucard's body.  I was hoping for something a little more unique.  And since you only see Alucard for the last little section of the game (though technically he is there for the entire game disguised as the Zobek's second in command) it's disappointing that he's only there for that last little bit.\n\nSpeaking of Alucard.  his DLC is solid too.  It has actual cinemas unlike how the DLC for LoS1 was handled.  He doesn't have new weapons for the magic modes, but the DLC is just long enough you don't notice it.  The only disappointing thing about the DLC is Alucard doesn't have any attacks for his Bat Swarm or Spectral Wolf abilities in combat or with magic.  Would've been a nice touch.  Oh yeah, the actor that plays Rob Stark from Game of Thrones does his voice if you're wondering why he sounds familiar.","June 26, 2015","true","34.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rynrly/recommended/239250/","rynrly","Ryn Rly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rynrly/","122 products in account","Where do I start?\n\nThe goal here was to improve upon on a good game that many claimed to be a "God of War" clone. Which it had similarities, sure, but to call it a clone is blasphemous. In fact, it possessed many qualities that made it superior even. The story, and acting was much better, for instance.\n\nThe original had so many things going for it, and I for one, thought the fixed camera really showed you how beautiful the environments were. Lush forests, large abandoned temples, etc. Those things are replaced by castle, and rainy, dark alleyways. Not much variety there.\n\nThe gameplay itself suffers from the new and 'improved' camera system. I feel like the fixed camera was done away with because we're sitting here saying to ourselves "It's 2014, we're past this. Resident Evil was frustrating." The truth is, it functioned very well in LOS, and you didn't have to fight that while also fighting swarms of enemies. That's the real issue with the new camera. You have a very claustrophobic point-of-view, and can't admire the environment even if it was really a sight to behold.  In fights, it backs out a little, but sometimes getting caught in an awkward corner and trying to manuever the camera while unleashing a planned combo at the time is not very fun. It turns making a well-timed block into a "I can't see if the enemy is attacking" kind of fight.\n\nThe other issue is the story. The ending of LOS set the bar very high for this game, which is a little unfair, admittedly. I do feel like the game lost some punch in its delivery when it canned the narration from Patrick Stewart. And sometimes during the cutscenes, it doesn't feel like the acting is very into it. Very subdued, and uninspired.\n\nI could say more, but I can barely stomach the amount of time I've put into this game as it is.\n\nIn shorter terms; Every area where LOS2 planned to improve upon its predecessor, it instead falls flat on its face.","March 1, 2014","false","6.9"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","3"

He comes off as bad but develops into a semi heroic character. I don't think developers will ever grasp the concept of being evil as a main character. If someone plays as a bad guy, he has to remain that way, i mean he/she has to be totally deprived of emotions and feelings. Dracula here has these and it basically takes away from the evil that the character is known for in the castlevania series. I'm content with saying he is basically a sissy compared to the Dracula in other Castlevania games. If i play as a evil bad guy, i want to bad all the way to the end.\n\nThe art direction i notice is down right horrible. The art direction on satan in particular is down right terrible. I think i could of design a better version of him thats not too similar to the bible depiction of him. The armor on a couple of particular characters, dracula included are pretty much weird to me. They have the same similar design and shape, which consist of sharp wave like rig.\n\nThe combat is decent, but i just don't understand why the devs didn't add more skills to draculas default whip, they had room to. They could have even recycled some of gabriels whip skills from lord of shadows. While playing i kept thinking i could do one of my favorite skills from the first Lord Of Shadows but then reality hit..\n\nFinal battle could of been done better, instead they went for a semi-cliche kind of approach, which is expected in other games. If you're a castlevania fan, you'll expect a really cliche climatic Castlevania final battle, which isn't a bad thing. I guess these guys didn't play the castlevania games, when putting this one together.\n\nIf it was me i would of added a bit of fanservice to the game. I can say artwise, though the graphics are pretty good, the devs dropped the ball hard on this game. It's a ok game if you just want combat, decent boss battles, but dont expect a great blow your mind game experience.\n","October 8, 2014","true","22.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","4"

Don't buy it unless you have a morbid curiousity to see what happened after the very entertaining first game. If you haven't played the first, go buy that instead.\n\nThe first Lords of Shadow was an unexpected surprise for me, with gorgeous art and a fairly well told story backed up by solid action. Combined with a ridiculous twist and cliffhanger at the end, I was pretty excited to see where MercurySteam took the series next. On paper, it sounds pretty good. Expand the combat systems from the original game, continue the story, and place it in an open, Symphony of the Night style world that favors exploration.\n\nThen they went and cocked it all up. The action is barely distinguishable from the first, despite the huge change in character. You now have subweapons, but they are essentially palette swaps of the default whip with the properties of either the light or dark magic from the first game.\n\nThe story is hilariously badly written, and at times borders on nonsensical. Character motivations frequently are completely impenetrable and illogical, and the ending of the game provides very little closure. The first thing that you see when the credits roll is that one man 'wrote and directed' the game. If I were him, I certainly wouldn't take credit for this wet fart of a story for fear of the death of my career.\n\nClassic metroidvania backtracking and openness is a great idea, but the biggest problem is that the map system is absolutely not up to the task. Modern metroidvanias like Shadow Complex frequently combine the classic 'grid' style map with indicators of an item that you have seen but were not able to access. LoS2 has a woefully inadequate 'world map' that is simply the names of different areas with the number of secrets you have yet to access. With all the shortcuts, twists and exits in each area, neither the world map or the local map (that basically confines its view to the loaded in level chunk with no indication of where exits go) is sufficient to make hunting for upgrades anything but a chore.\n\nAnd then there are the infamous stealth sections. God, the stealth sections. I'm typically against the death penalty, but whoever added those to the design doc needs to be publically executed. I want to watch. There are apologists for them, saying that they're 'more of a puzzle' than a stealth section. That may be true, but they're still a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥, inconsistant puzzle, using mechanics that do not smoothly integrate into the game. If you thought the 'boat stealth' sections from ACIV were the worst in recent memory, boy do I have a surprise for you.\n\nAlright, I've got that out of my system. Don't buy this for 60 bucks.

It's also important to note that this is written from the point of view of someone who has not played any of the Castlevania's before Lord of Shadow (The first one.)\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 thrusts you into the role of Gabriel Belmont (otherwise known as Dracula) who is disturbed from his centuries of rest to once again battle Satan. The game stands well on it's own and I feel like someone who hasn't played the first game can still pick up this one and not be confused as to what is going on. However, I also feel like if someone were to have played the first one they will enjoy the story a lot more than if they didn't. (This is easily remedied by reading a wikipedia summary or watching the cutscenes of the first game on youtube.)\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of Devil May Cry, Ninja Gaiden and other stylish action fighters. You do combos against multiple enemies and emphasis is placed on avoiding attacks to survive. Even the normal mode feels difficult because there is just so much going on and it's easy to lose track of enemies that end up behind you. However, the combos you can upgrade into feel almost pointless when you can just mash your single target attack, dodge and come out victorious. However, it also does some things good by giving your weapons meaning. The Void Blade restores health through attacks and the Chaos claws deal extra damage to enemies. Dodging attacks is essential because in order to use these weapons you need to build up a combo meter which allows "blood orbs" to appear which gives power to the weapons.\n\nWhere Castlevania: LoS2 sets itself apart from Devil May Cry and Ninja Gaiden is in the platforming sections. With Devil May cry you time a bunch of jumps and with Ninja Gaiden you run across rooftops. With Castlevania it manages to execute a good platforming experience reminiscent of games like Prince of Persia. You'll scale up walls while under siege by enemies, time perfect jumps and use your abilities to reach hidden spots to power up Dracula.\n\nI also think it's worthwhile to note that if you dislike Quick Time Events(QTE), there is an option to disable QTE's in the game menu. This is a huge step forward as a lot of gamers moan and gripe about having to "Press X to not die" and I hope to see this option more in the future in other games.\n\nOverall, if you liked Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry you'll find a similarly enjoyable experience in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.","March 3, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This title is a hack and slash action oriented game that is not for the faint of heart. Those who dislike blood and gore are likely to turn away from this game, however those who like blood guts and gore can go nuts. Fans of Castlevania will appreciate this game to a point, however those new to the series may find things a little confusing.\n\nFor starters, the control system in the game is very fluid for the most part. Abilities can be used at will depending on the situation at hand. Swapping between the 3 weapons you get in the game is very smooth, switching from one to the other and back again at the touch of a button while keeping a combo going. The combat in general is smooth, however there are minor things that can be very disheartening for newer players. Unblockable attacks can be overlooked given the amount of things going on in a heated battle at times. For example, fights with a lot of dirt, rubble, blood and enemies flying everywhere can sometimes (not always) block your view from unblockable attacks meaning you are going to get hit. And in a life or death situation this is very annoying.\n\nThe difficulty of the game varies between 4 difficulties, 3 of which are available from the outset. The 4th difficulty is unlocked by beating the game once. A veteran of games from series like Devil May Cry will not find the initial "hard mode" all that difficult. While it can be a challenge at times managing the players health and resources on hard, it isn't deathly hard. For newer players the easy and normal difficulties can provide their own challenge, but all in all things are very much dumbed down for ease of play.\n\nGraphically, this game is incredible. The HD textures make everything within the environments stand out. From the tiniest pebble on the ground to the largest building in the distance, the developers have not skimped on anything. The whole game looks amazing from start to finish. The addition of several hundred pieces of concept art makes the whole look of things even better. The animations for every enemy, and every npc are very fuild, very good at depicting a certain realism about things.\n\nThe music in this game is also once again incredible with a few minor exceptions. Certain cutscenes have music that just doesn't fit at all. No emotion is felt from the music, no meaning. However that is just a few places. For the most part the music, and sounds in general are very well placed, very well composed and very well done overall. Voice acting is quite good, at times it's a bit questionable however again for the most part it fits, and is very well done by the actors including Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart.\n\nNow. The major gripe I have with this game is the lack of direction throughout a lot of the games "open world" sections. Your minimap shows you the general direction on where to go, but a lot of the time you can spend a fair amount of time searching for the way to go. This could be a ledge to grapple, or a wall to walk around. For the most part things are easy to spot, but there were several times where I had to look around the area, after backtracking and re-entering the room just to find where to go next.\n\nTo conclude, I would give this game 8/10. It is a good solid game, well built and with a lot of nice features and well crafted gameplay. If you like hack and slash adventure games then this is a definite pick-up. 15 hours of solid gameplay minimum, well over 20 with NG+ and challenges, as well as the concept art collection. Those who know the Castlevania games of old may frown upon its story, but give it a shot and you'll like it.","March 2, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Near finishing it up, I've got to say Mercury really did an awesome job with LoS2. When they meant the game was going to be "open world", they weren't kidding; no map stage selection screen to revisit stages or whatever, you gotta backtrack either on foot, or through warps (map rooms) which, I admit it can be a bit tedious at times but, I don't mind (especially when you get to grind on enemies along the way). The story is great and we get to see a more human side of Dracula in comparison to the previous iterations before the reboot of the series. The contents to collect and search throughout the game is pretty vast (void/chaos/life crystals, kleidos nails, soldier/memorial scrolls, and other sub-weapon expansions). The skills and skill mastering system is also pretty deep (SO MANY MOVES YO! :V ). But enough about me gushing over this game! :D ENOUGH TALK, HAVE AT IT... and discover for yourself. :D","March 2, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can easily say this game is phenomenal. Thanks to those guys this might be the last castlevania game like this we  will see in a really long time. One thing that is very  easy to spot is that it does borrow from other titles, but it grabs the great ideas. For instance at one point it reminded me so much of metal gear, and a few minutes later it took me  on an a train ride a la unchardted 2 style both of which were very fun parts of the game. It has very very good looking graphics, an amazing soundtrack, awesome combat system, and a lot of collectibles. The story is pretty cool too I absolutly don't understand again why a lot of the so called professional  critics, scored it so low. I own hundreds of games outside of steam, I know when a game really really sucks to the point of it just being unplayable or not worth my money, but this game is worth every single cent I spent on it. You will really like it if you are into adventure games that make you explore (metroidvania games) or the castlevania series, just take it slowly enjoy the views the atmosphere, learn the combat system, and you will love it.","February 28, 2014","true","23.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BakedCookie/recommended/239250/","BakedCookie","BakedCookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BakedCookie/","287 products in account","First thing's first- many mainstream reviewers heavily underrated this game, sometimes to the point where I wonder if they played a different game. It baffles me even more when they say things along the lines of "I loved the first game but this doesn't even come close". That my friends is a lie, it is a lie because Lords of Shadow 2 improves in many areas of the first game and it amounts to it being an overall better game. I'd also like to add that this game performs better on PC than the first one. Let that sink in- this game with a free camera and an hd texture pack performs better than it's fixed point camera, straight up console port predecessor. I'm not entirely sure who was responsible for the port, but whoever it was the port is done well, with all the main options present as well as some gameplay customization thrown in for good measure.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nLet's kick it off with the things LoS2 does not do well, because trust me- while it is a great game it is not devoid of flaws and when they pop up, they show. I think we can universally agree that the stealth sections are a pain the the ♥♥♥♥, it's not even that they are boring to some (I personally enjoyed the first two hours of the game where the majority of stealth happens) but that they lack the fidelity to make them truly enjoyable and sometimes that they are kinda going against common sense. The latter comes into play most prominently in one boss pre-fight and one later city stage. Those were the only two places in the game that I was stuck for 15min straight just going "why game, why would you make me do this". Aside from the sections where you are stripped of your powers and must rely on stealth (that being the beginning, around 0.5 to 1.5h into the game) the stealth amounts of about 30 minutes of the entire game at maximum. So while it has some clear issues it's not something you'll be doing a whole lot.\nAnother negative point I would nitpick is the level layout design (not the design itself), in that this being an open world game it should be easy to navigate it, however I find myself wondering how to get to that one place I've been to previously and my best bet is to just wonder around until I find it. Now let me be clear- this is not a problem when it comes to the main storyline because for that purpose the game gives you a minimap with a quest marker (and it works very well as a matter of fact) it only becomes a problem when you unlock new powers and want to revisit older areas to collect the things that were previously out of reach. This problem I feel is a direct result of the game being as grand as it is- the sheer amount of vistas, sceneries, ruins and wrecked architecture left little in the way of a 100% clear and intuitive way to traverse it. And in contrast to the stealth sections I feel it would be hard if not impossible to make the world easily accessible without sacrificing some of the great art direction and good design choices. That said the quick travel system that you unlock sometime into the game could offer more places to warp to and not just a few general districts.\nFrom a technical aspect the environments, especially in the city sections, could use some higher resolution textures and maybe a bit more detail to boot. Especially on the cars.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nThankfully the game has more than enough to counterbalance it's faults and come on top. Let's start with the combat system because it is pure bliss here. In the first game, while I enjoyed the combat I always felt that launching enemies into the air is completely unviable and that the dodge move was kinda sluggish. That has thankfully been revised in LoS2 and the combat is smooth, fast and very responsive. The dodge is now a dash that can be chained together to either cover distance (combine with sprinting for best results) or quickly angle around an enemy. It is very responsive and can be triggered from both the ground and air, meaning you no longer have to be afraid of going airborne as you can always dodge out of any enemy attack.   The physics of the world have also been altered slightly so that controlling Dracula feels just right. A change from the original is also the Void/Chaos magic which, when activated replace your default blood whip with either the void sword or the chaos claws. These come with their own abilities and mastery trees. It's a great improvement to the old system where activating either would just apply an effect to your combat cross. Here you actually get a different weapon, with different range and different moves. The Void/Chaos magic extends into subweapons which give you a LOT of variety to your combat style. Overall the combat just feels great and rewarding, rarely (if ever) did I feel like it was the games fault when I died, as there is always a technique or an approach that will result in your victory. That said, it is important to learn some enemies patterns as they can sometimes be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ if you forget that said enemy has a certain pattern of unblockable attacks that you must dodge.\nOnto the visuals then, which I feel are absolutely gorgeous. The animations of every character are great, Dracula himself is very fluid in his movements which is quite critical as you'll be staring at him quite a bit. This shows especially in the platforming bits where Drac jumps from ledge to ledge in quite the Spiderman fashion. The texturework is stellar on the characters, great in the castle and great/good in the city. I wish it was more consistent but for what it, it passes in every respect with just a slap on the wrist for the odd texture in the city. Overall I'd say the game screams high fidelity (and don't even get me started on the facial animations/textures, they are finger-licking good). But what are good graphics without good environments to put the into? Thankfully I feel the game delivers that too. The castle has locations that made me just stop for a few seconds (or was it minutes?) to just take in the surroundings, their creative value being just that high. The city, surprisingly, did too. Granted it has some bland locations when compared to the castle, but it also has some stellar gothic architecture melded with a cityscape with some impressive statues to boot. I feel like the first parts of the city that the player sees really do it injustice at it is mostly based around cubes and blocks (sciences district, I'm looking at you). The other districts offer more variety, and in general I really liked going to the city. It also helps that the enemy design in the city is some of the best I could imagine for this game. I half expected to get some generic futuristic solder or something but instead I got Castlevania's version of the Combine from Half-Life. I think it goes without saying I was most impressed with how they handled it. Enemy design in the castle is equally creative, however I'm going to cop out here and say that the castle is the most memorable enemy. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but let's just say if MercurySteam ever got their hands on the Silent Hill franchise, I would actually anticipate the next installment. To wrap this part up, the art assets, the direction and execution are almost stellar in this game. What keeps is from being truly great are the few bland environments in the city, and some environmental texturework that is not up to snuff at times.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI'd love to write more but I'm getting close to my word limit, my summary would be that when the end credits rolled I felt like I played a great game and a great final installment to the Castlevania trilogy. It didn't end in a cliffhanger, but it didn't answer everything either (in a subtle manner). If I had to rate the game I'd give it an 8.5/10, the extra 0.5 is for the replay value- after completing the game I only uncovered 30% of secrets and still have challenges to complete. And I can't wait to get back into the fray, completionist style (and trust me, few games do that to me).","February 27, 2014","true","32.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'm around 1 hour in the game maybe more and I'm absolutely loving it! It's a definate improvement over the first one. I believe Mercurysteam took the fans advice and upped the gameplay, story, action and mare the world more free so to speak. I'm hoping for a lot less ridlles as well. I haven't encountered any yet so I don't know but I'm hopeful it won't be like the first game.\n\nAs I mentioned this game is a clear improvement over the first game. Combat flows alot better!  Much less restricted camera focus. Nice and free.  Now we're using the wasd buttons to move, mouse to fight and more which in my own opinion makes the game so much easier to play.  The story is amazing so far! I TRULY AMAZING!  The graphics are picture perfect, the game is  stabile, zero bugs or anything like that so far...\n\nI believe this version will be alot more open minded in addition to the very linear format of the first game. Of course the gameplay is linear as the first one but for what regards the quest system it appears that you're not stuck with just the main quest. I haven't reached that point yet but I was informed that I could choose between quests from my log which is something brand new in the game.\n\nThis is what I know so far guys! I'm loving it. Best dracula game I've played without question. It's dark, gritty, bloody, murderous, evil and yet also about Gabriel as we know him though very few traits remain. It's all Dracula now! Believe me!\n\nIf you liked the first game...you will without question enjoy this one.  Once again. This tiny incomplete review is based on around 1-2 hours of gameplay.

(People really seem to love the 'plots' of Castlevania games without understanding that the story is generally pretty weak.)\n\nGameplay-wise, big improvement over LoS1.  The camera isn't locked, the environments are open for fighting and the "background" doesn't obstruct the combat the way it did in LoS1.\n\nThe platforming is guided, there aren't a lot of fall down and die challenges, if you can make a leap, you'll make a leap, and there's a lot less guesswork than there was in the first one since the camera now sits behind Gabriel not a mile away from him while you judge a gap.\n\nThe pace does get disrupted in several moments with these bizarre stealth pieces that, as you approach the end of the game, will have you wondering how it is you still aren't powerful enough to sneak around enemies you should be able to kill.  If you've been playing about 45 minutes of combat, then expect to spend the next 45 dealing with sneaking.  There are a couple of scenes that will definitely test the frustration durability of your controller as well.\n\nThe game allows backtracking, but it isn't as crucial as it was in LoS1.  I remember in LoS1 NEEDING to go back and get some more upgrades because combat was such a pain.  In this I tended to find enough health upgrades, power upgrades etc. along the way if I kept my eyes open for side passes, that I did not backtrack at all.\n\nI didn't backtrack because it is a giant pain in the ♥♥♥.  The environments are HUGE, there is a quick travel system but it goes to like 4 waypoints in massive areas in the city or in the castle, so it doesn't exactly put you right where you want to be.  I thought about it said "nope" and never backtracked, aside from hitting up a shop.\n\nYou may also get locked into certain fights and you can't back out of them to go back and farm health potions, so you're screwed.  Let's just say I spent so long fighting the last boss starting with a shred of health and zero void sword power that I had to learn how to fight and counter him effectively.  I'm probably pretty much unbeatable now thanks to my own lack of preparation going in to the end game.\n\nDespite some of the flaws, fun game.\n\nSo...\n\nGet this if:\n\nYou love the atmosphere / plot of the Castlevania games and aren't so linear in your thinking that "ZOMGZ ITS NOT CASTLEVANIA IF ITS NOT 2D!"  Or if you were ever a fan of the Legacy of Kain games, because there hasn't been a better "bad-♥♥♥-vampire platformer" since the last ones of those were made.\n\nAvoid it if:\n\nYou need complicated platforming, not the hand holding kind, or if you're the kind of person who will put a game down if the pace of it gets disrupted.  Because this game definitely upsets its own pace several times during a playthrough, and then it just sits on your computer never getting played.\n\nWhen in doubt:\n\nSteam sale!","December 27, 2014","true","16.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

There was a letter from someone in the development team that talked about how the production was disjointed, some bad reviews, etc. There was no way I was going to pass on it though.\n\nThe player returns again to the role of Gabriel Belmont, who is now Dracula. Following a tutorial level that takes place in his castle, the game is divided between two major environments, both of which are "free to explore". The first is the city of Castlevania in the 2040s or 2050s (mostly modern, but with some nice cyberpunk and gothic touches), while the other is Dracula's castle of antiquity (which has been destroyed in the modern day, but still exists as an extradimensional realm; I don't believe it is in Dracula's mind).\n\nUnlike the fixed camera angles of "Lords of Shadow", this game features a true 3rd person over-the-shoulder camera. It is well executed, and allows the player to really drink in the beautiful visuals that drip ambience. I personally preferred the castle to the modern levels, though.\n\nCombat still consists of basic attacks, combos, dodging, special weapons, and special powers. I have to admit that most of the fights were a bit dry for me. Most enemies require a single special tactic to defeat, and I frequently found myself looking for ways to bypass them (and there aren't enough ways in the game to do so). The designs are interesting, but fighting even common enemies frequently took as long as a boss fight; that was annoying.\n\nThe boss battles are a lot of fun, mixing again a good amount of combat, quick-time elements, cinematics, and great music. Unfortunately the game suffers from boring boss battle environments; like the first game, it's usually just a sort of open arena (though the music, in my opinion, imparts the sense of swinging around to avoid attacks and other epic thoughts.)\n\nThe voice acting and story are still excellent. Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart really have to carry most of it, and they do great jobs. The game takes some time to defeat, though all the events occur in a single night (this is undoubtedly longer for Gabriel/Dracula, since half of the game involves him traveling to his other-dimensional castle).\n\nThe music in this game is AMAZING. It's probably my favorite video game score, and possibly my favorite of both video games and movies. To say that composer Óscar Araujo accomplished something amazing would be an understatement.\n\nDespite so many similarities, this game didn't feel the same as the first "Lords of Shadow", so I can't say this one is either better or worse. There are some weak points in the gameplay (such as some enemies that Dracula is NEVER able to defeat in combat, regardless of how powerful you become), but this is balanced by some truly amazing scenes as well (the train battle comes to mind).\n\nIn some way it is more "Castlevania" than the first game, and less so in other ways.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend highly it to Castlevania fans as well as fantasy action fans. It's a shame that this game will be the last in the series (to my understanding). Mercury Steam and the designers did a great job of creating a Castlevania series that represents Western concepts and artistic values over the Japanese anime style that the original games devolved into.","November 30, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020880329/recommended/239250/","76561198020880329","GRiVEN","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020880329/","836 products in account","Lords of Shadow 2 continues where Lords of Shadow left off, almost literally, with an aged Dracula awakening during modern times, weakened and missing his memories from the past thousand years or so. Soon, Zobek comes to Dracula and informs him that Satan is preparing to return. Zobek offers Dracula eternal rest in return for destroying Satan’s acolytes, thus preventing Satan return. With the two coming to an agreement, Dracula sets out to recover his full power and prevent the return of Satan.\n\nAs one of its strongest aspects, Lords of Shadow 2 expands on the excellent combat system from the original Lords of Shadow. Many of Dracula’s combat moves are very similar to those used in LoS, this time with a vampiric twist. Instead of the Combat Cross Dracula wields whips made from his own demonic blood. Instead of the light and chaos magic from the first game, Dracula has the Void Sword and Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can restore Dracula’s health with each successive hit, while the Chaos Claws increase the Dracula’s combat strength. Similar to the magic system from LoS, both the Void Sword and the Chaos Cross have their own pool of magic which can be restored by chaining combos, which drops magic orbs.\nChaining combos is not as easy as it sounds however, as even the weakest enemies have ranged attacks, as well as strong unblockable attacks. Thankfully, Dracula’s dodge and parry will mostly keep the player safe as long as they are mindful of enemy patterns. Lords of Shadow 2, like Lords of Shadow before it, shows the player no mercy when they fail to dodge or parry an attack. In fact, even with some of the weakest enemies, a failed dodge can mean getting hit by a string of unblockable attacks until the enemies combos are over. This can lead to a somewhat abrupt death if the player does not manage to restore Dracula’s health immediately.\n\nCombat does feel more forgiving in Lords of Shadow 2 this time around, however. For one, checkpoints are more frequent and areas before large fights generally have an artifacts which allow Dracula to recharge his health and magic before heading into the fray. Helping to make things easier this time, secondary combat items such as daggers no longer require collection and instead recharge after a few seconds. There are also a host of consumable items in LoS2 that do everything from restore health and make attacks stronger to slow down time and give unlimited magic. These items make the difficulty curve in Lords of Shadow 2 feel more manageable, despite its sometimes unforgiving combat.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not always about its fantastic combat system. Sometimes, the game slows to a crawl as Dracula is forced to use stealth to proceed. These segments see Dracula using some of his abilities such as possession, rat transformation, and bat swarm to progress. At first, the stealth segments make sense as Dracula is weak and needs to possess either scientists or cyborgs to progress. As Dracula recovers his powers however, it becomes unclear why he is forced to sneak about. Dracula can destroy one of Satan’s acolytes but is unfit to face a simple cyborg? It makes little sense.\nOne particular stealth segment towards the middle of the game is particularly frustrating. Dracula is forced to sneak about a maze full of dry leaves as a boss actively hunts for him. If the boss hears Dracula step on the leaves, the boss finds Dracula and forces him back to the start of the maze, taking a portion of the player’s health. This is made worse by the boss actively pursuing Dracula regardless of the noise made, sending Dracula back to the start if he simply comes into line of sight. The segment is made all the more insulting since Dracula and the said boss fight almost immediately following the maze. What was the point of the maze at all? Why did Dracula run if he could simply stand and fight?\n\nSome of the frustrations involved with Lords of Shadows 2 also stem from what should have been its greatest strength: the open world. Without spoiling too much, the game basically revolved around two semi-open worlds: the city and Dracula’s castle. The game looks beautiful and the levels are mostly well designed, but the navigation map struggles to keep up. Sometimes the player is left with nothing more than a vague arrow pointing somewhere off-screen. I found myself several times wandering in circles only to discover a small ledge I strained to see or a far off switch I was supposed to hit with a dagger. These moments can be frustrating, and may be played off as exploration/puzzles but mostly just feel like poor design.\n\nIn regards to puzzles, LoS2 is a little bit disappointing. While the volume of puzzles seems to have increased significantly from the previous entries, the quality seems to have gone down. Most of the puzzles boil down to pull this switch/use that power. Rarely do the puzzles reach the height of those in the original Lords of Shadow, if at all.\n\nThat’s not to say the game doesn’t have its inspired moments though. Part way into the game, Dracula unlocks optional arena style challenges where the player can put Dracula’s powers to the test. These can be a lot of fun and test the player’s skill by doing such things as banning the use of a specific power or setting a time limit to kill enemies.\n\nThere are also moments where the game shines creatively such as a first person feeding segment, some clever sliding puzzles, and an interactive play. Equally enjoyable are several segments in the game where Dracula fights with a companion at his side. Dracula may be required to work with his companion to platform past obstacles or to solve puzzles, which really feels great. These moments are too few and far between, unfortunately.\n\nOn the more positive end of things, the boss fights in Lords of Shadow 2 are actually an improvement on Lords of Shadow and seems to take a page from Mirror of Fate. The fights feel more epic, with larger bosses, and fewer quick time events.  The QTE are mostly limited to escape animations but are sometimes used for boss finishers. Wisely, Mercury Stream has provided checkpoints before boss finishers which makes the QTE less frustrating. Wiser still, you can turn off QTE entirely if you so choose. With boss fights less reliant on QTE, the game flows a lot better, and it gives the player more of a sense of involvement during boss fights.\n\nAs someone who actually enjoys the Lords of Shadow universe, I felt slightly let down by its supposed conclusion. While the ending was satisfying enough, it felt a bit abrupt and unexpected. The story also pays almost no attention to the events of Lords of Shadow, only vaguely referring to the game’s events. Instead, the game focuses more on events from Mirror of Fate. This combined with the sudden demise of some key characters and a lack of explanation regarding how the player comes to arrive at Dracula’s castle, make the story feel unrealized at times. This is further compounded by an ending that doesn’t necessarily feel appropriate for the series, especially given the general direction of the entire game’s story and portrayal of Dracula throughout.\n\nAs the player progresses through Lords of Shadow 2, they see Dracula coming to terms with the monster that he has become - how becoming Dracula has affected him, his family, and the world around him. Unfortunately, that character progression just doesn’t live up to the ultimate ending, leaving loose ends right at the moment that it seemed everything was going to be tied up.\n\nOverall, Lords of Shadow 2 was an enjoyable experience despite some questionable gameplay additions and a lackluster ending. There’s a lot of content to Lords of Shadow 2 and a lot of fun to be had, including a New Game+ mode. Hopefully the upcoming Alucard DLC just ties up some of the loose ends that LoS2 left unraveled.\n","March 10, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Seeing the first LoS on my gaming rig made me salivate and I was not disappointed. Awesome storyline, great voice acting and a perfect mixture of puzzles and action bathing in a dark graphical and musical atmosphere.\n\nNow here comes LoS2 and I was ready to sharpen my holy swiss army cross against a legion of blood suckers again... which... you don't get to do per se. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't upset about the choice of having to play as Dracula. I wasn't bothered by the rather mind boggling flashbacks and choices for his resurrection. What DID make me quite mad, was the lack of consistency of the story compared to the prior game. Plot holes scattered all over, questions about some enemies which remain unanswered (you know, those mechanical ones...). Quite honestly, by trying to give you more freedom by opening up the "world" and let you travel back and forth to reach secrets you could not get before acquiring specific powers, the developers actually have damaged the game rather than improving it. I found myself running around like a vampire on the beach at noon all over the place to end up at random places for not much more than a couple of XP. Rather disappointing.\n\nBut frankly, the game gets better the more you play it and old Fangs gets his powers back to kick to serious booty. Puzzles, action, frantic action, lots of blood and body parts flying around. Seriously entertaining. And the end is satisfying.\n\nOverall, it's a notch down compared to LoS, but not a complete disaster. Much could have been done to make it more engaging and gripping if the story had been more consistent. But aside from that, I'd say that I would recommend this game nonetheless, especially on sale.

There was a letter from someone in the development team that talked about how the production was disjointed, some bad reviews, etc. There was no way I was going to pass on it though.\n\nThe player returns again to the role of Gabriel Belmont, who is now Dracula. Following a tutorial level that takes place in his castle, the game is divided between two major environments, both of which are "free to explore". The first is the city of Castlevania in the 2040s or 2050s (mostly modern, but with some nice cyberpunk and gothic touches), while the other is Dracula's castle of antiquity (which has been destroyed in the modern day, but still exists as an extradimensional realm; I don't believe it is in Dracula's mind).\n\nUnlike the fixed camera angles of "Lords of Shadow", this game features a true 3rd person over-the-shoulder camera. It is well executed, and allows the player to really drink in the beautiful visuals that drip ambience. I personally preferred the castle to the modern levels, though.\n\nCombat still consists of basic attacks, combos, dodging, special weapons, and special powers. I have to admit that most of the fights were a bit dry for me. Most enemies require a single special tactic to defeat, and I frequently found myself looking for ways to bypass them (and there aren't enough ways in the game to do so). The designs are interesting, but fighting even common enemies frequently took as long as a boss fight; that was annoying.\n\nThe boss battles are a lot of fun, mixing again a good amount of combat, quick-time elements, cinematics, and great music. Unfortunately the game suffers from boring boss battle environments; like the first game, it's usually just a sort of open arena (though the music, in my opinion, imparts the sense of swinging around to avoid attacks and other epic thoughts.)\n\nThe voice acting and story are still excellent. Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart really have to carry most of it, and they do great jobs. The game takes some time to defeat, though all the events occur in a single night (this is undoubtedly longer for Gabriel/Dracula, since half of the game involves him traveling to his other-dimensional castle).\n\nThe music in this game is AMAZING. It's probably my favorite video game score, and possibly my favorite of both video games and movies. To say that composer Óscar Araujo accomplished something amazing would be an understatement.\n\nDespite so many similarities, this game didn't feel the same as the first "Lords of Shadow", so I can't say this one is either better or worse. There are some weak points in the gameplay (such as some enemies that Dracula is NEVER able to defeat in combat, regardless of how powerful you become), but this is balanced by some truly amazing scenes as well (the train battle comes to mind).\n\nIn some way it is more "Castlevania" than the first game, and less so in other ways.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend highly it to Castlevania fans as well as fantasy action fans. It's a shame that this game will be the last in the series (to my understanding). Mercury Steam and the designers did a great job of creating a Castlevania series that represents Western concepts and artistic values over the Japanese anime style that the original games devolved into.","November 30, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020880329/recommended/239250/","76561198020880329","GRiVEN","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020880329/","836 products in account","Lords of Shadow 2 continues where Lords of Shadow left off, almost literally, with an aged Dracula awakening during modern times, weakened and missing his memories from the past thousand years or so. Soon, Zobek comes to Dracula and informs him that Satan is preparing to return. Zobek offers Dracula eternal rest in return for destroying Satan’s acolytes, thus preventing Satan return. With the two coming to an agreement, Dracula sets out to recover his full power and prevent the return of Satan.\n\nAs one of its strongest aspects, Lords of Shadow 2 expands on the excellent combat system from the original Lords of Shadow. Many of Dracula’s combat moves are very similar to those used in LoS, this time with a vampiric twist. Instead of the Combat Cross Dracula wields whips made from his own demonic blood. Instead of the light and chaos magic from the first game, Dracula has the Void Sword and Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can restore Dracula’s health with each successive hit, while the Chaos Claws increase the Dracula’s combat strength. Similar to the magic system from LoS, both the Void Sword and the Chaos Cross have their own pool of magic which can be restored by chaining combos, which drops magic orbs.\nChaining combos is not as easy as it sounds however, as even the weakest enemies have ranged attacks, as well as strong unblockable attacks. Thankfully, Dracula’s dodge and parry will mostly keep the player safe as long as they are mindful of enemy patterns. Lords of Shadow 2, like Lords of Shadow before it, shows the player no mercy when they fail to dodge or parry an attack. In fact, even with some of the weakest enemies, a failed dodge can mean getting hit by a string of unblockable attacks until the enemies combos are over. This can lead to a somewhat abrupt death if the player does not manage to restore Dracula’s health immediately.\n\nCombat does feel more forgiving in Lords of Shadow 2 this time around, however. For one, checkpoints are more frequent and areas before large fights generally have an artifacts which allow Dracula to recharge his health and magic before heading into the fray. Helping to make things easier this time, secondary combat items such as daggers no longer require collection and instead recharge after a few seconds. There are also a host of consumable items in LoS2 that do everything from restore health and make attacks stronger to slow down time and give unlimited magic. These items make the difficulty curve in Lords of Shadow 2 feel more manageable, despite its sometimes unforgiving combat.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not always about its fantastic combat system. Sometimes, the game slows to a crawl as Dracula is forced to use stealth to proceed. These segments see Dracula using some of his abilities such as possession, rat transformation, and bat swarm to progress. At first, the stealth segments make sense as Dracula is weak and needs to possess either scientists or cyborgs to progress. As Dracula recovers his powers however, it becomes unclear why he is forced to sneak about. Dracula can destroy one of Satan’s acolytes but is unfit to face a simple cyborg? It makes little sense.\nOne particular stealth segment towards the middle of the game is particularly frustrating. Dracula is forced to sneak about a maze full of dry leaves as a boss actively hunts for him. If the boss hears Dracula step on the leaves, the boss finds Dracula and forces him back to the start of the maze, taking a portion of the player’s health. This is made worse by the boss actively pursuing Dracula regardless of the noise made, sending Dracula back to the start if he simply comes into line of sight. The segment is made all the more insulting since Dracula and the said boss fight almost immediately following the maze. What was the point of the maze at all? Why did Dracula run if he could simply stand and fight?\n\nSome of the frustrations involved with Lords of Shadows 2 also stem from what should have been its greatest strength: the open world. Without spoiling too much, the game basically revolved around two semi-open worlds: the city and Dracula’s castle. The game looks beautiful and the levels are mostly well designed, but the navigation map struggles to keep up. Sometimes the player is left with nothing more than a vague arrow pointing somewhere off-screen. I found myself several times wandering in circles only to discover a small ledge I strained to see or a far off switch I was supposed to hit with a dagger. These moments can be frustrating, and may be played off as exploration/puzzles but mostly just feel like poor design.\n\nIn regards to puzzles, LoS2 is a little bit disappointing. While the volume of puzzles seems to have increased significantly from the previous entries, the quality seems to have gone down. Most of the puzzles boil down to pull this switch/use that power. Rarely do the puzzles reach the height of those in the original Lords of Shadow, if at all.\n\nThat’s not to say the game doesn’t have its inspired moments though. Part way into the game, Dracula unlocks optional arena style challenges where the player can put Dracula’s powers to the test. These can be a lot of fun and test the player’s skill by doing such things as banning the use of a specific power or setting a time limit to kill enemies.\n\nThere are also moments where the game shines creatively such as a first person feeding segment, some clever sliding puzzles, and an interactive play. Equally enjoyable are several segments in the game where Dracula fights with a companion at his side. Dracula may be required to work with his companion to platform past obstacles or to solve puzzles, which really feels great. These moments are too few and far between, unfortunately.\n\nOn the more positive end of things, the boss fights in Lords of Shadow 2 are actually an improvement on Lords of Shadow and seems to take a page from Mirror of Fate. The fights feel more epic, with larger bosses, and fewer quick time events.  The QTE are mostly limited to escape animations but are sometimes used for boss finishers. Wisely, Mercury Stream has provided checkpoints before boss finishers which makes the QTE less frustrating. Wiser still, you can turn off QTE entirely if you so choose. With boss fights less reliant on QTE, the game flows a lot better, and it gives the player more of a sense of involvement during boss fights.\n\nAs someone who actually enjoys the Lords of Shadow universe, I felt slightly let down by its supposed conclusion. While the ending was satisfying enough, it felt a bit abrupt and unexpected. The story also pays almost no attention to the events of Lords of Shadow, only vaguely referring to the game’s events. Instead, the game focuses more on events from Mirror of Fate. This combined with the sudden demise of some key characters and a lack of explanation regarding how the player comes to arrive at Dracula’s castle, make the story feel unrealized at times. This is further compounded by an ending that doesn’t necessarily feel appropriate for the series, especially given the general direction of the entire game’s story and portrayal of Dracula throughout.\n\nAs the player progresses through Lords of Shadow 2, they see Dracula coming to terms with the monster that he has become - how becoming Dracula has affected him, his family, and the world around him. Unfortunately, that character progression just doesn’t live up to the ultimate ending, leaving loose ends right at the moment that it seemed everything was going to be tied up.\n\nOverall, Lords of Shadow 2 was an enjoyable experience despite some questionable gameplay additions and a lackluster ending. There’s a lot of content to Lords of Shadow 2 and a lot of fun to be had, including a New Game+ mode. Hopefully the upcoming Alucard DLC just ties up some of the loose ends that LoS2 left unraveled.\n","March 10, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I must'v played through it at least 5 times.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 COMPLETELY matched up with it. I WOULD say it beat it, but I hold Darksiders 2 near and dear to my heart, I couldn't betray it like that.\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a GREAT Action/adventure game, with tons of different enemies, with different attack patterns, it forces you to adapt to your situation really quick, and I think that's what we need more in games.\nI'm going to be comparing CLOS2 (castlevania: lords of shadow 2) To Darksiders 2, since it has a small bit of similarities. The problem with Darksiders 2, was that they threw the same enemy at you constantly, and it made the game a bit boring, not to mention memorizing all their attack patterns, and making the game a breeze. Not much of a challenge, in hindsight.\n\nCASTLEVANIA THREW THAT OUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOW.\n\nMOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ TONS OF DIFFERENT ENEMIES LEFT AND RIGHT EVERYWHERE\n\nEverywhere you went there was a different enemy, and it really brings out that sense of impending doom thing they have going for it.\n\nLike, 'oh i'll just go over here and grab tha-wait... no... no i won't. it's scary over there'\n\nGranted, if you're skilled enough, you can defeat the enemies no problem, and grab whatever the hell you want, but that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is, you never know what's going to be behind that corner, so it really makes you stop and think about your situation. Do I have enough health in case a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ shows up? Do I have enough healing items in case I get ♥♥♥♥ed over? THAT'S what makes the game fun, exciting, and fresh. It just throws new ♥♥♥♥ at you, it keeps it FRESH.\n\nAnd the weapons you get, holy ♥♥♥♥. Your main weapon is called the "shadow whip" and it's basically, a whip that Dracula (main character) can summon whenever he wants, as it's made out of his own blood. The lore about the weapon says that people who get hit by it says it feels like "A thousand fangs piercing every inch of your body." Also, it hardens on impact... That's why it's able to hit people, and not just splooge all over the place.\n\nYour secondary, or heavy weapon, is called the "chaos claws" These deal... MASSIVE amounts of damage, but they can't be used for long, as they require a chaos charge. you get a Chaos charge by absorbing blood orbs from enemies.\n\nYour third weapon is called the "Void Sword" This is the same as the Chaos claws, except it doesn't hit as hard, AND with every blow you land, you get health back. So, basically, if you've played Darksiders 2, it's basically health steal.\n\nAnd the Graphics... The Graphics, and the lighting technique are AMAZING. Everywhere you go is beautiful scenery, be it the modern city or Dracula's castle. The Characters models are amazing, as well. The art they chose for Dracula, and alucard, and all the other people you come in contact with is BRILLIANT.\n\nAnd the best god damn part of this whole game? YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO KNOW THE STORY! CLOS2 is technically part of the story that Castlevania was portraying in their earlier days of 2d sidescroller, but it doesn't match up with it.\n\nIt's almost a different timeline.\n\nYou know what? ♥♥♥♥ it. Castlevania beat Darksiders 2 in my list of all time favourites.\n\nYou had a good run Darksiders 2...\n\nSeriously though, go buy this game. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great.","December 16, 2014","true","47.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I really enjoyed this game.  I thought the things that needed to be improved on from the first LOS (like the camera) were and at least there was some effort made to bring some new elements to the game.  Were all those elements needed or well executedt? Not really, but I dont think they made a big enough impact to deter me from playing, they were just things I could have done without.  Story aside, I enjoyed playing this game more than the first.  And the story isn't that bad, but compared to the first LOS it falls flat, and I could see some people having a negative gut reaction to to where the story is going within the first half hour of the game and that may sour your opinion of the game as a whole but Io have played much worse games that have better ratings than this.\nIf you played and enjoyed the first LOS, you need to play this game.  If you haven't played the first one, do so before this one. If you think all Castlevania games should be like the ones from the  80's, dont play this game.","January 3, 2015","true","19.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/recommended/239250/","Levyne","Levyne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Levyne/","141 products in account","LoS2 is a game that I found myself pretty hyped for. The downfall of this sequel, however, is that it doesn't even favorably stack up to its predecessor.\n\nLoS2 has improved primary combat from the first game. The Void Sword and Chaos Claw mechanics feel distinctly unique from the main whip weapon, but unfortunately they do not really feel different from each other, except for the range of attacks and the focus on healing and damage. The Claws and the Sword have the same base combos as the whip, and while they offer more options once you learn the available skills, it still feels like the game is played largely the same regardless of which weapon you have equipped. The ability to dodge into enemies to interrupt some attacks, as well as dodging vertically or block from an aerial position, are welcome. It would still be nice for the dodge to have some window of invulnerability, for the cases where the camera is not being nice and you are unable to exactly avoid a tracking charge move or the like. Speaking of, the camera assist does seem to be helpful, but at the same time there are a few instances where I find myself needing to find the center of the room just so that I could get situated again with the camera and enemy placement.\n\nOverall, the combat is the only real improvement that the sequel provides, and everything else changes for the worse. The story starts off really interesting, but nose dives quickly. Zobek is the game's instant chaperon, declaring to Dracula what needs to be done and why. This is kind of an instant turn off. The idea that Dracula has become an "errand boy" for a man who has deceived him in the past is a bit silly. Story threads seems half-baked, and some ideas are created and forgotten faster than the player anticipates. Early on the game focuses on an antidote subplot which drags further on into the story than it needs to, but the result of this is never really made known. Later plot threads involve putting an item back together, which of course is made up of various pieces held by various antagonists. The plot shifts back and forth from the modern day tasks set forth by Zobek and from emotionally declared tasks requested by Dracula's own desires. It's a bit vague but it's hard to be clear without spoiling things. The idea is that the shifting of gameplay between the City and the Castle is reflected in the story itself, and it is never really made clear which plot threads end up important and which don't.\n\nThe duality of the gameplay locations itself is a similar mess. Ignoring motivation or plot reasons, exploring the castle is pretty fun. The locales are pretty unique, ranging from a leaved garden, to a snowy tower, to a theatre and workshop and fire-lined deep halls and moonlit balconies. While the platforming is not terribly intricate, jumping and exploring paths between the castle sectors wasn't ever really boring, outside of the rooms that clearly act as loading areas. Too often does Dracula find himself in an "airlock" where he has to close off the path behind him and open that in front of him to continue on. While during the initial run through of a place, these parts aren't bad but are merely annoying. However, they make exploring after the fact a large chore. I found myself actually dreading shifting from one area to another if it meant passing through one of these airlocks, especially if I found I needed to run around and go through it again. Aside from those however, the castle is damn gorgeous and is generally a pleasure to visit.\n\nThe City, on the other hand, is a wreck. This doesn't just limit itself to the location itself, but also the way that it plays differently. First off, the locations of street level roads, parking garages, a church, a train station, industry hatches and factories... there's some variety but it just doesn't compare to the ornate castle areas. Most everything is drab, dark, and cramped. It's just boring. On its own this isn't something that is a deal breaker, but the fact that areas are often separated by underground hatches leading to cramped hallways and elevators and such, again, make exploring the areas after initially playing through them to simply not be very fun. Since the rewards for exploring visited areas is mostly limited to extensions to your health or magic bar, or perhaps background lore, these factors make backtracking around not the most appealing thing to undertake in the first place. Secondly, the enemy types found in these modern areas included demons with shotguns or grenades, as well as robot police type mechs. These enemies are not terrible, but having to avoid various manners of ranged attacks on awkward enemy types just make them not as fun to fight. The city area does have the spectre/wraith type enemies, which I do enjoy fighting, but it doesn't compare to the jailers, harpies, blood skeletons, brotherhood knights, and such of the castle areas.\n\nThe Boss fights of this game are spectacles, and while the motivation for fighting each of them is a bit silly, some of them are really well done. The boss designs are creative, fun to look at, and most importantly, fun to fight (generally). The boss fights do a fair job of mixing up how you are best to tackle them, including using ranged or aerial attacks, or using Void and Chaos power, as well as prioritizing positioning and reflexes. It's just unfortunate that one of the most interesting boss fights, the one you fight in the theater, ends up also being one of the easiest in the game. There is a challenge set of maps also available, but these feel so separate from the main game. Sure, you can "farm" experience through these, but you could just do that with enemies anywhere, and you don't have to skip a cutscene every time you want to enter the challenge area. I understand that for many players, the challenges being present for a sake of variety is plenty, but I would have liked some sort of exp bonus for each completed challenge as some sort of motivation for completing them during the main game. Aside from that, the challenges themselves are pretty interesting and some are fairly challenging. The limitations forced on the player for some of the later challenge rewards allow you to think of other ways to dispatch enemy types. For instance, a later challenge that required to freeze monsters readily taught me about the void power variant of the mist form, which normal gameplay might have never pushed me to attempt otherwise.\n\nFinal thing I want to touch on is the stealth. Outside of some admittedly shameful ineptitude from certain review sites when it comes to finishing the stealth sections, I will say that the reviews themselves are not wrong. They just seem unneeded, and they interrupt the pace of a game that needs all of the pacing consistency it can find. Even with the idea that the stealth sections are more like puzzles in the guise of stealth, they still feel manufactured and present just to be present; I think I would have preferred more Zelda-eqse puzzles like in the first game rather than avoid unkillable enemies as the immortal prince of darkness disguised as a rat. While puzzles can become an iterative process where you learn the patterns needed and slowly make progress to a solution, these stealth sections seem more like trail and error where you simply try out which combination of bat, rat, and possess needs to be done in what order in order to progress. The infamous stealth section in the garden area was the largest of the game, and while mechanically it wasn't much different from any of the numerous smaller stealth sections, it felt the most unneeded since the fight that it precedes make the whole section seem pointless.\n\nThe game is a decent run through, especially for fans of the initial Lords of Shadow, but for anyone waiting to jump in or wanting to be proven wrong about their opinion on this latest outing by MercurySteam, this game isn't going to make believers out of the doubters.","March 2, 2014","true","47.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theholydarkness/recommended/239250/","theholydarkness","[TSC] TheHolyDarkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theholydarkness/","101 products in account","Allow me to add to the chorus that says "The Metacritic Score is a lie."\n\nThis was a good game. Though it differs from the first. It is by that measure that I think its best compared.\n\n+Graphical Presentation+\nThe first game had your character crossing an elaborate, Lord of the Rings like world with plenty of variety and set pieces. It was absolutely beautiful.\n\nNone of that beauty comes close to be realized here. Instead, what you get is an atmosphere...\n\n...THAT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE CASTLEVANIA!\n\nThere are many reviewers who will cry at the fact that the last game was prettier, but here, you are in a dark, moody castle with full control of your camera and dammit I just couldn't help but love how it actually felt like you were involved in a dark tale of vampires and demons, unlike the first. So between this and the first, its an apples to oranges comparision. In the end, the graphical presentation gives you that SoTN feel that the first game was missing (the sexy mountaintops of LoS1 be darned).\n\n+Story (Spoiler Free)+\nThe first game was about losing faith. The second game is about redemption. Obviously. What else is new? What's important here is characterization and voice acting delivery. To which it does an absolutely fantastic job of delivering. Though, in my view, its story is not as heavy as the first, given that every single chapter in LoS1 had Captain Picarde himself explaining what the heck is going on in detail. We really could've used that narration to explain some of the strange stuff having in this castle-city. Like what the heck is a castle doing here in the first place? That was a head-trip, but hey, its Dracula; his castle be constantly respawning I guess.\n\nSo here's what I recommend you do before jumping in here: 1) Play the first game first (or read its cliff-notes). 2) Play Mirror of Fate (or read its cliff-notes) . They frequently make references to the first game and the hand-held tie-in so if you skip these steps then expect a confusing plot.\n\nGiven that I didn't skip these steps, I found LoS2 to make for a pretty good story. Certainly has more heart than most games these days. It's like a DMC that you can take seriously.\n\n+Gameplay+\nHere is the one place where I can say without a doubt that it delivers better than the first game. You see, LoS2 is easier than the first, for all the RIGHT reasons.\n\nThe first had some Nintendo-hard bulls*** issues holding it back that have been fixed. For one, you have more options given the three weapons to choose from. The lame Light and Dark Magic system is replaced by an Ice Weapon and Fire Weapon.  In the first game, you only switched to Light to heal on occasion and that was it, as you were constantly struggling to fill up the focus meter to fuel your heals. Dark magic was never used. It was nothing more than an unimportant DPS buff.\n\nHere, the replacements to the old magic honestly feels different enough for you to want to mix it up, what with the fire ability being able to break enemy shields and blocking (in addition to doing more DPS), and the ice sword having some mean crowd control abilities (in addition to healing you). Filling up the focus meter is much faster and easier so you can continue to fuel these things without fear, and with the camera in your control, you just won't feel as frustrated as before.\n\nThe side items and powers are must more useful as well, and a power you get later on adds a whole new dimension to to your defensive options. Overall, I'd say LoS1 comes no where CLOSE to being a steller action game in the gameplay department. It was servicable and that was it. Here, we actually have a system that's as fun as God of War.  YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRACULA, AND NO ONE CAN F*** WITH YOU! You ARE the final boss of over 30 games, and nothing can stop you, only slow you down.\n\nHell yeah.\n\nAbout the only thing relatively weak are the stealth sections, which make sense only at the start of the game...how is it that you're a threat to Satan, but these red guys can blow your ♥♥♥ away doing 9999 damage per shot? I need Captain Picarde to explain. Fortunately, such sections are mercifully short and easy.\n\nThere are also fewer puzzles than the first game. But who cares?\n\n+Overall+\nOverall I give this game a 7.9/10. Its not the greatest thing since Bayonetta but taken as a whole, the Lord of Shadows series offers the best story in the action game genre today...taken as a whole.  View Lord of Shadows 1 and 2 as one really long epic and you're pretty much doing it right. When the dust clears, you'll likely give this game a worthy playthrough on New Game + and have fun with it as well.","December 14, 2014","true","30.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Because LOS 2 is far from the great game the first one was, but also isn't totally crap - I'd say it's about 60/40 on the quality divide.\n\nIf you played LOS 1 you'll recall it finished with a gob smacking reveal - that had me extremely curious as to how the developers would follow up on this audacious twist. As it turns out - not particularly well. It's a beat em up platformer just like the first, but in this case the camera is moveable - which makes a big, and unwelcome, difference as it is slightly too far out to see the action, and also gets obscured by the ridiculous amount of special effects that happen with EVERY attack.\n\nThe game begins back in ye olde days with Dracula's castle being attacked by a giant robot that looks like a building. At first I was like WTF  is that?? because it looks utterly stupid - until I remembered the Titans from LOS 1: those majestic towering elemental creatures that were so impressive. Well, this is one of those - except it's been put through the moronometer, and come out with totally dumb design. Technically impressive for sure, but so NOT Castlevania!\n\nIf you hated the liberties the first game took with the series design - you'll be frothing at the mouth over this one....and I'd probably best not mention it gets even worse when the game jumps back to the present day, because those bits will  likely cause your brain to explode in disgust. They annoyed me, and I wasn't bothered by LOS 1's changes.\n\nIn the modern day bits you begin by traipsing through a pharmaceutical warehouse, beating up crates and plastic barrels - but not the enemies because you are too weedy after starving yourself of blood for hundreds of years. Yet there's a cutscene where Dracula gleefully murders a family of three - kid included - to regain some of his strength, and to show you how EVIL he has become...err, okay ...not really selling it so far (mainly due to Robert Carlylse's utterly ♥♥♥♥ performance), but whatevs!\n\nAnyway, because you've become a total wimp  the first enemies you face have an enforced stealth aspect, which is pretty basic - and by the way, said enemies are big dudes in demonic armour with a gun bigger than you are.......Wot tha fudge?\n\nEventually you get through these dull encounters, and get sucked back into ye olde times - which thankfully are (a) much more enjoyable, and (b) less crap stylistically, though the first boss you face in this world isn't the greatest to look at. Duff them up, explore a bit more, and then...it's back to the crappy warehouse, traipse thru that some more, and it's back to ye olde world. The games a YOYO!!! Ye olde world =good, modern day=big bag'o'shito\n\nBack in yon days of lore there's a bit with these creepy snake headed girls that's very....creepy, as they skitter about, and contort themselves in a fashion that really won't be doing their spine any favours. They're genuinely disturbing, yet at the same time it's such a pity the whole game seems incapable of maintaining the menace they exude.\n\nThe boss battle that precedes this bit has an awfully written cutscene, that's very japanese (even though the devs are spanish...) With an overtly sexual demonic villainess who laughs like a demented walrus, and then says you make her wet....yeeeessss, ok then. The bizarrest thing about all this - the first game had Hideo Kojima involved and wasn't this bad, this time around he was nowhere near this game and it's even more Hideo Kojimaesque than Hideo Kojima.\n\nAnd, well, that's as far as I've got so far : that's an awful lot of crappy aspects for the first 3 or 4 hours of a game. There's still some enjoyment to be had with it, but it's a shadow of LOS's greatness and a horrendous treatment of Castlevania.\nOn the plus side - Patrick Stewart is much less awful this time around, so there's that. So, here goes - time to push the 'meh' recommend button, oh wait - there isn't one.","March 18","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I loved Lords of Shadow. It had some issues, but was incredibly enjoyable, from the variety of settings to the classic monsters Gabriel did battle with.\n\nI'd read that this one was very slow to get going, but that once it did, it was solid. That disappointed me in and of itself, but it also made me wait for a sale to buy it. Finally a good one came along, and I bought the game, looking forward to get back into the world and see what had become of Gabriel since we'd last met.\n\nBecause I'd read the reviews already, I was willing to sludge through the awful stealth sections where you have to turn into a rat to accomplish a variety of goals. And yes, they were terrible. But what was also very annoying was a constant sense of "where do I go" and "what am I supposed to do now?" A lot of time was spent backtracking or wandering all over the map looking for the next goal. There were areas that I couldn't get to simply because I wasn't SUPPOSED to get to them yet, even though I could see things I wanted just beyond simple things like rocks that Dracula should've easily been able to leap over and obtain.\n\nNot this Dracula. So that took me right out of the immersion. But OK, I can overlook it if the game itself is good.\n\nIt's just the opposite of the first LoS to me. That one was excellent with a few flaws. This one is generally bad with a few bright spots, none of which make up for the game as a whole.\n\nThe voice acting, aside from Dracula, is absolutely terrible, especially the "extras" you fight who constantly shout out the same lines over and over. The monsters in this one are poorly designed as well, and even the humans look bizarre. Garbriel's head often seems way too small for his giant body, for instance.\n\nSome of the fights were OK, but the vast majority just came down to relentless button mashing mixed with evasion. You can learn all the "cool moves" you want, but you really don't need them. Just mash that X and Y, and you'll get through most of the fights. Boss battles are typical of the problem with so many of these types of games today: big, giant, lumbering beasts or creatures that you have to climb or hit a glowing portion on, blah, blah, blah. Nothing exciting, nothing very interesting.\n\nThe only thing that kept me going in this was really wanting to see a resolution to Dracula's story. Quite frankly, I wanted to see him become Gabriel again. But about 3/4 of the way in, I realized that, despite what some of the reviews said, this game was not getting much better. I was revisiting the same places over and over again, and who wants to walk Dracula around science labs in a game like this? Drab, boring science labs is where you spend much of the game, not the gothic settings of the first.\n\nSPOILER:\nAnyway, I was getting so frustrated wtih the game that I decided to spoil the ending for myself. I wanted to see if it was worth playing through to the end for a solid payoff. Well ... for me, it's not. Not even close. There was no resolution whatsoever. Silly me. How could I not get that they were just going to leave everything open-ended for yet another one of these things. The plot has become idiotic, downright stupid. I felt dumber for having played as much as I did.\n\nBut at least I got it on sale. A true shame what they did to this franchise after such a great predecessor. Do not recommend this game at all.","March 10, 2015","false","17.3"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","22","45","3","0"

Should mention that the tutorials are horrific in this game and leaves a bad first impression right there but other than those things, its a pretty decent game with good combat and somewhat fun exploring(when you go back in time ofc, to avoid those horrible city sections.) and the boss fights are quiet nice, most of them are really well designed and badass but also not too difficult. At its current price i find it hard to recommend this game, at least if you are a fan of the first Lords of Shadow game but when it drops down to 20-15€ then it would be worth the price and worth giving a shot. Quick round up the good thing and bad things of the game.\n\nPros:\n+Really good looking graphics and runs really smooth with not a single framedrop\n+Medieval era is awesome and looks fantastic\n+Combat is great and fun\n+The Orchestral music in the medieval areas and most boss fights are fantastic\nCons:\n-The Orchestral music during the city sections are really bad\n-Very few different kinds of enemies\n-Story is mediocre\n-Stealth is boring\n-So is the whole city\n-Characters this time around are not as interesting or memorable as the first game.\n\nEDIT: Now that the DLC is out but cant be reviewed seperatley, i will just combine it with this.\n\nThe revelations DLC is a fantastic piece of content but still feels like it was cut from the main game just too make some extra cash.\n\nSo you play as Alucard this time to retrieve Draculas weapons for whats coming next for him when he  wakes up. Sounds simple and a bit boring but it was much better than i expected.\n\nThe big thing about this is NO STEALTH or CITIES, it only takes place in the castle and it looks amazing and has some nice puzzles and exploring the castle is fun.\n\nNow how is it controlling Alucard? I find it awesome, he has a good variation of combat skills and his abillities are cool but they have no purpose in combat. Instead of having a different weapon like Dracula for his light and dark magic, he has a sword with light and dark magic which might sound a bit lame but its not, works really well and its not too hard to learn the combat skills.\n\nOverall this is one of the best DLC's i have ever finished and definetly worth the money and makes the games story feel much more complete, its just a shame that this wasnt a part of the main game from the beginning.\n\nWould easily recommend the main game and dlc if found for 30-50% off, unless you own the main game, then you should throw ur money in steam right now and buy the dlc.","February 28, 2014","true","16.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The storytelling is artrocious right from the 10 minute opening cutscene. The modern day scenario is completely lacking in any charm whatsoever. They were definitely trying to be more like Darksiders with their "open world". However, the game throws you from one thing into the next way to much. The game feels disjointed.

You guys were so much better in previous games !).\n\nA decent plot, completely destroyed by the worst appalling ending I've ever witnessed in a triple A game.  The story is actually interesting if you've completed both the first Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate (otherwise, don't even bother), but the grand finale and the game's ending is so embarrassingly insulting, it's actually a league of its own.\n\nCombat mechanics are half-way decent, since it's basically a dumbed-down version of the first game (the game is much easier, thanks to a larger Synchronized Block window and an overpowered evade move, which knocks down and interrupts enemies), but let's not delude ourselves any longer and call this game what it is: shameful.\n\nObjectively, it's not the worst piece of gaming ♥♥♥♥ this century, but unfortunately the first Lords of Shadow which was published 3 years before this sequel, is just way better in every possible way (yes, even the fixed camera which actually provided some cinematic flair).  As a fan of the first Lords of Shadow and having always argued about Mirror of Fate's qualities (still waiting for it on Steam), Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 has been such a disappointment it has made me depressed, disgusted and hateful.

I watched all the trailers over 30 times at least and got kinda obsessed over it, but then release day came. I started playing and it was a great game! Smooth combat which improves a lot over LoS 1. There are many moves for all weapon types and with each mastery level, the weapon's effectiveness improves. The enviroments are stunning (plus with the free camera, you can enjoy them more), and with the HD texture pack only available on PC, the games was absolutely amazing and showed what PC's can do that consoles can not. I enjoyed the game quite a lot infact, but the story did seem dumbed down, especially the ending (won't spoil it for you and besides, it's my opinion on the ending). The modern day city was refereshing, but got a bit boring after going through the same area's multiple times during many missions. The stealth mission's are not exactly as good was Splinter Cell, but they are alright in their own way. Characters in this one seemed a bit bland as well, even Alucard and Gabriel. The only part I enjoyed in terms of characters was the Carmilla part, other than that, the story was pretty dull in most areas. After all, Dave Cox did say that we were going to get an epic, emotional ending as well.\n\nI'll just list pro's and con's on my view:\n\nPro's:\nGreat combat system! Way better than that of LoS 1.\n\nBeautiful enviroments (just a bit repetitive).\n\nGreat QTE's for boss fights.\n\nSoundtrack is absolutely one of the best I have ever heard in a video game!\n\nThe free-camera.\n\nPretty cool boss fights.\n\nCon's:\nThe story was pretty bland compared to the first one.\n\nCharacters seemed to not be that interesting either (Except Alucard, Gabriel, Zobek, Marie, Carmilla and maybe Victor) Mainly the acolytes and Satan (Dave also stated we'd see how Satan progressed as a character. Didn't really see that at all).\n\nSome enviroments are boring when you keep having to go through them all the time.\n\nNot too many enemy types actually. I came across about 10-15.\n\nStealth isn't the best either.\n\nThe difficulty has been lowered down in this game as well compared to LoS 1.\n\nFinal Verdict for me:\nPersonally, I'd give it a 7 maybe 8/10. The ending wasn't all the good in my opinion, others may disagree. I think the game was pretty over-hyped, but most games are these days to be honest. I would definitely recommend buying this game, but don't expect as much a story as LoS 1. Combat was lovely though as well as the climbing buildings, wires and lamposts etc. I only ever got to use the dragon form once though (found it rare to find fragments of the medallion). Overall, if you loved the first one and MoF, get it! If you found LoS 1 and MoF a bit boring and bland, this game may not be for you then. I personally enjoyed 80% of it, but I feel that it will be another year or 6 months until I replay it.","February 26, 2014","true","20.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I have heard that Konami changed the original ending to the one we have here, so we'll see what the DLC offers.\n\nAll in all I think that I may have enjoyed the first game more than this one, but this had moments, especially in the first half of the game, where I felt as if it was exactly what I had wanted out of the sequel.  The latter half also has great segments, such as the Toy Maker, but the last quarter of the game the narrative begins to get a little loose and things just happen because end the game already.

I think the combat was well put together.  The story we really well done, IMO.\n\nThis is a tricky review though.  As I said, during the game it was fun.  On beating the game though, I did feel disappointed.  But let me break down some of the elements.\n\nStealth:  I feel the hate for these sections is misplaced.  The fact is, they are such a tiny part of the game, they might as well not even be there.  They can all be completed in no more than 10 minutes.  I also feel the whole transforming into the rat swarm was not neccesary at all.\n\nEnemies:  Most enemies are very good.  They vary up their attacks, they dodge your attacks, and large groups of them can prove problematic.  Out of all the times I died, it was mostly to these situation.  At points you are under seige from large groups of small enemies, and then sometimes you are facing two or three very large hard to kill enemies.\n\nAs it should follow - Combat:  The combat I feel was excellent in this game.  It was as good as the combat in the first game, hands down.  They added this power up element which basically incentivizes changing attacks and weapons.  The dodge was much more responsive feeling in this game than the last game.  Accordingly, the timing for the charge moves of enemies is very much varied.  So there is no absolute time to block.  They also made it harder to syncronize block in this game.  It felt like you have less frames to hit the button in.  I noticed that some enemies hardly ever normal attack and almost always charge.  Those enemies ended up being the easiest though as their attacks tended to not be varied.\n\nThe World:  This is where the game has some failings.  It placed you in many small corridors and very few vistas.  In the first game you had lots of open and interesting areas to fight and puzzle your way through.  In this one lots of times it felt lackluster because of this failing.  The castle, as other reviews have stated, is awesome.  But it just feels like the castle is mostly optional.  You find Wolf portals between the worlds, but I found little reason to back to the castle and explore.\n\nEnvironmental puzzles:  Almost non-existent.  It's a shame, iit was fun to try and get past timing puzzles and spike traps in the first game.  This game had none of that.  No timing puzzles, no spike traps, it just felt like you were walking forward a lot in this game with little to hinder your way... well little except finding a switch which was usually located in the same room.  I just didn't see the point of pulling a lever to open a door that was five feet away.\n\nExtracurriculars: There was plenty of things in this game to collect.  But the back tracking isn't fun to me.  In the first game, the stage based design was awesome for this.  Go back, find the scrolls, collect the gem or the weapon upgrade, maybe do a the stage challenge while you are at it.  I loved the challenges in the first game, they were fun to try and complete.  This game didn't really have that.  They had some sort of challenges that I unlocked throughout the game, and the game managed to tell me about them about 700 times throughout the course of the game.  The funny part was, going through the pages of the Journal and menus... where the hell are they located?  I never figured it out, but I wan't inclined to backtrack and figure it out.\n\nPros that don't need explanation:\n\nMusic was awesome\nVoice acting was awesome\nStory was, for the most part, very good\n\nCons (many of these are personal cons and as such I know aren't objective or shared by many people):\n\nFree Camera - I loved how the first one was with the locked camera.  The devs always put it in a good spot to show off the awesome world.  I feel that stepping away from that was a mistake.  The camera was downright annoying in some battles, and in other battles it didn't do a good job.\n\nOpen World:  As explained, I didn't enjoy this aspect.  I am a firm believer that not every game is automatically made better by an open world.  This one was definitely not.  Believe it or not, the world actually felt much smaller than the stage based world from the first game.  I think a good open world is truly awesome, but this unfortunately was not.  Also, in making it an open world that helped to deny my want to go back and find collectibles.\n\nOverall Opinion:  I think this is a worthy game on a sale.  If you played and liked the combat from the first game, you are probably gonna love the combat in this one.  I also felt that the dev failed to deliver on a conclusion to the trilogy.  The ending was not a conclusion, but an outright attempt to further the series into yet another game, which disappoints me.  I am anxious to see what they do with DLC however.  There are rumors of an Alucard DLC, which I would be interested in playing.   If they did some sort of DLC that let you play as the other Belmont you meet in the game, that would also be fun.  If I had to give it a score, I would probably give it a 6/10.  This is not an objective review, I have explained what I personally did not like about it.\n\nEdit:  At the time of writing my Steam timer shows 25 hours in game.. but I alt/tabbed out of the game to do something, realized I had to leave for work, and then left it on while I was at work by accident.  I really only put 15 hours or so into the game, so that was a disppointment.  The first one I put 29 actual hours into.\n\nEdit2:  I did a "No" recommend.  But if you get it on sale and want to see how the story plays out, it's  a yes.","March 6, 2014","false","25.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I was so hyped for Lords of Shadow 2.\nThe game began, the tutorial scene was spectacular. I felt like I was unstoppable as I tore through armies of men with great ease.\nSuddenly I was in the future and I had no powers at all. I thought to myself "I'm ok with this, it's just an intro scene to tell me the story" and I was right, I gained some of my powers back and I was placed into the world, the world which was simply a modern day looking city... that ruined some of the Lords of Shadow feels, I was used to beautiful natural landscapes with ancient ruins dotted around, the modern world is not something I want to see in a fantasy series, it's boring because I see it every day.\nI decided to push on and I came up to the first "enemy". The first enemy of the game you cannot kill, you have to hide from it. I am Dracula, the Prince of Darkness... and this GRUNT enemy is undefeatable by me, yeah that doesnt make me feel cool. You have to use stealth which is just turning into a rat and running past him, THIS IS A CASTLEVANIA GAME. I proceeded and there were two more of these undefeatable enemies, it took what felt like forever to get into real combat and ... it was Ok.\nThe combat feels smoother that the last game but for some reason I ended up getting hit a lot more, I dont know if this was my fault or a lack of enemies telegraphing attacks, I really dont know.\nThe first boss was cool to begin with but it was quite repetitive and way too simple, way more simple than the tutorial boss which actually hit me quite a few times.\nI continued through the game a bit longer, but after an hour or so after fighting mutants and military mech suit things, I gave up. My character had no motivation so I had no motivation, there were too many gaps between combat where i just had to ♥♥♥♥ around for a good while to make my way through an area. The scenery of the game was unattractive in my opinion with everything being either black, white or grey and all of the feelings of the original Lords of Shadow were gone.\nI was truly truly disappointed when I played this game and I wish that it didn't exist.\n\ntl;dr\nTHIS GAME IS CRAP\n3/10\n","March 24, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

A game I have been anticipating since I beat the first one. Mercury Steam did a good job rebooting Castlevania for me in a different perspective, however, that is sadly not the case with its direct sequel. Four excruciatingly long years I have endured to find that my expectations were too high for what could have happened to this series, and I will gladly explain why.\n\nI was wrong about my assumption again after finishing the DLC, since it added peripheral information to the reasoning behind some characters' choices, but it did not add anything more than what the player already knows which is ironic given its title "Revelations" and even more ironic comparing it to the first Lords of Shadow's DLC, which revealed quite a lot about the story. To be precise, I was generally dissatisfied with Lords of Shadow 2 in its story and was hoping the gameplay would make up for its mishaps.\n\nFull review found on: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/04/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2.html","April 13, 2014","false","143.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story so far is alright. You play as a weakened Dracula who has to get his powers/abilities back. The combat is strange because it's harder to fight regular mobs than it is to fight bosses. It has light puzzle solving. Parts of the game you have to sneak past guards because you're not strong enough to kill them. Which is complete bull crap because you're fighting Satan's acolytes who are super powerful demons. Basically the developers are forcing you to play a crappy game mechanic they thought was cool and justifing it by saying it's supported by the story. The more you play it the more it seems like an anime. Although the gameplay is different than Lords of Shadow you shouldn't play this one if you didn't like the story of the first.","February 28, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/X-TSR/recommended/239250/","X-TSR","X-TSR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/X-TSR/","143 products in account","This is a very, VERY good game!  Take note that this is a review from a gamer that ACTUALLY read all the memorials, did not skip a scene, took the time to look at statutes, arts and building structural designs, and all the back stories in every description. I also take this game as it is, instead of relating it back to any other Castlevania, such as Symphony of The Night or the first LoS.\n\n10/10 would recommend this game, and here's why:\n\nPros\n\n1) The story is amazing.  As I dig deeper into the story, I feel I can relate to some of the characters, know why they did what they did, and that is important! Some may argue that the ending is dull, I personally think that it is fitting.  Reading the memorials help me understand how the modern era portrays the world and history.\n\n2) Voice acting is phenomenal.  They not only fit the characters, they brought out the emotions of their characters and made the story more colorful.\n\n3) The soundtrack is amazing as well.\n\n4) The city and castle designs are amazing.  While it is set in a modern world close to ours, it also retain some original castle structures that makes sense to remain there.  The castle is, well, Dracula's castle, and it is beautiful.  The texture of the stone/wooden floors, ceilings, and walls are so detailed that they are worth admiring, one could feel that this is not a simple copy-and-paste world.  I actually took time to look at statutes from different angles, just to admire them.  The world is interconnected, different routes to a place is possible.\n\n5) Game's free-camera-control is great, and the combat is fluid.\n\n6) I love it when in Dracula's rat form.  While some will argue it's necessity (Dracula too powerful to be a rat), it gives me a different view of the city.  What amazes me is that despite everything being bigger, the texture of the world is still amazing (floor tiles, walls and cables)!  So what he turns into a rat? He's a ♥♥♥♥ing Dracula!\n\n7) The most controversial part of the game: Argreus.  I like the stealth part in his maze.  Again, many people would argue that since Dracula is so powerful why the sneaking and the one-shot-kill? Ever heard of Pan's Labyrinth? Well, Argreus IS Pan's brother, so it makes sense that a maze like that would be his world, and the one-shot-kill is justified.  That is why we have to make it past the maze to a higher ground where it is not a maze to fight him.  Savvy?\n\nCons\n\n1) The stealth system is flawed.  While bat swarm works on certain enemies (only on the red armored marine if I recall correctly), most of the time when you use it sneaking up on an enemy, it just draws attention to every enemy in the vicinity to focus on you (once you use it, they know where you are).\n\n2) Despite having so many different skills, as the game progresses, skills will become less useful.  Some enemies are so aggressive that you just don't have time to use different attacks without being knocked down first.  I ended up using basic attacks in most of the situation.\n\nOverall, this is a great game.  You will be missing out if you rely your decision to buy this game on unprofessional critic's opinions about this game.  Hell, reviewing a game ain't even close to my profession, but after seeing some negative reviews of this game, and after personally playing it, I feel compelled to write something to justify the unjust.  After all, it's really about whether you had fun or not about a game, right?","April 16, 2015","true","45.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Gameplay wise, it's gone back to the dungeon crawling genre which could be great for some of the gamers out there. The abilities are quite similar to what we experienced in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow however with different type of weapons and upgrades. There is a larger selection of secondary items that can help, but in my personal experience, they were rarely used. Some events were quite interesting but I must agree with most people that the stealth feature should have been scrapped and put focus on the platforming and puzzles.\nAs you might have guessed, the storyline begins with Dracula or formerly Gabriel Belmont fight the Brotherhood of Light then ends with Alucard appearing. You then jump through time into a modern technological world, and start with the ridiculous stealth feature à la Metal Gear Solid. So, your objectives are basically to fight various bosses and repossess old powers which Dracula has lost through time. Pretty much like any dungeon crawling game.\nUnfortunately, there is little content about the storyline which was pretty disappointing. Characters, including Dracula and Alucard were uninteresting, emotionless. The exception is when Dracula returns to his castle throughout the playthrough. I finished this game without any emotion and with lots of questionning.\n\nDo I recommend this game? I will for the people who like Castlevania, the old dungeon crawling genre. But, you must expect some disappointment if you want to know the rest of the story. Cheers.","March 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Leveling your weapons up is a much better experience now and you will actually feel the difference as Dracula's power returns.\n\nAs for graphics, the game is beautiful - though not as inspired as the first episode. Light is improved, textures are improved, creativity not so much. Bear with the game for the first 2 hours and it won't let you down. Playing through modern cities with the almighty vampire might sound like a nice idea but the lack of better designs and the feeling of repetition as the scenery looks the same for a while will make you ask why the developers chose this path instead of focusing on the much nicer gothic    landscapes Castlevania really shines on.\n\nStorywise, even though the actors are awesome and doing their best, they haven't got much to work with. Still, this is only true if you compare it with the first LoS. Yes, there's a story, yes, it's kind of mediocre... Well, the majority of games I've been playing haven't been above mediocre so I guess it's fine.\n\nOther than that, lots of places to explore and collectibles all over the place will give you replayability over the already lenghty main course.

For those that don't know, the first Lords of Shadow - and by extension this game as well - is a reboot of the franchise as opposed to a continuation of the original canon.\n\nThat being said, I have been greatly anticipating this sequel since finally playing and beating LoS and man was it ever worth all that waiting and anticipation! LoS 2 has you playing as the Prince of Darkness, Dracula (Gabriel Belmont in this universe) himself which really needs no explanation in regards to it's freaking cool factor.\n\nPatrick Stuart reprises his role as Zobek (aka Death) and Robert Carlyle is back (and better than ever!) as Gabriel/Dracula, which alone are two good reasons why this game rocks! Also, Richard Madden as Alucard was a pretty splendid choice in my opinion. The sound and music - and the other voice work too - is all quite excellent as well.\n\nI have been absolutely loving the gameplay so far, especially the combat which I feel has recieved a nice overhaul. There is still enough of the old system there that it should feel familiar and comfortable, but they also improved nicely upon some of the smaller snags I felt the first game suffered from. AI is a bit more agressive and (only slightly) less predictable this time, which is a bit refreshing. Also, for all intents and purposes - at least as far as gameplay is concerned - Gabriel and Dracula are two entirely different characters, despite actually being the same person.\n\nGone is the Combat Cross, Gabriel's signature weapon from LoS; instead Dracula most commonly wields the Shadow Whip which is a manifestation of his own blood that he can summon and control. Instead of Gabriel's Light and Shadow Magic, you now have the life-leeching Void Sword and the armor-piercing Chaos Claws which each offer their own form and style in combat. You can also feed on stunned opponents to recover your health in a pinch. Oh and instead of the consumables Gabriel used to carry around, Dracula wields powerful vampire abilities and other dark magics - Shadow Daggers, Void Projections, Bat Swarms and more; instead of being consumable they all have their own cool-down timers and thus behave more like spells would.\n\nThe game is much bigger and better all around for the most part, though there a few minor things that I personally find annoying. For instance exploration is way more 'hand holdy' than it was in LoS... to the point that ledges you can grapple and climb now glow faintly and are surrounded by a small swarm of bats, objects you can bash with your throwing daggers are outlined by a glowing red ring of what appears to be blood, and the addition of an actual function (hold LT) while platforming that outlines possible moves 2-3 steps ahead of where you're currently climbing/hanging. Not really a deal breaker, per say, but definitely takes a lot of the fun out of it. In LoS I actually missed quite a few collectibles due to not being able to find them or simply not being able to reach them once I did locate them - this in turn drove me to explore further and look all the harder for what I may have missed; the possibility for this level of challenge is all but impossible in LoS 2 it would seem.\n\nI won't give away too much of the plot, for two reasons: one I have yet to beat the game and two it would just be a damn shame to spoil something so good. That being said the basic premise is this: a thousand years (and a 3DS game) have passed since the events of LoS, Dracula has been defeated and weakened - by his own blood no less - and thus left vulnerable to an attack from Satan, whom Gabriels seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the last time they met. Zobek makes a timely arrival to warn his 'old friend' of course and offers him both a way to regain his powers - to defeat Satan - and a way to free him from his curse - death at the hands of Zobek, who has supposedly located the Combat Cross. Thus the battle begins between the Prince of Darkness and the agents of Satan.","February 28, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can't just go in blind for the story, but if you've followed the other LoS games, it makes sense. Gameplay got an overall improvement from LoS 1, and the hub-structure feels great.\n\nSome of the stealth sections can feel a little heavy handed, but they're over fast enough with just basic levels of situational awareness. Also, some of the monster packs can feel awkward at times due to running out of weapon-magic at bad times.\n\nOverall, it's still a solid game. It feels like a Castlevania, it plays like a Castlevania, and it's plotted like a Castlevania. Not sure what all the over-negative games-media reviews were hating on, part of me thinks they didn't "get" Simon's Quest when it was out on the NES originally, and have held a petty grudge since. It's not a 10, but it's not a 5 by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nIMO, 7.8/10, solid combat systems, a healthy-sized world with plenty to explore/find/collect, but with some rough stealth sections, and one character feeling fairly wasted in their introduction/departure.","February 28, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Do not let it bother you as it only adds to the depth of the game. The developers set out with very ambitious goals and should be commended for pumping so much into a single game of this quality, somthing I dont feel I have really seen on this generation.\n\nThe game is at its best on a PC with incredible visuals, I would however suggest a controller as it is an action game and does not feel right with a mouse.\n\nEnjoy!","February 27, 2014","true","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I had pre-purchased the game before all the reviews went online and I was worried that I had bought a terrible game before it was out.  So far the combat has been fun, the story is pretty good, and it's a beautiful looking game.  I'm glad I purchased the game despite what many reviews have been saying.  I will list some of the cons I have heard and why they haven't been a big deal.\n\nStealth areas:  I have read that many reviewers found the stealth parts of the game frustrating.  I haven't found them frustrating and I actually think they add a nice mix to the gameplay.  If there has been an area where I mess up the stealth it usually takes just one more try and doesn't detract from the experience.  There is a later area I heard that was very frustrating and although I was spotted a few times I made it through rather quickly.\n\nStory:  Now I have not beat the game yet but I can say that I am enjoying the story it is an interesting continuation of the first LoS and Mirror of Fate.  I suppose there can be loose ends that aren't tied by the end but I will have to see as I go through the rest of the game.\n\nCombat, Areas, and enemies are all a lot of fun.

It is much faster paced than the first one and is doing a nice job (story wise) of wrapping in the existing lore from other games (espeically Symphony of the Night) while adding it's own twist.\n\nThe environments, monsters, look & feel are all superb.  Fantastic lighting, graphics, mechanics - the game feels good to play.  Some pacing issues and 'duh, i know that' moments.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first one at all (which I did for the fantastic environments/monsters ... less the mechanics) then this is an upgrade and a solid sequel that definitely feels more like a castlevania game ... even with some very new changes to the formula.\n\nSo far: no wall chicken.","February 26, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I recomend this game, its have great changes, like the way player can use the camera, the scenes during gameplay its gorgeous! And now ill compare this game with the castlevania frangise itself:\nThe game its just like other games of castlevania that we played before, but with more realistic graphics. You need colect all the power you vampire can use before face new bosses and other chalenges.\n\nYou can go back to other areas that you previous visited and use the new powers to get hiden improvements for your charecter, discover new areas and sutch. Castlevania sinphony of the night also have this kind of "option". You have the npc stores to buy new items just like others castlevania games. You can solve puzzles like other castlevania games, but this time it feels  yeasier and "fluid" in the pace of game.\n\nI understand that some players complain about the fact that this game its not 2D, and the 2D games of franchise, since its not so realistic opens the imaginagion of players and the way they experience the game. But this game have all the best features that other games has ofered in the past.\n\nCastlevania never was a beat-em-up game, you aways will find the monters in specific location, lust like other games of frachise. You can go back and phorth to use you powers and have a lot to explore!\n\nI totaly recomend this game!!\n","February 26, 2014","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Regardless of how one feels about the architecture of the 'new world' versus the classic macabre, renaissance atmosphere that is a staple of the series, it can't be argued that the game doesn't look absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe combat is improved greatly, as is that horribly static camera angle that gave so many of us unnecessary troubles (that has now been modified to be a completely movable, 360-degree camera). The PC version's upgraded graphics settings are highly appreciated to those of us that have the means to run it. Even then it's not the most demanding game for video cards and being an older engine, it still makes use of every technique in the book to give the game a next-gen look.\n\nThe story itself is expanded and the lore is explored heavily; it's recommended that you play at least the first LoS game to get a decent grip on the storyline, but the prologues and 'follow ups' are perfectly acceptable to rely on. If you know the storyline already, then not much needs to be said, it the sequel we've been waiting for an a truly gorgeous take on Dracula's story along with the Belmont clan in general.\n\nThe music took me by surprise with this one. The original did a lot of harkening back to older Caslevania staples and did a lot of newer approaches to that old Gothic vibe. LoS2 does a great job at feeling like a standalone title and that shines the most through the music; it still feels like a Castlevania, but touches and nuances to certain tracks (techno-vibes for the future, classic organs for the past) make it feel fresh. There's some really beautiful tracks in this soundtrack.\n\nAll in all this isn't the Castlevania I've been fawning for over the years since the series has gone 3D; I still pine for a classic HD/pseudo-3D/2D 'Metroidvania' title. But this has proven that the series can at least work in the 3D realm. Improvements are necessary, and they've done enough to prove to me that 3D Castlevania can not only work, but flourish. It's not a perfect game and there's a few hiccups in both the gameplay and story, but it'd be nitpicking to say that these tiny aspects took away from my mainly thoroughly (and still in-progress) journey through the dilapidated castles and the sprawling wasteland of the futuristic, yet still familiar gothic city.","February 26, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For a 1000 year old vampire that can rival gods power (see LoS1), he sure seems to be getting overpowered a lot. Why even do what they did, just assemble the couple hundred guards they have and rofl stomp everyone?\n\nBoss fights have gotten less dramatic I feel as well, lightning chick and the Ring wannabees were much to simple for the expected ruckus they were supposed to bring.\n\nOverall though i'm still enjoying this game so i'd give it an overall score of 7.5/10.","February 26, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The mechanics fail so many time and screw you over. Especially when it come to big eneimes. One thing that will happen is that you will dodge but they will still hit you and I'm not talking about an attack where you have to jump. The one where you have to step out of the way but you can't at times because they will hit you any ways. I know that i dodge in time because I have done it many of times to know when to dodge. Another mechanics is the dagger. When you try to control the direction of which you want to throw it won't. I have tired some many times to see if there was a way of doing it but nothing.  its a problam when you need to kill harpies with just daggers and kill other enemies while being attacked and trying to survive or you will fail. Tihs is a challenge in the Kleidos challenges. Another thing is the acting could have been better. Now its not Robert Carlyle's, aka Dracula, fought. It was the direction he got from the people recording his voice. In the beggining he was great but once you fast forward time. He basicly became mono tone and it didnt pick up til he meat *SPOILER AHEAD* Maria. Thats when I was like YAY. Again I thought Robert was awesome but the people in charge were not. The last thing is that the Kleidos Challenges. They basicly made to where you needed to be an expert to beat or or have everything unlocked and upgraded. Now I do believe things need to be a challenge but this is pathetic. You have to beat them all in order to move on in the game which is one of the main reasons why its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If it was just a side thing that you could do then I would be making this comment and giving this game a bad review. So the main point is that the makers didnt do there job.","January 2","false","18.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrakeraider/recommended/239250/","thedrakeraider","Ratt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrakeraider/","331 products in account","A massive overhaul of the combat system without forgetting tricks learned, optional quicktime system, across the board admission that they made mistakes with the first game, and a demonstration that they can learn from them. The only problem this game has is the menu interface, which doesn't allow multiple saves or easy access to an actual title menu. But it doesn't hurt the actual content of the game.\n\nGraphics: 9/10. Only deducted points is for some weird-looking hair and particle animation touching on the uncanny valley, but it's otherwise a gorgeous, nigh perfectly beautiful game.\n\nSound: 10/10. The score is wonderfully emotional and puts you in the middle of each moment. You'll find yourself humming along with the rat theme, and gratified during the main theme's return in key moments.\n\nGameplay: 9/10. It's not castlevania anymore, but I'm not complaining. The tricks they picked up from Devil May Cry combine well with other improvements, and mesh in the Symphony-esque metroidvania world. No more is the whip the only useful weapon, no more is spamming R1 the easiest way to end fights. No more are quicktime events required, but neither are they abandoned, for those who enjoy them. And they skip function works beautifully, at no point during even cutscenes do they feel forced, nor does the lack of them feel depriving. A good status quo. But it looses a point for not having a heart system, or a means to deal with stealth sections as a combat option. Sorry, series fidelity is one thing I'm big on, and Castlevania isn't a stealth game, neither is it Devil May Cry. That said, the stealth segments are still very well designed, just a littlle immersion breaking when you're playing as the Prince of Darkness, whom the devil and death both fear.\n\nReplay: 9/10: Postgame, Newgame+, and some really enjoyable once-through sequences, with a train sequence early on being a standout, and a few of the boss build-ups having that effect as well, make for a game that you won't feel a need to give up for awhile, and will always be willling to dig out in a year for another run. No complaints, only point deducted is thanks to Dark Souls moving the goalposts (and Dark Souls II doing it again,) for replay value in recent years by evolving the new game+ formula, and there should have been an attempt to learn from their methods. Great games learn from each other. This applies to all games developed after a previous game. You don't need to change your self-entity, but cool tricks should not be ignored.\n\nStory: 10/10 Yes. On par with the first, with a slightly more Castlevania-y feel, despite your role as the series villian. No more pacing problems. Just awesome. There is emotion, forshadowing, character depth all done wonderfully. If I can make a complaint, it is only that some character arcs require a knowledge of the much-less-enjoyable first game to fully appreciate, but watching a youtube cutscene compilation will fulfil your need.\n\nOverall: 94/100. If you're into the genre, if you're into the series, heck, if you're into just good storytelling in general, give this game a shot. If you're scared, wait for a steam sale. It's optimized wonderfully, so hardware shouldn't be a big problem.","September 28, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The mechanics are well varied and properly executed, and at its' very beginning, launches the player into action.\n\nThe boss fights are bloody, epic, and memorable. Little was spared in terms of length and difficulty when encountering various bosses, who are well varied and endowed. Prepare to die a few times in your quest to make progress.\n\nNote that duie to the nature of the story (see section below) , repetitive gameplay is necessitated for one to unlock Dracula's potential abilities as the story progresses. This is executed in a repetitive manner, and as such, incurs a considerable challenge at the early stages of the game. However, as an indirect consequence, later sections are very rewarding as your new abilities are fully utilized in making progress. Prepare for a challenge.\n\nThe stealth system and mechanics used are not ideal and are out of balance. A being such as dracula shouldn't be reduced to a powerless imp in the stealth sections, which can be confusing and often convoluted.\n\nGraphics:\n\nExcellent, judging bu its' requirements and visuals. They are well balanced and properly executed. Details are clear and vivid, and so are the vast, open world environments. Character forms are well refined and so are their spectral abilities.\n\nStory line:\n\nAll in all, dependin gon your background, its' taste may differ to you. I've read previous reviews from people who played the games' prequel and most were not pleased.\nin my opinion, I found the fusion of both the present and the past (through the use of the Wolf Medallion) a bit unique in that you can switch to either timeline and progress at your own rate. In a manner, this further enhances the open world experience. As a drawback, this can make the game very repetitive since the environments are consrained to one transitional area, a chemical company. This also incurs a drawback to the overall quality of Dracula's retelling as a legendary vampire who must be trapped to a moden themed factory for extended periods of gameplay time as a requirement to progressing in the game. This repetitive nature may not bode well for all players.\n\nOverall rating:\n\nThe production quality is superb, and so is the gameplay. Comes highly recommended.\nMy personal rating is 7.5/10.","March 8, 2015","true","64.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you liked the first one, like I did, I highly recommend it. The combat depth from the first is still there, and no amount of button mashing will save your life. And the combat is quite chalenging. The map exploration is a Metroid-Vania, but in a 3D enviroment, look like Darksiders. The game rewards exploration, since there are a lot of collectibles and upgrades, and you can easily miss then if you don't explore, and a quick travel trough castle map rooms are a enourmous help, altough the quick travel system could be better. Story is awesome, what could you ask? It is Dracula, The prince of Darkness kicking Satan in the nuts - that's a good one on my book. The presentation is spot on, you totaly look like a badass vampire and fight like one, and both city and castle parts are impressive. The developers reproduce the horror ambience from other Castlevania games perfectly, and even when you are in modern times, it really looks like a Castlevania. The only complaint I have is that they could use more of the open air parts of the modern day city, since it looks so awesome, but you'll be on the inside of buildings most of the time. I'm a big fan of the series, and this is a worthy sequence of a great game. I'm still working on beating it, and the boss fights are really good.","March 10, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is great and I liked it more that the first Lord of Shadow. The gameplay is better than the first one and they fixed a lot of issues of the first Lord of Shadow combat. Some might say that the stealth sections are unecessary in the game, but I think that they fit in the game. Why? you might ask, because you have lost all of your powers and you are trying to get them back. It wouldn't make any sense to kill every strong enemy left and right while you are still "weak" and without your powers, would it?\n\nOverall, the story and gameplay are good and I really liked this game. The only thing that I hated about this game was that there was no replay value in this game. Once you beat the game there is not a whole lot to do unless you want to do challenges which I found to be boring, or try to unlock achievments.\n\nI give the game a 7/10.","December 6, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, most people will say the story sucked...and they're right. The story wasn't all it was supposed to be. Very shoddy work on the story, I won't lie. But you know as well as I do they aren't done with it. There will be more story released just like there was with the first one. Which, i'm ok with. With all the backtracking and whatnot I did it took me 23 hours to complete. That's a good length in my book with what story they went with. I mean, who wanted more of what they were doing? And the graphics are truely amazing. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The screenshots alone prove this game is pretty as hell. (heh) And a lot of people are complaining that the scenery is bland and boring. It's modern age style london. It's not that exciting. What did you expect from modern times? I mean, come on now. The segments in the castle are amazing and remind me of the backdrops of the first one, though not quite as epic looking.\n\nAll in all it's an improvment on the first. The camera problems are gone, the combat has been tweeked, and you get to play as Dracula. That in and of itself is way too awesome. WAY TOO AWESOME! It was a great game that I reccomend for fans. People joining in on the series now may find it difficult at times to maintain interest in the story. But the gameplay will probably keep you around. I give this game an easy 9/10. Only losing a point because of the story. I had high expectations and they were met. ^_^","March 1, 2014","true","30.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a shlocky, hamfisted and (in my mind) enjoyable story focused on Dracula and his bloody escapades around his palace in two different timelines.\n\nWhile not wholly divergent enough from the play-book of the first Lords of Shadow to call it a Metroidvania, Lords of Shadow 2 (LoS2) makes an admirable attempt at creating a fully explorable world which requires backtracking to old nooks with new moves in your arsenal to claim some doodad for your growing inventory of glowing crystal assistance-thingies. It's all very obvious and not particularly exciting, but it does reward you for your time and attentiveness.\n\nYou won't really need those 'hidden' rewards unless you're playing on the upper difficulty echelons. The combat is instantly recognizeable if you've played the first game. This year's model does come with improvements, weapon switching on the fly similar to DmC: Devil May Cry replaces the blue glow/red glow for essentially the same status effect, but with new combos to learn. There's also a fully adjustable camera, which is a pleasant new necessity (given the level design). Like the first Lords of Shadow, LoS2 has a deeper combat system than you might give it credit for at first appearance, it'll grow on you, but it doesn't go as far as some contemporaries and on all but the highest difficulties you won't struggle in battle.\n\nLoS2 has a few obvious issues. While there's some goofy and entertaining narrative chunks to push you forward early on, there's also some sluggish tutorialization. The two timelines are enjoyable, but the past clearly has the art design edge- with the present not really distinguishing itself nearly as much. You'll probably greet flashlights with a weary sigh as the signal in another easy, brainless stealth section that, conceptually, is used to break up the monotany of entertaining flashy combat and brisk level design. Yeah, great idea.\n\nAt the end of the day, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a likeable sequel. It's self-aware, in many aspects, with fantastic options like 'Turn off QTEs' which I highly recommend, as well as boasting satisfying boss encounters. It unfortunately struggles with branching out and exploring new gameplay elements. The pacing could be tighter... But, that said, I had a lot of fun with it. There are some great sequences, great moments that play off of the crazy Castlevania Dracula power trip which make it easy to recommend to fans of the first game. When it's firing on all cylinders, it captures the essence of what so many people liked about the first.\n\nIt hits a lot more than it misses and is worth your time and money if you happened to enjoy the first. It runs great, looks great and is fun to play. While it didn't surpass my expectations, it met them.","March 1, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have been in situations where I used items I did not want to, died because of pushing the wrong button, and worst offender, those QTE events...seriously this is completely useless.

The mechanics fail so many time and screw you over. Especially when it come to big eneimes. One thing that will happen is that you will dodge but they will still hit you and I'm not talking about an attack where you have to jump. The one where you have to step out of the way but you can't at times because they will hit you any ways. I know that i dodge in time because I have done it many of times to know when to dodge. Another mechanics is the dagger. When you try to control the direction of which you want to throw it won't. I have tired some many times to see if there was a way of doing it but nothing.  its a problam when you need to kill harpies with just daggers and kill other enemies while being attacked and trying to survive or you will fail. Tihs is a challenge in the Kleidos challenges. Another thing is the acting could have been better. Now its not Robert Carlyle's, aka Dracula, fought. It was the direction he got from the people recording his voice. In the beggining he was great but once you fast forward time. He basicly became mono tone and it didnt pick up til he meat *SPOILER AHEAD* Maria. Thats when I was like YAY. Again I thought Robert was awesome but the people in charge were not. The last thing is that the Kleidos Challenges. They basicly made to where you needed to be an expert to beat or or have everything unlocked and upgraded. Now I do believe things need to be a challenge but this is pathetic. You have to beat them all in order to move on in the game which is one of the main reasons why its ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If it was just a side thing that you could do then I would be making this comment and giving this game a bad review.

Dracula vs Satan in the fantastic/futuristic modern day setting among the apocalypse - sounds exciting. Plays boring.\nFirst LoS was a really boring game, but at least the story was coherit, the art style was beautiful and it, while borrowed, truly *tried*. It felt like it was trying to be a good an exciting game. Usually it wasn't. But it's the thought that counts.\nMirror of Fate was surprisingly fantastic, falling slightly flat from what people expect from the 2D Castlevania, but a fun mix of classic games in the series with gameplay elements of LoS.\nLoS 2 tries to improve. It looks better technologically, tries to rebalance some things in a good way, makes camera mostly good, removes the linear level progress in favor of the open world and makes soundtrack especially nice. And then adds forced stealth sections. And boring bland looking levels. And "secrets" which usually feel like pointless stuff. And incoherit storytelling without any conflict you can feel (but it's there, honest!).\nThis feels like Blood Omen 2 recreated in LoS universe. Except Blood Omen 2 was still a pretty okay game with some excitement and Kain, while this game just... is. LoS 1 was boring, this game just exists. It's just there. And you can play it. But you really shouldn't.\nP.S. Playing as Alucard in the DLC is fun, but that's about all there is to the DLC.

The stealth part is on only one hour long on the fifteen you are gonna spend in this marvelous gothic world. The modern set is very well designed with an impressive mastery and good assets. I would advise you to play on the hard difficulty to explore all the options the fighting system offer, it is quite deep and rich.\nIf you did not like the first one, this one is more energetic and more entertaining but beware it is not a metroidvania, it still based on the reboot. The story will move you depending on your personnal tastes, it moved me with this evil character undergoing a journey in his memory and truly evolving into a real being.

These can range from creative to asinine, and they get progressively less fun, forcing the question of: Why does Dracula have to sneak around? it's Dracula!\n\nThe storyline can be silly at times and I would've preffered the timeline to stay in the past, in Castlevania.

The social implications of this would be amazing, yet it's completely ignored.

These can range from creative to asinine, and they get progressively less fun, forcing the question of: Why does Dracula have to sneak around? it's Dracula!\n\nThe storyline can be silly at times and I would've preffered the timeline to stay in the past, in Castlevania. However the decision to include the present was confusing as it neglects the most interesting part: Dracula in the present. The social implications of this would be amazing, yet it's completely ignored. I feel this was a wasted opportunity.\n\nThat being said, at the end of the day this is easily the strongest entry into the 'Lords of Shadow' stable, but I'd only recommend it for diehard fans.","March 11, 2014","true","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

OK, yes - fighting is perfectlty fine. Especially since devs dropped the fixed camera. But everything else? Not so much. It's like devs tought "We have a good fighting that we improved with working camera. Lets call it a day, just fit anything as the rest. Who cares anyway - it's the beating that matters". And  so we have booooooooring plot, told in Fast Forward mode (even faster than in previous part). With some sort of poor stealth sections instead of puzzles. And of course there are still platforming elements but just as in part 1 - you have to be deliberatly sabotaging yourself to fail them. And the visuals... Castle part is ok. Really. But the City?! Jesus, it's supposed to be somewhere around year 2000. So why dafuq everything that can tries to look like World War I thing?! The things that cannot are just plainand simple putting fantasy stuff in early XX's cetury seting, Which never looks good. I know, I know - we all want to be unique and original. But that doesn't mean we have to be ugly or do ugly things. And - last but not least - technicals. The game does not recognize controllers other than Xbox's. You are very limited at keybinding (for example, the game does not recognise mouse side buttons). And autosave feature is f***** up - which means that you will see info about "autoseve issues" which is a kind way of saying "Next time you start the game, we will ask you to do it from the begging" cause you cant save on youir own. So make sure you kep somwhere copies of your autosaves.","April 12","false","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The futuristic London setting is bland and uninspired, the skill progression feels almost non-existent, the stealth parts are terrible. Example of how completely stupid the stealth parts actually are. They literally consist of turning into a rat, taking over a body, or using bat form to walk right past someone. On top of that the whole these enemies are too powerful for you is complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I mean ♥♥♥♥! you destroy satan and all of his acolytes yet you literally get one shot by some random minions where the ♥♥♥♥ is the logic? The half open world is stupid I don't feel like I'm on an epic journey like I was in lords of shadow one, instead I feel like im running to 3 different wings of the lamest city. This is what killed this game for me and the ending(BIG SPOILER). The entire game Dracula had a goal in which he would help kill satan and then recieve what he has wanted for one thousand years which is death. The ♥♥♥♥ing ending to this stupid game is him looking into the mirror of fate crushing it and saying fate will tell what happens from here and he walks away and the game ♥♥♥♥ing ends. The only redeeming quality of this game is when you are in Dracula's castle, the outstanding sound track, and the boss fights. I don't recommend this game for anyone looking for a good story/ending to lords of shadow.\n\nEdit: To all those reviews saying stop comparing it to lords of shadow 1.

The story is definitely not something to be amazed at but it does have its moments. The gameplay is nice, your powers have multiple uses. Combat is amazing and the difficulty level is just about right. I played it in normal. The game is also visually very impression, however, Dracula's hair is kinda ♥♥♥♥ looking, that was my only problem with the graphics honestly.\nMy only real complaints with this game is that there's ♥♥♥♥ tons of QTEs in the game, you even have QTEs while opening doors! However, QTEs can be disabled in the options menu. Also, Keyboard mapping is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the game doesn't tell you that to change the book's pages you need to use Insert and Delete. I had to randomly press all my keyboard buttons to figure that one out because it's not even written in the configuration menu. If you're playing with QTEs "on", the game will not tell you which button to press in the keyboard but will rather tell you which button to press on the gamepad, so you're always looking at the options menu in order to figure out which buttons to press. (For easy access to the keyboard layout, press F1 while in-game.)\n\nCons:\nQTEs everywhere\nGame is not keyboard and mouse friendly\n\nPros:\nGreat Graphics.\nOkay-ish storyline, the game does have it's high moments but it's rare.\nGood hack and slash combat with proper difficulty settings.\nThe game definitely does not hold your hand but you can adjust it that way.\nThere are demons with boobs!","March 3, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

The gameplay itself is solid, responsive and platforming isn't a chore like it was in the first game (fixed camera and 3D should never mix). The enemies are a nice change of pace, forgoing the traditional fodder spam in previous Castlevania games and the removal of the "Grab is the only attack that matters" is nice. Given the track record of 3D Castlevania games, this one is a leap in the right direction. The puzzles are a nice touch, not too difficult and quite creative.\n\nThat being said, there are parts in the game that will cause you grief. Wandering around the city looking for an objective is tedious and frustrating, especially when the enemies continously respawn. The stealth mechanics are either stupidly easy or very cheap (I have developped a hatred for the fall season). And certain parts of the game will not give you an indication of what is required until you die (and a tip appears on the game over screen).\n\nAll in all, the game is decent and will cater to fans similar games (God of War, Dante's Inferno, Devil May Cry, Bayonetta) and maybe Castlevania fans (if they are open to the 3D element). Unfortuately, the game's frustrating componants may deter players new to the genre. If the gameplay issues could be adressed, this game could truly be considered the stepping stone for 3D Castlevania games.","February 27, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Better world, story, and gameplay.\n\nThe explorable world with collectable lore was a major plus. Exploration and secrets were a fairly good distraction that led me to look at the world a little more thoroughly. The lack of any side missions or story was a bit dissappointing.\n\nThe story is fairly engaging, more so I imagine considering I played the first game and have already developed an understanding and sympathetic realtionship with the main character.   Robert Carlyle offered a wonderful dracula and the supporting cast were almost invariably superb.  I'm glad they had the lore portion of the in game menu, because without it I would have felt that they introduced some characters out of the blue without any exposition. Which could be viewed as lazy but I didn't find it too offensive.\n\nThe combat is quite fluid and the controls are pretty intuitive.  It only took me about ten minutes to get a really good grasp on the mechanics of the game.The boss fights are pretty good as well.  One complaint about the boss fights is that they seem to be very interesting and tactically stressful to begin with but they gradually push into tedium when you learn what tactics are necessary to defeat them.  This is most prevenlant in the first boss and last two bosses.  Another negative thing about certain sections of the game would be the "stealth" sections.  They were lacluster, slowing the game down unecessarily sometimes, mostly due to the whole system seeming under-developed.\n\nOverall this game has alot to offer in most of its areas with only a few minor misses but doesn't really do anything epicly well or ground breaking.  I definitely enjoyed it.","February 27, 2014","true","54.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't stand this crap pile of code. The story is excruciatingly slow. The dialogue is awkward and is comprised mostly of overly-exaggerated acting.\n\nThe graphics are sub-par. Even on the highest settings on a newer high-end Samsung plasma TV and a gaming PC equipped with SLI'd GTX 780 Ti's, I am reminded more of a PS3 game than a PC game. After much experimentation with the graphic settings, I have come to the conclusion that they used motion blur to cover up the shortcomings and inadequacies of their game engine. Motion blur has clearly been implemented to bridge and smooth the gaps between stuttering frames rather than to create a more realistic sense of motion. (Turn off motion blur and you'll see what I mean.)\n\nThe combat gameplay is utterly terrible. Gabriel is incredibly sluggish for being the badass that he's supposed to be. The camera angles are unmanageable and frequently interfere with the direction of your attack. Even the minor improvement after you disable the "Combat Assist Camera" setting, you are still left to struggle against some unidentified form of 'aim-assist' that frequently targets random objects to your sides and behind you rather than the bad guys - which is completely infuriating.\n\nOn that note, let's talk about enemies. Enemies are as cheap as they come. Their attacks will always interrupt yours where, conversely, your attacks rarely ever interrupt theirs. To make matters worse, the enemies constantly rely mostly on their 'unblockable' attacks. They are so frequent that fighting multiple groups of monsters results in more dodging and - invariably - dying over and over again rather than a well-balanced challenge. The unblockables are either back-to-back or followed up by a second attack that changes oblique angles to follow Gabriel in more of a 'homing' fashion. All of this requires a lot more room to maneuver than is often provided.\n\nForget blocking. It worked well in the first game but here, blocking is inconsistent in success.\n\nWorse still; as you progress through the game, you are faced with armored enemies whom you can not damage until you fist-pound the armor off of their bodies with the chaos claws. (This supposedly makes the armor "hot" until it either shatters...OR the AI decides that it's too hot to wear - at which point they strip it off.)\n\nAttacks don't just glance off of the armor. They bounce off. This makes targeting the lesser enemies around an armored enemy IMPOSSIBLE as your blows land squarely on the armored enemy rather than on any of the non-armored enemies. This makes fighting infuriating as you can't target the armored enemy without having to constantly avoid the attacks of the lesser enemies and vise versa. (Again, most of these attacks are unblockables.)\n\nIt is also obvious that the developers generate challenge in the game using cheap methodology. The whip's reach is ridiculously short and enemies purposefully stay just outside of it's range. The sword and claws are nearly useless as they are limited on usability due to rapidly-drained energy meters which must be saved for various tasks. It's also irritating that ground attacks still catch you in-air - despite what basic relativity/logic would otherwise dictate.\n\nThe bosses are ridiculous with typical lather/rinse/repeat tactics. Many of their attacks feel cheap and, at first, unavoidable. (Again, Gabriel is ridiculously sluggish.)\n\nAlso... Why is a terrible creature such as Dracula spending so much time skulking in the dark as a rat? LAME.\n\nThen there are the little maze/stealth 'puzzle games' you play with various main story characters. (Carmella, Agreas (Pan's brother,) etc.) Here, you have to sneak through the areas unseen as the characters hunt you with intent to kill you on sight. These are incredibly irritating. This is NOT what Castlevania games are about. The controls are difficult enough but these control difficulties are highlighted during these maze/stealth puzzle games.\n\nAll of this does little more than to make your character seem weak and not AT ALL like someone who once defeated the most powerful foes the world's history has ever known. This is unforgivable.\n\nIt definitely wasn't long into the game to realize that it's an atrocity. Not only does it quickly prove you right, it actually makes you realize that you underestimated it's terrific level of crappiness. It's definitely the type of game that makes you wonder in fury if the studio has ever heard of "quality assurance." ("Did they even PLAY the damn game after making it!?")\n\nNOTE: Dying finds you having to re-watch all videos and re-gather all items you find unless you passed a save point - including shards that increase your stats. (WHY, Mercury Steam? WHY!?)\n\nDon't feel bad if you finally give up on playing this crappy game and resort to Googling the videos to finish Gabriel's story instead. Trust me. I should have. It's NOT worth the time it takes to play it.\n\nThis game is GARBAGE","September 19, 2014","false","13.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Whilst I will admit that it had its foibles, overall I enjoyed it more than any other game I played that year. After spending some time with LoS2 I can already say that this is more of the same, so if you liked the first game then you will like this and vice versa. The game looks simply amazing, there's no denying that.\n\nThe gameplay is almost identical to LoS but with a few tweaks. You now have a free roaming camera; This makes sense, as whilst the game world is stil split into distinct areas, you have the freedom (of a kind) to move between them as you see fit, and having a free camera lets you search around levels for all of those secret hideaways and stashes. As I just mentioned, the game world this time round is a much more open one. There are a ton of secrets and upgrades to find. Some of the things that made some people dislike LoS return, though they aren't deal breakers (platforming is still ropey and sometimes you think (can) jump to ledges only to "bounce" off them and fall into some lava or a pit and have to restart your platforming. The game starts off slowly but then builds pace nicely. The combat is almost identical to LoS (no bad thing).\n\nThere are however some annoying things; "cheap" shots by enemies that are way off screen, unlbockable and sometimes un-dodgeable attacks and the way enemies will keep you in their fight area if you try to run/climb your way out of a fight. Most annoying.\n\nSeeing as this game is around £40-£50 on consoles I would definitely recommend getting on PC. Grab yourself an Xbox controller, ram up the graphics settings, sit back and enjoy another lengthy epic adventure (with minor quibbles (and they ARE minor)) with Gabriel Belmont AKA Dracula.\n\nConsidering how EPIC the finale of LoS was, I can't wait to see how this one (as the end of the LoS storyline) pans out.","February 26, 2014","true","12.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Lords of Shadow 2 is a fantastically composed game, with an enjoyable mix of platforming sections and combat, though the balance towards the platforming and forced stealth after the game's introduction is a bit skewed.\n\nCombat feels incredibly meaty, and switching weapons mid combat is far more satisfying than the magic system from the previous game, really making combos feel heavy and devastating. Though there is a limited meter for each of the weapons, I found that I barely reached the bottom unless I was obsessing heavily over one. The one complaint is enemies with shields that need to be broken with the chaos claws, and whilst you can backflip over them, the mercenary soldiers seem to be able to rotate instantly, requiring the use of the claws more often than not. There is a plethora of abilities for each weapon, and unless you constantly back and forth between zones grinding enemies for xp, it is highly unlikely you will have unlocked them all by the game's end.\n\nBoss battles are big and epic, featuring multiple phases, transitions and enjoyable visuals and backgrounds, the second fight with Volkova being one of the highlights of the game. Lords of Shadow 2 also ignores some of those awkward climbing bosses from the first game, with only a short climbing section featuring in the pentultimate encounter. Whilst it isn't always immediately obvious where to go, swarms of bats linger on ledges Dracula can jump on from the ground, whilst holding a button highlights the path you need to take.\n\nThe voice acting is superbly well delivered, Patrick Stewart as Zobek owns any scene he's in, and although Gabriel/Dracula's dialogue in the game's introduction is quite hammy, Robert Carlyle really hits his stride as the game's pace picks up, especially in the more emotional engagements with his family.\n\nAll in all I would recommend Lords of Shadow 2 if you're after a game that's going to last you a good long while, however one thing I would object to is marathoning it as fast as possible (as I did) as you'll find yourself getting burnt out and frustrated quickly.","March 3, 2014","true","18.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Some times the camera will even pan in on something important for you, then give you "valuable" hint on how to overcome your struggles. should you happen to die or fail the game will kindly show you everything again.

The story of the main game was interesting and the art style is fantastic, but the gameplay and combat system actually got quite annoying near the end, when trying to get all the collectables.\n\nPart of the problem is the level design which is a non-obvious corridor, where areas are separated by a multitude of sluice-gates, elevators, decontamination rooms, etc. It's constant delaying and unnecessary gratuituous animations which get boring rather quick. It takes a very long time to navigate between areas and respawning mobs often prevent you from leaving before you dealt with them, even though you have nothing else to gain from killing them. Once I got the final secret collectible, it took me something like 20 minutes to get to the area where you trigger the final boss encoounter.\n\nUnlike the Arkham games where collecting additional content is enjoyable and adds to the experience, the design of the levels actually takes enjoyment away. I would recommend doing a story driven run and avoiding backtracking for collectables and challenges.\n\nThe music is OK on it's own, but doesn't fill inspired as much as the art style and often doesn't really fit the environemt or add much to the game.\n\nThe PC port is pretty bad. You pretty much need a controller, as all the button prompts are laid out for a 360 pad. It's much worse than the first game which you could play with KB/Mouse perfectly fine. The game runs well and stable, but it's absolutely impossible to tab out. You need to trigger an automatic save, which often happens between areas, but isn't reliable, and quit the game.\n\nLastly, something that bugged me personally. You frequently either fight or partner up with humnoid characters. They have about 3 phrases each on average and will keep shouting them non-stop. Gets seriously annoying.","November 14, 2015","false","31.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Decent graphics and responsive gameplay, but heavily mired by a flawed combat system. Still perhaps worth getting if on sale for the mindless smash enemies combat. Great voice acting from the main actors, but less should have been put in to the voice acting and instead spent on developing a real story that respects the franchise mythology. Big thumbs up, the scourge of modern games, QTE's, can be disabled permanently.\n\nLong Version:\nStory\nAwful to put it simply, it's a train wreck. Castevania is at its heart a conquer the castle and kill Dracula game, this "re-origin" story series has just wrecked that with taking away everything that is Castlevania in exchange for trying to dramatise the backstory of Dracula to make him a tragic hero; with an overwhelming judeo-christian mythology shoehorned in to dominate the mythological aspects whereas previously the series was only very loosely tied to any particular mythology. The whole story was just 'Ugh, it's the devil is the bad guy story, how original...push that religion on us even more'.We are meant to believe the city is built on the ruins of Castlevania (dont even get me started on that nuke effect taht was shown large enough it would have destroyed several ENTIRE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), and the devils kids would use that spot to try bringing about their dad's return...ofcourse. Use the site your ancient enemy is at his most powerful as your base of operations.....yep, perfect sense.\n\nMajor plot holes exist *spoiler* e.g. Zobek could have read Drac's mind to discover his deception unless he lost his memories, but Zobek couldnt realise that his lieutenant had been replaced by Alucard by, oh I dont know...reading his thoughts....yeah, sure. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe deal with Castlevania itself is never really clarified, is the castle real and split off from the modern era dimension, or just a figment of Drac's fragmented mind....Major problems arise with the story regardless of which it is.\nThe story is jsut a cavalcade of bad ideas.\n\nGameplay\nTight controls that function decently for getting around and in combat. Probably the aspect of the game that is most positive. The grappling aspects are a disappointment, see that you can only use fixed grapple points to get around, instead of simply making anything that is like a ledge able to be hung from, and the game is loaded with invisible walls which is hugely disappointing for exploration. The game is heavily walled in and you will find that you are limited to very selective above street level areas, and street level, if you want to go explore over the rooftops of the city like some real badass vampire god, forget it, go buy a copy of Batman arkham city, a game which did city exploration properly.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is broken down into mobs using 3 types of attacks: range, melee blockable, and melee/range unblockable.\nYou have 3 weapons, a whip, sword adn claws. All with varying utility, the whip is a mid range weapon that is usable for building up 'focus' which when you hit 100% then attacking enemies will cause them to drop little gems that can be absorbed for magic power for your sword or claws, this only works with the whip though so you will spend a lot of time using it. Void sword burns magic and leeches life on hit, while the claws also burn magic but deal high damage and destroying shields and armour. The shields and armour ♥♥♥♥ was a terrible implementation, mobs can stand there blocking forever if you dont destroy the shield or armour, forcing you to use the real core combat mechanic, "timed counters" where you hit L2 at the right time in their swing to block an attack and stun them for a second and smash away, this builds huge focus so you can get your claws powered up to break the shields, alternateively you can somersault over attacking monsters and smack them in the back, whatever works. Unfortunately unless you are good at it, you are ♥♥♥♥ed, having spent significant time playing dark souls it was ♥♥♥♥ easy to time compared to parries in DS, but often if you are using the void sword or claws the actual enemy attacks get obscured by the flashy animations of the glowing weapons that you dont see them, this is a ♥♥♥♥ implementation really forcing play where you dont really engage upclose with magic weapons you mainly use a couple of specific moves then go back to the whip.\n\nThere is though a mechanic of "unblockable attacks", which is a huge flaw in the combat and you are forced to dodge, these attacks are indicated, but seems like lazy design, especially when you come to the bosses who their attacks are pretty much all unblockables or range attacks other than usually 1 blockable melee attack, this menas you can spend boss fights frustrated and magic starved as the range attacks keep you away, and the unblockables are chained so often the fight is 30 seconds of dodging and waiting to get one block and some melee attacks, absorb some magic and hit them a couple times for reasonable damage as the whip does ♥♥♥♥ all. In this way the game lends itself to securing really only a couple of the actual skills for the sword and claws to 'gg no re' your way through the game, namely: Whirlwind for the Void Sword, and Flame Claws for the Chaos Claws. Both expensive to use but when you see them in action it's pretty much a no brainer to use them. You may simply discover the other method which is boss cheese and basically forces you to pop relics such as ensnared demon then go crazy with the inifnite magic while timer counts down (spam those flame claw attacks, for real, ~300 damage per hit on everything), then when it runs out pop the dragon emblem and finish the boss off, takes about 30secs per boss fight, even on PoD difficulty and is almost zero effort (you may have to use the void sword to freeze bosses to spam them hard with the claws).\n\nSkipping combat and bypassing trash is often impossible, as pretty much every enemy has some sort of range attack intended to knock you off a hang point if you try to grapple away. Some monsters (the wraith type guys at the end msotly) have ridiculous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attacks that you cannot do anythign to avoid and hit extremelyhard, as noted, the wraiths, tey have a lightning attack that will hit you from 50 metres away, is practically instant hit and dodging it not really possible as by the time you see it, it is hitting you, and there is no way to defend against it other than popping the sword or claws shield magic. As these creatures fight in packs of 4-6 generally, you can imagine, Drac at max HP has about 300 hp, and lightning hit's for 40 each time....6 of them will kill you in about 3 secs, faster than you can close the distance to get to them sometimes....\n\nAlso, finally, the camera is terrible, even with "combat assisted", it is awful and seems like it tries to blind spot enemies, and the trash monster scripts seem they are intent on getting behind the camera when they can to hit you in the back. This because truly frstrating when their seems to be no 'free camera' even when assist is off and the camera constantly tries to centre in ways that make no sense and you often spend as much time trying to correct the camera so you can see wtf is happening as actually paying attention.\n\nDLC\nRevelations has good puzzles, but disappointingly cruel end boss fight due to endless unblockable attacks and mechanics that dont work with the camera (teleporting behind and unblockable charge).\n\nConclusion\nIs the game worth buying? Not at full price, it seems like an effort to just milk some more money out of the Castlevania fans who are holding on to hope that each release will be the next Symphony of the Night. Something which the LoD series just hasnt been anything near, ultimately this game is completely forgettable.","September 28, 2015","false","48.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Even Patrick Stewart can't say the rediculous lines he's given with any gravitas. Which was a problem in the first game but is even moreso in the sequel. Further, the stealth sequences are shoehorned in and are very clunky. Dracula can take down giant gorgon monsters, combat mechs, and blood golems, but he can't handle some jerk in a suit with a grenade launcher.\n\nThe plot meanders about, spending alot of time introducing characters who'll never be seen outside of their introduction until it finally mercifully ends on an anticlimatic note.\n\nThe combat is good, if somewhat shallow, but the platforming is floaty at best.

I've played every single game to date! (including Simon's Quest) I have kept an open mind about all the different stories and enjoyed every single one.\n\nSo believe the severity in my words when I say that I *FIRMLY* believe that this game ruined the entire Lords of Shadow series for me. Don't get me wrong!\n\nMechanically speaking, this game is near flawless! (I say "near" because on the hardest difficulty I was alowed to play, I still didn't find it challenging.) The story, however, took my favorite iconic Castlevania characters and just... Ruined them. The first one had a GREAT concept. I liked it! Despite the fact that it really was very "God of War"-ish. The DS "between" game even expanded on the great story they built up towards. BUT THIS ONE TOOK THE GOOD IDEA AND JUST RUINED IT.\n\nI want to use much harsher words, but I find reviews that just spew profanity never really seem to hold any weight for anyone. So trust that I want to just use every harsh word in the book at this. Honestly, I wouldn't even recommend this game to anyone who ISN'T a fan of the previous games. The story writing and concept for this game just didn't work in this one.","March 17, 2014","false","12.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

How about displaying the correct keys on the screen for the PC port, instead of still having the XBox controls on screen? Seriously. You can't even turn off the onscreen controller "hints," so I'm fighting a paladin, really into it; he launches an attack. . . I dodge it. . . screen freezes: "whow hey, did you know you can dodge this attack, by pressing the X key on your XBox 360 controller?" I'm already dodging the attack, anyway!! And the game pauses, while I'm in battle, to tell me how to dodge the attack--I've already dodged it anyway--and the instruction isn't even for the right controller!!! In 2014, a majour release title like this, should feature the correct controls when displaying instructions. There's no option to change what controls are displayed, or to just disable when the game displays controller instructions--there is an option you might think would do that: it doesn't. It is an insult to literally the entire gaming community, that a majour video game would not even take the time required to show the keyboard controls onscreen, for their PC release. What does it say about your game, when you do not put forth that level of effort when releasing it?\n\nRecommended, absolutely, if you are very interested in the story of Dracula. I am, and I like the game for it, but at least 60% of my enjoyment of that, is burnt away by the frustrating controls and other bad design choices.\n\nFor example, not too far into the game, you fight through a boss encounter of three strong enemies, and then immediately after, you open a portal to the next area. As soon as I got there, I accidentally opened the same portal again going backwards to where I just came from. I figured it out quickly, however the game would not let me just turn around and continue playing in the realm I portalled to: instead I absolutely had to complete portalling back into the first realm that I started from, where, oh the boss is here again, and oh thanks we just autosaved, and also I now only have a little bit of health and no mana left because I literally just faught this boss 15 seconds ago!! This is a design choice for this game. You can't open the portal until the boss is dead, so I almost quit playing at this point, because I could only survive two hits before dying. This is not how you introduce a new part of your game! Just please don't do this in your game. Like, I even understood that I had accidentally opened a portal backwards, and the game would not let me cancel out of it; and then there's a forced boss encounter before I can open the portal again?  It's just really bad game design. It feels like no one actually sat down and played this game.\n\nIn another area, you have to get through a high security door. I though "what I'll do is kill that scientist, then the enemy will send another scientist in through that door, and when he enters,  I can rush through the door." No! Because that door is really just an art feature over an invisible wall, and the only way through it is to specifically activate a cutscene. Arhg! You can see through the door when it opens; why would this one door, in the entire game, have an invisible wall behind it? And then you can't really tell: "was I trying to go through that door too early, too late? Did I get stuck on the edge of it maybe. . . ?" You review the hints you have, and it seems like you're doing the right thing. It's frustrating because you're really playing this game against the game designers, and not against any enemies of Dracula. The game encourages you to imagine yourself as Dracula, but if Dracula was really here, then he would just walk through that door.\n\nAn enemy has an energy shield, which you have to pound away on to break it. If you cease attack, for literally less than one second, then the energy shield completely recharges. So it's difficult to tell if what you're doing is effective, because it's hard to stay on the enemy as they move around, and other enemies in the room try to attack you. Then, do you want to know what happens when you do break through the energy shield? If you do break through the energy shield, then the energy shield completely recharges, looking just like what happens when you stop attacking it. You actually have to break through the shield three times, but the game offers no signal that you're actually having an impact. If you break through the shield, it looks the same as if you failed to break through the shield. This is a bad design choice which I hope I don't have to explain further, but I will: it encourages the player to cease doing the right thing, maybe even leave the area, and try other things--which incidentally won't work.\n\nThe game offers a difficulty setting, but so far as I can tell, the only difference is that you get more health pickups on easy. It doesn't, for example, make that shield recharge after 2 seconds, so you can break through it without being a super expert fighter.\n\nThere is an interesting story of Dracula here, but it is wreathed in bad design. Confusion abounds. Fighting is challenging, but difficulty comes from trying to understand what the game expects. A game about Dracula, could be difficult by having strange boss encounters that make you pass unusual trials. You may even think that's what this game is. But I do not think the difficulty present in this game, was intentional. Having a game throw you back against a boss, immediately after you defeat it; without restoring your health, and autosaving at the start of the battle . .  This is not "difficulty" this is "bad design." It is worth playing to experience some of the story of Dracula, but it is not worth playing to see what a good game looks like.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlso. . . to one of the commenters: I didn't write about any crashes. And I'm not using a 360 controller, because I like using a mouse and keyboard: the game actually controlles quite well with a mouse and keyboard, except that all the information in game is for the 360 controller, and then you're like "ooh, what button was it to activate this blood spout?" Then you have to go searching through not one, but two sepearte controller help pages to try and find it, and just, ugh. . .why? Why is it like this???","February 26, 2014","false","32.3"," 21 of 61 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","21","61","0","3"

LoS2 takes place in a combination of the modern world built on Dracula's castle and the past. While playing LoS2, I never really felt a sense of progression, I just felt like I was playing. It's not a particularly difficult game but it does have some stealth scenarios that can be annoying. The boss fights aren't particularly intuitive, just hack and slash and avoid getting hit. The modern environments weren't really my cup of tea but I thought it was fun that they used Dracula's castle as the foundation of an entire city. The past environments were nice and the graphics were done fairly well.\n\nI had no performance issues with the game (played with an i7-950 & GTX 780) and no technical issues; it worked very well for me. I played with a gamepad, as any sane person should do with such a game.\n\nTook me just over 16 hours to complete. I didn't collect all of the items and upgrades, but probably most of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazie/recommended/239250/","Blazie","Drei Fufzig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazie/","94 products in account","So first of all I didn't play the Castlevania series before which means I don't know anything about the GBA/Nintendo etc games.\nI bought Darksiders -which was in a bundle- and I realy fell in love with the game. Afterwards I got Darksiders 2 and after I finished it aswell I started to search for games which are alike. Someone told me about Castlevania: Lords of Shadows.\n\nSo I started with Castlevania:LoS (Ultimate Edition) and it was one of the best expiriences I've ever had. The atmosphere, the fights, the mechanics (light/darkness) and the insanelly good music made this game a 9/10 for me. When I finished the game and closed the client I got an announcement by Steam about Castlevania:LoS2 and I was soooooooooo happy.\n\nI immediatelly bought it and when it was released, I immediatelly started it.\nThe 1st thing was the "Tutorial" which was epic as ♥♥♥♥. One of the greatest things in my opinion is the new usage of Light and Darkness which is splitt in new weapons (Sword/Gauntlet). I really liked the character development and how much the characters in the game actually changed.\n\nI'll be honest. After I played for about 1 hour I was really disappointed about the game. It didn't feel like the 1st LoS and something was missing. I felt that the story was really flat and -maybe- it was the new location which I felt were not fitting the game. And I stopped playing it.\nAfter some time passed I started the game again and realized it was the worst mistake ever to stop playing it.\n\n#######################SPOILER###########################\n\nIt's amazing! I love how the game changes all the time. The timetravel and the changes in the locations are amazing. The story of the 1st LoS and LoS2 combine themself very well and makes a lot of sense. The story of LoS2 feels very flat but after I reach a certain point in the game my opinion changed completely. It pretty much change the whole point of view.\nOne of my favourite parts is still the music in this game which fits perfectly.\n\nAbout the gameplay it's really simple to explain. The people who played the 1st LoS won't find many differences. You can still  find containers to increase your life/light/darkness. The 1st difference lies within the skilltree. While you still purchase new combos with the points you gain, your skills level aswell if you use them and you can compile them in your weapon which makes the weapon stronger. This change is really good in my opinion because it was one of the flaws in LoS. The skilltree didn't seem to be important and you didn't really need to unlock the combos becuase you could beat the game with the stadart attack. Now there is at least a reason to use different attacks.\nA new feature I really appreciate are the challenges which are a small sidekick. You get different challenges where you need to kill enemies within a certain time of do other things.\nOne of the facts that every LoS1 players will love is the camera which you can move completely freely.\n\nWhat else can I add. The bossfights are still really good and the finishing moves are still epic as ♥♥♥♥, the enemys use undodgeable moves more often which makes the fights a bit harder while the overall gameplay didn't change that much from LoS1.\n\nI will say it this way: If you liked the 1st LoS and enjoyed it you will like the 1nd one aswell. Give it some time and don't drop it after an hour like me. Play it and see how well it develops.\n\nMy rating: 8 /10","May 21, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You slash. You're obviously very, very insane, but that's okay; being a rather old recently re-awakened vampire lord apparently does that. People complain that it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, but not having played the predecessor I can say this game is fine.\nThe stealth sections are very annoying, as most would say. Quite disposable, and shouldn't have been part of the game. More focus on puzzles would have been appreciated, instead.\nAnother big complaint is the city over the castle... the apocalyptic castle/moderncity is rather unique, and imho, still beautiful. At some parts it feels a little like the modern parts of the city desecrate the castle, but I think that's intentional, too.\n\nCOMPLAINTS:\n\nYou cannot play this without a controller. None of the keys are coreographed properly for quicktime, skill use or anything else (X, Y, A, B on EVERYTHING) You can re-map the keys and go through it (mostly) fine... with one, notable and game-shattering problem: navigating the skills menu.

A 58 out of 100 seems awfully low for a game that plays so well, that I'm baffled by the hatred it gets from critics. Or, perhaps, the way Metacritic aggregates review scores is the problem? A single negative review can make that score right there plummet and provide extreme misinformation on an otherwise great game!\n\nLords of Shadow 2 does a few things quite well. First, it removes the stupid locked camera. Second, it has easy to learn combos that the game outright encourages you to use via the "mastery" system. Third, it has far more gothic scenery and themes that pay a deep homage to Castlevania in general. Fourth, the graphics are absolutely beautiful yet they run at 60 frames per second. Fifth, the bosses are incredible. Sixth, there's a ton of secrets and for the most part you are encouraged to explore at your leisure between objectives. Those are the six key aspects I can think of, besides the music, voiceacting, and controls being stellar as well. The story can be confusing, but it's the most tragic tale of Dracula I've ever seen in my life, and that is awesome in itself! Have you ever found yourself rooting for Dracula in all of the Castlevania games? Well, you WILL in this game!\n\nThe most criticized aspect of this game is that it "doesnt know what it wants to be", on critic reviews. I'm sorry, but there is such a thing as "gameplay variety". Consistency is nice, but this game isn't trying to be 100% like God of War, and offers decent stealth segments which aren't awful. Some of these segments are even a little clever, but they could be better. In fact, the game IS consistent for the most part, offering lots of platforming, action, exploration, secrets, and grand vistas. So why is that the worst part of the game? Is it really too linear? Does it really change too often too fast with the gameplay? Is it not trying hard enough to be Metroidvania style? These questions don't matter. The classic Castlevania games were by far more linear than this game, except the often criticized Simon's Quest entry. There are things wrong with Lords of Shadow 2 as well, but does it really warrant a FIFTY EIGHT OUT OF ONE HUNDRED Metascore?!\n\nSo, I highly reccomend this game. I like it much more than Lords of Shadow, in fact!","January 12, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The early reviews for the game made it sound like it was terrible, but it really wasn't that bad. However, that's not to say it isn't without its flaws.\n\nThe highlight of the game is probably its combat. You get three different weapons this time around instead of just magical powerups for the whip like in the original LOS: A light magic sword, dark magic gauntlets, and the whip returns as the default weapon. Each has their own style and role in combat; the sword can heal you when you do damage, the gauntlets do more damage than the other two overall and can also break enemy blocking, and the whip has good crowd control skills and has more range overall. Each weapon also has a fleshed out skill/move set tree that you can unlock with experience points. Gabriel controls more or less the same as he did in LOS with a couple tweaks, like a free moving camera.\n\nFor the overall main plot the game is shorter than the original Lords of Shadow, but it has much more in the way of secret items and challenge modes. The game is also much less linear than the original, with a semi-open world map that you can freely roam when not in a specific mission. The voice work is high quality, with much of the cast of the original returning (Patrick Stewart FTW) along with some new cast members who give a great performance as well. The game itself also looks great with very detailed and unique locals, characters, and monsters.\n\nThe biggest let down of the game is probably the forced stealth sections. They slow down what is normally a relatively fast paced game to a crawl, and don't work out well with how the game controls. They also don't really make sense in the context of the game, you are supposed to be this powerful being and yet these power armored lackeys can utterly destroy you if they see you. Thankfully there aren't many of these sections, and the rest of the game definitely makes up for it.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is pretty good and is definitely worthwhile if you've played the other Lords of Shadow games.","January 25, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ending sucks. I won't spoil anything, but I must say it was quite a let down. Many unresolved questions and an unsatisfying end both in story and boss fight. It was easier than the first acolyte.\nLooking at this game from a completed perspective, even before my edit, I can say that this game had a lot of potential and good ideas, but from what I've read had a botched development. It shows because a lot of the game feels incomplete or like the developers rushed to finish what was left after some development troubles. It's really a shame and very disappointing.*\n\nI played the first Lords of Shadow and I enjoyed it. As for this one, I would say it's better in some areas and worse in others.\n\nCOMBAT: Compared to the first, it feels like they really smoothed out the combat in terms of how you move around and perform moves. some difficulties become clearer when it comes to one mechanic though: the way some enemies block in this game. When some enemies are blocking, they stop your combo and deflect your attack and zero damage is done. This can get really annoying when there are multiple enemies and you are attacking one that is open, but the one right next to the first is blocking. it will stop your combo. This makes engagements with multiple blocking enemies really annoying unless you are really good with your chaos energy (it's like the shadow energy from the first game and it breaks through shield and armor). Multiple skeletons are the most annoying thing in this game... That said, thankfully those kinds of enemies don't show up terribly often, and combat can still be very fun now that it's smoothed out.\n\nSTORY: Sadly, I would have to say the story in this game is inferior to the first overall. There is no longer an opening narration to each stage like their was in the first because of the way they made the map somewhat open world (I'll get into that further down). There are also seems to be less moments of significant plot progression throughout the game; a lot of times it feels as if you go a great distance just to get a small snippet of story. That said, one of the things that brought me back toward liking the game more were the story moments (they pick up more once you get a bit further) when you see the way Gabriel changes based on his interaction with the other characters. Some of them were very moving. Still, overall there just doesn't seem to be as much story as there was in the first game, and for Patrick Stewart in particular, it almost seems like a waste of his talent.\n\nVISUALS: For the most part, I'm going to say that this game's visuals are gorgeous. Very pretty and detailed environments. Not a lot of more vibrant environments like the first game, but they are still very detailed and pretty, especially when the game's graphics are turned up. However, i did say "for the most part" because some of the more industrial areas that you explore in the game, particularly the areas with a lot of pipes and wires going along the walls and cielings, are very dull and start to feel repetitive really quickly.\n\nMAP SYSTEM: I think they had a good idea when they started this game to give it a more open world feel, but ultimately the traveling around the map gets very tedious, especially when you are backtracking to find all the hidden upgrades, and again in the more industrial areas, it becomes easy to get lost and start traveling in circles when you are looking for certain areas.\n\nOVERALL I would say Lords of Shadow 2 is a decent game that you will enjoy for its beauty and decent combat system if you have the patience for the map and sometimes tedious battles with annoying enemies, but I would buy it when the price lowers. Also, if you have a choice, play the first Lords of Shadow before you play the second, it will make your experience with the second. The story will of course make more sense and be more enjoyable.","June 20, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They somehow managed to copy the original wholesale while making it worse in every way. - The combat is less engaging. Enemies are dumber and easier. There are less moves for the whip. The 2 new weapons are just re-skins of Light and Dark magic, and feel clunky, slow, and lack impact - the only weapon that 'feels' good is the whip (since it's ripped entirely from the first one)\n\n- There are no "puzzles" worth mentioning - I recall at least a few of the puzzles in the first game taking me a few minutes to work out. That is entirely missing from this game.\n\n- It's much shorter.

I really looked forward to the progression of the story from Lords of Shawdow 1.  I felt a little disappointed with the story since the previous game and its DLC made it seem that much action was going happen.\nThat being said I still enjoyed most of the game, specifically its fighting mechanics, bosses and challenges.\n\nCons: (not trying to spoil so it will seem vague)\n1. The developers made some odd decisions with the overall features/design of the game, some levels had these sections that required special abilities to get through them which to broke the pace of the game. There were also too many climbing sections.\n2. You're Dracula, and while he is weak the developers could have taken a more creative route with the abilities.\n3. The direction of the Story could have been better, The plot development left for so much to be desired.\n\nPros:\n1. FIghting Mechanics were awesome. The leveling of weapons and powers were balenced.\n2. Challenges were a great addition, they were fun and just right in difficulty.\n3. The new items and some of the abilities were interesting.\n\nI recommend the game if you completed Lords of Shadow 1, if you get it at a reasonable discount.","September 23, 2014","true","59.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As said the story is fairly interesting. You play as Dracula on a mission to destroy Satan in order to stop a demonic invasion and finally be able to rest in peace. The voice acting was absoluely fantastic and the characters were completly believable and not at all flat. There was nothing weak with the characters.The Graphics and animation are also superb and the player is presented with stunning visuals all around, especially with the scenery which presents a gorgeous display of gothic architecture and other surroundings which will leave the player feeling fully immersed. Combat was intersting in that you could not simply just plow through a horde, but actually have to take the time to defeat them. I was playing on easy and defeating casual enemies was even then not just a simple task. Every enemy took time to kill. Quite a few boss battles took place and every boss was also an interesting character, who took time to defeat. Though I didn't find too much of a strategy nessessary, they still took time to defeat and it was enjoyable. The game is quite long and I feel that there were some parts the developers should have left out and even some parts I found completly unnessessary. For instance, there is at least two occasions where you are practiacally playing hide and seek, which I didn't feel was really nessessary or even enjoyable. Aside from this I feel it is a very well developed game. While I do not feel is is a classic, it was undeniably an enjoyable expirence that I can highly reccomend to anyone looking for strong characters, good story, and outstanding visuals.","August 14, 2014","true","30.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So this review will be focused in comparing the two games (I played the first on X360)\n\nI will say that, only in my first 2 hours of gameplay, i felt comfortable to rely on the lore for my so expected ending of the story. And i need to point out that this is a great game, regardless of comparations with the first. Also, a lot of these reviews say negative stuff about the stealth moments, but i think it's good and important because you have to acompany the story, if Gabriel lost most of his power, how would he go against a creature of Satan? It's very important to the lore. And i cannot agree to you being a fan of the saga if you don't pay attention to the story. I feel like these moments show me that like in the first game, i had to become strong. Playing all the game with ultimate Dracula powers would be tiring, and most likely ruin the experience.\n\nAs to graphics, my system is not the best, but what i've seen in my game and videos, it doesn't leave a lot to be wished.\n\nI really enjoyed the new mechanics of gameplay, especially Gabriel's (sorry, can't call him Dracula :////) new powers. this really feels like to play the first game, but much more complete than that. Something i dislike strongly is the new combat rythim, i can't get to use special attacks, because i'm 95% busy finding enough time to do so. Also, there are some times when you truly don't know what to do, and you have to perform some action too quickly. I found this very troublesome in some parts.\n\nAnd the camera, oh, the camera. That's something MUCH better than in the first game, when the camera was placed in map-specific locations, and also had the problem of having to stop to ajust your controls, since they were kept on camera changes (40% of camera changes). Now, it's something much more subtle, the camera is controlled by the player, and stays in a 2nd/3rd person view which receives some influence in a few map areas (but nothing that forces the camera on a spot or a too strong change. It feels better because now it gives me the immersion of exploring the world. And of course, this is better because now i feel rewarded for looking for a nice view and finding an amazing view. It's very balanced.\n\nI do recommend this game to everyone, best buy, worth all the money (altough i got it on a discount).\n\nPlease feel free to add me or comment on my profile with any disagreements or suggestions to this review.\n\nI wished to give it 10/10, but the gameplay has a few artifacts in my point of view.\n\n8.5/10","September 13, 2014","true","53.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It absolutely lived up to all of my expectations, including the DLC.  It ended, for the most part, exactly how I would have wanted.  It is sad that Mercury Steam will most likely never work with the Lords of Shadow series again, but the story is at least complete and was well done from start to finish.  What more could a fan of great story-telling ask for?\n\nIt does have some problems here and there, but if you are interested in it due to being a Lords of Shadow fan then your money will be well spent, since you are most likely here for the series' most accomplished attribute, it's lovingly crafted tale.  Otherwise, I suggest doing some more research on it, or maybe even trying the first two games (Don't forget Mirror of Fate) to see if the story grabs you.\n\nEither way, my final opinion on this game is that it is a finely polished piece of software that has phenomenal storytelling and an extremely well implemented combat system.  It suffers slightly from some odd gameplay design choices here and there that might be a bit off-putting to some, but this game did not get the attention, nor respect, that it truly deserved.  Hopefully, Mercury Steam will craft something in the future that is not so much the "diamond in the rough" that this game, and it's predecessors, ended up being.  Maybe something with a bit more mainstream appeal, i suppose?  I hope only the best for their future after having finished the Lords of Shadow series and am tentatively awaiting news of their next project.","July 1, 2014","true","38.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was surprised how much I enjoyed the first game (buying it on 360 and PC), so I was just stoked to have a fully-blown sequel to it. It plays well, combat feels solid, and some of the fights are challenging, and I can think of only one part of the game where I almost ALMOST gave up, which was Agreas' maze, but I can forgive it because overall this is probably the best £30  I've spent on a game since... the first game.

I loved the first game.  I felt they did a great job rebooting the series and breathing new life into it.  While I loved the old games story wise they sucked.  Even lament of innocence which was great and tried its best to explain the belmont & dracula feud still lacked a little bit.  Now Lord of Shadow did a great job of really giving that belmont dracula feud a purpose and reason.  This game picks up right from the first game and really starts to breath life into dracula and with great story telling elements and voice acting really connects the players to dracula and kinda makes us question is her really that bad.  Maybe he has a good reason for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nPeople will pick apart the game play and the stealth mode.  I didn't enjoy the stealth mode but I did enjoy the combat system and loved using his new powers.  I loved the leveling up of the weapons and skills.  The items you pick up on the way I felt were just wasted I never used anyone of them expect of the health potion.\n\nThe environment was good.  I enjoyed my time in the Castle but didn't care for the modern world.\n\nThe important question is should I buy this game?  I think so but not at the full price.  The reason why is because of the ending.  The game really built things up with scenes of Dracula kinda coming back into the light and forgiving himself and redeeming himself in his own eyes.  This was great and really connected me to him even more.  The ending just kinda flopped there like a fish out of water.  It didn't wrap anything up or raise any question of whats next like the last game.  It was disappointing.  The fight with satan wasn't as tough as it was in the first one.  I kept thinking to myself he got beat the last time hit the gym and came back buff, but his old cross fitter body was better.  They need to give this game a proper ending if this really is the final game.  If they don't then all of that great work to just end on a bad note.\n\n\nSo final thought great story, but buy at half price due to the lack of a ending.","March 7, 2014","true","70.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't exit the game whenever you want. You can't start the game from the beginning once you started... this is annoying especially when you want to showcase the game to someone else or when you just choose to enjoy the beginning one more time. The save file is stored in various places (at least the PC version) and so far I have deleted all save games from the two places I found to no avail... the game still remembers where I left off and this is VERY ANNOYING! I still haven't found how to delete my progress and start from the beginning. If you die, you can't exit the game, you're forced to either start from the last checkpoint or re-start the level... Yes, the creators of this game made some really bad decisions...\n- The story is weird and if you expect to see skeletons, crypts and all sorts of you would expect from "Castlevania", you'll be very dissapointed. This game starts out right, but from the second level on you revive many years later in an already advanced Transylvania, with cars, cities, technology, etc. REALLY???? This is definitely not a game in the series for a Castelvania fan in my opinion.\n- I won't keep writing the rest of the negative things I've found on this game because it would take me too long and I have more important things to do right now. If you like Castlevania, replay the old games instead, this game totally blew it off.","October 2, 2014","false","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was loaded with recycled content including characters that shouldn't have been there - and game mechanics that were random and only served to draw the game out.\n\nThe load screens were my favorite where Gabriel/Dracula stared thoughtfully into some candlelight while his inner dialogue summed up the most immediate objective. Soft, introspective piano music would play in the background. Then you the accept button and a slashing sound was followed by Gabriel glaring suddenly into the camera... It was over-the-top.\n\nThe return of his wife Marie was a surprise and a happy one but they failed to tie her presence in to the over-arching arch.

I really looked forward to the progression of the story from Lords of Shawdow 1.  I felt a little disappointed with the story since the previous game and its DLC made it seem that much action was going happen.\nThat being said I still enjoyed most of the game, specifically its fighting mechanics, bosses and challenges.\n\nCons: (not trying to spoil so it will seem vague)\n1. The developers made some odd decisions with the overall features/design of the game, some levels had these sections that required special abilities to get through them which to broke the pace of the game. There were also too many climbing sections.\n2. You're Dracula, and while he is weak the developers could have taken a more creative route with the abilities.\n3. The direction of the Story could have been better, The plot development left for so much to be desired.\n\nPros:\n1. FIghting Mechanics were awesome. The leveling of weapons and powers were balenced.\n2. Challenges were a great addition, they were fun and just right in difficulty.\n3. The new items and some of the abilities were interesting.\n\nI recommend the game if you completed Lords of Shadow 1, if you get it at a reasonable discount.","September 23, 2014","true","59.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In answer to the first question, my answer would be, for the most part, yes it is. The reason why I say for the most part is because while I think that los2 is a genuinely good game, I feel that it falls just short of matching the greatness of the orginal. The main reason why I think this is, is because los2 is a game of two halves.\n\nOn the one half you have the exploration of draculas castle, which to say the least is huge and the medieval gothic  architecture as well as the unique characters and enemies that inhabit the prince of darkness's home. For me, this is where the game truly shines as it is this part of the game that seems to embody both the aesthetics and quality of the first game.\n\nThe other half of this game involves navigating through a modern day setting, which I'm afraid to say is where this game falters. The main reason for this is because while the modern envioments are competently enough designed from a gameplay perspective, they lack any kind of personality and uniqueness of their own to make them memorable or even particularly interesting enough to warrent further exploration beyond the main game. Indeed, aside from the boss battles that take place in these locations and the stealth sections (The latter of which I actually quite enjoyed, contrary to popular opinion!) I found most of my time spent in the modern setting to be fairly forgettable,  especially when compared to the parts that take place in Draculas castle, and ultimately hold the game back from being truly on par with the first game.\n\nIn answer to the second question as to whether the game is worth buying, my answer would be that if you enjoyed the original los then I defiantly believe that this game is worth buying. If you've never played the original but like God Of War style hack and slah games then I would also recomend this title as being a worthy purchase. In short, I would say that if you liked the original los then the odds are that you'll probably like this game as well. In conclusion, If I had to give the first game a score out of ten, then I would probably give it an 8. With this game, I feel that a 7 would be more appropriate.","March 8, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which blended God of War/Devil May Cry style gameplay with the original Castlevania actiony dark fantasy romp through monster land. I won't give away the ending to that game as some jerks do in even mentioning this game, but you probably already know. If you have not played Lord of Shadows, playing it first is an absolute necessity, and it's also a superior game to this one in my opinion.\nThat said, in my opinion, contrary to the many reviews that are probably due to people not getting paid enough to give the usual IGN "9.5/10 it's ok" kind of review, I found this game a great experience, for many many reasons, since I always like to leave the reader with a positive taste in their mouth if I reccomend this game, (which I do), Then I'll start with the things this game gets wrong once I briefly summarize what it's about.\n\nLord of Shadows 2 has you playing as a newly awakened Dracula after a brief and extremely handholdy tutorial (which will be especially tedious if you played the tutorial), Where he defends his castle from the Forces of The Brotherhood of light. These events take place after Lord of Shadows, and Mirror of Fate (which still needs a port, get on it Konami) And you can read the rest of this in the game summary above on the steam page.\nThe gameplay is a blend of the 3D actiony combat and beat em up that Devil May Cry and God of War pioneered and refined also seen in Lord of Shadows, it is similar enough to that game that it doesnt feel brand brand new, but still new enough to not feel rehashy. It also features platforming and Uncharted and God of War brand climbing sections. And some stealth sections. You explore Dracula's castle, both in the quasi-otherdimensional quasi-memory quasi-past, and the modern day city Castlevania which was built over the ruins of Dracula's castle and it's quite cool how they overlap.\n\nNow, lets get to the negative bits. The stealth in this game is awful and unnessecary, There was a way this could've been done, which would involve Dracula stalking his prey and feeding, but the mighty Prince of Darkness running away from rejects in red from Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 on steroids as rats was just ugh. But this can be forgiven as it is mostly just puzzles. The worst one is a particularly aggravating section of stealth against a giant monster satyr that you fight immediately afterward, and is a *COMPLETE* Pushover. It's ridiculous how easy it is to beat this guy after you were cowering in fear in the most difficult stealth section of the game.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is how utterly uninspired and generic the soundtrack is. It's beautifully written and scored but it's utterly forgettable and generic. there is maybe one, possibly two pieces on the whole soundtrack I remember at all, and they were variations on something from the previous game. This is forgivable for most games, But not Castlevania a series which has always had an extremely memorable soundtrack.\n\nAnother odd thing is how arbitrary the things you can climb on and things you cant seem to be, giving a linearity that's even more irritating, but It's a standard of the genre so it is not so bothersome. I dislike how few platforming sections there are, honest platforming and it lacks puzzles compared to the first one.\n\nAnd one last flaw I noticed, was how much I hate enemies that require a certain power to defeat, though thankfully those enemies are either rare or this can be gotten around by clever gameplay. In addition, nto enough moves interrupt enemies for long enough making it too easy to be overwhelmed in situations you shouldn't be, and there simply isnt a large enough variety of enemies compared to the first game.\n\nNow onto the positives.\nThe Art Direction of this game and it's implementation is breathtakig, it's simply magnificent. And is definately the strongest points  of it. The animation is fantastic, the atmosphere is gorgeous and captures castlevania to a T, while reminding me of Devil May Cry, and Vampire: The Masquerade, this all creates a neo-gothic feel that perfectly suits this game.\n\nThe Combat is very good, and very polished. A skilled player can defeat most enemies completely untouched while keeping an very strong level of  challenge. the only drawback of the combat is the lack of stunlocks hits on groups of enemies causes far too much interruption, but this can be argued adds to the challenge, and I am a bit inclined to agree. The game feel is a bit light, but otherwise the sound of the fighting. I particularly like how it is a better Devil May Cry than the latest DMC game, and still retains all of the castlevania feel.\n\nThe Characters are all excellent, and the story is beautifully told, and has much pathos even if it's a touch predictable. All in all, it fits together in a really excellent way and creates an atmospheric, fun, rich experience, if a touch too short. It starts with a whimper and ends with a bang. Many great boss fights and difficult enemies, and no shortage of action.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, Castlevania Lord of Shadows 2 deserves is an excellently designed and executed game with a haunting and engaging story, a rich atmosphere, a fairly deep and well done combat system and plenty of gameplay and is well worth the money.\nVisuals 9/10- Excellent art design and execution, well done animations, Rich, beautiful enviroments and atmosphere.\nSound 7/10- forgettable if well done soundtrack holds back what otherwise is an excellently voiced experience with quality foley .\nGameplay 7/10- Lack of enemy variety, with some flaws to an excellent combat system as well as lack of platforming, combined with not enough puzzles for my liking hold back slightly what is an extremely fun experience, the tedious stealth sections at times could've been an improvement were they better executed and designed but otherwise it is another black mark lowering it's score\nStory 9/10- Excellently written, solid concept and unique spin on the castlevania formula, it is at times quite predictable, but it is so well executed it makes up for it, it is truly heart-warming, wrenching and breaking at times. With truly unforgettable moments, there is better stories out there, but not all that many\nOverall= Solid 8/10\n\n","March 8, 2014","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was really excited the moment they shown the first trailer for the sequal over two years ago that I was highly anticipating this next installment.  When the reviews started coming out for the sequal I was upset what they were saying when I had high hopes for this game.  The negative comments seem to over embelish the quality of the game that it would get a D minus rating over issues such as the stealth portion, a shallow ending, and boring environments.  After playing this game I thought whoever was playing this game seem to be as bad as the critics, reviewing movies in that they are blind to what is an actual great movie when the majority movie going public seems to love the movie.  This game my fellow gamers is a great quality game.  Gone the fixed camera angels, you now have a free camera you can manipulate around the character to get a better view of Dracula and his environment.  The environment is breathtaking, The amount of work and detail that went into Dracula's castle and Castlevania City makes you take a moment to study the detail and architecture. The environment also reminds me they were trying a Castlevania SOTN where the city and castle are connected to each other. The gameplay is very smooth especially the combat portion. Gone are the Combat Cross, light and shadow magic systems in place are the Shadow Whip, Void Sword, and Chaos Claws.  My favorite weapon is Chaos Claws simply because it reminds me of using Hercules Gauntlets in God of War.  But interchanging between weapons is a fluid motion you can make awesome combos.  If I had to make any complaints about this game is the story.  It didn't feel fulfilling (ie character development)  especially the end.    I was disappointed with the last boss Satan. It would have been nice to fight him head on vice using (SPOILER ALERT) someone close to Dracula. Also I wish the ending had an epilogue like the first one. It sort of left a question mark on Dracula's fate.  Like I said the grips that people had of this game is minor.  The stealth system was interesting idea but in some place poorly executed. Like when Dracula is already powerful why does he need to avoid Satan's Elite Armored brutes? Some of the stealth puzzles can prove irritating for some people have to start over and over again namely sneaking past Pan's brother.  But after observing other players in how they pass him it became quite easy and a little scarey lol.  This is great game which I highly recommend if your fan of this genre or God Of War type games.  Additionally I am re-playing this game again. This is one of those games I hope they make a movie out of this game use this plot for the story.","March 28, 2014","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In comparison to LoS1 where levels are abundant and the scenery constantly changing as you progress, LoS2 seems to rehash the same areas, in a similar fashion to that of Dragon Age 2.  You spend more time running through the same areas and just gives off a feeling of redundancy throughout the course of the game.  Sure, the areas are pretty huge, but when you need to run through the same areas repeatedly to progress it's more of an annoyance than anything.\n\nGroups of enemies seem to perfectly chain their "undodgeable" attacks to seemingly no end.  I'm up for a challenge, but when you're surrounded by a whole group of enemies it's extremtly annoying to constantly be chained from special to special.  Then again, I suppose that's how the NPCs feel so bit of karma I suppose.\n\nThe stealth sections truly are a bit annoying.  I understand that they're trying to incorporate a bit more than your run of the mill hack and slash, but there aren't multiple ways to approach them or to resolve them.  Not to mention that if you're spotted, you can pretty much expect to just restart from checkpoint; rarely is there a chance to regroup without taking massive damage.\n\nOn to the good, as this overall is a recommendation for the game.  Overall, I have to say that I did quite enjoy the storyline, and being able to play as Alucard really gave me some flashbacks to some of the greatest games in the canon.  [Spoilers] The surprise appearance of another Belmont was quite good as well!\n\nThe combat system, while much has been leveraged from the first game I quite enjoyed, even if it was a bit repetitive.  There seems to be quite a large focus on countering in this game as opposed to its predecessor, which I don't mind personally.  The new abilities are quite interesting as well, and the upgrade/mastery system keeps you trying to use new attacks against the same enemies you encounter.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't agree with the Metascore rating as it does seem a bit low.  Sequels are always tough and when you have a title as solid as LoS1, it's hard to not play second fiddle.  Anyone who is a fan of the series I would think would like the game, and overall it's a good playthrough with the added Kleidos challenges.","September 1, 2014","true","93.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037516396/recommended/239250/","76561198037516396","Camelslayer","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037516396/","282 products in account","This game is kind of a mixed bag with me, so I'll just list the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n+Gameplay\nThe gameplay is quite a bit improved from the first game; camera is no longer locked, climbing is easier, items are actually useful this time, and there's items dedicated to helping you uncover secrets. I'm also quite fond of the openness, allowing you to go back at virtually any time to explore, collect items, etc.\n\n+Graphics\nVisually, the game is beautiful, and there's plenty of areas in the game that are simply stunning. Found myself taking in the view more than once.\n\n+Combat\nThe mastery system rewards using different skills to enhance your weapons' power. Each of Dracula's weapons have their own specific use, similar to the first game, but are more than just enchanting your whip with magic this time around, giving you entirely different movesets for each weapon. Also you get to drink your enemies' blood.\n\n+Music\nThe music of the first game was good, but it lacked any sort of memorability. The music in Lords of Shadow 2 is much better, although you'll hear a lot of the same tracks over and over. Somewhat of a hit and miss here, but a majority of the music is good enough that this is more of a pro than a con.\n\n+Pacing\nThere was a lot of nothing in between the major events of the first game; the pacing was just kinda crap, in all honesty. There always seems to be something going on in LoS 2, it's easier to feel like you're actually doing something rather than roaming through some ruins without much of a goal, which was a major problem throughout the first third of the first game.\n\n+Gabriel is More Interesting\nI was completely incapable of feeling any sort of sympathy for Gabriel in the first game. He was a cardboard cutout of a character devoid of most emotion. In this one, however, he's a little more interesting simply because he is fairly PO'ed. Also he's the dark lord, he has a reputation to live up to. Thankfully, he does.\n\n+Environment\nAs previously mentioned in the Graphics, the game is beautiful. The environment is also essential for this as well; for the areas that they created, the world is detailed and interesting. Areas are distinguishable from other places, and the concept of building a city on the ruined foundations of Dracula's castle is, honestly, quite interesting. It creates a distinctive gothic-type city that still seems reminiscent of Dracula's castle pre-ruin when you have opportunities to overlook the city.\n\n+Lore\nWhile the story blows (more on that later), it does have some intriguing lore to find, some of which indicating that the people of Castlevania City are fully aware that monsters and magic are a thing. It's definitely a turn from the original Castlevania games and other games such as Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines where hiding the supernatural from the world was of the utmost importance. In Lords of Shadow 2, I find it intriguing that they accept, and are even fascinated by, the fact that there used to be werewolves, vampires, and even the siege against Dracula are merely documented as history and treated as such. Their history is as natural to them as our own is to us. This is certainly something I'd love to see expanded on in future games- maybe not Lords of Shadow, but other franchises where the supernatural is merely embraced as a part of history rather than hidden from the world for safety.\n\n\nCons\n-It's Not Castlevania\nYou can add the title, give the characters the names, and everything else, but it still doesn't make it a Castlevania game. Let alone it's horridly out of place with half of the game taking place in a modern day city. To be perfectly honest, it feels more like Darksiders than Castlevania due to the themes throughout the game. The heart and spirit of the series is completely absent from Lords of Shadow, hence I only ever refer to it as Lords of Shadow.\n\n-Story\nI find it ironic that they rebooted Castlevania with an intended focus on story, and then ended up dropping the ball. The first game had an okay, albeit not-very-original story with Satan having Necron Syndrome and popping up literally out of nowhere at the end. Mirror of Fate was an atrocity of a game and explained jack squat. Similar problems are in LoS 2- Gabriel often finds himself back in what appears to be either the past of his memories of his castle. Honestly have no idea because it's never explained at all. His memories/past/whatever-the-fudge-is-going-on also has zero relevance to what's going on, aside from getting back his powers because reasons. There's also some Resident Evil bullcrap going on where the citizens are mutated by some demonic virus; this is so out of place it hurts. Everything else is fairly easy to follow, and there's some interesting things that do happen throughout the game, but it's nothing to write home about. Story is honestly not a good reason to play this game, and if it's what you're looking for, turn the other way.\n\nGabriel forgot how to Open Doors\nFound a door? Guess what? You're going to have to pull a switch to open it. He's only a superhuman Prince of Darkness, godforbid he opens a metal door on his own. There's a lot of this crap that just slows the game down needlessly, especially since it takes forever for said doors to open. This game was made in 2014, this is rather inexcusable.\n\n-Enemies can be Annoying\nThere's a guard/perfect guard mechanic in the game, which is quite useful. Unfortunately, roughly 50% of the time, the enemies perform an unblockable attack, which renders guarding a lot less useful than you'd like it to be. Also there's plenty of times where I simply wanted to get somewhere and didn't want to fight. Going places often involve climbing. Guess what? Every freaking enemy in the game can use some kind of projectile to knock you down, often forcing you to fight enemies when you don't want to. This is often infuriating when you merely want to explore for upgrades and other hidden items.\n\n-Stealth Segments\nOkay, I get that he's weak and whatnot at the beginning, but this just seems so unnecessary. Especially since the stealth segment with Agreus is absolutely infuriating.\n\n-Bugs\nEvery now and then, characters may "say something" without sound- basically the sound file for the line they're supposed to say doesn't play (no subtitles either, which is even more aggravating). I've had other instances where the objective was the last objective I just did, and wasn't up to date. Worst of all, I've had it crash on me for no reason once.\n\n\nFinal VerdictWhile the story is laughable, the stealth is pointless, and bugs are afoot, the game is actually quite fun. I do not recommend it at full price; wait for a Steam sale to get it because $40 is a bit much for some of the frustrations of the game. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty good, despite the annoying gameplay oversights. Worth getting if you're interested in, or at least play the demo first to know if you'd like it.","September 13, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etc\n\nGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it.\n\nControls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to "auto aim" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack.\n\nCollectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game.\n\nOverall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS.\n\nI'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a "true" Castlevania Fan\n\n7/10","October 29, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't help but mention that because of the potential it had.  Art direction and presentation is grand.  Music is immersive.  The combat makes you feel in control at most times, save when your striking foes and they strike through your blows, and knock you down.\nThe biggest complaint I have with this game is the stealth portion and poorly designed platforming.  Both are irritating, boring, and distracts from the overall experience.  If the stealth portion were implemented better, with clearer directions on where to go, what to do, who to possess etc, things might have been different.  The platforming at times is ackward, and just feels again, like a distractor from combat.\nIn the end, I love the script, I love the art/graphical presentation, and I love the combat.

Game mechanics, movement and art style is very much the same. Very well executed, and especially the scenery of the game is nothing short of stunning!\n\nThe storyline, however, is a bit confusing to those who have not read up on what they are going into. The game is open-world, with some backtracking and exploration. Collectibles are hidden where you won't necessarily be able to get them first time around, which can be frustrating if you are not aware of what skills are necessery to get to them. Also, I had a hard time getting used to the fact that Dracula was running around in a modern world for a part of the game, and with the game happening one part in the modern day, and the other part in Draculas castle, the skips can be confusing.\n\nThe game however is quite fun, the dialogue is quite great, really moving moments that often surprised me in how much they made me care about the characters.

Many Arguments we’re made about stealth, and I agree with these statements also, but I look at them deeply as story relevant for example, the calm before a huge scene which many movies do before a big surprise. Speaking of surprises, Castlevania 2 will not disappoints you at all, look pass the negative reviews, because many of the steam users are swimming in our beloved Rust game by the genius Gary atm.

So this review will be focused in comparing the two games (I played the first on X360)\n\nI will say that, only in my first 2 hours of gameplay, i felt comfortable to rely on the lore for my so expected ending of the story. And i need to point out that this is a great game, regardless of comparations with the first. Also, a lot of these reviews say negative stuff about the stealth moments, but i think it's good and important because you have to acompany the story, if Gabriel lost most of his power, how would he go against a creature of Satan? It's very important to the lore. And i cannot agree to you being a fan of the saga if you don't pay attention to the story. I feel like these moments show me that like in the first game, i had to become strong. Playing all the game with ultimate Dracula powers would be tiring, and most likely ruin the experience.\n\nAs to graphics, my system is not the best, but what i've seen in my game and videos, it doesn't leave a lot to be wished.\n\nI really enjoyed the new mechanics of gameplay, especially Gabriel's (sorry, can't call him Dracula :////) new powers. this really feels like to play the first game, but much more complete than that. Something i dislike strongly is the new combat rythim, i can't get to use special attacks, because i'm 95% busy finding enough time to do so. Also, there are some times when you truly don't know what to do, and you have to perform some action too quickly. I found this very troublesome in some parts.\n\nAnd the camera, oh, the camera. That's something MUCH better than in the first game, when the camera was placed in map-specific locations, and also had the problem of having to stop to ajust your controls, since they were kept on camera changes (40% of camera changes). Now, it's something much more subtle, the camera is controlled by the player, and stays in a 2nd/3rd person view which receives some influence in a few map areas (but nothing that forces the camera on a spot or a too strong change. It feels better because now it gives me the immersion of exploring the world. And of course, this is better because now i feel rewarded for looking for a nice view and finding an amazing view.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WingedRider/recommended/239250/","WingedRider","Rider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WingedRider/","172 products in account","*Edit: When I first wrote the review, I was only almost done with the game, but now that I have seen it through to the end, I feel I have to amend a couple of my points, primarily with the story. The ending sucks. I won't spoil anything, but I must say it was quite a let down. Many unresolved questions and an unsatisfying end both in story and boss fight. It was easier than the first acolyte.\nLooking at this game from a completed perspective, even before my edit, I can say that this game had a lot of potential and good ideas, but from what I've read had a botched development. It shows because a lot of the game feels incomplete or like the developers rushed to finish what was left after some development troubles. It's really a shame and very disappointing.*\n\nI played the first Lords of Shadow and I enjoyed it. As for this one, I would say it's better in some areas and worse in others.\n\nCOMBAT: Compared to the first, it feels like they really smoothed out the combat in terms of how you move around and perform moves. some difficulties become clearer when it comes to one mechanic though: the way some enemies block in this game. When some enemies are blocking, they stop your combo and deflect your attack and zero damage is done. This can get really annoying when there are multiple enemies and you are attacking one that is open, but the one right next to the first is blocking. it will stop your combo. This makes engagements with multiple blocking enemies really annoying unless you are really good with your chaos energy (it's like the shadow energy from the first game and it breaks through shield and armor). Multiple skeletons are the most annoying thing in this game... That said, thankfully those kinds of enemies don't show up terribly often, and combat can still be very fun now that it's smoothed out.\n\nSTORY: Sadly, I would have to say the story in this game is inferior to the first overall. There is no longer an opening narration to each stage like their was in the first because of the way they made the map somewhat open world (I'll get into that further down). There are also seems to be less moments of significant plot progression throughout the game; a lot of times it feels as if you go a great distance just to get a small snippet of story. That said, one of the things that brought me back toward liking the game more were the story moments (they pick up more once you get a bit further) when you see the way Gabriel changes based on his interaction with the other characters. Some of them were very moving. Still, overall there just doesn't seem to be as much story as there was in the first game, and for Patrick Stewart in particular, it almost seems like a waste of his talent.\n\nVISUALS: For the most part, I'm going to say that this game's visuals are gorgeous. Very pretty and detailed environments. Not a lot of more vibrant environments like the first game, but they are still very detailed and pretty, especially when the game's graphics are turned up. However, i did say "for the most part" because some of the more industrial areas that you explore in the game, particularly the areas with a lot of pipes and wires going along the walls and cielings, are very dull and start to feel repetitive really quickly.\n\nMAP SYSTEM: I think they had a good idea when they started this game to give it a more open world feel, but ultimately the traveling around the map gets very tedious, especially when you are backtracking to find all the hidden upgrades, and again in the more industrial areas, it becomes easy to get lost and start traveling in circles when you are looking for certain areas.\n\nOVERALL I would say Lords of Shadow 2 is a decent game that you will enjoy for its beauty and decent combat system if you have the patience for the map and sometimes tedious battles with annoying enemies, but I would buy it when the price lowers. Also, if you have a choice, play the first Lords of Shadow before you play the second, it will make your experience with the second. The story will of course make more sense and be more enjoyable.","June 20, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They somehow managed to copy the original wholesale while making it worse in every way. - The combat is less engaging. Enemies are dumber and easier. There are less moves for the whip. The 2 new weapons are just re-skins of Light and Dark magic, and feel clunky, slow, and lack impact - the only weapon that 'feels' good is the whip (since it's ripped entirely from the first one)\n\n- There are no "puzzles" worth mentioning - I recall at least a few of the puzzles in the first game taking me a few minutes to work out. That is entirely missing from this game.\n\n- It's much shorter. One of the things that impressed me about the first one was the length - the game felt -HUGE-, which is refreshing for an action game.\n\n- Less boss fights, less interesting boss fights.\n\n- The level design is pitiful in comparison to the original.\n\n- The secrets are laughable. I remember scouring levels in the original for hours to find most of the health/light/dark gems. They're practically thrown at you in this game, often appearing in plain view.\n\n- Stealth sections - Poorly done stealth sections. Dracula hiding from goon troops.

While it had it moments, which for the most part came from the storyline, I was disappointed by the open world concept that was completely hyped by marketing.  Of course if you love mazes, I say go for it!  The game play was another upgrade, as far as controlling Gabriel Belmont is concerned.  The different powers that you pick up during the game add a fun challenge to break up the hack-and-slash that the first game depended too much on.  I think, unfortunately, that the developers listened to too many people while they were in the creative process, and it caused a bit of a mess.

If, on the other hand, you are a fan of the old series (e.g: Symphony of the Night) then you probably didn't liked the first game and you shouldn't bother with this one. The name "Castlevania" is the only common ground between the old series and the reboot.\n\nThe story isn't memorable, but it is decent and it does its job. Also, the Castlevania series wasn't necessary about story. What you have in Lords of Shadows 1 and 2 is great pretext for an action game.\n\nThe artistic direction is more dark now and this is understandable since Gabriel turned into the evil Dracula. I am not a fan of the modern setting and I prefer the castle sections which look terrific.\n\nThe stealth part of the game does seem weird but it's not game breaking as it was stated by the critics. Blame it on a poor game design decision that doesn't quite blend in with the setting.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and the nice feature, called mastery, encourages you to use all the moves from your arsenal. Successfully using a skill in combat increases its mastery. Once it reaches 100%, you can improve your weapon by transfering the mastery of the skill.\n\nA minimap has been added to help exploring and find secrets. The old life and magic gems are back in the form of pain boxes. You can still find more about the lore by reading the journals of the fallen soldiers of the Brotherhood.\n\nYou can and will return to previously visited areas.This is done better than the previous game, where you had to return to the map overview and select a completed level. Here you simply transition between areas. It's not sandbox, but there is a sense of continuity.\n\nTo sum it up, Lords of Shadow 2 is good action/combat game, with an excellent artistic direction, nice voice acting and a story that helps you move forward. It's not a classic but it never wanted to be one. Definitely this is not a terrible game as the game critics want you to believe for whatever reasons.","March 4, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, the combat's fun, not played many hack'n'slash games and this made me wonder why, it's incredibly satisfying pulling off that perfect combo right after a successful synchronized block. Only real criticism I have of the combat is that there's not much of an incentive to try the special moves. When a game's this simple to beat and the enemies aren't overly difficult, nothing really forces you to have to pull off the special attacks, and you find yourself halfway through wondering if you're really getting the full experience because of your lack of variation in how you play combat-wise. Can't really comment on the exploration, as I've really no idea what makes someone want to explore a game world, some open worlds make you want to explore - some don't. I have no idea if it's to do with art style or hidden secrets, but I definitely wanted to explore the castle and find every secret there was to find, found myself spending hours just exploring different areas. Graphics-wise, this game looks amazing - found myself pressing F12 way more than I probably should have been, and I've changed my desktop to different screenshots about 5 times since I bought this game. The gothic architecture of the castle really gives the developers a chance to pull off some of the most stunning scenes, last-gen ports have never looked so good. Although I've never played the first LoS, I kinda felt myself wondering how great this game would be if it had the same setting, medieval Europe. I really dreaded the modern day parts of the game, the city was boring - everything looked the same, spent most of it hoping I'd see another castle sequence soon. Voice acting was great, can't really go wrong with a cast like Richard Madden, Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart, although when voice actors so famous play roles you can't help but see them as the actor as opposed to the character, because you've heard their voice so many times before. Characterisation wasn't the best, I wanted to see a Dracula that didn't start tearing up everytime he was reminded of his past, and he didn't really develop much throughout the story. Not going to go too into depth about stealth, all I'm going to say is that it was terrible and I'm glad it wasn't more prominent in the game. Story-wise, this game's brilliant, sometimes when the combat became a bit too repetitive and I was stuck in the city knowing I wouldn't see another medieval-esque area for a while, I was just hoping another cutscene would occur. The whole father-son dynamic between Trevor and Gabriel was really well-written and enjoyable to listen to, and although I complained about him being too emotional, I really liked the parts that Gabriel's human side showed in the scenes with his family. Boss fights were one of my favourite parts of the game, it was different every time and it forced you to adapt to the situation as opposed to just hitting and dodging, only criticism is that the dialogue during the fights could be improved as I heard the same line over 50 times when fighting some bosses. Can't really think of any other elements of the game to comment on. Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth getting - not got much replayability but the first playthrough is worth the money. Despite its many drawbacks like stealth and poor setting - the art style, voice acting, combat and story do more than enough to make up for it.","March 5, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was expecting something more unique from a modern day Satanic laboratory (especially compared to Frankenstein's Lab or the Toymakers Workshop from the previous games) for instance.\n* Most time in the modern day is spent underground or in corridors, opposed to the more visually pleasing areas such as the Arts District.\n* The Stealth sections needed more variety to be interesting, or should have been limited to just a few segments. Though they still only take a few minutes to do. Too much of a big deal was made about one stealth segment in particular, only because people forgot about the handy Mist ability.\n* The ending is somewhat inconclusive and the final segment leading up to it lacks any real sense of build up.","March 5, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason why I have so many hours put into this is because I actually like walking around and beating stuff up; it's that fun to do it.\n\nMy other complaint (but rather a nitpick) was the difficulty. Even on the hardest I found the game is way too easy, but that's maybe because of my experience with these types of games. Others will say it's hard and I won't disagree with them.

I beat my first run on the second hardest difficulty (considered hardest until you beat it... semi-smart idea for a rerun) in about six hours, and that's with finding most of the collectables along the way. The reason why I have so many hours put into this is because I actually like walking around and beating stuff up; it's that fun to do it.\n\nMy other complaint (but rather a nitpick) was the difficulty. Even on the hardest I found the game is way too easy, but that's maybe because of my experience with these types of games. Others will say it's hard and I won't disagree with them. Some people can work with it while others can't.\n\nI enjoyed the story (Though how well it connected with the first game was pretty stale) but really wished that they put a lot more time into it for a full price game (that 6$ off because of pre-order did help slightly).

I certainly do not feel it deseved such low critic scores. Are there some issues, of course. But on the whole, I still had fun with it, and that's what it all boils down to. If you want some handy bullet points on the matter:\n\nPros:\n* Combat is very fluid, and there are a number of attacks and options at your disposal\n* The Boss battles are the real showstoppers in terms of granduer and excitement, and are the high points of the game, and each one of them is unique.\n* Platforming is also very fast and has definitely been streamlined from the original\n* The Castle setting is simply beautiful and really makes the player want to explore it\n* Game is super optimized and runs amazingly well on most machines. Played at 1080p with all settings maxed at a constant 60fps\n* The musical score is just so well put together and a treat to listen to, fitting the action on screen perfectly\n\nCons:\n* The game starts off slow after the prologue, focusing a lot on the modern day section\n* The modern day section is sadly lacking in terms of creativity and imagination. Was expecting something more unique from a modern day Satanic laboratory (especially compared to Frankenstein's Lab or the Toymakers Workshop from the previous games) for instance.\n* Most time in the modern day is spent underground or in corridors, opposed to the more visually pleasing areas such as the Arts District.\n* The Stealth sections needed more variety to be interesting, or should have been limited to just a few segments. Though they still only take a few minutes to do. Too much of a big deal was made about one stealth segment in particular, only because people forgot about the handy Mist ability.\n* The ending is somewhat inconclusive and the final segment leading up to it lacks any real sense of build up.","March 5, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also a very gorgeous game and is a fantastic PC port.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is a disappointment more than anything. The series had amazing potential after the underrated Lords of Shadow in 2010 but it's all been squandered here with head scratching design choices and plot that just plods along until it feels like pushing forward.

I played it, I played Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow, both the DS Castlevania games, and yes... I wish they'd go back to those... but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.\n\nThe voice acting is good, the combat is fun and engaging, the level design is interesting (especially the bits in Dracula's castle), and it has some of the most imaginative bosses I've seen (the Toymaker is a special favorite).\n\n... it just doesn't play like a Castlevania game.\n\nIts neat to play as Dracula, its neat to have to fight as a vampire and use vampiric powers, and damn if I didn't let out a laugh when I saw what happened to that Chupacabra ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the first game.\n\n... but it feels more like God of War.\n\nIts by no means a bad game! I had fun with it!

In answer to the first question, my answer would be, for the most part, yes it is. The reason why I say for the most part is because while I think that los2 is a genuinely good game, I feel that it falls just short of matching the greatness of the orginal. The main reason why I think this is, is because los2 is a game of two halves.\n\nOn the one half you have the exploration of draculas castle, which to say the least is huge and the medieval gothic  architecture as well as the unique characters and enemies that inhabit the prince of darkness's home. For me, this is where the game truly shines as it is this part of the game that seems to embody both the aesthetics and quality of the first game.\n\nThe other half of this game involves navigating through a modern day setting, which I'm afraid to say is where this game falters. The main reason for this is because while the modern envioments are competently enough designed from a gameplay perspective, they lack any kind of personality and uniqueness of their own to make them memorable or even particularly interesting enough to warrent further exploration beyond the main game. Indeed, aside from the boss battles that take place in these locations and the stealth sections (The latter of which I actually quite enjoyed, contrary to popular opinion!) I found most of my time spent in the modern setting to be fairly forgettable,  especially when compared to the parts that take place in Draculas castle, and ultimately hold the game back from being truly on par with the first game.\n\nIn answer to the second question as to whether the game is worth buying, my answer would be that if you enjoyed the original los then I defiantly believe that this game is worth buying. If you've never played the original but like God Of War style hack and slah games then I would also recomend this title as being a worthy purchase. In short, I would say that if you liked the original los then the odds are that you'll probably like this game as well. In conclusion, If I had to give the first game a score out of ten, then I would probably give it an 8. With this game, I feel that a 7 would be more appropriate.","March 8, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which blended God of War/Devil May Cry style gameplay with the original Castlevania actiony dark fantasy romp through monster land. I won't give away the ending to that game as some jerks do in even mentioning this game, but you probably already know. If you have not played Lord of Shadows, playing it first is an absolute necessity, and it's also a superior game to this one in my opinion.\nThat said, in my opinion, contrary to the many reviews that are probably due to people not getting paid enough to give the usual IGN "9.5/10 it's ok" kind of review, I found this game a great experience, for many many reasons, since I always like to leave the reader with a positive taste in their mouth if I reccomend this game, (which I do), Then I'll start with the things this game gets wrong once I briefly summarize what it's about.\n\nLord of Shadows 2 has you playing as a newly awakened Dracula after a brief and extremely handholdy tutorial (which will be especially tedious if you played the tutorial), Where he defends his castle from the Forces of The Brotherhood of light. These events take place after Lord of Shadows, and Mirror of Fate (which still needs a port, get on it Konami) And you can read the rest of this in the game summary above on the steam page.\nThe gameplay is a blend of the 3D actiony combat and beat em up that Devil May Cry and God of War pioneered and refined also seen in Lord of Shadows, it is similar enough to that game that it doesnt feel brand brand new, but still new enough to not feel rehashy. It also features platforming and Uncharted and God of War brand climbing sections. And some stealth sections. You explore Dracula's castle, both in the quasi-otherdimensional quasi-memory quasi-past, and the modern day city Castlevania which was built over the ruins of Dracula's castle and it's quite cool how they overlap.\n\nNow, lets get to the negative bits. The stealth in this game is awful and unnessecary, There was a way this could've been done, which would involve Dracula stalking his prey and feeding, but the mighty Prince of Darkness running away from rejects in red from Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 on steroids as rats was just ugh. But this can be forgiven as it is mostly just puzzles. The worst one is a particularly aggravating section of stealth against a giant monster satyr that you fight immediately afterward, and is a *COMPLETE* Pushover. It's ridiculous how easy it is to beat this guy after you were cowering in fear in the most difficult stealth section of the game.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is how utterly uninspired and generic the soundtrack is. It's beautifully written and scored but it's utterly forgettable and generic. there is maybe one, possibly two pieces on the whole soundtrack I remember at all, and they were variations on something from the previous game. This is forgivable for most games, But not Castlevania a series which has always had an extremely memorable soundtrack.\n\nAnother odd thing is how arbitrary the things you can climb on and things you cant seem to be, giving a linearity that's even more irritating, but It's a standard of the genre so it is not so bothersome. I dislike how few platforming sections there are, honest platforming and it lacks puzzles compared to the first one.\n\nAnd one last flaw I noticed, was how much I hate enemies that require a certain power to defeat, though thankfully those enemies are either rare or this can be gotten around by clever gameplay. In addition, nto enough moves interrupt enemies for long enough making it too easy to be overwhelmed in situations you shouldn't be, and there simply isnt a large enough variety of enemies compared to the first game.\n\nNow onto the positives.\nThe Art Direction of this game and it's implementation is breathtakig, it's simply magnificent. And is definately the strongest points  of it. The animation is fantastic, the atmosphere is gorgeous and captures castlevania to a T, while reminding me of Devil May Cry, and Vampire: The Masquerade, this all creates a neo-gothic feel that perfectly suits this game.\n\nThe Combat is very good, and very polished. A skilled player can defeat most enemies completely untouched while keeping an very strong level of  challenge. the only drawback of the combat is the lack of stunlocks hits on groups of enemies causes far too much interruption, but this can be argued adds to the challenge, and I am a bit inclined to agree. The game feel is a bit light, but otherwise the sound of the fighting. I particularly like how it is a better Devil May Cry than the latest DMC game, and still retains all of the castlevania feel.\n\nThe Characters are all excellent, and the story is beautifully told, and has much pathos even if it's a touch predictable. All in all, it fits together in a really excellent way and creates an atmospheric, fun, rich experience, if a touch too short. It starts with a whimper and ends with a bang. Many great boss fights and difficult enemies, and no shortage of action.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, Castlevania Lord of Shadows 2 deserves is an excellently designed and executed game with a haunting and engaging story, a rich atmosphere, a fairly deep and well done combat system and plenty of gameplay and is well worth the money.\nVisuals 9/10- Excellent art design and execution, well done animations, Rich, beautiful enviroments and atmosphere.\nSound 7/10- forgettable if well done soundtrack holds back what otherwise is an excellently voiced experience with quality foley .\nGameplay 7/10- Lack of enemy variety, with some flaws to an excellent combat system as well as lack of platforming, combined with not enough puzzles for my liking hold back slightly what is an extremely fun experience, the tedious stealth sections at times could've been an improvement were they better executed and designed but otherwise it is another black mark lowering it's score\nStory 9/10- Excellently written, solid concept and unique spin on the castlevania formula, it is at times quite predictable, but it is so well executed it makes up for it, it is truly heart-warming, wrenching and breaking at times. With truly unforgettable moments, there is better stories out there, but not all that many\nOverall= Solid 8/10\n\n","March 8, 2014","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it had it moments, which for the most part came from the storyline, I was disappointed by the open world concept that was completely hyped by marketing.  Of course if you love mazes, I say go for it!  The game play was another upgrade, as far as controlling Gabriel Belmont is concerned.  The different powers that you pick up during the game add a fun challenge to break up the hack-and-slash that the first game depended too much on.  I think, unfortunately, that the developers listened to too many people while they were in the creative process, and it caused a bit of a mess.

The leveling system for your weapons actually requires you to try out different combos in order to max out and get points to make the weapon stronger, which encourages trying new attack patterns and not using the same, one effective combo over and over again (*cough* God of War *cough*). The character models are very detailed and the voice acting is pretty spot on. Not to mention the level design is absolutely gorgeous when you're in the castle. The bosses have memorable designs and battles. And I loved the open world to explore that wasn't of the MetroidVania design.\n\nThe Bad: Despite the game throwing hordes of different looking enemies at you, they oddly enough don't feel too varied. The game constantly shifts back and forth betwen the modern city evironment and Dracula's castle, but it feels kinda hectic and you almost never do anything in the city; Kinda like they just didn't have much planned out for it. The story is actually pretty awful and does an almost complete nose dive in the last hour or so and ends with one of the weakest plot resolutions I think I've seen in a long time, even though everything up to that point in the writing feels pretty sturdy; Almost as if the writer just stopped caring when the game was almost finished. And the stealth sections are absolutely terrible. They're the kind where you only have ONE way to go about getting through each section and it never changes EVER. The game designed one specific enemy for you to encounter during this sections which kill you easily. This is explained by Zobek saying you're too weak to fight them. If you're familiar with old vampire lore, you know they can take different animal shapes, typically being of the night time variety (wolves, bats, etc.) but the game only lets you change into one animal, being rats. But both these points really fall through at the end when you're pretty much a full strength Dracula and you're still having to sneak past these things disguised as rats.\n\nI don't really know if I'd recomend this or not. I mean, I did enjoy the game for the most part. But if you're wanting to play this because you enjoyed the last one as I did and really wanted to see how things would end for Gabriel, all I can say is, without giving any spoilers, I couldn't have felt like I got a bigger slap in the face. But if you don't care about the story and want to play a beautiful game with some of the best hack and slash I've seen in a while, I say try.\n\nEDIT: I decided to give this game a recommendation because despite its flaws it was one of the better games of 2014. I suppose that's some merit","June 24, 2014","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, you might find this one annoying then.\n\nThe first major problem is that unlike the first game, this one is much shorter. You can beat it in about 6-8 hours. That's a decent run time, but then you realize there is nothing else. The game even feels like less is going on, even when a lot of stuff is happening. And not in a good way.\n\nThe story is this:\nGabriel Belmont is Dracula. He wants to die. Because being Dracula is really rough. Now it's the future, and he wakes up. Death shows up and tells Dracula that if they defeat Satan together, than Dracula can have a weapon that will give him eternal rest. Dracula agrees, and it's off to hunt down three of Satan's kids to save the world.\n\nSeems like a simple story, right? Well, it kinda isn't. Dracula ends up world hopping from time to time. This means he travels between two totally different world maps. A city, and a castle. The castle is a highly detailed and very pretty wonderland. It's well designed, tons of interesting enemies, and great atmosphere. The castle areas are the best enviornments in the game. Unfortunetly, the castle areas are also home to the worst bits of story. You mostly spend time running around, talking to characters from related to the lore. This also includes Dracula's dead wife and son, who ask you to preform fetch quests for them. At the end, you fight Dracula's inner evil, and the castle section is dead forever. No more use out that.\n\nThe city on the other hand is the worst. Everything is grey and looks alike. All the good will of the castle and it's varied enviornments is sucked away by the fact that Dracula can't jump over a fence. Running around the city area is difficult too, as the layout is poor and often trying to cram too much into too little space. I got lost a great number of times just trying to go back the way I came because they force you to take different routes all the time. The enemies are mutated humans who somehow manage to be able to block your strongest attacks by using a shotgun as a shield. The other enemies are humans in mech suits, which are easily amongst the most annoying since they fly outside your range and have high damage dealing guns. They even come equiped with shields to block the attacks that do land.\n\nBut the City part is where all the story happens. All the important, interesting, story details go on in the city. But the boss battles suffer even then. Boss fights in the city are single stage moments with more cutscene than combat, in comparison to the more interesting and BETTER boss fights found at the castle. Clearly there was a conflict during development.\n\nThe game seems split most of the time actually. It feels like there was a great deal of splits amongst the developers, as some stuff feels a lot less fleshed out. Especially since the ending is flat and awful. Nothing feels resolved, and I guess this was done so that you would still be able to free roam through the city and pick up the collectables you missed.\n\nAnd now, for something that some may be a bit confused by. But the game needed more Quick Time Events. OR at least a better allocation of those QTEs. Let me explain. The bosses are completely void of quick time events. But, there is still a quick time event to open a door. The QTEs for the bosses was deemed LESS important than the QTEs to open the door. It just seems odd to me. And in a way makes the ability to turn off QTEs utterly pointless since there aren't enough to justify the option.\n\nThe combat is better though. The gameplay has been improved. But oddly enough, the difficulty has raised quite a lot. But not in the good way. Instead of making the enemies more interesting to fight, they no longer stagger, have more health, and tend to swarm. Most have shields that require a three hit combo from your chaos guantlets. The chaos guantlets are really slow, have poor range, drain magic, and the enemies tend to dodge after the second hit, so the third hit rarely hits. And that's if you even manage to get a full combo off since the enemies attack so often you spend most of your time dodging instead of attacking. The game even brings in enemies later in the game who summon more enemies, and have unblockable attacks.\n\nThe game isn't bad. But is a sad sequel to the first Lords of Shadow.","March 8, 2014","false","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was really excited the moment they shown the first trailer for the sequal over two years ago that I was highly anticipating this next installment.  When the reviews started coming out for the sequal I was upset what they were saying when I had high hopes for this game.  The negative comments seem to over embelish the quality of the game that it would get a D minus rating over issues such as the stealth portion, a shallow ending, and boring environments.  After playing this game I thought whoever was playing this game seem to be as bad as the critics, reviewing movies in that they are blind to what is an actual great movie when the majority movie going public seems to love the movie.  This game my fellow gamers is a great quality game.  Gone the fixed camera angels, you now have a free camera you can manipulate around the character to get a better view of Dracula and his environment.  The environment is breathtaking, The amount of work and detail that went into Dracula's castle and Castlevania City makes you take a moment to study the detail and architecture. The environment also reminds me they were trying a Castlevania SOTN where the city and castle are connected to each other. The gameplay is very smooth especially the combat portion. Gone are the Combat Cross, light and shadow magic systems in place are the Shadow Whip, Void Sword, and Chaos Claws.  My favorite weapon is Chaos Claws simply because it reminds me of using Hercules Gauntlets in God of War.  But interchanging between weapons is a fluid motion you can make awesome combos.  If I had to make any complaints about this game is the story.  It didn't feel fulfilling (ie character development)  especially the end.    I was disappointed with the last boss Satan. It would have been nice to fight him head on vice using (SPOILER ALERT) someone close to Dracula. Also I wish the ending had an epilogue like the first one. It sort of left a question mark on Dracula's fate.  Like I said the grips that people had of this game is minor.  The stealth system was interesting idea but in some place poorly executed. Like when Dracula is already powerful why does he need to avoid Satan's Elite Armored brutes? Some of the stealth puzzles can prove irritating for some people have to start over and over again namely sneaking past Pan's brother.  But after observing other players in how they pass him it became quite easy and a little scarey lol.  This is great game which I highly recommend if your fan of this genre or God Of War type games.  Additionally I am re-playing this game again. This is one of those games I hope they make a movie out of this game use this plot for the story.","March 28, 2014","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some had good ideas marred by poor controls (N64 games) while others had tedious gameplay with excellent music and atmosphere (Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness).\n\nThen 2010 rolled around and Lords of Shadow came out.  Another 3D Castlevania that I had zero expectations for but still an almost forced obligation to try...and it blew me away.  Amazing graphics, gripping story, phenomenal soundtrack, varied enemy encounters, huge boss fights, and a simple on the surface but surprisingly deep combat system in the vein of God of War (this doesn't have to be an insult, people) gave a shockingly well rounded package that earned the game some high sales and critical praise the series hadn't seen in a long time.  It had its faults, namely a camera that couldn't be controlled and a somewhat slow beginning, but the series seemed to be headed in a positive direction.\n\nA few years later we got Mirror of Fate, a sort of in-betweener entry to bind the stories of LOS1 and LOS2.  It also marked a return to the side-scrolling roots with flashes of SOTN style gameplay.  The story was interesting but markedly less central compared to LOS.  Still, the gameplay was mostly interesting, a little different, and again had a wonderful score.\n\nWith the announcement of certain features like a seamless world and a controlled camera, LOS2 had a lot to live up to.  For the most part it delivers, though it definitely has its flaws.  Rather than continue on with the paragraphs at length, I'll make some easy to peruse pros and cons lists.\n\nPROS:\n-The story is still well told and interesting, voice actors all nail their roles (specifically Robert Carlyle and Jason Isaacs).\n-The soundtrack is still amazing.\n-Gameplay remains mostly unchanged, though there is less emphasis on puzzle solving.\n-Good length, around 15-20 hours depending on how much secret hunting you engage in.\n-Lots of neat references to classic entries.\n-Dracula's castle offers some cool, varied areas.\n-Weapon mastery/skill tree system rewards experimentation and discourages 'spamming.'\n\nCONS:\n-Seamless world exploration is hurt by an incredibly weak map system.  Opening the map in the menu only lets you see a very small portion of the area you are in, and you can't cycle between them.  There are also a scant number of teleportation rooms, making backtracking quite painful.\n-Difficulty seemed all over the place.  I found most bosses very easy and generally struggled more with the regular enemy encounters.\n-The modern city you explore has that Gothic Castlevania feel to it, but unfortunately most of the areas are hard to differentiate.\n-Ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic.\n\nAs for the now infamous 'stealth' sections, I can safely say they have been completely overblown in just about every review.  Yes, they are by no means a good part of the game.  However they are very simple and account for less than 45 minutes or so of game time.  Don't let that be what sways your heart on the game.\n\nAlthough it has a few questionable design choices, for the most part I can give a positive recommendation for LOS2.  Arguably one of the best facets of the series is that each game brings something different to the table.  LOS was about the closest we've gotten to a (fun) 3D classic Castlevania, Mirror of Fate was more along the lines of a 2D SOTN/Circle of the Moon type game, and LOS2 was an attempt to merge the two.  None of them are perfect, but the series hasn't been this interesting in over a decade.

I have a whip, a sword and punches? Sequels mustn't copy that.\n\nDespite the Cons I like this game for the short time it took me to finish it and I will rate it good.\n\nI would recomend it to people who like to check new games and Castlevania fans.","May 17, 2014","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If, on the other hand, you are a fan of the old series (e.g: Symphony of the Night) then you probably didn't liked the first game and you shouldn't bother with this one. The name "Castlevania" is the only common ground between the old series and the reboot.\n\nThe story isn't memorable, but it is decent and it does its job. Also, the Castlevania series wasn't necessary about story. What you have in Lords of Shadows 1 and 2 is great pretext for an action game.\n\nThe artistic direction is more dark now and this is understandable since Gabriel turned into the evil Dracula. I am not a fan of the modern setting and I prefer the castle sections which look terrific.\n\nThe stealth part of the game does seem weird but it's not game breaking as it was stated by the critics. Blame it on a poor game design decision that doesn't quite blend in with the setting.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and the nice feature, called mastery, encourages you to use all the moves from your arsenal. Successfully using a skill in combat increases its mastery. Once it reaches 100%, you can improve your weapon by transfering the mastery of the skill.\n\nA minimap has been added to help exploring and find secrets. The old life and magic gems are back in the form of pain boxes. You can still find more about the lore by reading the journals of the fallen soldiers of the Brotherhood.\n\nYou can and will return to previously visited areas.This is done better than the previous game, where you had to return to the map overview and select a completed level. Here you simply transition between areas. It's not sandbox, but there is a sense of continuity.\n\nTo sum it up, Lords of Shadow 2 is good action/combat game, with an excellent artistic direction, nice voice acting and a story that helps you move forward. It's not a classic but it never wanted to be one. Definitely this is not a terrible game as the game critics want you to believe for whatever reasons.","March 4, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, the combat's fun, not played many hack'n'slash games and this made me wonder why, it's incredibly satisfying pulling off that perfect combo right after a successful synchronized block. Only real criticism I have of the combat is that there's not much of an incentive to try the special moves. When a game's this simple to beat and the enemies aren't overly difficult, nothing really forces you to have to pull off the special attacks, and you find yourself halfway through wondering if you're really getting the full experience because of your lack of variation in how you play combat-wise. Can't really comment on the exploration, as I've really no idea what makes someone want to explore a game world, some open worlds make you want to explore - some don't. I have no idea if it's to do with art style or hidden secrets, but I definitely wanted to explore the castle and find every secret there was to find, found myself spending hours just exploring different areas. Graphics-wise, this game looks amazing - found myself pressing F12 way more than I probably should have been, and I've changed my desktop to different screenshots about 5 times since I bought this game. The gothic architecture of the castle really gives the developers a chance to pull off some of the most stunning scenes, last-gen ports have never looked so good. Although I've never played the first LoS, I kinda felt myself wondering how great this game would be if it had the same setting, medieval Europe. I really dreaded the modern day parts of the game, the city was boring - everything looked the same, spent most of it hoping I'd see another castle sequence soon. Voice acting was great, can't really go wrong with a cast like Richard Madden, Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart, although when voice actors so famous play roles you can't help but see them as the actor as opposed to the character, because you've heard their voice so many times before. Characterisation wasn't the best, I wanted to see a Dracula that didn't start tearing up everytime he was reminded of his past, and he didn't really develop much throughout the story. Not going to go too into depth about stealth, all I'm going to say is that it was terrible and I'm glad it wasn't more prominent in the game. Story-wise, this game's brilliant, sometimes when the combat became a bit too repetitive and I was stuck in the city knowing I wouldn't see another medieval-esque area for a while, I was just hoping another cutscene would occur. The whole father-son dynamic between Trevor and Gabriel was really well-written and enjoyable to listen to, and although I complained about him being too emotional, I really liked the parts that Gabriel's human side showed in the scenes with his family. Boss fights were one of my favourite parts of the game, it was different every time and it forced you to adapt to the situation as opposed to just hitting and dodging, only criticism is that the dialogue during the fights could be improved as I heard the same line over 50 times when fighting some bosses. Can't really think of any other elements of the game to comment on. Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth getting - not got much replayability but the first playthrough is worth the money. Despite its many drawbacks like stealth and poor setting - the art style, voice acting, combat and story do more than enough to make up for it.","March 5, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I certainly do not feel it deseved such low critic scores. Are there some issues, of course. But on the whole, I still had fun with it, and that's what it all boils down to. If you want some handy bullet points on the matter:\n\nPros:\n* Combat is very fluid, and there are a number of attacks and options at your disposal\n* The Boss battles are the real showstoppers in terms of granduer and excitement, and are the high points of the game, and each one of them is unique.\n* Platforming is also very fast and has definitely been streamlined from the original\n* The Castle setting is simply beautiful and really makes the player want to explore it\n* Game is super optimized and runs amazingly well on most machines. Played at 1080p with all settings maxed at a constant 60fps\n* The musical score is just so well put together and a treat to listen to, fitting the action on screen perfectly\n\nCons:\n* The game starts off slow after the prologue, focusing a lot on the modern day section\n* The modern day section is sadly lacking in terms of creativity and imagination. Was expecting something more unique from a modern day Satanic laboratory (especially compared to Frankenstein's Lab or the Toymakers Workshop from the previous games) for instance.\n* Most time in the modern day is spent underground or in corridors, opposed to the more visually pleasing areas such as the Arts District.\n* The Stealth sections needed more variety to be interesting, or should have been limited to just a few segments. Though they still only take a few minutes to do. Too much of a big deal was made about one stealth segment in particular, only because people forgot about the handy Mist ability.\n* The ending is somewhat inconclusive and the final segment leading up to it lacks any real sense of build up.","March 5, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was surprised how much I enjoyed the first game (buying it on 360 and PC), so I was just stoked to have a fully-blown sequel to it. It plays well, combat feels solid, and some of the fights are challenging, and I can think of only one part of the game where I almost ALMOST gave up, which was Agreas' maze, but I can forgive it because overall this is probably the best £30  I've spent on a game since... the first game. For me, I'm just in it for the story, and having played both its sequels, it feels nice and tight to the storyline it set out to tell.

I loved the first game.  I felt they did a great job rebooting the series and breathing new life into it.  While I loved the old games story wise they sucked.  Even lament of innocence which was great and tried its best to explain the belmont & dracula feud still lacked a little bit.  Now Lord of Shadow did a great job of really giving that belmont dracula feud a purpose and reason.  This game picks up right from the first game and really starts to breath life into dracula and with great story telling elements and voice acting really connects the players to dracula and kinda makes us question is her really that bad.  Maybe he has a good reason for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nPeople will pick apart the game play and the stealth mode.  I didn't enjoy the stealth mode but I did enjoy the combat system and loved using his new powers.  I loved the leveling up of the weapons and skills.  The items you pick up on the way I felt were just wasted I never used anyone of them expect of the health potion.\n\nThe environment was good.  I enjoyed my time in the Castle but didn't care for the modern world.\n\nThe important question is should I buy this game?  I think so but not at the full price.  The reason why is because of the ending.  The game really built things up with scenes of Dracula kinda coming back into the light and forgiving himself and redeeming himself in his own eyes.  This was great and really connected me to him even more.  The ending just kinda flopped there like a fish out of water.  It didn't wrap anything up or raise any question of whats next like the last game.  It was disappointing.  The fight with satan wasn't as tough as it was in the first one.  I kept thinking to myself he got beat the last time hit the gym and came back buff, but his old cross fitter body was better.  They need to give this game a proper ending if this really is the final game.  If they don't then all of that great work to just end on a bad note.\n\n\nSo final thought great story, but buy at half price due to the lack of a ending.","March 7, 2014","true","70.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And like in all openworld games, this one also has fast-travel system, but its pretty primitive.\n\nThere are 2 different worlds that you can travel, the modern era where the Satan's forcers brings havoc and the Dracula's Castle where the Dracula's own blood is trying to trap you.\n\nGraphics are decent, sounds and voice actings are doreable. The battle system is slightly better than it was in the original LoS, but at the same time it feels a little bit watered down from what it was.\n\nThe overall story is a cliche, because you can easily predict that what's about to happen. However, it is interesting enough to see it through. The ending itself however was a disappointment for me, because there's no conclusion, but that's just my opinion.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Battle and upgrade systems\n+ Boss encounters (though the last boss was disappointment)\n+ Lots of different enemies\n+ Lots of collectables for those interested\n+ Over 20 hours of gameplay if you collect every collectable like I did\n\nCons:\n- Disappointing last boss\n- Awful Fast-travel system (though you only need it when you're searching for collectables)\n- Lots of annoying enemies at the end\n- Bad ending (there's no conclusion in my opinion but then again I didn't play the revelations DLC)\n- The Shop's location is bad, because getting some of the collectables requires a certain item that can only be bought from the shop, so you need to visit it a lot\n- Kleido's Challenges offer no reward except a few Steam achievements\n- Few un-skippable cutscenes and events such as the slow paced transition between the modern era - Dracula's Castle\n\n\nDo I recommend ?:\nIf you're interested to see what happens to the Dracula after the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, then this might interest you. But if you haven't played those 2 games before, don't care about the story and are only interested for the action, then don't bother.\n\nVerdict: 6 / 10 - Slightly good game\n( 1 = Do-not-bother game\n5 = Average game\n10 = Must own game )","March 29","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I definitely liked this game, and do wish there was a third ready to queue up.\n\nOverall it was a great game, with amazing visuals, great story, and an amazing soundtrack. However, it was an interesting mix of strengths and weaknesses, some being very different than the 1st game. I would say that its 1st strength is how powerfully it started, I was drawn into the story immediately and even felt goosebumps as the 1st cut scene gracefully sets the stage of what Gabriel has become, complete in its gothic splendor of visuals, music, and of being loathed by the locals and probably even by himself. It’s the type of vampire that I wish could replace the entire Twilight series. If you’ve read the Anne Rice novels, I noticed many details that were alike.\n\nThe 1st hour was a blast, then come an hour of wondering if this game was going to turn horrible, followed with an awkward climb back to awesome, and luckily it stayed there til’ the end of the game.\n\nThe bad: There were many things that weren’t explained in the 2nd hour which made the story seem artificial, luckily everything started making sense as you put the pieces together yourself, that’s if you didn’t bail in the meantime and read every piece of lore you found. Often there wasn’t enough of a visual clue to know what to do next, I found myself running through the same halls over and over again, trying to find that one thing I missed and now I can’t move on. Finally, the final boss is Satan, and you never really fought him, and then he was “dead”. Game over, time for DLC-expansion. Just so awkward.\n\nThe end result is we have lots of 10/10 experiences mixed with subpar experiences, leaving you wanting more if you made it far enough to understand its style, but also hoping they’re learning from their mistakes and that they figure they’re ♥♥♥♥ out. I would probably relate my enjoyment to watching the beginning seasons of Dr. Who, of which they luckily got their ♥♥♥♥ figured out which is apparent in later seasons.","February 7","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Few glitches here & there. Still wondering why Dracul would have a shadow but no reflection (because they're kind of the same thing...). But a very nice and polished game graphically speaking. Artistic direction is... you know, quite nice. The environment are less numerous than in the previous game considering we really have two sets : the castle & the modern town, but both are cool to explore (yes, even the modern world).\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nVoice acting is yet again very good, musics are kind of below the quality of the first game's ones.\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nA bit better than the first game : it's still the same thinking but with more variety (you got a whip, your fists & a sword this time), the moves are really fun to launch and there's more strategy this time. The boss fights have also improved.... 'xcept the last one...\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nSo, it's the conclusion, and all in all it's not that bad but there's one thing that totally ruined it for me : the ending. The last battle & the ending following that is one of the worst I've seen. Last battle : too easy and not at all making you feel involved in it. And the ending was totally rushed, it just sucks. This whole ending was completely rushed.\n\n- Length :\n\nHalf the time you'll need to complete the first LoS, this game is much shorter (partly due to the fact that it's much easier)\n\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nIT'S NOT A BAD GAME. You need to remember that. BUT:  it's lacking a lot in the storytelling (especially nearing the end) & in environment.

Graphically, it fails to impress. Mechanically, it feels sloppy. The combat is frustrating and choppy and, while LoS1 had its fair share of controller-throwing platforming segments, LoS2 doesn't even justify its own such moments with an equal helping of fun, satisfying ones. I have only put a couple hours into the game so far, and already I'm mad at it. I cannot comment on the overall story yet, but the beginning feels rushed and strange, and I have to feel bad for Patrick Stewart being forced to deliver such a petty script as Zobek. The writing is childish and uninspired, and the semi-animated lore sequence explaining the Belmont lineage is utterly boring.\n\nBut you know, I could forgive all of that if the game didn't so completely miss its own point. At no time during play did I ever FEEL like Dracula, who is supposed to be an absolute powerhouse, combining strength, speed, and magical abilities to devastate ranks upon ranks of foes. The most basic of enemies can take a monumental beating from any of your weapons, and can even attack straight through your combos to strike you. One minor strike from an enemy, however, will interrupt your combo and send you flying, which makes your stature feel pitiful, even if you aren't taking significant damage from those attacks. These problems are only magnified and exacerbated when, after the tutorial sequence, the story fast-forwards some centuries and resets all of Gabriel's powers, requiring you to slowly unlock them, one by one.\n\nOther games have successfully portrayed their protagonists as extremely powerful beings without robbing the game of its core challenge. A great case in point is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Lords of Shadow 2, however, takes the legendary Dracula and nerfs him into the ground, and then poops all over him with bad gameplay mechanics.\n\nI'll say it again: if you want more LoS, play the first game again, because you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.","July 6, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nevertheless, the story is compelling (again, probably the best of any Castlevania I've played) and the game's world is built masterfully.","February 11","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And like in all openworld games, this one also has fast-travel system, but its pretty primitive.\n\nThere are 2 different worlds that you can travel, the modern era where the Satan's forcers brings havoc and the Dracula's Castle where the Dracula's own blood is trying to trap you.\n\nGraphics are decent, sounds and voice actings are doreable. The battle system is slightly better than it was in the original LoS, but at the same time it feels a little bit watered down from what it was.\n\nThe overall story is a cliche, because you can easily predict that what's about to happen. However, it is interesting enough to see it through. The ending itself however was a disappointment for me, because there's no conclusion, but that's just my opinion.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Battle and upgrade systems\n+ Boss encounters (though the last boss was disappointment)\n+ Lots of different enemies\n+ Lots of collectables for those interested\n+ Over 20 hours of gameplay if you collect every collectable like I did\n\nCons:\n- Disappointing last boss\n- Awful Fast-travel system (though you only need it when you're searching for collectables)\n- Lots of annoying enemies at the end\n- Bad ending (there's no conclusion in my opinion but then again I didn't play the revelations DLC)\n- The Shop's location is bad, because getting some of the collectables requires a certain item that can only be bought from the shop, so you need to visit it a lot\n- Kleido's Challenges offer no reward except a few Steam achievements\n- Few un-skippable cutscenes and events such as the slow paced transition between the modern era - Dracula's Castle\n\n\nDo I recommend ?:\nIf you're interested to see what happens to the Dracula after the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, then this might interest you. But if you haven't played those 2 games before, don't care about the story and are only interested for the action, then don't bother.\n\nVerdict: 6 / 10 - Slightly good game\n( 1 = Do-not-bother game\n5 = Average game\n10 = Must own game )","March 29","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Few glitches here & there. Still wondering why Dracul would have a shadow but no reflection (because they're kind of the same thing...). But a very nice and polished game graphically speaking. Artistic direction is... you know, quite nice. The environment are less numerous than in the previous game considering we really have two sets : the castle & the modern town, but both are cool to explore (yes, even the modern world).\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nVoice acting is yet again very good, musics are kind of below the quality of the first game's ones.\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nA bit better than the first game : it's still the same thinking but with more variety (you got a whip, your fists & a sword this time), the moves are really fun to launch and there's more strategy this time. The boss fights have also improved.... 'xcept the last one...\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nSo, it's the conclusion, and all in all it's not that bad but there's one thing that totally ruined it for me : the ending. The last battle & the ending following that is one of the worst I've seen. Last battle : too easy and not at all making you feel involved in it. And the ending was totally rushed, it just sucks. This whole ending was completely rushed.\n\n- Length :\n\nHalf the time you'll need to complete the first LoS, this game is much shorter (partly due to the fact that it's much easier)\n\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nIT'S NOT A BAD GAME. You need to remember that. BUT:  it's lacking a lot in the storytelling (especially nearing the end) & in environment.

The modern setting looks more like a faux Resident Evil than it does Castlevania and the game only really shines when it will occasionally go back to its familiar Gothic locale.\n\nIt's not all bad though, the combat is really great and even by the end you'll still be pumping points into it to unlock new combos. It's also a very gorgeous game and is a fantastic PC port.\n\nLords of Shadow 2 is a disappointment more than anything. The series had amazing potential after the underrated Lords of Shadow in 2010 but it's all been squandered here with head scratching design choices and plot that just plods along until it feels like pushing forward.

Overall, it`s good... until the ending.\n\n\nAltough it suffered an upgrade, this game have a few issues (SPOILER ALERT!!):\n\n- In comparison to the first game's DLC, I had to avoid been seen by the last boss for his powers were too great - he could melt me in a instant; there was a danger, a reason to hide... but in this game I had to play through a stupid hide-and-seek minigame for no reason before fighting two bosses; neither I nor them got stronger/weaker or the place before the fight buffed them or myself just before the fight so WHY the combat couldn't have started as soon as I saw them?

Music is the best part of the product, as cinematics are too (running 99% of the times fully real time)... but all the mythological themes, magic, settings and others that make a Castlevania game a Castlevania game are far away gone to present a more contemporary, darker, story. Character development is way better than the first game, but storytelling is not as solid as it could be. Gameplay feels amazing all the time, but I recommend using a guide if you don't want to get lost and wander for hours sometimes. Feels rock solid, but if you're expecting a Castlevania game you might not like this one at all as it feels a lot more like a Devil May Cry game now.

Game lacks collectibles, gear to improve you status, weapons, etc\n\nGameplay its ok but having so many attack combos can be too overwhelming, most of the time you'll use only use 2 or 3 combos for the whip and sword, I barely used the shadow claws (except when required by the game). It might be my bad memory but I found myself checking too many times how to make that cool looking combo I just unlocked and not so much time using it cause you can beat the game without it.\n\nControls are fine but a few times they can get very frustrating, camera its also a bit frustrating since there is no way to lock your attacks to an enemy and the game will try to "auto aim" your attacks to the closest enemy but always the one you don't mean to attack.\n\nCollectibles are a bit boring, scrolls that try to complete the story and tell you parts of it that are not currently happening in game. You (Dracula) feel like the less powerful Dracula from the saga and the stealth sections of the game make no sense for a Castlevania game.\n\nOverall its a good game, not so much a good Castlevania. Definitely an improvement over the first LoS.\n\nI'll only recommend it if you don't mind a short game with almost no replay value and very little exploration like in past Castlevania games and you are a "true" Castlevania Fan\n\n7/10","October 29, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm also quite fond of the openness, allowing you to go back at virtually any time to explore, collect items, etc.\n\n+Graphics\nVisually, the game is beautiful, and there's plenty of areas in the game that are simply stunning. Found myself taking in the view more than once.\n\n+Combat\nThe mastery system rewards using different skills to enhance your weapons' power. Each of Dracula's weapons have their own specific use, similar to the first game, but are more than just enchanting your whip with magic this time around, giving you entirely different movesets for each weapon. Also you get to drink your enemies' blood.\n\n+Music\nThe music of the first game was good, but it lacked any sort of memorability. The music in Lords of Shadow 2 is much better, although you'll hear a lot of the same tracks over and over. Somewhat of a hit and miss here, but a majority of the music is good enough that this is more of a pro than a con.\n\n+Pacing\nThere was a lot of nothing in between the major events of the first game; the pacing was just kinda crap, in all honesty. There always seems to be something going on in LoS 2, it's easier to feel like you're actually doing something rather than roaming through some ruins without much of a goal, which was a major problem throughout the first third of the first game.\n\n+Gabriel is More Interesting\nI was completely incapable of feeling any sort of sympathy for Gabriel in the first game. He was a cardboard cutout of a character devoid of most emotion. In this one, however, he's a little more interesting simply because he is fairly PO'ed. Also he's the dark lord, he has a reputation to live up to. Thankfully, he does.\n\n+Environment\nAs previously mentioned in the Graphics, the game is beautiful. The environment is also essential for this as well; for the areas that they created, the world is detailed and interesting. Areas are distinguishable from other places, and the concept of building a city on the ruined foundations of Dracula's castle is, honestly, quite interesting. It creates a distinctive gothic-type city that still seems reminiscent of Dracula's castle pre-ruin when you have opportunities to overlook the city.\n\n+Lore\nWhile the story blows (more on that later), it does have some intriguing lore to find, some of which indicating that the people of Castlevania City are fully aware that monsters and magic are a thing. It's definitely a turn from the original Castlevania games and other games such as Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines where hiding the supernatural from the world was of the utmost importance. In Lords of Shadow 2, I find it intriguing that they accept, and are even fascinated by, the fact that there used to be werewolves, vampires, and even the siege against Dracula are merely documented as history and treated as such. Their history is as natural to them as our own is to us. This is certainly something I'd love to see expanded on in future games- maybe not Lords of Shadow, but other franchises where the supernatural is merely embraced as a part of history rather than hidden from the world for safety.\n\n\nCons\n-It's Not Castlevania\nYou can add the title, give the characters the names, and everything else, but it still doesn't make it a Castlevania game. Let alone it's horridly out of place with half of the game taking place in a modern day city. To be perfectly honest, it feels more like Darksiders than Castlevania due to the themes throughout the game. The heart and spirit of the series is completely absent from Lords of Shadow, hence I only ever refer to it as Lords of Shadow.\n\n-Story\nI find it ironic that they rebooted Castlevania with an intended focus on story, and then ended up dropping the ball. The first game had an okay, albeit not-very-original story with Satan having Necron Syndrome and popping up literally out of nowhere at the end. Mirror of Fate was an atrocity of a game and explained jack squat. Similar problems are in LoS 2- Gabriel often finds himself back in what appears to be either the past of his memories of his castle. Honestly have no idea because it's never explained at all. His memories/past/whatever-the-fudge-is-going-on also has zero relevance to what's going on, aside from getting back his powers because reasons. There's also some Resident Evil bullcrap going on where the citizens are mutated by some demonic virus; this is so out of place it hurts. Everything else is fairly easy to follow, and there's some interesting things that do happen throughout the game, but it's nothing to write home about. Story is honestly not a good reason to play this game, and if it's what you're looking for, turn the other way.\n\nGabriel forgot how to Open Doors\nFound a door? Guess what? You're going to have to pull a switch to open it. He's only a superhuman Prince of Darkness, godforbid he opens a metal door on his own. There's a lot of this crap that just slows the game down needlessly, especially since it takes forever for said doors to open. This game was made in 2014, this is rather inexcusable.\n\n-Enemies can be Annoying\nThere's a guard/perfect guard mechanic in the game, which is quite useful. Unfortunately, roughly 50% of the time, the enemies perform an unblockable attack, which renders guarding a lot less useful than you'd like it to be. Also there's plenty of times where I simply wanted to get somewhere and didn't want to fight. Going places often involve climbing. Guess what? Every freaking enemy in the game can use some kind of projectile to knock you down, often forcing you to fight enemies when you don't want to. This is often infuriating when you merely want to explore for upgrades and other hidden items.\n\n-Stealth Segments\nOkay, I get that he's weak and whatnot at the beginning, but this just seems so unnecessary. Especially since the stealth segment with Agreus is absolutely infuriating.\n\n-Bugs\nEvery now and then, characters may "say something" without sound- basically the sound file for the line they're supposed to say doesn't play (no subtitles either, which is even more aggravating). I've had other instances where the objective was the last objective I just did, and wasn't up to date. Worst of all, I've had it crash on me for no reason once.\n\n\nFinal VerdictWhile the story is laughable, the stealth is pointless, and bugs are afoot, the game is actually quite fun. I do not recommend it at full price; wait for a Steam sale to get it because $40 is a bit much for some of the frustrations of the game. Gameplay-wise, it's pretty good, despite the annoying gameplay oversights.

I'd say it's worth 20-30$ when you pick it up. If you played the first castlevania game (the one prior to this - not necissarily all the previous titles) you will find the gameplay to be really similar in style. The storyline is obviously linked though different and the opening gameplay scene was pretty intense and ties all back later in the end of the game. Overall I enjoyed this, though admittedly I didn't go above and beyond with completionist. I finished the main storyline completely and gameplay said 53% complete, so there's plenty of side stuff if you're into that sorta thing.

The way the last game ended, the trailer involving the castle siege, the unique universe and artistic style the game takes place in; how could they go wrong?\n\nAnd at first, it seemed like they'd made another great game (just like the first, which also came out to muted-to-mediocre reception but would prove to be a stellar experience). Even beyond the introduction sequence, with the lackluster stealth, linearity and meagerness of the city, it stilled promised to be much more, at least to me.\n\nFor as long as I could, I held onto the concept that, at worst, it could be a poorly executed great concept; it kept sliding further and further away from that great concept ideal, to be expected of something coming from such a high plateu with too much expectation; a fault of my own if anything.\n\nWhat was dreadful about this game, however, was not its inability to match the former game's great expectations: it was unbelievably poor direction the plot lurches towards the mid-to-end of the game. In almost complete contrast to Lords of Shadow, which started off slow, picked up speed and took off into orbit: this game started off in orbit, slowed down and instead of just falling to the ground, somehow fell into a wormhole that took it straight into the jaws of a black hole where it went full-on Event Horizon.\n\nGive this game a massive miss; play the first and imagine what could have been, don't make the mistake that I did and assume the reviews were just a repeat of the first on release, of fans of Castlevania of old and this game just didn't live up to their rose-tinted rememberance of easiers times, and those who refused to do anything but accuse it of being a God of War clone, when it was so much more.\n\nIn short, this game represents a tragedy in what could have been, of which I am saddened to have been a part of.","September 25, 2015","false","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And like in all openworld games, this one also has fast-travel system, but its pretty primitive.\n\nThere are 2 different worlds that you can travel, the modern era where the Satan's forcers brings havoc and the Dracula's Castle where the Dracula's own blood is trying to trap you.\n\nGraphics are decent, sounds and voice actings are doreable. The battle system is slightly better than it was in the original LoS, but at the same time it feels a little bit watered down from what it was.\n\nThe overall story is a cliche, because you can easily predict that what's about to happen. However, it is interesting enough to see it through. The ending itself however was a disappointment for me, because there's no conclusion, but that's just my opinion.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Battle and upgrade systems\n+ Boss encounters (though the last boss was disappointment)\n+ Lots of different enemies\n+ Lots of collectables for those interested\n+ Over 20 hours of gameplay if you collect every collectable like I did\n\nCons:\n- Disappointing last boss\n- Awful Fast-travel system (though you only need it when you're searching for collectables)\n- Lots of annoying enemies at the end\n- Bad ending (there's no conclusion in my opinion but then again I didn't play the revelations DLC)\n- The Shop's location is bad, because getting some of the collectables requires a certain item that can only be bought from the shop, so you need to visit it a lot\n- Kleido's Challenges offer no reward except a few Steam achievements\n- Few un-skippable cutscenes and events such as the slow paced transition between the modern era - Dracula's Castle\n\n\nDo I recommend ?:\nIf you're interested to see what happens to the Dracula after the events of Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, then this might interest you. But if you haven't played those 2 games before, don't care about the story and are only interested for the action, then don't bother.\n\nVerdict: 6 / 10 - Slightly good game\n( 1 = Do-not-bother game\n5 = Average game\n10 = Must own game )","March 29","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphically, it fails to impress. Mechanically, it feels sloppy. The combat is frustrating and choppy and, while LoS1 had its fair share of controller-throwing platforming segments, LoS2 doesn't even justify its own such moments with an equal helping of fun, satisfying ones. I have only put a couple hours into the game so far, and already I'm mad at it. I cannot comment on the overall story yet, but the beginning feels rushed and strange, and I have to feel bad for Patrick Stewart being forced to deliver such a petty script as Zobek. The writing is childish and uninspired, and the semi-animated lore sequence explaining the Belmont lineage is utterly boring.\n\nBut you know, I could forgive all of that if the game didn't so completely miss its own point. At no time during play did I ever FEEL like Dracula, who is supposed to be an absolute powerhouse, combining strength, speed, and magical abilities to devastate ranks upon ranks of foes. The most basic of enemies can take a monumental beating from any of your weapons, and can even attack straight through your combos to strike you. One minor strike from an enemy, however, will interrupt your combo and send you flying, which makes your stature feel pitiful, even if you aren't taking significant damage from those attacks. These problems are only magnified and exacerbated when, after the tutorial sequence, the story fast-forwards some centuries and resets all of Gabriel's powers, requiring you to slowly unlock them, one by one.\n\nOther games have successfully portrayed their protagonists as extremely powerful beings without robbing the game of its core challenge. A great case in point is Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine. Lords of Shadow 2, however, takes the legendary Dracula and nerfs him into the ground, and then poops all over him with bad gameplay mechanics.\n\nI'll say it again: if you want more LoS, play the first game again, because you'll enjoy it a whole lot more.","July 6, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Few glitches here & there. Still wondering why Dracul would have a shadow but no reflection (because they're kind of the same thing...). But a very nice and polished game graphically speaking. Artistic direction is... you know, quite nice. The environment are less numerous than in the previous game considering we really have two sets : the castle & the modern town, but both are cool to explore (yes, even the modern world).\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nVoice acting is yet again very good, musics are kind of below the quality of the first game's ones.\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nA bit better than the first game : it's still the same thinking but with more variety (you got a whip, your fists & a sword this time), the moves are really fun to launch and there's more strategy this time. The boss fights have also improved.... 'xcept the last one...\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nSo, it's the conclusion, and all in all it's not that bad but there's one thing that totally ruined it for me : the ending. The last battle & the ending following that is one of the worst I've seen. Last battle : too easy and not at all making you feel involved in it. And the ending was totally rushed, it just sucks. This whole ending was completely rushed.\n\n- Length :\n\nHalf the time you'll need to complete the first LoS, this game is much shorter (partly due to the fact that it's much easier)\n\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nIT'S NOT A BAD GAME. You need to remember that. BUT:  it's lacking a lot in the storytelling (especially nearing the end) & in environment.

Although LoS2 has less atmosphere and eyecandy than Lords of Shadow 1,it's still a worthy and great sequel.\n\nThe gameplay as a whole is satisfactory (even the stealth parts have their own charm), and the combat is just as fun as the first game (although very identical, with a few different moves and weapons).\n\nThe story and progression are amazing, nothing to ever complain about.\n\nI've played at the hardest diffculty available (before I've unlocked a harder difficulty), and found the game to be a bit too easy, only struggling at some bosses.\n\nThe game is slightly shorter than most single players (I've beat it in 13.5 hours), but enough to satisfy you, and there's the resurruction DLC that you can get if you haven't had enough.\n\nOverall, the game is great and definately what you want and need after you're done with Lords of Shadow 1.\n\n7.5/10","June 27, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I picked it & all DLC up on a seasonal sale for $20.\n\nExcept for the Kleidos challenges, it was pretty easy even on the highest difficulty. Aside from that, it was an incredibly good game. The visuals were detailed and gameplay was smooth. The fighting system was basically the same, so if you liked LoS1 chances are you will also like LoS2.\n\nThe story did have a different feel from the first game, but admittedly my memory of LoS1 is a little fuzzy. It was less like a revenge/avenger story, and instead more like a murder mystery in which you are the victim.","May 1","true","80.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, the gameplay and player progression is extremely dull and boring. Fights are very repetitive and smashing buttons again and again is not fun. The only cool gameplay element in the whole game imo are the stealth tasks where you are asked to infiltrate some place without being detected.\n\nI'd recommend this for the story, but definently not for the gameplay.","June 1","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
