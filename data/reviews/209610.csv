"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/209610/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","What can I say about this game?...  Well, it’s fun.  It’s frustrating.  It’s simple.  It’s small.  Did I mention it’s fun?  That said, it's not worth $10, and I'll tell you why;\n\nRoller Coaster Rampage is pretty different from every other roller coaster game I’ve played.  The coasters in this game are virtually “created” as you ride them.  Trust me, it’s a very unique experience, and often that is where a lot of frustration comes from.\n\nThere are 2 modes you can currently play in Roller Coaster Rampage.  There’s the Campaign mode where you basically try to collect as many gems as you can while linking your on-the-fly track with already pre-constructed pieces of track.  Then there’s the Free Ride mode, in which you just make a coaster any way you like.  You'll find yourself spending most of your time in Free Ride, as the Campaign mode is rather easy and only has about 30-ish challenges to finish.\n\nI found quite a few things dissapointing about this game.  One disappointment with this game was the content seemed to be drastically lacking.  It’s virtually impossible to build the same coaster, but you only have one location so the scenery all around you is always the same.  The location is rather small as well, leaving you struggling to build any ride that lasts longer than a minute or two.  The coaster itself was also always the same.  You couldn’t change to a wooden one, or a hanging one, or any other coaster than the standard metal one.  The starting station was always the same, however in Campain Mode it was sometimes rotated a bit to make your launching and landing directions different.\n\nElement impacts (crashing into objects) were random as well.  Some things like the coaster track legs would get out of your way as you crossed them and other times you would ram into them and your hard work would come to an immediate and very violent end.  Occasionally when legs did move they would interfere with a part of the track you already built, leaving you to sloppily go right through a track leg when you went back and rode the coaster after it's built.  It was impossible to know if it’s safe to cross under another track or not.  This made most of my coasters climb as they progressed and then dive back into the station at the end, instead of having a large hill at the very beginning.  It also kept me from doing several cool maneuvers, like having a loop run through the center of another loop.  Scenery was also touch-and-go as well.  It was hard to tell what you could safely pass through and what you couldn’t.  On occasion, sometimes an object would be deadly to your coaster one pass and safe the next.  It was a mix that made it hard to do the quick decision making that the game requires you to make.\n\nAnother thing that brought frustrations was the control layout.  I found the controls really awkward, especially since you have to really think fast while playing.  Your acceleration/breaking and “roll” was controlled by the WASD keys while the arrow keys controlled left/right and up/down movement.  You also had the numbers 1-3 for “stunts” like left/right corkscrews and looping.  It probably would have been a much better setup with Q and E for the corkscrews and maybe R or F for looping.  That would be more common, and easier, for those who are practiced in FPS games.\n\nIt’s not all bad though.  I really enjoy this game as a simple time waster.  It’s fast to load and you can quickly get yourself into the “Free Mode”.  Even if you’ve only got 10 minutes to waste you can get a few rides in before you have to shut it down.  I often find myself firing up this game in those few minutes before leaving for work, just because I know it’s a game that you can be satisfied with only playing it 5 minutes.\n\nThe purchase price of $9.99 is very high, and it's the main reason I'm not giving my recommendation for this game.  There's just too much lacking.  A lack of content makes it nothing more than a quick time waster.  The controls are frustrating.  The unchanging scenery is just lazy game designers.  It's not worth $10.\n\nI bought the game as part of a 4-game bundle for $5.99 which makes my purchase worth it.  If you can buy it like that, or on sale for no more than $2, then go for it.  Otherwise you're just paying Cadillac prices to own a Ford.","April 21, 2014","false","2.5"," 75 of 83 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","75","83","0","4"

If you dislike games with very clunky controls that makes it impossible to play; you'll hate this game. The utter freedom in creating any coaster design you want is great; even if you create physically impossible coasters that would rip it's riders apart; and the fast action makes it addictive. But, still, those controls. They make absolutely no sense; they're hard to get to when you need them and you'll find yourself spending more time crashing your coaster becuase you weren't able to get turned quick enough.\n\nIt's a fun game, it's a *really* fun game; but the controls aren't suited for the kind of fast paced action this game throws at you. They're clunky, they're cumbersome, and they're just in no way suited for this game. If you find it on sale; it's worth about 2 bucks; but I wouldn't give any more for this game. It's a game you'll play; you'll probably never actually advance.","December 22, 2013","false","15.0"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

At first I was suprisingly amazed by the screenshots of the game and wanned to buy it, but now I saw it in a bundle, on bundlestars. Got the bundle...\nAnd I was suprised...\nIts actually alot worse than I though.\nDon't let the screenshots fool you.\nIts hard to explain this thing by text, and hard for you to understand why you shouldn't get this game.\nSo let me explain this easier - heres cons and pros.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics,textures.\n+ Doesn't take alot of space.\n+ Good animations.\n+ Controller support. (I haven't tried it.)\n+ Workshop??!? (? - I'm not sure about this, they said they have one tho it doesn't show up here. But yeah I guess its coming soon feature.)\nCons:\n- Bad menu.\n- Only 1 track color.\n- Only 1 coaster design.\n- Boring after first half hour - hour.\n- No new coaster parts.\n\nAnyways, its a no from me.","October 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","1"

Roller Coaster Rampage is simply a game about Roller Coasters. That's it.\n\nHowever, This game delivers everything that it promises. (I haven't seen much destruction in my playtime though.) The graphics for this game look 2007-ish, and not up to modern specs. The Coaster Creation is an innovative idea, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Most players would feel more comfortable playing this with a controller.\n\nThe campaign (as it's called in game) is merely a set of simple challenges that can be completed quite easily, and they seem very repetitive. There is only 1 park available in Roller Coaster Rampage, and it gets small and boring, fast. If you could walk around the park and visit other attractions, the game could be reasonably fun. However, you cannot.\n\nFree-Play mode is where the game shines. The track can be easily created and then you can ride the insane monstrosity you've created (But I couldn't find a save button). It's pretty neat, but construction can get messy with lots of rails and support beams everywhere. When you hit high speeds the track seems to get choppy (even though the game renders at a nice 60 fps), and the railcars seem unable to follow physics.\n\nWorkshop support is 'Coming Soon!', but I have no idea how long that's been there.\n\nBut why do I recommend this game? It's simply a fun little time killer. I bought it for $2.50 during the Holiday Sale, and that's as much as this game is worth. If you're thinking about dropping $10 on this, wait for it to go on sale for $2 or less.\n\ntl;dr\nGraphics: 7/10 - looks cartoony, but a little on the low-def side.\nOverall Gameplay: 6/10 Needs fine tuning, and a controller greatly helps.\nCampaign: 5/10 - Average challenges that add little to mechanics and design.\nFree-Play: 8/10 - Fun, but you cannot save tracks. Physics and Construction seem a bit wonky.\nOverall Score - 6/10. Average, but definitely not worth $10. Wait for a sale.","January 2, 2014","true","0.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Its not a theme park came, but very much a build as you ride coaster generator. The concept is nice and create an easy pick up and play format. However, I find there is one main flaw in this game and that is the lack of a rewind feature.  It is quite frustrating to build a really long coaster and have it crash right at the end and have to start all over.  Either restarting 10 seconds before the crash or just a simple rewind feature to be able to go back to any point in your build and deviate from your original plan.  I would invest a lot more time in this game if this was the case. Otherwise, I see myself playing it seldomly.","August 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Wasnt sure what I was expecting from a 3d roller coaster, but in this game you just kind of move around and it lays track as you go.  You dont plan it out as in other tycoon type games.  In this game you need to collect gems adn do stunts.  The controller support is ok but the game is very picky if a jump says 50 mph, and your at 51 or 49 you crash.  Crashing would be more fun if people were on the roller coaster screaming, but the game is mostly silent minus a muted background track.  Meh, woulda been more fun to build a wild ride like Mr.Bones but there is no real building in this game just as you go.

If you're looking for a rollercoaster simulation game where you get to painstakingly create and ride an awesome rollercoaster, this is not the game for you.  You play it in first person and "build" the roller coaster as you ride it.  It's awkward to control and frustrating to try to make a neat coaster without running into something and being forced to start over again.","July 25, 2012","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are fixed "joints" around the park, but you basically build the track in real time as you are collecting diamonds and trying to do corkscrews etc.\n\nVery arcadey, and loads of fun.\n\nThere are a few bugs which are especially noticable when you go back to ride the track you just made, but ultimately they're forgivable. The option to play in 3d just adds to it. Rollercoasters + 3d are a winning combination.\n\nIt's cheap and well worth a look if you can overlook some of the bugs.","July 20, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Avoid. Really avoid.\n\nI can see what they were trying to do. Visually the game looks at first glance like an improved version of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and some care and attention has gone into creating a single park and a single design of coaster. Do not be decived by these superficial similarities.\n\nYou build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it.\nThis is NOT a rollercoaster building game, it is not a park management game, I'm not sure what exactly it is if I'm honest. The closest thing I can compare it to is something like Temple Run, only with rollercoasters and a first person perspective.\n\nEach level, you are given a few segments of rollercoaster pre-built. Your job is to link them together, in the pre-set (but not shown) order, and that is it. You are asked to add various elements such as barel rolls or corkscrews in between each element, and there are gems to collect which basically show you exactly where your track should go (except not every section has gems, and then you're left circling round looking for the next segment of track). This all sounds quite fun so far, and would be a good game mechanic in a game like Rollercoaster Tycoon any of its rivals. But this game doesn't share any of those games mechanics.\n\nYou cannot place track with any kind of sensible interface. You cannot undo your track except by restarting the level. You cannot see your ride from any perspective other than first person, riding in the front seat. I don't just mean when riding it, I mean all the time. You build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it. This really isn't much fun at all, and leads to hilariously awful coasters with curves that would be impossible in real life and really not fun. Then by the time you get to level three, the game starts to feature pre-built segments that involve jumps and you realise that not even it takes itself seriously any more.\n\nCouple this awful gameplay and lack of realism with a terrible interface, bad colision detection (most of the time if your track collides with things the cars fly through the air and disintegrate, but sometimes they don't, and then you can have coasters going right through trees, buildings, and other bits of track), and you end up with a truely awful game.\n\nRun, run far away from this awful thing and never look back.","October 18, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game would be good if it's bought on a sale (at least half price) and it's a cheap concept of No Limits and Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Most of the times if you were going to ride the workshop coasters and then the game crashes. You'll have to use a controller in order to play this game, you build coasters with it.

I has its moments. To be honest, it really isn't the best.\n\nThe trailer is one of the reasons I bought this game (And it was half off). It really overhypes the gameplay. There is only one map, and some limitation to what you can do (I initally thought you could crash and destroy EVERYTHING from the ground to trees and certain buildlings).\n\nI haven't played all the levels and havent done much free mode so maybe I can't post a real review, but this is what I have experienced so far.\n\nI would reccomend it if it was on sale and you needed a quick little game to pass time or have some fun with something different (Just like buying DLC Quest).\n\n(Another quick thing is that it doesn't full screen at its start menu but changes when ingame. It can be a bit of a hassle at times :P)","October 14, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
