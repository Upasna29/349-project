You can do combos, air combos, special attack and ride dragon(it's a dragon right?).  The difficult is a bit high but it's ok after a few game over -_-"\n\nPro :\n- Smooth animation\n- Responsive Control\n- Rare to find air combos in side scroll type\n- Good AI and variety enemies attacks\n- Great boss fight\n- Cool BGM\n\nCon (you can fix in future update) :\n- I think enemies should drop some HP / MP recover item\n- Should add invincible frame for special attack\n- the air attack combos hitbox should a bit more wider.  Sometime air combos miss if you get to close to enemy.\n\nStill waiting for future update.\nIf you like side scroll beat'em up and challenge game.  You will like Princess Edge ^^\n\nAnd the last thing I want to shout after played this game "DRAGON HEADBUTT !!!" :P","April 1","true","15.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

However, it is still a game that I am happy to recommend to old school gamers looking for their next fix on the Beat ’em up genre especially those who grew up loving and playing the ♥♥♥♥ out of Golden Axe. A lot of people thought that the genre was long gone but occasionally a developer who like me grew up feasting on the genre will attempt to rekindle it with varying degrees of success.\n\nWhen you’re playing one of these types of games you’re not necessarily looking for the best graphics or sound. What you’re after is maximum playability – intuitive controls that are fun to play and an often surprising amount of options and opportunities to employ strategy. We love the never ending brutality that these games have. We look for epic boss fights and various different encounters that make us actively think about what an enemy’s greatest point of weakness is and how to overcome seemingly unimaginable odds to beat each level until we’ve either defeated the game or reached a point where you obsess about what it will take to overcome that level. Even the most skilled players of the genre can struggle against different types of bosses.\n\nTherefore you’re not going to find the latest and greatest graphics here. The graphics that are in the game are basic but they serve their purpose quite well. Although others may disagree I enjoyed the in game sound more than I did the graphics. The tunes are catchy albeit a little on the repetitive side. The challenge in the game is pivotal and it achieves what it sets out to to a significant degree. This is definitely the highlight of the game. I think the balance is more than suitable for the genre though younger players may find the game a little on the difficult side – which is the intention. A final positive that I want to mention are the number of special moves featured in the game already. That is a definite advantage and should theoretically provide some replayability as you attempt different play styles.\n\nWhere the game falls short, at least for now, is that there are only five stages and nine regular enemy types. The developer claims that this is already a finished game but it is too much on the short side. I’d like to see a lot more content added to the game. I’d bring the game up to at least eight different levels with each level having a boss fight. I’d also like to see the game become more Steamified with achievements and trading cards added to the game. Local co-op would be another option that I would like to see considered, however, that may unbalance the gameplay and make it too easy.\n\nThis is a cool game and one that brings back memories which is clearly the intention of the developer. I hope they continue along their game development pathway.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","3.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Here you will experience one solid title with two special features: multiple planes (Guardian Heroes) and backstab attacks for more damage. You will control a Princess inspired by Tyris Flare from Golden Axe on her quest to defeat a great evil that has been unleashed (And no, you can't summon a dragon here! That's the enemy!), aside from standard attacks, combos, and mounting beast, you can execute a variety of magical attacks with unique properties for destroying waves of multiple enemies. The graphics, music, and playability are very good, but the difficulty may require some practice to get used to. This game is in early access, so you can drop your suggestions for improving!","March 28","true","7.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

Generally speaking I tend to only review a niche in hentai games, but in terms of gameplay, this is similar enough to a game EroBotan would begin producing later that I thought it was worth talking about. Princess’ Edge: Dragonstone is a side-scrolling beat-em-up in the tradition of Golden Axe, Knights of the Round and the like, starring a scantily clad barbarian princess in her quest to save the fictional land of Arelia from the re-emergence of an ancient foe.\n\nTo begin with, the artwork: There isn’t much of it, but what is there is decent. The protagonista of this game is a bikini-clad barbarian warrioress, drawn in such a way not just to get the attention of its intended audience but in a simple enough costume that it’s easy to translate to pixels. It obviously draws some influence from other beat-em-ups with similarly scantily-clad heroines who tend to be just as easy on the eyes to encourage people to try their playstyle (as EroBotan admits, it’s a direct copy of the costume worn by Tyris of Golden Axe. And speaking of…)\n\nGameplay is quite engaging for a low-budget beat-em-up. Those of you who have played any of the fan favorites of the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre such as Turtles In Time or Double Dragon will find a degree of satisfaction in how easy it is to chain attacks together. In many ways it’s a bit more complex than its inspiring early 16-bit games, and in others less so. There are no screen-clearing special moves as yet, but you do have plenty of methods of attack at your disposal. Knowing when to attack with your sword and when it might be more beneficial to attack with your limited if generous supply of magic attacks will get you through plenty of situations in which you end up surrounded by helmed thugs. Of note is that I found the final battle (the Ancient Black Dragon) far less challenging than the one before it, in which you face two of the cheapest bosses in the game at once. I’m uncertain if it’s a glitch or perhaps by design, but I found a strategy of dashing close to the dragon and constantly switching sides to keep backstabbing seems to make the battle nigh effortless.\n\nIn-game graphics here are best described as “okay”. Although we can probably chalk up the hammerspace appearance and disappearance of her sword to the premise that she’s gifted in magic, I find it amusing that a barbarian warrioress with combat training to take on armies of soldiers runs into battle as if she’s skipping through a field of lilies and chasing after butterflies. There’s a small but serviceable variety of enemies with only a tiny amount of palette and/or weapon swap to incorporate a few different attack styles, though as you might expect, the foes that are going to give you the hardest time are going to be the bosses themselves. It’s pretty obvious most of the graphical attention went to the main character and to the bosses here, though also understandable. With that said, the bombastic effects of special attacks and spells from protagonist and foe alike definitely serves to this game’s advantage: it does make you feel as if you’re playing in an anime fantasy setting. And yes, fellow horndogs: this isn’t a hentai game, but EroBotan, true to their name, made sure there was jiggle in that bikini now and then.\n\nThe sound is just above average overall. A standard array of slashes and slaps that, while they’re quite obviously stock sounds, are more or less tried and true for the games they’re often put in. The highlight here is the game’s music, composed by “Garoad”. It’s a synthesizer-heavy soundtrack that actually manages to fit the game quite well, giving it the feel of a throwback to 80s B movies that followed in the wake of Conan the Barbarian. (Yes, Yor, I’m looking at you.) I do feel the game could use a bit more sound here and there; voicework for the heroine would go a long way, though EroBotan are planning on arranging for this to happen. But the same can be said for the enemies. In a beat-em-up, the sounds of their agony as you pummel them into the dirt, or the death throes of a stage boss after you finally deliver the killing blow, really keep players like me engaged. The game feels rather unfinished without them.\n\nOverall, I call this a game worth a play. If you’re looking for story, look elsewhere; like most games of the 80s to 90s era, story takes a far back seat to the simple delivery of action and service. If, however, you’re just after a good beat-em-up experience with a cute heroine and a decent challenge, this should be in your library for a play-through now and then.","March 25","true","0.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The game is running quite flawlessly for a game that is in early access and has just been released.\n\nBug-wise, I ran this game a couple of times by now, and I ran into no critical ones yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, it performs very well even for my quite old laptop.\n\nGameplay-wise, the character animations feel smooth, and the designs are pretty neat too. The main heroine's voice acting is pretty decent too. Hits seem to register correctly. The combo system is pretty straightforward and not too difficult to get used to with one's preferred key figuration and precise timing. I played on Normal difficulty, and the balance between mobs, bosses, and the main heroine felt pretty fair. It might feel unfair to some of the players as the main heroine can't guard and has a shorter range than the enemies. However, they all have certain patterns that you have to adapt to. It's just something you learn the hard way.\n\nSound-wise, it might not look like it from the trailer, but the hit sound effects are good enough. BGM-wise, it does get repetitive, but I feel like the gameplay makes up for it.\n\nTherefore, the game seems to be on the right track, generally feels worth the price, and most importantly, it is fun. I imagine it can only get better as the dev polishes it further.","March 26","true","4.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
