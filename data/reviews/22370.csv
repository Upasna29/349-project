Allright, since I've played this game for nearly 600 hours, I'll give you a serious recommendation.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Elder Scrolls series like me, you'll love it. Fallout 3 is kinda similar to TES IV: Oblivion in many aspects. Don't expect a fast-paced shooting gallery because combat's the weakest spot in the game. Fallout 3 is all abount exploration, moral choices and immersing yourself into the world. Walking lonely with your dog like two little dots in the Capital Wasteland, crawling in the dark while exploring an abandon Vault, punching a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in his face because he annoyed your girl, blowing up a city to become an evil based... are just some small things among thousands of insane ♥♥♥♥ you can do in this game.\n\nWhat I love most about Fallout 3 is the dark atmosphere. In this game, you really feel like you're in a dead world. You rarely find a house that's not completely ruined, you will meet many kinds of people, from poor citizen who can't protect themselves from Mutants to cannibals and slave traders. The diversity is undeniable, the world is beautifully crafted in a dark and heavy tone. Fallout 3 sometimes doesn't take itself seriously, it's the result from a script filled with black-comedy, from story, dialogues to the ridiculous amount of gore. Fallout 3 is an over-the-top game, but it still managed to maintain both dark tone and comedic writing.\n\nCombat is... well, not so much things to say. You can find bazilion of weapons, from a small pistol, sub-machine gun to things that can blow up a god damn building like a rocket launcher called Fat Man, a holy-♥♥♥♥-it's-on-fire machete with a name that I can't spell properly and a gun that can shoot junks you put in called Rock-It-Launcher (I wished it allowed me to put someone's head in it). However, the impressive amount of weapons can't prevent the combat system from being dull. 3rd person camera works better than it does in Oblivion, but I found it a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use it in combat so I recommend sticking with 1st person camera. This game has a turn-based system called V.A.T.S. In the first Fallout games, this point counts the actions that player can use, from moving to using your weapon. In Fallout 3, this system serves as an aimbot helping you "mark" enemy's parts of their body (it has percentages, so don't expect to get 100% YOLOSWAG420). The problem is, VATS can be abuse, you can shoot an enemy, run back, wait for it to regenerate and bam, get back to the warzone. The mechanic of this system is a little bit weird and I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative point.\n\nShooting people isn't something special, you met a bunch of bandits ? Keep the distance and shoot them. You found a big ♥♥♥♥ing bear ? Keep the distance and shoot him. You met 10 Enclave soldiers ? Keep the distance and shoot them. You met a mother♥♥♥♥ing Deathclaw ? Keep the distance and shoot him. Combat is kinda dull, repetitive and it only feels decent if you manage to find creative ways to punish enemies, like putting a grenade inside a bandit's pants and see him explode or firing a flamethrower while sneaking behind an Enclave soldier.\n\nGraphics looks kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by today's standard, but you can always find some enhancing mods so that's not a big trouble.\n\nMy conclusion: After 580 hours in this game, I had a very good time immersing myself in a dark, dead wasteland. Combat is dull, karma system doesn't make sense sometimes, but other aspects has hidden those shortcomings perfectly. I'm not a Fallout hardcore fan, but now I want to be. 9/10. AND GOD DAMN IT BETHESDA, RELEASE FALLOUT 4 ALREADY!!!.\n\nP/S: It works fine on Windows 7, at least for me.","February 7, 2014","true","585.0"," 2,408 of 2,615 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","408","2","4","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/recommended/22370/","GopherGaming","Gopher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/","352 products in account","Probably one of my favourite games of all time. Stepping out of the vault into the harsh sun drenched wasteland is a moment in my gaming history that I will never quite forget. The thrill of seeing this open world stretching off to the horizon, knowing that adventure awaited me, left me almost awe struck.\n\nThe game itself is a totally open game where you can chose your own path in a Post Apocalyptic hell hole. Will you be a heroic saviour of mankind, or a vicious survivor who does what is needed to survive? It is completely up to you. On your way you will meet a mix of people, some evil, some less so, and others .. well let's just say the wasteland produces a lot of strange characters.\n\nA great game, but made even greater by the modding community that has been built up around it. This is one of those games I highly recommend modding pretty much immediately. And if you have any worries about doing so, check out my tutorials for modding this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SAeXsA6Nt8&index=5&list=PL77ECC4B6194E1685\n\nBe warned however that this game is old, and will need quite a lot of tweaking to get working on Windows 7 or later. If you also own Fallout: New Vegas, I would actually recommend using the Tales of Two Wastelands mod to play the Fallout 3 story using the Fallout: New Vegas engine, which is far more stable and works fine on Windows 7.\n\nI have no tutorial on this mod yet, but when I do, I will update this review.\n\nIMPORTANT: I have played this game for several hundred hours, but not on this account, and most with certain mods installed that stop Steam from knowing that I was playing.","January 3, 2015","true","0.4"," 1,090 of 1,163 people (94%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","94","090","1","71","40"

Go To Library-->Fallout 3-->Press Properties-->Local Files-->Browse Local Files-->fallout 3-->Fallout 3.ini\n\n3. Press "Ctrl+F" type (without quotation marks) "bUseThreadedAI"\n\n-If the game has been started it should already be a line named "bUseThreadedAI=0",\nchange the 0 to 1.\nIf the line isn't there, add it in the in the .ini folder.

I've heard some complaints about the combat but i thought it was great. The V.A.T.S gives you a really cool tactical shooter perspective.The Animations are a bit akward and theres no sprinting which should be ESSENTIAL because the world is so vast. This is nothing that mods couldn't fix. The leveling system is amazing in which you can choose which skills you want to master based on your playstyle.\n\nVisuals:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441989686\nThe visuals are alright. It's something you would expect since it was released in 2008. I thought the visuals were pretty good and nailed the vibe but looked a bit bland. I installed a few mods to fix this. If your computer can handle them i suggest modding the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game graphically.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio of this game is AMAZING. The soundtrack fits right into the retro 50's post apocalyptic setting. Having the in game radio on at all times is a REQUIREMENT to fully enjoy this game.\n\nEnvironment:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441989678\nThe environment in this game is big but not huge. It's an open world game much like Skyrim is. The map is filled with sidequest you can do for awesome rewards like laser guns or awesome launchers that launch 6 nukes at a time and causes an a explosion so big it might crash your game and make GTX Titan Z's cry.\n\nOptimization:\n\nThis game is not very well optimized for Windows 7,8. But there are solutions on the internet that will fix the game for the most part. During my 60 hours the game crashed about 11 times. around 7 of those were in one of the DLC's(Point Lookout) which is almost unplayable due to low framerate and crashing.\n\nVerdict:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441062483\nThis game is hands down one of the best games i have played and this a must buy for any video game fan. Even tho i put 60 hours into this i've barely scratched the surface since i have 3 full DLC's and their respective sidequest and half the sidequest in the main game to complete.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/22370/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.\n\nMethods of execution include getting beaten to death by drug-crazed raiders, blown apart by explosive weapons, turned into ash by one of the many laser weapons used here, and dying slowly and horribly from radiation poisoning. Fun! But all of these execution methods are, ultimately, better than becoming a communist. As Liberty Prime so eloquently puts it: better dead than red.\n\nSeriously though. Dislike this game and I will personally call a vertibird strike on your ♥♥♥. You have been warned. o_O\n\nThe first Fallout game by Bethesda is noticeably different in tone from the old Fallout games, and particularly Fallout 2. This is one of the bleakest and most depressing games I've ever played, depicting a world that is in far worse shape than any other Fallout game where there are at least some signs of civilization returning. Here... everything is either dead or slowly dying as it is consumed by non-stop violence and pervasive radiation. How lovely. x_x\n\nThe most logical explanation for this, aside from the change in developer, is that whereas the previous Fallout games centered on the West Coast of the USA with only a few major cities (Los Angeles/The Boneyard in Fallout 1, San Francisco in Fallout 2) showing up in relatively small roles in the plot, Fallout 3 centers on Washington DC, the US capital (as well as Pittsburgh, PA in a DLC). A city that, in any nuclear war, would be a primary target for destruction, and that destruction is very much on display in a disturbing amount of detail. As someone who has visited DC three times in my life at the time of writing, the last of which occuring about a week after I first played this game (January 2009), strolling around the ruins of a place I have seen in the real world is really eerie. Almost every major landmark in DC can be visited in Fallout 3, except now they are all in various stages of ruin (The Washington Monument is more or less intact, while the White House is just a massive radioactive crater) and filled with ceaseless violence.\n\nIf you have played Bethesda's other open-world RPG's like Oblivion or Skyrim, then you know how this plays: lots of quests and stuff to do, but mostly its about running around a huge world and seeing what you find. There are some glitches and crashes, so be sure to save often. GFWL is part of this, but you can tell that to bugger off pretty easily (and in fact you need to in order to use the best mods). Also while it might take a little work to get mods working, they are more than worth the effort. The superb mods for New Vegas and Skyrim found on the Nexus Network websites can be traced back to Fallout 3 mods, and many have the same creators (Fallout 3's FWE later became New Vegas' Project Nevada). In other words, this game has insane replay value by itself, and modding Fallout 3 can turn this into a game with virtually endless amounts of things to do.\n\nThe GOTY version includes the five DLC's, which are a mixed bag of awesome, competence, and failure. Broken Steel is probably the best since it allows you to play after the end of the main story, along with the host of additional content it adds. The Pitt is a dark atmospheric journey into the industrial ruins of Pittsburgh filled with gray morality and disturbing choices. Point Lookout sends you into a similarly immersive swamp area with lots to explore and one of the most memorable (and by far the foulest-mouthed) characters in the Fallout series. But the other two DLC, Operation Anchorage's linear adventure into a simulation of a great battle before the apocalypse (It's ok) and Mothership Zeta's killing spree through an alien spaceship (ugh...), fall far below the other three in quality. Regardless, all of them add more to the game and give you plenty of new toys to use in the main game.\n\nI've heard this game has some issues with Win7 and newer operating systems, but I don't know anything about that since I'm still using the same PC I used when I first played this game so many years ago. I do believe there are fixes, but people with those newer OS's should look into them before buying this (or just get it on sale)\n\nRegardless of its bugs and other issues that keep it from being perfect, this is one of my favorite games of all time, and that's really all you need to know. Buy it. Play it. Like it. Or else I will call you a communist and point Libery Prime your way.\n\nCommunism is the very definition of failure. :P","November 21, 2014","true","640.1"," 163 of 193 people (84%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","84","163","193","64","19"

Create your own unique character, male or female, and quickly escape to learn that the nuclear war from long ago has left a wasteland topside. With humanity struggling for survival, mutants occupying the DC ruins with a mysterious agenda, and the various irradiated creatures of the waste, the setting feels like "Fallout". Play how you want, investing in the skills you choose to develope your character to reflect your play style.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nAt the time the graphics were not bad, but not good either. I would give some leneincy to Bethesda however, considering how large and content rich their open world games are. Character models could be stiff as well, but I was able to overlook this because of the sheer variety of locations, items, people and creatures you interact with.\n\nSound: 9/10\nOne thing i'll always credit Bethesda for is having so much voiced dialogue. Every NPC has voiced dialogue despite their importance, greatly improving immersion. I was also impressed with the radio stations. Hours and hours of music and dialogue between several different radio stations made the long walks to new destinations less of a bore. As far as Audio effects go i'd say most were well done. Some guns didn't sound like they had enough "bang" to be realistic, but the energy weapons and melee sounds were entertaining.\n\nPlayability: 9/10\nAmazingly customizable, even more so with mods. You can make your character look how you want, play how you want, and do what you want. Use the weapons and tactics you want to use. If you want to go off and explore 30 minutes into the game you can, and it's just as rewarding/interesting as following the main quest. I only knock a point off of this due to the many bugs/issues people had at the release of this game. While it's improved drastically, there is still the occasional crash, glitch, or corruption.\n\nEntertainment: 10/10\nThere are literally hundreds of hours of fun to be had here. A lot of people complained about the main quest, but I found it to be interesting and more importantly, rewarding. The main quest however, is just a tiny piece of the games content. 90% of the entertainment can be found by just exploring on your own. The character customiztion enhances this, making a lot of interactions and situations unique to your character based on their skill set or decisions.\n\nReplayability: 10/10\nThe amount of customization options and content ensure that no two playthroughs are the same. I've made half a dozen characters and still discover new things in this wasteland...","June 6, 2015","true","6.0"," 101 of 114 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","101","114","7","6"

The best in the series, falling shortly behind Fallout 2, the god of such RPGs, in my opinion. If you care to put some time into optimizing the bugs and tweaking settings to make it run propely, this is a damn near perfect game by our beloved Bethesda. Expanding the universe of the already exciting post-nuclear America, we're shown what happens to the area surrounding Washington, D.C., called "The Capital Wasteland". A rather grimmy environment that is packed with creepy and eerie surroundings. There's not one moment in the wasteland where you can feel truly safe from the mole rats to the Deathclaws wanting to rip your head open with their giant fangs. Did I mention they're ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying?\n\nGameplay has stayed somewhat true to its predecessors, you still have the V.A.T.S. system, but it's no longer turn-based, as you'd guess. The story is not the greatest, it has never been in the Fallout franchise, but what makes up for this is all the other stuff you can do in the Capital Wasteland. There's tons of different sidequests to do, multiple unique weapons and other stuff to collect, such as the bobbleheads - which increase your stats depending on which ones you pick up. The world is giant as you would expect, about 100+ locations to discover and, potentially, loot.\n\nRating: 9/10","August 11, 2013","true","56.3"," 159 of 198 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","159","198","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xNoahx/recommended/22370/","xNoahx","xNoahx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xNoahx/","263 products in account","Just to clarify with you, I have been playing Fallout 3 ever since I was ten years old (yes, a ten year old played this game). I remember begging my mom for it day after day ever since the first day it was released. When I saw that lunchbox (collector's edition) shaped present under my tree, I opened it instantaneously and saw my dream present. I ran up to my room, launched it on my Xbox 360, and experienced one of the best things I had ever seen/played in my life. I think that overall, I have accumulated over 1200 hours playing this one game, so now you know that I have some experience with it. Moving on to the review...\n\n*By the way, I wrote this review as a huge piece, but I decided to divide it up with headers if you want to learn about a specific aspect only.\n\n\nINTRO and CHARACTER CREATION\nFallout 3 is set in a post-apocalyptic version of Washington, DC. You are a resident living in Vault 101, one of the many underground shelters built by a company named 'Vault-Tec' before the bombs dropped in America on October 23, 2077.  About 200 years later, the game starts you off with a thirty minute prologue. You begin right at birth where you create your character's appearance and eventually set his/her's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes and your TAG skills. If you played the original Fallout or Wasteland games, you will be very familiar with the character creation system. Basically, you have 33 points to work around with that can be placed in Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck and you will excel or be weaker in certain areas depending on where you allocate these points. TAG skills on the other hand raise three of your skills by +15 to give you boosts in certain areas when you start off.\n\n\nPLOT/STORY and QUESTS\nIn the beginning of your life, everything is fairly normal in the vault. You are raised by your single-dad, James (voiced by Liam Neeson), and deal with the usual experiences of childhood such as birthday parties, friendships, bullies, and school. Once you reach the segment when you are nineteen years old (five segments at ages 0, 1, 10, 16, and 19), things start to go wild when your dad leaves Vault 101 without you. Naturally, you decide to escape the vault yourself to find dear old Dad and discover why he left and where you can find him. Along the way, you will run into extremely diverse characters ranging from a grizzled man who is the sheriff of a town centered on an undetonated atomic bomb, a ghoul-hating, deceptive old geezer who owns a refurbished hotel, a psychotic, Russian pimp who is willing to sell his women's "services" to anyone who has enough caps (currency), and even aliens. I won't say anything more about the plot, but in my opinion, Fallout 3 has a very personal main quest that will pull your heart strings on numerous occasions.\n\nAccompanied by the main quests are an insane amount of side quests that will lead you to the many interesting settlements across the Capital Wasteland. They range from simple assassination and extortion missions all the way to solving a crisis between two "superheroes" disrupting a town or managing a cannibal situation. Whenever you play Fallout 3, your quest tab in the Pip-Boy 3000 will always have at least something in it for you to complete and you will never be left empty handed - especially with the amazing mods out there (I will get into that later).\n\n\nUSER INTERFACE\nSpeaking of the Pip-Boy, it is your main user-interface while playing. With the press of a button, your status, karma, missions, map, items, notes, and radio will all be easily accessible to you. It is a great, clean interface that makes everything very manageble for the player.\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nOne thing that is easily overlooked with Fallout 3 is its incredible soundtrack. All of the music is from the early-mid 20th century and it perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game. Eventually, you will know many of the songs note for note and for some reason, I have not gotten tired of the music six years later. However, the ambient soundtrack is another huge strength for the game. When you are exploring the Capital Wasteland without the radio playing on your Pip-Boy, you will get to hear the creepy atmospheric music play in the background. It will build up the suspense in you and keep you always on the lookout for any nearby threats. The combat music is good too and it will make encounters feel more deadly and action-packed.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAs for the gameplay, the shooting mechanics are ok, but not the best. There is no iron-sights capability without mods, so if you are playing this on console or without the Fallout Script Extender, FOSE for short, then you are going to have to aim with a tiny UI crosshair. This is a bad system, but it is managable due to slight auto-aim. I think that the auto-aim was added with the intention to correct this flaw, but once again it can be removed using mods (we are getting there :P) and it is not a big deal. There are a variety of guns in the game that range from the categories of small guns (pistols, rifles, etc.), big guns (miniguns, rocket launchers, FAT-MAN's, etc.), energy weapons (laser and plasma pistols and rifles), and explosives. Melee combat is basically the exact same as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion so if you liked it in that game, you will enjoy it in Fallout 3. You can go unarmed or use a bladed or blunt weapon.\n\nWeapons are not the only things to consider in Fallout 3. Secondary skills like repair, medicine, and speech all carry just as much weight as the combat skills. It is even possible to make characters that focus exclusively on non-combat skills and have hireable companions do all the killing for you. This is the beauty of the Fallout games, any character build can be viable as long as you do what is necessary to make it work.\n\nAs you progress throughout the game your character gains xp by completing tasks like killing, discovering new locations, lockpicking, hacking, passing speech checks, completing quests, and more. When you reach the xp requirement to advance in level, you can allocate your skill points (amount of skill points determined by intelligence) to any of the thirteen skills accessible to you. This does not follow the "practice makes perfect" levelling module that The Elder Scrolls uses.\n\n\nMODS\nThis is the big one that you have been waiting for! The Fallout 3 nexus (fallout3.nexusmods.com) at this moment contains 13 526 files available to download for free to enhance your Fallout 3 experience, and the number grows daily. Just about anything can be tweaked or created by using the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or G.E.C.K. for short, and can be uploaded to the nexus for others to try out. You have probably heard of mods that are commonly used like Fallout Wanderer's Edition, Energy Visuals Enhanced, RH_Ironsights, and Weapon Mod Kits, which can greatly add to the experience. These mods are excellent and add many things that should have been in the game to begin with. Just be warned, mods can cause instability with the game, save corruption, constant CTD's, and can be incompatibile with other mods. For your first playthrough I would highly recommend downloading strictly fixes and tweaks like the Updated Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch, the Fallout Stutter Remover, Fallout 3 - Enhanced Camera, the 4GB Patch, and texture mods. You could even download FWE, but I would 100% go to the preset options once you exit the vault in the FWE control panel and use the 'I Love Vanilla' preset to keep the original feel of the game. When you are done with your first playthrough of the vanilla game, go ahead and add in all the mods you want! Just make sure you know what you are doing and if you don't, follow Gopher's EXCEPTIONAL 'Fallout 3 Modding Guide' on Youtube.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWar, War Never Changes... but in this case that's good.\n\nFollow this guide - http://steamcommunity.com/app/22370/discussions/0/828937546147175081/","December 10, 2014","true","27.7"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","93","106","7","4"

Fallout 3 is the quintessential Bethesda game which puts the burden of functionality directly onto the consumer to mod the game into some shape that doesn't crash as soon as combat begins, even if it’s altering one line of code in the ini file.\n\nThe qualities of game mechanics and story are nothing without the ability to run on a machine and operating system built after 2008. When GOG and Lucasarts/Disney patch the likes of KOTOR 2 or older games into something that can easily run decades after their initial release, Betheda should be able to hire coders to take out GWFL with their Fallout Shelter war chest alone.\n","July 26, 2015","false","67.7"," 153 of 234 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","153","234","9","12"

NOTE: THIS IS CASE SENSITIVE\n\nbUseThreadedAI=0\n\nYou must change this to:\n\nbUseThreadedAI=1\n\nStep 3: Directly underneath the changed line of text, create a new line and type:\n\niNumHWThreads=2\n\nStep 4: Save the config file and then close. Then try to launch Fallout 3.\n\nThese steps are basically telling the game to launch using just 2 cores. This way it will make sure that the game will not freeze due to errors trying to find 'outdated' cores.\n\nThis fix will usually solve your problems, however if this has not worked and the game is still crashing then try these additional steps:\n\n-Uninstall Fallout 3, disable .NET 3.1 under 'Turn windows features On or Off', then reinstall.\n\n-Renaming or deleting the music folder inside the Fallout 3 folder apparently helps as well somehow?\n\nNow it should work\n\n\nGOT FOSE get it to run on win 7 & 8 here\nStep 1: Right click and go to properties. Then go to compatibility mode and set it to windows XP (Service Pack 3) and check “Run as Administrator”\n\n","April 17, 2015","false","34.9"," 549 of 899 people (61%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","61","549","899","26","19"

This game literally ruined my life, i've finished it like 14 times before losing the count. No, i'm not crazy, yes, my social life imploded. And don't trust the grandpas that will tell you this game is garbage just because they played the first 2 Fallouts and refused to play this one, they are just ignorant. In this game you live a wonderful and touching adventure in first person (Identifying so with the character), watching the character growing and becoming the hero or anti-hero that he'll be. Oh yes, because obviously you can and have to choose between choices that will influence the events and your karma. So, we have an abnormus replay factor, if we consider that we can play as good, bad, neutrals or do a mixed playtrough, choosing maybe a different type of class for the fight. AND, the game is easily moddable and has a large and active modding community: Nexus Mods. So, even if you have finished it in every way possible, you can mod it and transform it in a new game to discover. Trust me, this game is AWESOME.\n\n\nLa guerra... la guerra non cambia mai.\n\nItaliano:\n\nNon fidatevi del tempo di gioco che dice Steam, l'ho comprato anche qui giusto per averlo. Questo gioco ha letteralmente rovinato la mia vita, lo avrò finito qualcosa come 14 volte prima di perdere il conto. No, non sono pazzo, si, la mia vita sociale ne ha risentito un pochino. E non fidatevi dei vecchiacci che vi diranno che questo titolo fa schifo, solo perché giocarono ai primi due ai tempi, e si rifiutarono di giocare questo, sono degli ignoranti. In questo gioco vivi un'avventura stupenda e toccante in prima persona (Immedesimandoti dunque nel personaggio), vedendo il personaggio crescere man mano e plasmandolo lentamente nell'eroe o antieroe che sarà. Eh si, perché ovviamente potrai e dovrai fare delle scelte che influenzeranno gli eventi ed il tuo karma. Abbiamo dunque anche un fattore rigiocabilità enorme se consideriamo che possiamo giocare da cattivi, da buoni, da neutri o fare un mix, scegliendo magari anche una tipologia di personaggio diversa per quanto riguarda i combattimenti. Senza contare il fatto che il gioco è facilmente moddabile e vanta di una community di modders vasta e attiva, ovvero Nexus Mods. Dunque anche avendolo finito in tutte le maniere possibili e immaginabili, potete ancora moddarlo all'infinito e renderlo un gioco nuovo tutto da riscoprire. Fidatevi, questo gioco è perfetto.","January 3, 2015","true","1.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","28","35","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/recommended/22370/","Fluoxx","Fluoxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/","472 products in account","I'd like to start this review by saying that Fallout 3 is an absolutely magnificent beast of a game and that it will remain one of my most beloved games for ETERNITY. I first played the base game, without any DLC, and I'm very glad I did. This is primarily because even without any DLC, there are a plethora of locations to discover and explore, so many quests to do and plenty of people to help or hinder (or shoot in the face and rob). This review might be a bit long, but it is one of the few games I can play again and again, time after time, and still become 100% immersed in, so bear with me ;)\nSome spoilers may lurk below, be warned!\n\nFirst off, Fallout 3 is a single-player, post-apocalyptic game set in a post-nuclear American wasteland. As I touched upon earlier, the game world is gigantic, maybe even dauntingly so. I'm the type of gamer who has to discover everything, so for me this was a massive plus in the game's favour. This wanderlust is helped and even encouraged by a compass at the top of the screen, highlighting discovered and undiscovered locations. Once you're out into the wasteland proper, you're not really limited in where you can go, either. The amount of freedom this game gives you is refreshing and liberating, though be careful where you wander! As I found out, the answer to 'What's that thing over there running at high speed towards me?' is not 'let's go have a look', but instead 'it's a bloody great Deathclaw, and it's now chewing my face off, cheers wanderlust!'\n\nAnother point in F3's favour is that players can play in a way which suits them. Want to be a lovely guardian angel who wanders the wasteland helping others and destroying evil? Or would you be a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that goes round pistol whipping people in the face? Do whatever you want, there's a variety of options you can take regarding playstyle. Also, while the range of options for offense/weaponry isn't as massive as some other games, there's still a very wide selection. Weapons can also be built once you've found the relevant schematics, some of which, without spoiling them, are very fun to play with. You can also experiment with different types of armour, or walk round in your pants, it's up to you really. The skills and perks systems allow you to choose whatever path you want, whether that involves big guns or slapping people about with melee weapons.\n\nDLC aside, I was surprised at the relatively short length of the main questline in F3. For players who prefer to concentrate on the primary story arc, you may find the game ending somewhat prematurely. The full potential of this game really is unlocked when you take all of the side quests and exploring into account. The world is there to explore and it adds so, so much to the game. Some of the missions are downright crazy, while some locations are inherently creepy - I'm looking at you, creepy haunted place and acid-trip-gone-wrong Vault - and despite the length of the main arc, it is still an engaging storyline. I also found this game to be very immersive, especially when wearing headphones. You also have access to a radio through your Pip Boy device, and it's an oddly enjoyable experience wandering the wasteland listening to 'Jingle Jangle Jingle'.\n\nThe game is not without it's downsides however (though sometimes even they result in some classic moments). F3 will sometimes glitch out, and sometimes, it will glitch out spectacularly. The game incorporates a follower system, whereby some of the NPCs you meet in the game will agree to come and help you out, fighting monsters with you and the like; now I was wandering around with one of these followers and we happened to be walking next to those metal roadside barriers. I jumped over and ran on a little ways and turned round to make sure no beasties had snuck up on me, only to see my follower doing what appeared to be the Hokey Cokey dance on the barrier; before I could fully process this he was slingshotted into upper orbit, disappearing into the sky like a big green blob. It was okay though, he dithered out of the ether again about 10 minutes later, just in time to stop me getting done in by one of the wasteland's hostile denizens.\n\nYou may also find yourself randomly taking damage for no reason other than you trod on some clutter. Certain places in F3 are  immensely cluttered, meaning you will also at times be flung across a room as plungers apparently have a secondary function as trebuchets. When you're trying to sneak down a tunnel and not get your face shot off, suddenly treading on a cup and getting thrown into your assailants arms isn't much help. Also, if you've just left a crazy fight, uber low on health, and a wayward plate decides it hates your soul, you better prepare your ♥♥♥♥ because it's probably going to do you in if you stand on it in the wrong way.\n\nWhile the ability to play this game however you want is a massive bonus, it also has its pitfalls. You can pretty much kill any NPC you find, and this can, at times, irrevocably screw up your game. F3 also has several console commands that you might use to help you out, such as using them to unlock a pesky door you keep failing to lockpick. Some of these commands can also screw the game up, so it pays to be mindful of what you're hammering into the console if that's something you enjoy exploring in a game.\n\nOverall, I found Fallout 3 to be a wonderful game. It looks fantastic, and the post apocalyptic setting is rendered beautifully. The developers did a wonderful job here, and my only regret is that I didn't play it sooner. It also has so much replayability, you can come back to it again and again and make different choices, choose a different path. While it has its downsides, F3 makes up for them with an engaging world full of interesting characters and factions. It also helps that a lot of the bugs are hilarious and often don't have a massive impact on gameplay (I, for one, don't mind vanquished Mirelurks pinwheeling off into the sky). I do however think to get the full benefit of what this game has to offer, you have to pursue the side quests and get your explorer hat on. I also think that while I've reviewed the base game in general, the DLC adds a massive amount to the game and are well worth the money.","September 27, 2014","true","96.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","2"

However there are a few flaws.\n\nThe first one is it's legendary instability under Windows 7 or later. Depending on your setup, the game can be anywhere between unplayable and crashing at the title screen to playable, but with scrambled music due to the Directsound kerfuffle. Heck, even though the game is playable under Vista the soundtrack is scrambled albeit still fixable if you're willing to go out and buy a Creative gaming sound card if just to use ALchemy to fix the soundtrack. The biggest issue is that Bethesda is not willing to fix the bugs even though there is a huge fanbase, and is even working against the fans by issuing takedowns at unofficial patches to fix the issues. That's right, the developer doesn't want fans to play the game with proper music.\n\nSecondly, the game uses the problematic Games for Windows Live framework for a lot of things, including copy protection. Microsoft recently announced that they're shutting down GFWL. Guess what this means for the game. Sure, again there are fanmade patches to work around this, but well, it shows Bethesda's mindset.\n\nIn short, unless you're willing to go the full mile securing a decent Windows XP machine and then get your hands dirty with unofficial patches, don't buy this. If you absolutely must, get one of the console versions instead, PC gaming master race be damned. Don't get me wrong- It's a great game, and I support both consoles and PCs equally, but the PC version of this game is just not worth it and I'm not happy with the way Bethesda is treating the PC players of this game.\n\nEDIT: Just bought a new laptop and upgraded it to Windows 10. Won't run, period. The game installs, the Launcher comes up (along with a stern warning from Windows saying that this game won't run), and... nothing. Clicking on Play results in nothing happening. Additionally, the game's installation of Games for Windows Live bricked the laptop's internet connection until said item is uninstalled. It has went from bad to worse. I definitey don't recommend it now. It's a great game, but it's coding is so bad it's not even forwards compatible with newer versions of Windows.","October 18, 2014","false","33.7"," 290 of 494 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","290","494","5","15"

There are crashes for just about every operation the game performs. If you google Fallout 3 crashes you will be treated to a cornucopia of nine or more fixes for reasons the game could crash. Do you have a processor with more than one core? Crash. Do you have a laptop with an integrated graphics card? Crash. Do you have autosave on? Crash. Do you have Windows newer than Vista? Crash. Did you forget to sacrifice to Cthulu before booting? Crash.\n\nThis may not apply to you though, it seems some of these instances are more serious than others. I myself got the lucky draw of several of these risks, playing on a laptop running Win7 with an integrated graphics card and a quad core CPU.\nThe only reason I didn't return the game after rebuying it digitally was that I got it to work somewhat after doing a convoluted set of tasks that may or may not have involved cthulu in some form of desperate plea for help.\n\nSo after modding the game with a file that overrides the graphics options, fiddling with settings in both the launcher and ingame, setting compatability for WinXP and having to order the laptop to only use one cpu in task manager every time I load the game  (Because OF COURSE it resets every time you reboot the game) I got it to work, allthough it eventually crashed again and this time, having saved up it's spite for a good hour, it crashed so hard it froze my entire computer and I had to do a hard reset to make it work properly again.\n\nI do hope that I am wrong though, and that this was a case of the integrated graphics cards gremlins, which presents a much less all-engrossing scope. Fallout 3 is a legend in it's own right, a classic that everyone and anyone should be able to try out or re-visit.","December 30, 2015","false","33.4"," 36 of 56 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","36","56","9","17"

It's well worth the full price and can't wait to play it again with different perks,builds,and quest choices.\n\nNote: This is my first ever review, so I'm sorry if I forgot to mention some important or necessary details.","February 5","true","101.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Initially released in 2008 even after 6 years its far better than most post modern rpg game titles and that my dear fellow gamers says a lot!\n\nAs i am writing this review down im trying to find any flaws that may pop into my head, but truth be told i cant find anything wrong with this title. Whether its the graphics, whether its the gameplay or the story itself Fallout 3 has everything in adundace and more. I myself am still shocked at the amounts of detail this game offers and the awesome vibe u get  when u follow the story of the nameless hero of vault 101 aka the "Lone Wanderer" as he roams the derelict wastelands of his nation's capital.\n\nA world filled with crazy wannabe mad max raiders, super mutants, aliens, fascist regimes, lone rangers, mutated animals and oc what every nuclear title requires Cockroaches. To help u fight all that as with every bethesda title u have to freedom to become everything u want and use every weapon at your disposal from pipe lines to future laser tech. And if u want to add a little bit of macho manliness u can be kenshiro from hokuto no ken series and fight all your way using only your hands in unarmed combat. And if u think thats not enough to keep u alive, thats why u have Liam Neeson as your papa to remind u how awesome u really are ^^.\n\nFallout 3 game of the year edition is prolly one of the most awesome rpg titles to have been created this far. Personally i enjoyed it more than i did skyrim and truthfully i never expected this game to be so good.

After escaping from Vault 101, a subterranean nuclear fallout shelter you lived in all your life, you explore the post-nuclear war-torn wastelands of Washington DC while on the trace of your father's footsteps.\n\nPros: 1st person perspective is a huge departure from the original Fallout games that add to the immersiveness. The game offers a very large world to explore, filled with bandits, super mutants, ghouls and radioactive creatures. I love the bottle caps as currency, although you're likely to mostly barter for ammos and equipment in exchange for the incredible amount of scraps and junk you can scavenge. There's a nice amount of guns to get your hands on, drugs (or chems) to give you boosts, and an assortment of food and medicine to keep your health up, most of which is irradiated which forces you to carefully manage your radiation poisoning. Quests are plentiful, and everywhere you go you'll have people asking for help in these hard times. The RPG elements consists of your basic attributes and trained skills, while leveling up allows you to train those skills and assign perk points to an increasing list of perk options, so that you may make your character just the way you want it. The VATS system allows you do precision targeting in fights, with VATS points just limited enough to avoid over use.\n\nCons: The world design is not on par with modern post-apocalyptic setting: wastelands feel barren and empty, buildings look and feel repetitive, and the urban DC area is nothing but impassable walls of concrete rubble with only the occasional building you can actually get in. Graphics and character designs feel repetitive and didn't age well. Gameplay does include a third-person option, but it's basically the same as the first-person option except that you see your character's back. Getting started can discourage newcomers as the early game is much harder and players spend most of their time going back and forth carrying junk with their limited carrying capacity to barter for barely as much ammos as they spent getting their loot, assuming the few vendors even have any stock of ammos compatible with the guns you have.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nI'm threading lightly as not everyone will enjoy this game: it's not as lively as Fallout 4, not as deep as the Metro series, and doesn't have the personality of the Borderland series. If you're a classic Fallout fan looking for a modern take on the isometric cRPG style, you should probably be looking at Wasteland 2.

Fallout is life.\n\nIf you're like me and never played previous fallout games then you will be a bit confused when you play the game for the first time. But after about an hour into the game you simply can't stop playing.\nOkay so here is my story: i started playing this game right before Fallout 4 came out since i was too poor to afford FO4 at that moment so i watched a few reviews on YouTube and decided to play it. As i said if you're new to the franchise like me, you will be confuse about how some elements in the game work right off the bat but that dissapears shortly after 1h into the game.\n\nYou are born and raised into a vault untill the age of 19 i think because of a nuclear blast and after some incidents you are bound to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of the vault. After that the fun begins. It's YOU vs THE WASTELAND.\nThe fallout 3 world is so god damn massive that even with my 10 hours of gameplay i haven't come close to completing even 10% of the game. There is a main story and many many side quests that you can choose to do. They are all equally fun so i suggest doing them all, well, you don't really have a choise to be honest. you will be so addicted to the game that it will be hard for you NOT to go for all quests.\n\nYou can choose how you want to play the game and every action you do effects the ending of the plot.

I have found Fallout 3 to be a pretty good sequel of the previous games. Not perfect though.\n\nI have always dreamed to experience a wastelands from the first person and this game does it good. I will never forget that feel of exiting Vault 101, fantastic experience. Scavenging through the destroyed cities, looking for supplies and watching out for the mutants or bandits. This game knows how to create a "immersive experience".\nAlso it was a first time when I drank a radiated water from the toilet.\n\nBeing accompanied by a Beautiful soundtrack and Wonderful "ol'times music" from the radio doubles that effect.\n\nWhile this game lacks few details from the previous series , like extensive dialogues or better Charisma system with a lot of choices. It fixes that problem ( a bit ) with a great voice acting.\n\nBeing a hobbyist level designer by myself it amazes me how much they put detail into every location. There is a story everwhere, every placed rock had some kind of backstory or it can even lead you further.\nExploring wastelands, city ruins , old metro's never felt so amazing. Especially School or RobCo factory.\n\nI loved also how much story was put into the game, you can read about people last moments right before the bombs fell down. When you enter some abandoned office building , its like a time has stopped.\n\nNot to mention quests, while there are not that many they are very well designed and don't feel repetive or boring ( aka kill, bring, deliver ).\nThe main storyline of Fallout 3 is quite interesting too, it might feel a bit personal here but It got me hooked a lot more than a New Vegas story. Yeah it seems quite a generic becouse you are a superhero guy that is going to save a wasteland from the bad guys.\n\nI like New Vegas but even if it had better design choices, the atmosphere of the game was "lost somewhere". It lost its post-apocalyptic feel that Fallout 3 had.\n\nBut even in the last moments of the game , you had a choices. Especially if you are a pacifist ( or you like a more diplomatic way of playing this game ), then you might find it really interesting. You have a choices and they actually change something here.\nIts a possible to play this game with a a 10 INT , 10 CHA character by only talking or bluffing.  You can hire some mercs of followers to do a dirty job for you and this is what I also like here.\nYou are not limited to your gameplay style and you are not a "jack off all trades", like in the Skyrim.\n\nWhat about DLCs?\nThey are amazing and well done. Each of them offers a different theme so it doesn't feel like a "1 new quest DLC".\n\n- Operation Anchorage , its a simple shooter. Almost no dialogues , just go and shoot gooks. Some say its the worst DLC , I can agree but not fully. It still allows you to experience a pre-bombs era with a sweet rewards at the end.\n- The Pitt, this how DLCs should look. Offer a new interesting stuff and continues a amazing Fallout 3 experience.\n- Point Lookout , was more like a horror game. Really decent DLC. I would like to see a full standalone game set in this theme becouse even for a DLC it was amazing.\n- Mothership Zeta, a short funny addon where you shoot aliens and meet a lot of strange people from the past.\n- and the last one Broken Steel , which expands the main story after Fallout 3 events.\n\nBETTER DEAD THAN RED\n\nLast worlds\nIt might look old now but with a few graphic mods it looks fantastic. There is a high replay value becouse of many in-game player choices, builds and endings.\nIf you want harsher experience you might try to download some combat overhauls and all that stuff. There is a lot of good mods that kept this game fresh for a several years. As always , Bethesda games are very open to the modding. Thats a huge plus. Becouse if you don't like X part , you can fix it with a Y mod.\n\nThey gave us a game where we can shape it by ourselves, to fit your gaming tastes.\n\nJust don't make Fallout 4 look like a Skyrim, don't "casual" it too much please.","December 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppytippers/recommended/22370/","toppytippers","Monsoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toppytippers/","149 products in account","Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. When developing Fallout 3, Bethesda only kept what was valuable to Fallout. Not “valuable” to the series and what made it so great, but valuable in terms of measurable monetary value. Fallout 3 is an attempt at bringing Fallout to the “modern gamer” and it’s one of the few things Bethesda did right.\n\nRight from leaving the Vault you can see that the game is very good looking with a nice aesthetic style, too bad it’s ruined by that horrendous green tint. Despite being pleasing to look at the game world is very badly designed. Locations are randomly placed and most of them bear little or no significance at all. On top of that, there is almost no variation in the caves, buildings or those damned metro tunnels. Once you been through one, you’ve been through them all. And to make matters even worse, exploration in the game in more chore than challenge as enemy levels are scaled with the player, meaning as long as you’re decently equipped and not caught off guard, you’ll breeze right through anything.\n\nGameplay is familiar; it plays as if it’s “The Elder Scrolls IV.5: Fallout”. Bows replaced by guns, skills reworked, etc. On the surface it’s not really a bad thing, combat is more complex than TES but (much) less so than previous Fallouts. Your weapon skill determines your accuracy and damage dealt (this also applies to guns, even though that’s not how guns work) and your number of Hit Points is derived by your Endurance. Skills have been reworked so that “Tagging” a skill only increased its base by 15 points, no longer increasing the rate the skill increases during point distribution on level ups. Also, perks are now gained upon every level up as opposed to every third. Meaning by the time you reach the default cap of level 20, you’ll be nigh unstoppable. Attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) have been almost completely trivialized, doing little outside of increasing the base number for your skills. And the availability of the perk “Intense Training” only further trivialises the allocation of attribute points. Unfortunately even 5 years post release, the game is still full of potentially game breaking bugs, even after being blatantly dumbed down for the 360 and PS3. And the PC version isn’t much better either, unless you’re running Window Vista then get used to reading “fallout3.exe has stopped working” every hour or so.\n\nThe original Fallout sent you on a quest to find a replacement controller chip for your vault’s water purifier and Fallout 2 had you finding a Garden of Eden Creation kit to save your tribal village from a severe drought. Both are for the benefit of many, where Fallout 3’s main quest is personal. Leave the vault and find your father. Having a personal goal in a Fallout game was a strange choice. In the first two games you end up having a great impact on the rest of the wasteland, eradicating the Super Mutant threat or the Enclave in Fallout and Fallout 2 respectively. Fallout 3 main quest ends up being a lazy compilation of all these objectives from the previous games and seems pointless. Why are we competing against the Enclave when A: The Enclave was destroyed in Fallout 2 and B: They want the exact same thing we want. So why not team up? It’s certainly not for control of the area, because people seem to be doing fine without a source of pure water. The illusion of player choice exists but you have almost no influence on the story or game world with your decisions. The Evil path doesn’t seem like it is there for players who want to commit to being evil, but there for players who just want to murder people for the fun of it. An example of this wasted potential is in an early side quest, where you can either blow up a town for two obnoxiously stupid characters for reasons which are cryptically arbitrary, or you can save the down by defusing the bomb the town is for some reason based around. Blowing up the town nets you destroying one of the game’s main hubs for nothing more than a cool looking explosion.\n\nYou’ll find through your travels that there is a strangely limited number of NPCs/town in most of cases, a couple generic citizens with a handful of named characters. How the player can interact with the NPCs is even more limited. Dialogue has been seriously dumbed down since Fallout 2, both in terms of writing quality and sheer number of choices of what to say. Speaking of writing quality, you can’t expect me to believe that “You can’t be President. You’re an abortion of science. You need to die…” (one of the game’s skill check dialogue options) is something that a scientific mind would say, can you Emil Pagliarulo? The delivery of dialogue is just as bad. The number of voice actors is extremely small all sound uninspired, even celebrity Liam Nesson’s performance is off on a few of his lines. Bad writing, bad delivery along with bad facial animation makes NPC interaction nothing to look forward to, at least most of them have very little to say.\n\nIt’s obvious that Bethesda aren’t familiar with the Fallout universe as there are many inconsistencies to be found in Fallout 3, both with lore and its own story. Most obvious is the changes to the Brotherhood of Steel. Because of Bethesda’s apparent inability to creatively and skilfully write opposing factions with unique and believable motives, they wrote the Brotherhood of Steel to be the goody-two-shoes of the game, as opposed to them being the xenophobic tech-nuts they once were. This is explained in-game as the Elder of the BoS chapter exploring the east suddenly deciding to abandon the Brotherhood’s primary goal of recovering advanced technology to do nothing but help old ladies across the street. This “explanation” was clearly an afterthought used so that the BoS could be in the game for brand recognition. The Garden of Eden Creation Kit was just a mere collection of seeds and horticulture tips in Fallout 2, but in Fallout 3 it’s completely rewritten as some kind of magical life-bringing device to save the wastes from radiation for no reason other than it suited Bethesda’s writing. It seems that rather tell their story in the Fallout world Bethesda shaped the Fallout world around their story, which makes very little sense in of itself.\n\nThe game’s atmosphere is good as a standalone, but as a Fallout title it’s completely off. Bethesda did a great job of capturing the mood of Fallout but not its atmosphere. All this assuming you’ve turned the OST off of course. For some reason Bethesda chose to abandon the atmospheric music of the first two games in favour of the action movie soundtrack that assaults your ears. Which gives player the only difficult choice of the game: Do I listen to this travesty of an OST? Or do I listen to THREEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAWWWG, the most out of place character in the game.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fun shoot and loot game with lots to explore then this is the game for you. If you’re looking for an RPG experience with complex characters and depth in the gameplay then you’re better off looking elsewhere. It succeeded as a way of bringing a loved series to a new generation of gamers, but it alienated lots of fans of the original games.","December 25, 2013","false","76.1"," 43 of 74 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","43","74","0","17"

However I played this extensively up until the release of NV and beyond then too on my 360. I use FSE so the time doesn't get logged on steam as it removes the overlay. So my total playtime is over 1000 hours I expect. This is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece. I played it for countless hours discovering every solitary bobblehead, nuka cola quantum and all 5 behemoths. I bought the DLC on release out of a desire for more of this post apocalyptic adventure.\n\n*spoilers*\n\nI left the vault in search of a father who left me feeling betrayed.

I came back from the dead to continue my fathers dream and the war against the Enclave, I became a member of the Lyons Pride and the Brotherhood of Steel to cram a power armoured fist down their throats in an effort to rid their evil from the capital wasteland. Then I settled down in my Megaton home, and life was good.\n\n*spoilers over*\n\nThen I started all over again. This time as a knife weilding pyromaniac, then again, as a tech expert with a knack for explosives and lasers.

The world was interesting with interesting people such as a benign super mutant and old lady hoping for a violin and a man seeking freedom for his band of former slaves and the smart mouthed little p12!ck who lead a town of children. The game looked good to me with its blasted landscapes and shiny monochrome vaults and misplaced tower rising in the south, broken D.C landmarks and its mushroom clouds which conjured a sense of horror as you realise just how much devestation the power of the atom can bring. This game is one of my all time favourites. Sure it has bugs and glitches. Sure the graphics and gameplay are dated but this is still a damn good game. A lot of the old time FO 1&2 diehards hated this. And that is ok. Because sometimes the old games just feel right and this dramatic a change can turn some off. I never played the originals. I tried, but they are too dated for me and I wish I could get into them, but hey.\n\nIf, somehow, you don't own this game.

Yes, it is, with all of the good and all of the bad. The good being a masterfully crafted world that is a joy to explore again and again, with enjoyable combat, loads and loads of items, and an atmosphere that will never let you go. And the bad being the paper thin plot line and almost amusingly bad dialogues, complemented by equally atrocious voice-acting. So, in essence, it’s your usual Bethesda game: a great dungeon crawler with a bad story.\n\nLong version:When the first previews were seen about Fallout 3, everybody thought that the new owner, Bethesda just re-skinned their high-selling game, Oblivion, slapped in some firearms, and called it a day. In some manner it’s true, Fallout 3 is not like any other previous Fallout titles, which included two turn-based isometric RPGs, a TBS/RPG hybrid, and a top-down button-mashing hack-and-slash. Fallout 3 on the other hand is an action-RPG/FPS hybrid dungeon-crawler, which features all the trademarks of the Elder Scrolls series, including the good and the bad.\n\nThe Good: The game world is jaw-dropping. The ruins of Washington D. C. are a marvel to look at, and the surrounding wasteland offers plenty of smaller and larger places and secrets to discover. The map is enjoyable enough to start a new character for the sole reason of exploring it again.\nThe combat is heavily biased in the player’s favour, but it’s still fun. It’s also very violent and gory. Although it features less death animation than the old 2D games, they are so brutal it’s almost a guilty pleasure to wander around and blow the super mutants and the raiders to tiny, bloody bits.\n\nThe Bad: Practically everything that involved the writing staff. The main plotline is just a mishmash of Fallout 1 and 2 with little cohesion and a plethora of plot holes. The established lore is either misused with little understanding, or simply contradicted (again, Elder Scrolls players are probably used to this). The dialogues and the voice acting ranges from somewhat tolerable to downright painful.\nAlso, like in the case of all GameBryo engine (and Fallout) titles, it’s essential to install the community-created patches to get rid of the thousands of bugs and game-breaking glitches, including one where it’s impossible to start the game on Windows 7 or later.

You will still get an idea of the game - but there will be *SPOILERS*. So:\n\nI actually did start the game and died.\n\n9/10.\nI'm just kidding.\n\nSoon after I left Vault 101 and the sun ♥♥♥♥♥ my eyes I realized "I will have a lot of fun with this game".\nI jumped down the hill and, without a real reason, drank from the irradiated puddle directly in front of the Vault and ... died.\nAfter enabling god mode I drank from the same puddle again an ... died?!\nWhat the heck is wrong with these damn puddles?\n\nIrradiated Cheat-breaking puddles: 7.5/10\n\nI went to Megaton, a lively and beautiful little settlement (for wasteland conditions) inhabited by a lot of warm-hearted, welcoming NPCs. In an unfortunate turn of events I accidently blew the city up from a Tower miles away. I really can't recall why.\n\nAbility to blow an entire city up, avoiding really funny quests and destroying the lives of dozens of people: 10/10\n\nSome kid ran into me, asking me for help because his city was "attacked by giant ants". I knew that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tried to trick me so I kindly asked him to get lost. I also stole his sweets.\n\nMy search for Dad continued as I reached a seemingly abandoned ship, Rivet City. Instead of asking for information I just killed everyone, breaking the main story line leaving me unable to finish the game. But I pushed a hobo from the deck and nobody noticed it, so I got that going for me, which is nice.\n\nAble to break the game by killing essential NPCs: 6/10. Only amusing in the beginning.\n\nI aquired Abraham Lincoln's very own rifle. 10/10\n\nI got killed by a deathclaw. Multiply. Within a matter of minutes. On easiest mode. With god mode on. 0/10. Bethesda please nerf.\n\nI found dad, he was playing some sh*t game with Oculus Rift. Was all black and white and way too happy, so I hacked into the game and killed everyone spawning Chinese invaders. I also dropped a chandelier on a b*tch. 10/10.\n\nDad and I went back to Rivet City. He was not amused everyone was dead.\nBlablablabla, middle part, I saw Dad die, blew up a secret underground base, killed the President and their leader destroying the whole faction, saved the entire wasteland by cleaning the entire water from radiation, gave the water to wastelanders for free, helped the BoS establish their influence in D.C., helped a man liberate his home and finding a cure for a disease that turned people into ghoul-like, crawling mutants, solved the mystery of a dangerous island in Maryland, brutally slaying a tribe of uncivilized brats and solving the fight between a brain and a ghoul, I helped the US army win versus the Chinese who attacked US soil via Alaska, GOT ABDUCTED BY ALIENS, saved the entire PLANET by destroying the mothership AND killing their captain, and when I got back I was killed by THE KID I STOLE THE SWEETS FROM.\n\nTEN OUT OF FRIGGIN' TEN!\n\nBUY THIS GAME!

TL; DR This game takes awhile to get exciting, but its well worth it.\n\nRather than discuss why I recommend this game, allow me to post a slight side quest spoiler, as it really captures the moment where I fell in love with Fallout 3.\n\nAs I was exploring the wastes, I came across a sizeable tower. As I neared this tower, I saw a Ghoul (ie looks like a Zombie but is  in full control of his body/mind) aruging with someone over an intercom. Naturally I eavesdropped and discoverd the Ghoul wanted to bring his people into the tower, and the people in the tower, very clearly did not want them in.\n\nSo as the dismissed Ghoul left I naturally tried my hand at getting into the tower. As I was a human, they let me in no problem. Its there that I picked up a quest to eliminate the Ghouls, as they were become increasingly bothersome to the residents. So I ventured into the tunnels, and found the leader whom I saw previously yelling into the towers intercom. He proposed a different solution, one that would let him and his band of ghouls forcefully take over the tower.\n\nI weighed my options. Most tower citizens were not bigots, so I saw no reason to kill them to let the Ghouls in, yet I did not want to elimite the Ghouls. Not agreeing with eliminating either party, I opted for a more peaceful route.\n\nAfter a few speech persuasions, (maybe a few stealthy murders) I persuaded the majority of the citizens in the tower to let the Ghouls in. The ghouls moved in shortly after. All was well. I had done it. I had solved a problem, with both parties intact.\n\nor so I thought.\n\nI returned to check up on my Ghoul/tower residents, and I noticed something amiss. The former tower leader, was gone, and so were a few of the other human residents. Some investigating later, I found the bodies of a few of the previous Human occupants, shoved in a storage closet. I questioned the Ghoul leader, and he dismissed the murders as "accidents" related to "disagreements".\n\nI lost it. I slayed every single Ghoul in that tower, I felt betrayed. Had I not done the good thing? I made two groups coexist. In my quest for an ideal solution I did not see the underlying problem.\n\nAnd now my charecter sits in an empty tower. Filled with neither Ghouls nor Humans, contemplating the error of my choice, dwelling on my unsastisfying rampage against the ghouls that betrayed me. All the while marvelling at the game design, and how it made clear moral choices murky.","May 21, 2014","true","55.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I have it for Games for Windows LIVE and XBOX 360, now I have my 3rd copy, Steam. I have completely finished the game and every aspect it has to offer time and time again, creating countless mods with the GECK. How did I do this, you may ask? Well, I've played it ever since its US release in 2008 and played nearly every day on my old Windows XP and more recently my Windows 7. The way you get it to work on your Windows 7 is you go to your Documents > My Games > Fallout3 > FALLOUT.INI. In lines 88-89, change bUseThreadedAI to 1 and add iNumHWThreads=2 just after it. This makes the game use Threaded AI and it makes the game use only 2 CPU cores; otherwise the game will continuously crash. After you do this, the game will be more stable than Fallout New Vegas.\n\nAlright. Onto the review.\n\nSetting\nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic, retro-futuristic Washington, D.C. following the Great War between the U.S., China, the Soviet Union and other countries. The Great War occurred on October 23, 2077 which caused immense damage and destruction despite lasting less than two hours. Before the Great War, there were the Resource Wars that nearly crippled the world and brought riots to the streets, during which the United Nations disbanded, and a Forced Evolutionary Virus plague coupled with global terrorism rendered the United States paranoid of both real and imagined communist plots. Canada was annexed by the United States in order to help the U.S. war effort against the Chinese in Alaska. The fact that Canada had the plentiful resources of nearly untouched wilderness made America's effort well worth the protection the U.S.A. promised to provide.\n\nThe World\nRust, decay, and creeping vegetation infest monuments from before the Great War. Amidst the ruins of Washington, D.C., the Capitol, the Jefferson Memorial and the battered remains of the Washington Monument still stand in the desolate area that is now known as the Capital Wasteland. The central hub of civilization in the ruins of the former capital is Rivet City, based in the remains of an aircraft carrier carried far inland and beached by a catastrophic tsunami whose waters have long since receded. Other settlements include the towns of Megaton, Arefu, Tenpenny Tower and Paradise Falls. Movement through the downtown area and settlements is possible through the Washington Metro tunnels and crossing the desolate nuclear wasteland.\nThe Brotherhood of Steel community is stationed in the Citadel, built in the ruins of the pre-War Pentagon where they attempt to preserve as much pre-war technology as possible. Super mutants, who since emerging from their refuges, have waged an unceasing war against what remains of humanity, trying to invade their territory and capture them. The Enclave - the self-styled inheritors of the power of the United States government - under the leadership of their new President John Henry Eden and his ruthless second-in-command Colonel Augustus Autumn, are the player's biggest foes in the game.\n\nEmotional Impact\nAt the very beginning of the game we are introduced to the Player's father, voiced by Liam Neeson. Character development is thown at us in the first few seconds of the game, great start. I shouldn't already be bored within the first 10 minutes of a game. Fallout 3 does very well to keep it that way.\nThe one (but not only) thing Fallout 3 does fantastic is character development.\n\nThere'd be more to this review but I would be spoiling it; if you haven't already done so, BUY THIS GAME!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY! Take it from me, I have 3 copies of this game!","July 20, 2014","true","57.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

But the game is pretty underwhelming. It's not as bad as Oblivion was for me, but, it's like they took Fallout 1 and 2, and like butter stretched and scraped over too much bread, there's just so much "fallout" missing  from it that it just feels like (in Oblivion) tons and tons of empty space. The loot is underwhelming too: I hope you like finding ammo and 3 to 9 bottle caps in literally every ♥♥♥♥ing container, even when you get to the end of random areas. There is literally no reward whatsoever for exploring, and the only worthwhile items you recieve are those given to you via the main quest. The only time I stopped being bored was when I started doing the DLC, and even then I was skipping dialogue because I could honestly care less: Mass Effect is much better in the dialogue department. "But that game came later Dusty!" Well guess which game(s) came before this one and did a better job then? That's right. Fallout 1 and 2.\n\nI think the only reason I played through this game was to "see stuff" and blow things' head off in slow motion. But when that's all your game really has to offer in terms of enjoyment, it really doesn't make up for the 57 hour content does it? I didn't explore every single area in the Capital Wasteland either because A. How does this game give me the incentive to even bother? and B. because the variety of enemies (or lack there of) just didn't hold me to doing so. Even the DLC Point Lookout just had reskinned "Big Mutants" and "Medium Mutants." Instead of being medium/big green guys with no lips, they were medium/big hillbillys. The Pitt even has reskinned Feral Ghouls!\n\nI guess the reason everyone says that this era (the Oblivion/Fallout 3 era) was Bethesda's "copy/paste" age, is because they literally took what little content they made and just STRETCHED it out over a massive expanse to make it look "huge and sprawling and detailed and immersive." And it's that last word that really broke the game for me. Because of the fact that this was so cheaply "stretched" to look like a massive achievement, instead, it's like Pablo Picasso painted "Guernica" on 8x11 xerox paper, and then on the computer stretched it out to 11x64 square FEET. What do you get? A wonderful painting, but it's ♥♥♥♥ing ruined.\n\nAnd herein lies why fans like me are disappointed: Picasso (Interplay/Black Isle) DID make their quality content fit inside their canvas (game).

I had a great deal of fun with this game for the first thirty hours of play or so.  The RPG character development is strong, the FPS aspect is great considering it's an RPG, and the VATS system which is a combination of both is unique and adds a certain cinematic appeal to combat.  And of course, the perk system adds a certain excitement to leveling up that wasn't standardized for RPG gaming yet at the point of this game's release.\n\nThe open world is exciting to explore as you seem to run across all kinds of events and quests that (as far as I could tell) you weren't handheld and led to from any other place in the game.  The main storyline and the enjoyable DLCs lead you to the far corners of the map, though additional quests are plentiful.  Multiple quests also seem to offer something entirely unique, especially those related to the DLC, where you'll unlock special perks and otherwise unobtainable weaponry - weaponry which often has its own mechanics that differentiate it from other gear in the game.\n\nMy only complaint with the game, and this may be self-inflicted, is that as I neared the end and started playing the different DLCs it seemed to begin to drag.  I ended up having to push myself to start the game up, even though I, generally, enjoyed my time playing the game even then.  This could be related to your character becoming drastically overpowered if you allow them to in the higher levels.\n\nAll in all, a great game and one that I highly recommend to RPG and Post-Apocalyptic fans.  I secondarily recommend this game to FPS, as the gunplay is fun, but it won't blow your mind if that's solely what you're hopping into the game for.","August 2, 2015","true","47.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/22370/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Fallout 3, surprisingly, is a game that was actually developed and made by Bethesda, and not a fan made mod. This is surprising because from just playing it, it can be hard to tell at times. I know I'm late to writing this review, but I wanted to remind both myself and anyone who reads this of how Fallout 3 was in case Fallout 4 doesn't seem as good as it looks when it comes out. (It may not look like it with the 90 minutes I have tracked, but I have completed the game twice; once from a retail copy and more recently through New Vegas using the Tale of Two Wastelands mod.)\n\nFallout 3 is set in the Capital Wasteland, a new location set on the opposite side of the US from the traditional west coasts of Fallout 1, 2, and later New Vegas. By doing this, they allowed themselves to have a clean slate of sorts, and have more creative freedom in writing the story. So naturally, being skilled writers as they are, they just copied a bunch of stuff from the old games and rewrote it to be worse. The Brotherhood of Steel is back, only this time they're a splinter faction that's a bunch of goodie two-shoes that go from shunning you to thanking you for letting them bask in your presence over the course of one quest (the "real" brotherhood is still technically there in the form of the Outcasts, but they barely have any presence in the game). The Enclave is back for no real reason at all, considering they were pretty much ended in 2. They made up their own east coast brand of super mutant just so they could flood the game with them. Even things like caps don't really make sense, since the only reason caps were used as currency in the west coast games is because they were backed by the Hub. The whole game just feels like they went through a picture book of Fallout and saw cool things and went "hey that looks cool, let's put it in our game too!" without really thinking that much about why they would actually be there.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is a mixed bag. The exploration can be pretty fun, especially with mods like DC Interiors (which opens up a bunch of the boarded up buildings that Bethesda was too lazy to furnish), but the shooting is fairly subpar, and you can tell that the engine wasn't really built for shooting games at that stage of its development. Of course, you can always use VATS if you'd rather watch the game play itself instead, since it's effectively been turned into an easy button that lets you have 5 turns to blow an enemy to pieces and then gives the enemy one. The whole stat system is a joke, and between the rate you get perks, the perks added by DLCs, and the bobbleheads scattered throughout the world, it's almost impossible to not end up with 10 in every SPECIAL stat and 100 in every skill by the time you finish the game.\n\nBecause it's basically impossible to specialize in any particular ability due to inevitably having to specialize in all of them, and the fact that the game doesn't really give you any major choices that have actual consequences, it can be difficult to feel like you're actually roleplaying in Fallout 3. But that's fine, because it's pretty much impossible with the dialogue anyways. The dialogue options are, as best as I can describe them, schizophrenically written. You can blow up an entire settlement and laugh it off, then five minutes later meet a group of people you believe to be cannibals and have no dialogue option to say anything other than something negative towards them. At one point early in the game you meet a ghoul bartender, and your only options are two choices of mocking him and the last option, "Let me think about it for a moment, my good man.", which is so cringey that I can only assume that if Bethesda's animators had any talent it would be accompanied by an animation of the player character tipping an imaginary top hat and taking a puff from a wooden pipe. Most of the intelligence choices are just repeating what someone just said to you back to them in a summarized form written in an overly wordy way, and a lot of the speech checks go beyond ridiculousness in terms of convincing people or things to do things they would never realistically do in a single sentence. The game has a karma system, but I don't know if it's even possible to keep a negative karma level because of how much of it you get dumped onto you just for things like killing ghouls or raiders (which are impossible to allign with because Fallout 3 has no faction system), but it doesn't really matter because it's not even that much fun to play evil. There are no real meaningful evil choices, just a bunch of "for the laughs" things. There are one or two noteworthy evil moments and then the rest of it is just "ahaha i shoot you in the face" options in dialogue that just aren't really fulfilling, and some of them are just plain nonsensical and make no sense for the player to do, like the one at the end of the Broken Steel DLC. The game also has two factions that hunt you down depending on whether your karma is too high or low, but while the evil karma version is a group of lawbringers who are hunting you down because you're a known criminal, the good varient just gets Talon Company, a mercenary unit that Bethesda just made up and gave no backstory aside from "they're bad guys and so they want to kill good guys because they're really bad people!" and set them loose on you.\n\nThe DLC is about what you would expect so far. Operation Anchorage is essentially just a 3 hour crappy military corridor FPS with a few good rewards, Mothership Zeta is a crappy space corridor shooter with a few good rewards, and Broken Steel is only worth playing because of the fact that it basically forces you to after the end of the base game. The Pitt and Point Lookout are basically the only ones that I would consider "good", with the former being a brief but interesting quest line and a relatively fun collectathon with some good rewards and the latter being the only dlc to give a more open experience in a new map with new side quests and things to explore. If it wasn't for the fact that the GOTY edition costs the same as buying regular fallout 3 + point lookout + the pitt I'd just tell you to buy those, but oh well.\n\nFallout 3 is what I would consider a "popcorn RPG". It's the kind of game where you can spend 100 hours just exploring the wasteland and looting buildings and doing side quests and then remember that there's a boring main storyline for you to do, but it's not a game where you have to make choices or develop a character or anything associated with more in-depth RPGs, and while to an extent I feel that way about all of Bethesda's post-Morrowind RPGs, Fallout 3 in particular exemplifies the concept. If you're new to the Fallout series you may love it, or if you've played them all you can probably still just forget that it's a Fallout game and have fun exploring, but it's both a terrible RPG and a terrible Fallout game. It's extremely unstable on its own, so either modding it to high heaven or playing it through New Vegas in the A Tale of Two Wastelands mod (which requires both games and all of their DLC) is basically required. If you have time to kill and just want to relax in the wasteland for a little while, there's no reason not to buy Fallout 3 if it's on sale and you've got nothing else to play, but there just isn't anything exceptional that would prompt me to actively recommend the game. Hopefully Bethesda will have learned from New Vegas when we get to play Fallout 4.","October 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 53 of 96 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","53","96","5","7"

Fallout 3 takes us to Vault 101, where you play as a male/female character of your choice who leaves the vault to search for their father. Along the way you encounter struggling towns, various NPC's, complete quests, explore, and dungeon delve buildings, ruins, and other vaults as you progress through the story.\n\nFallout 3 is a First Person RPG where you interact with your environment and engage in FPS-style combat with enemies. It has an impressive list of voice actors and an immersive story that pulls you into the world of the Post-Apocalyptic Capital Wasteland, essentially the ruins of what was once Washington, DC. Fallout 3 was a blast to play on the PS3, as well as the PC and spawned 2 sequels which take place after the events of 3. If you enjoy post-apocalyptic games as well as FPS combat and RPG's, I recommend picking this game up and giving it a try. The Game of the year edition comes with all 5 DLC's included, so make sure you pick up this particular edition to get the full Fallout experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/22370/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","Fallout 3 is one of the best examples of the FPS-RPG Hybrid genre, combining the sprawling depth of a traditional isometric RPG  with the reflex-rewarding immersion of an FPS.  Rather than dumbing down the game to fit the expectations of the fast-twitch FPS gamer, Fallout 3 keeps nearly all of the Fallout series' trademark complexity, nuanced plot, numerous areas to explore and seemingly endless sidequests.  All this adds up to a truly HUGE sandbox game that you can easily spend hundreds of hours on, never getting bored.\n\nThat is not to say that Fallout 3 is perfect.  Like most Bethesda titles, Fallout 3 has quite a few bugs, ranging from minor to serious.  Hardly surprising given the sheer scale of the thing, and percentage wise it's a very small portion of the game.  Of course, the bug problem itself leads me to mention one of the best things about Fallout 3: moddability.\n\nFallout 3 is one of the most moddable games ever released on PC, with mods not only supported but encouraged by the publisher.  While you can't get into the nitty gritty of the engine itself using the SDK (unlike most Source or early Unreal games), basically everything else is fair game for being modded.  This can range from the mundane to the fantastic, anything from increases in weapon damage to entirely new plots with numerous side-quests and fully voiced dialog.  Fallout 3 in itself is an amazing game, but with the appropriate mods - chosen from the literally thousands available - it can become truly awe-inspiring.\n\nMods can also include fixes to the bugs that Bethesda left in the game.  Yes, Bethesda may not have fixed all their mistakes in Fallout 3, but they at least left behind tools so that the fans can.\n\nAll that said, what you should take away from this review is that Fallout 3 is a really, really, really good game.  It takes very little time - as little as fifteen minutes - before the game has thoroughly sucked you in, and once you're hooked you can spend literally hundreds of hours playing and enjoying.  At time of writing I have more than 200 hours logged on the game and there are STILL areas in the Capital Wasteland I am encountering for the first time.  That's serious replayability.","May 6, 2014","true","271.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Lots of exploration, with a story and environment I like. "But hey, why's this review a negative review?" Well, because the game, even though I love it to death, literally CANNOT BE PLAYED.  Instead of Bethesda and Steam working things out, they just plop a "not optimized" notice on the page and expect it to be all ok. With newer games coming out with higher requirements, this poor game is left in the dust. And if you DO get it to work with the help of the plethora of guides out there that ask you to do the near impossible, not only does it crash a lot, but the Game of the Year Edition isn't even considered what you're playing. See my 0.3 hours? Should actually be close to 500 or so, but I'm playing "fallout3" and not Fallout 3 GOTY Edition. However, there ARE methods to help reduce crashing, although there's no garuntee it'll work for you. I tried all these methods, but they MAY work for you.

I know, I know, I have a huge backlog and I want you to buy me Game of The Year edition that will probably swallow hundreds of my hours that I don't have if I don't give up."\n\nSoon enough, Fallout 3 GOTY landed in my library.\n\nI consider myself to be a completionist, however, my work and habits prove I've become more of a collector. I was happy to get Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics on GOG for free when they were removing them from their library back in 2013. Then I've replayed Fallout 1 and started playing Fallout 2, creating character named after my daughter. I've stopped middle game and decided to return later (never did, but I will probably at some point). Same friend that got me Fallout 3 GOTY gifted me Fallout: New Vegas that I also didn't complete, but I've used to justify my laziness as 'my own plan to play the series in chronological order'. So of course, when I got GOTY, I was stuck and needed to deliver - at least to myself.\n\nFallout 3 GOTY stands independent of the other titles in the series. It was Bethesda's revolutionary change of perspective. Instead of old isometric view, Bethesda went with first person, immersing playerbase even deeper in 50's inspired postapocalyptic nuclear wasteland. We went upclose and personal with mankind's ♥♥♥♥ed up end.\n\nTo make a long story short and to avoid any spoilers, your main mission in F3 is to find your dad who left Vault 101. That requires exiting the Vault yourself for the first time in your life. Your first encounter with other humans and their pitiful destinies will probably happen in the city of Megatron from where your adventure will explode in every single direction possible. It is hard to describe Fallout 3 properly in short form. However, if we say we're having an unbeliveable, mature, choice-and-consequence heavy RPG title that sometimes intentionally goes silly and offers almost unlimited freedom along sidequests more complex and interesting than the main questline, we wouldn't go wrong.\n\nF3 GOTY comes packed with base game and additional DLC materials that will make you chase ghouls, mutants and raiders for tens and hundreds of hours, even in military virtual reality program. Its rich lore, interesting characters and unexpected plot twists here and there, along with the possibility to drive the game your way based on your choices is what makes it so appealing. It's hard not to enjoy sounds of rustling wind in the outskirt of devastated Washington DC. Letting go and losing yourself in loneliness of human misery never felt this good.\n\nGame fails a bit short in the shooting section. Hit detection is appearantly offset to simulate RPG system of risk and chance, luckily for us, F3 integrated V.A.T.S. queuing system that lets you hack the enemies to pieces, cripple their limbs and create some dramatic fighting scenes, all based on some sophisticated dice rolling.\n\nBut, here comes the big but(t). It's silly to recommend Steam's version of Fallout 3 GOTY. Simply, it doesn't work.\n\nI was informed of several issues that Windows 7, 8 and 10 users were complaining about before I've decided to play the game. But how severe these problems are, I had no idea. My hours in the game were characterized by random crashes, sound and graphic problems and unbeliveable glitches. I've tried it all - vanilla play, unofficial and official patches, different and recommended high rated Nexus mods, uninstalls and reinstalls, LOOT launcher installation. Latest problem occured literally out of nowhere. After 3 hours of installing and reinstalling drivers from different sources and ultimately completely messing up my display settings without being able to run the game, I've decided to quit.\n\nI feel sad and angry. Fallout 3 is, in the end and as much as I've managed to play, a great, great, loveable game. However, Bethesda's ultimate and insolent refusal to patch this gem is the reason why you shouldn't get it. Chances you will end up with good game badly broken are pretty high and that's something not worth risking. There are no excuses for not fixing what can be fixed, especially when almost 20 years old original and sequel are running flawlessly on modern systems.\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review?

Then, in game, there are other issues you have to constantly be aware of or else your game will crash. For example, did you know you cannot save over old save files? If you do, and load your game, it will freeze and crash every single time. There is no in game warning for this, just as there is no warning on the game page that this game is incompatible for most computers made after 2007 (as I've said, you have to read through third party guides and install third party mods just to play the vanilla version of the game).\n\nI do not know how it's legal to sell a broken product with no official warning given to potential customers. They use weasel langauge and say that the game is not 'Optimized' for Windows 7 and beyond instead of outright saying it will not work, which is the issue. Hopefully some people decide to read the reviews about the game on Steam and realize just how much of a headache they'll be going through just to install and play the normal, unmodded version of the game. And don't forget - never, ever save over an old save file (a bug the programmers never warn you about nor one they give you option to disabled) or else you can say goodbye to hours of gameplay.\n\nFallout 3 - the game itself is great. Installation is a massive problem (for no reason, since it's still possible to install with third party mods not officially created or endorsed by Bethesda, the game creators), and there are too many game ruining bugs. Seeing as how it's been years since this game was released, these issues are obviously never going to be addressed by the company - I suppose it's just easier to slap an extremely vague warning (hidden in the middle of the sale page) and just keep letting unaware customers continue buying a game they don't support than it is to have some integrity and intiative and fix the game. If you must play this game, find circular means - Bethesda obviously does not care about their customers consuming experience.\n\nGiven their treatment of customers, I will not buy (nor recommend anyone else to buy) any other games from Bethesda, Fallout 4 included. They are still charging a hefty price for a broken game (giving no warning to customers about the broken software), which can only be played with software created by dedicated fans who receive a sum total of zero dollars for making Bethesda's product workable for them. What a despicable company.","November 19, 2014","false","0.3"," 77 of 144 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","77","144","3","5"

Originally completed on the PS3 years ago, the quality of Fallout 3 warranted another purchase for the PC. It was a purchase that I did not regret.\n\nFallout 3's 1950's representation of a post-apocalyptic setting is both visually stunning and conceptually very well done. It manages to deliver an astonishingly accurate world that attempts to keep what we know of the 50's in check, yet sprinkling it with a dose of future technology and the consequences of said technology - which effectively suspends the 50's style similiarily to what the Dark Ages did after the enlightened Renaissance period. Fallout 3's characters are as much "of the times", as they are diverse. The NPC's mannerisms, beliefs, and way of life are decidely 50's oriented. There are the mutants, the human enclaves, the militant powers, the underdwellers, and the radioactive fauna. These factions breathe life into an admittedly grey, dead world (as befits a post-nuclear setting).\n\nFallout 3 is a dark, gritty story based on the freedom of exploration, role-playing, and as such is what makes the game so incredibly entertaining. There is a linear story, but it's not essential to get the feel of the game because in almost every title of this game type, the side quest content far outweighs that of the linear "campaign". Mechanics are simple, the movement a tad clunky, and the combat a tad frustrating. Melee is essentially whack and run, and aiming down sites is near nonexistent. To combat this shortcoming Fallout 3 makes use of VATS, which enables you to aim and fire at specific parts of the body, greatly increasing accuracy and a chance at survival. This aspect incorporates melee as well. There are two incredible soundtracks within the game, the usual OST and in this case, the radio station. These two soundtracks add much to the overall quality of the atmosphere, and in turn the end product.\n\nI highly recommend the fantastic Fallout 3.","December 6, 2013","true","86.5"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","5"

First of all lets get this out of the way. The game is old, and the graphics aren't the best. But Bethesda doesn't care about graphics in their games. They care about the world and the story, and how free you are. You walk around post nuclear Washington DC. Being the good guy, bad guy, dude who doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing care, or whatever you can come up with.  The game never ceases to remind you of how ♥♥♥♥ed everything is. And some of the most interesting quests in rpgs come from this game. There are very few repetitive quests, unless you find the game mechanics repetitive (talking, walking, shooting.)  Another elephant I want to get out of the way; there is no aim-down-sights or sprint, and the game is not very immersive (due to bugs mostly.) But thanks to being on the pc, you don't have to worry about most bugs (game breaking ones, ones that make you reload to the last save because you are stuck in space), due to mods! ADS, sprinting, and bug fixes out the ♥♥♥ (for modding tutorials, I suggest gopher on youtube.) Basically after playing this game again just using about 2 or 3 mods, I realized what a jewel fallout 3 is, it gets you attached to things very easily, but mostly things like Megaton, robots, that black lady who gives you stimpacks, Hobo McDirtFace, even ♥♥♥♥ like teddy bears (if you have hoarding problems this game doesn't help.) But one thing you don't get attached to is your dad. I mean the story is engrossing but you don't really see much of him. Liam Neeson voices him but he only has about 30 or so lines because the amount of times you see is slim. You look for your dad half the game and you would suggest Bethesda to do something with the talent they had.\n\n\nAll in all, great game, mods make it better.\n\n\nI tried to make this review trying not to be a parrot, but some things I think are shared opinions.","October 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

The most important of its strengths in my opinion, however, is its ability to immerse the player in an atmosphere filled with choice, unique experiences, and a world worth exploring.\n\nThe Fallout franchise has always done these things right, but Fallout 3 brought a new atmosphere and a new set of mechanics to an already great model. These mechanics all work extremely well and make Fallout 3 a revolutionary game. The combination of the dialogue system, V.A.T.S., and the functionality of the Pip Boy make gameplay smooth yet still very refreshing. The primary narrative is strong and supports the immersion of the gameplay, while the entirety of the wasteland is filled with areas full of depth and story that is present in almost no other game.\n\nRevisiting Fallout 3 has only confirmed the undeniable strengths and with each playthrough, the player will surely find new areas and characters worth exploring and experiencing. For these reasons, Fallout 3, along with its predecessors, stand alone in their own sect of games. Along with these strengths, Fallout 3 added a certain undefineable charm as it broke into the 3-dimensional realm.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwarisover/recommended/22370/","kwarisover","Lord Kane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwarisover/","384 products in account","Third canonical entry of the beloved classical RPG franchise Fallout. First one ever produced in a decade, if you discount the spin-off Brotherhood of Steel tactical RPG and the action game released on Playstation. Also the first title since Bethesda took over. This one generate quite a bit of controversy within the Fallout community, largely due to the fact it plays different than previous titles, as Bethesda decides to use the Elder Scrolls' engine based on GameBryo, which obviously is what they excel at.\n\nContrast to previous titles' isometric CRPG aspect, Fallout 3 is recommended by the developer to play in First Person perspective, even though a third person is present in the game. Some may mistake this game as an FPS on first glance, but rest assured this is still a pretty heavy CRPG, where character development, stats, skills and perks play the most important role in terms of gameplay, rather than the player's aiming skill.\n\nSuffice to say, Beth created this Fallout title with love and homage to the original titles produced by Interplay, who sold the license and rights to them. This curiously gathered a lot of hate within the community towards them, even though in my opinion it was Interplay's fault to mismanage itself and go bankrupt. Other than the perspective, this game plays and feels like a true Fallout title, all the concepts and aesthetics were nicely adapted into the familiar Elder Scrolls-like gameplay, which personally is quite a happy mix due to my loyalty to that series.\n\nNeedless to say, the gameplay leans more toward Elder Scrolls titles rather than the old Fallout games in the 90's. Some may see as a problem, but I don't. Especially if you live in 2015, you can literally find spiritual successers to every classic RPGs: Wasteland 2 to Fallout (and of course the original Wasteland, which Fallout is loosely based on), Pillars of Eternity to Baldur's Gate, Torment: Tides of Numenera to Planescape, Divinity: Original Sin to Ultima, and a bunch of excellent tile-based dungeon crawlers to the classics like Eyes of the Beholder in early 90s. So you see, Fallout 3 being different than before isn't a problem for me personally, and it surely wasn't a problem for the original Fallout crew, of which a large proportion of developers work for Obsidian to strike a deal with Beth to work on a title truer to the original spirit of Fallout to based on Fallout 3's base game. See New Vegas.\n\nOne benefit of Beth's taking over that no one can deny is obviously the production value. Fallout 3 is a step up in almost every direction up from Oblivion, which FO3 is built upon. Some folks jokingly name the new Fallout as "Oblivion with guns", which indeed tells some truth. Gone is the old turn based tactical combat, in with the new hectic real-time action with pausible VATS system which allows you to plan and spend your action points. I wouldn't favor one system over the other,  but FO3 does bring some fresh air to this aged franchise.\n\nWorldcrafting wise, Beth does what it does best. Exploration is rewarding as ever. This time around, the game is set in DC and has an east coast vide, as opposed to the West Coast settings in Fallout 1 and 2. You can definitely tell this is due to Bethesda locating in Maryland. The gameworld itself is slightly smaller than that of Oblivion. This doesn't mean it has less details. If anything, the world in this game is even more vibrant. Beth clearly learnt their mistake with the generic tones of the Radiant system in Oblivion and improved upon it. This also paved the road for future titles like Skyrim and Fallout 4 to progressively become more and more organic and polished. The excellent sequal New Vegas developed by part of the original Fallout crew also take advantage of Fallout 3's engine and many of the existing gameworld assets. which is a nod to Beth's skill and will to inherit this franchise.\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10. A true Fallout fan's must have. Niche audience of open world and CRPG genre will also find quite a bang for your buck. Although avid fans only waiting for Van Buren project should be advised to find nostalgia elsewhere in titles like Wasteland 2. You may reserve your opinion towards many of the new aspects of this new title, yet nobody can deny this is hell of a game and a truly a rewarding RPG experience.","November 18, 2015","true","82.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/22370/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","Fallout 3 is a very good RPG, with a lot of action thrown in it, and a very good story. Set in a post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war, you'll find yourself travelling through the Capital Wasteland, which used to be Washington and its surrounding areas. Even though the world is post-apocalyptic, it still has a quite distinctive 50s feeling to it, as history in the Fallout universe is different from ours.\n\nThe story starts out somewhat simple. You live in Vault 101 with your father, but after he leaves one day, you must escape the Vault, and search for him. However, it's not as easy as it sounds, as you'll end up in the middle of a conflict for control of the Capital Wasteland.\n\nThe GOTY edition, which I'm reviewing, includes all 5 DLCs released for Fallout 3; and I'd say it's worth it getting this version over the regular edition, as they add a lot of content. From the snowy landscape of Alaska in Operation: Anchorage, to the final frontier, space, in Mothership Zeta, they all offer new quests, locations, and items; as well as enemies. Broken Steel, in particular, picks up the story from where it ends, adding three new quests after the main story.\n\nThe setting, as I mentioned, is based around the area of Washington, and there's plenty of places to discover. Even though it's not a faithful recreation (and even if you've never been to Washington), you can recognize some of its famous landmarks, like the Washington Monument, or the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's RPG elements are quite good. Like in almost every RPG, you earn experience points and level up; each time you do, you get to distribute several skill points into the different skills, and you also get to choose a perk, which grants you extra abilities. What makes Fallout's system special, however, is, well, its SPECIAL system, in which, at the moment of creating your character, you define his seven main attributes (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck), which not only affect your skills, but also things like your maximum health or carrying capacity. As far as the combat goes, it's pretty much an action game, and can be played both in first and third person; however, your skills will affect how well you do in combat. Of course, being an RPG, it's not all about combat; you'll find yourself doing several quests, even outside the main storyline, helping people all around the Wasteland. There's also tons of dialogue, you can always find someone who might have some valuable information for you, or you can even avoid some combat situations simply through dialogue!\n\nWell, in conclusion, I think this is a very good game, and I recommend it. It's a great experience, after all. I'd also add that you should check out Fallout: New Vegas as well; I haven't reviewed it yet, but it was the first Fallout game I've ever played, and it's as good as Fallout 3, if not better.","February 15","true","95.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Finally, after more than 10 years I would be able to continue my adventures in my most beloved franchise ever 'Fallout' (I did not count Fallout Tactics, which I also loved).\n\nI was sceptical at first, since this would be first Fallout game made by Bethesda. Like others, I did not just want a 'Oblivion with guns', also being on the East-Coast would feel differently, compared to the other games in the series.\n\nRight from the start the hand of Bethesda was clearly visible. Starting the game as a baby/toddler/teenager was probably not what Black Isle would've done. Also the storytelling is a bit more childish and immature (like in Oblivion). The story was praised by many and even got an award for best story that year. In my opinion, the story(telling) is one of the worst parts about the game. If you have played Fallout 1 and 2, you will notice the story of Fallout 3 is simply Fallout 1 & 2's story put together. There are also weird locations/quests and multiple things that do not really add up to the Fallout lore.\n\nAside from the story, Bethesda still did manage to create a beautifully post-apocalyptic world and kept the Fallout feeling mostly throughout the game. Graphically, the game has aged but it's still well playable.\n\nThe thing I love most about Fallout 3 is just wandering around the Capital Wasteland and find new locations, items/weapons/armor and/or easter eggs. Often you will enounter various enemies and npc's which either want to help you or destroy you.\n\nGameplay is fun aswell. Killing enemies feels satisfying, there are tons of weapons for you play around with, quests to finish, secret locations.... there's just too much for me to write down. simply put, Fallout 3 will most likely enjoy you for hundreds of hours and is a must-have for every RPG-lover.","March 25, 2015","true","34.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

So whereas the earlier "Fallout" games were loaded with the sorts of detail and humor which made their worlds feel alive, playing this just feels like wandering through a wax museum.  It's pretty to look at at first glance, but the novelty soon gives way to an uncanny valley type queasiness which ultimately gives way to boredom.

And if, but only if, you can read through all the faults of the game and still want it, then I would recommend it.\n\nThe story for Fallout3 is something that starts out interesting. You begin as a small child to explore the world and quickly progress through your life until your father decides to hop on out of your life. This will lead you to begin your search through the wasteland in hopes of finding your father and question why he left. Sadly this fresh new idea will leave you scratching your head by the end of the game wondering why over and over again. More than once you find yourself 'ambushed' and cutscened away unable to do anything. Othertimes you'll find yourself facing a decision where you cannot, CANNOT, choose the most reasonable option just because. Although the main story is full of these moments, I often found myself in side-quests almost slackjawed in awe at some of the situations the game placed me in. So while the main story is lackluster, there are some interesting side-quests within the game that can make up for the main story.\nCombat. Oh lord, the combat for this game. You have literally two options to pick from either you A.) Shoot thousands of rounds at an enemy until they die or B.) Use VATS to instantly vaporize your opponent with no problems. And although many might argue with my description of the combat, clearly these people have never played melee runs or min-maxed their talent points properly to become completely broken. Overall it's combat falls flat just like the TES Bethesda games which require you to simply click your Mouse 1 button enough times. Sadly dialogue with other characters often falls flat and you'll find yourself in a stale world where I truly felt ALONE despite being around ten or so characters.\nI really cannot say anything bad about the soundtrack, most of the game consisted of real world songs which were all fantastic for their time and fit in with the atmosphere that Fallout 3 has to offer.\n\nOverall the game suffers from a poor story with terrible gameplay mechanics, where the side-quests and looting seem to be the only redeeming features of the game.","November 30, 2013","false","16.7"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","32","59","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/recommended/22370/","DangerousSaiga","Dangerous Saiga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/","221 products in account","Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition is a 2008/09 post-apocalyptic role-playing game that takes place in desolate wasteland of Washington DC. You play as the Lone Wanderer, who travels on a journey to find your Father (voiced by Liam Neeson) in the wasteland. Leaving Vault 101 takes personal risks and responsibility. Would you do the same?\n\nFallout 3 starts in the year, 2277, 200 years after the Resource War (United States versus China in a fight for remaining sources on Earth) ended suddenly due to atomic weaponry inflicting against the United States and the rest of the world. Washington DC takes the most damage due to its strategic and political significance. The question remains: What was your Father’s intention to leave Vault 101? The main story is good though some people argued that the plot is decent. In my perspective, the plot is typical and good. It’s not the best or have a strong presentation, but it’s good overall. The real reason for playing Fallout 3 has to be exploration and doing major side quests. Exploring the unknown world of post-apocalyptic Washington DC feels so amazing and worrisome at the same time. These two emotions is what makes the game feel so great. The setting is unpredictable. You may find an abandoned settlement that has a mysterious past,  reading journal entries on what caused a location to fall apart, or some batsh*t crazy thing comes to you when you almost finish investigating an area.\n\nThe gameplay is primarily first-person or third-person shooter that place strong emphasis on your gameplay type. You can go guns blazing, get a companion and do some killing, conduct stealth and light skirmishes, or just explore alone in the Capital Wasteland. What makes Fallout 3’s gameplay a bit special is the V.A.T.S (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) where you “paused” the game while targeting an enemy’s legs, arms, equipped weapon, and the head. The feature is pretty nice and does help you in dire situations. However, it’s a bit unfortunate that V.A.T.S makes the game paused and not real-time. The stealth mechanic is a mixed bag. You can practically invest a lot of points towards the Stealth skill to make your stealth “level” to what suits you. If your Stealth skill is low then the enemy will “automatically” notice you even when the enemy is not facing you and you are crouch-walking towards an unsuspected enemy. What frustrates me the most was that there is no iron sight or aiming down your equipped weapon. Aiming is mostly useless and “hip-fire” the equipped weapon seems to be what’s best.\n\nIs there criticisms for Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition? Fallout 3 is definitely not perfect. There are a lot of technical issues and bugs that Bethesda Games Studios neglected. Many PC users now have Windows 7, 8/8.1, and Windows 10 and a high majority will most likely have an major technical issue that can or cannot be fixed. The games does crash to desktop in modern PC architecture due to no support of multi-core processing (when the game came out, it was dual-core). The solution is there to fix it, but it does not fully bandage the problem. The NPCs look stale, but mods do help make it better. The most critical aspect of the game is the karma system. In a post-apocalyptic setting, any person would know that there’s no (or little) black-or-white scenarios. The karma system is a good concept, but heavily flawed since conducting bad “actions” like stealing or pickpocketing is treated like a horrid sin.\n\nThe review sounds critical but why does it gives a thumbs up? The answer is simple: It is fun. I remembered when I got the Fallout 3 Collector’s Edition back in October 2008 (where you get the concept art book, featurette DVD, the vault boy bobblehead, and a lunchbox (yes, an actual lunchbox). Fallout 3 crash to desktop so often that I’ve lost count. For some reason, I didn’t too angry about it (even though I should have). Fallout 3 was the first video game that I actually got so immersive to. The setting draws you in and exploration is so much fun. Fallout 3 is one of a very few games that gameplay matters over graphics and “minor” flaws. Does the sequels like Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4 improved over Fallout 3? Certainly. Fallout 3’s default price is at $19.99 (for Game of the Year Edition). I’ve strongly recommend (for those who haven’t play Fallout 3) to get it on a steep discount of -75% ($5 USD or regional equivalent) since the game faces technical issues on today’s PC systems. Fallout 3 is certainly not top-tier game (when looking at it today), but the game was a marvelous achievement for a first-person shooter to be in an open-world setting.","November 4, 2015","true","29.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now I have Windows 7, and I fully played through all the content in this game, and what I believe they're trying to say with that is that this game has a bunch of performance issues. Fallout 3 loves to crash. A lot. As in, it made me press the quicksave button all the time so I'd make sure I wouldn't lose as much progressas I potentially could. However, I did play through everything, and I loved it. In fact, this is the second time that I've played through everything in Fallout 3. I just love the game so much that even the regular crash couldn't stop me.\n\nThe very first part of the game is so well done, very immersive and eases you into the game proper nicely. Don't expect amazing shooting mechanics, while it does have FPS mechanics (you'll never used third person camera because of how bad it is for combat) you don't play it for the shooting. You play it instead for the RPG elements, the storytelling, and the impeccable atmosphere the Wasteland offers you. It's grim, it's gory, it's gritty, it is a complete hellhole on a destroyed post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Many of the landmarks that characterize D.C in the real world are very well replicated here in its ruined and wrecked glory.\n\nThe Fallout universe itself is a joy to be in, with its 50's/futuristic quirks, power armors, aliens, big guns that really go BOOM, and freaky mutations. The game did give me quite a few jumpscares when I was caught unawares by some of the wildlife. The V.A.T.S system is awesome as you pick your favorite body part and shoot, complete with guts and gore flying everywhere as your enemies die. Good stuff.\n\nThe inevitable question when it comes to this game is: "Is it better than New Vegas or is it the other way around?" I would say that even though I slightly prefer New Vegas, both are worth playing anyway because it shows both Bethesda and Obsidian's strong (and weak) points. And both are good games in their own right.\n\nBethesda made Fallout 3. And what makes Bethesda great are both its sidequests (which are always more interesting than the main story itself) and its attention to detail in its environments. They love to litter the landscape with information, each containing a small story or information explaining why that skeleton's standing in that bathroom, for example. And sometimes it doesn't, all it shows you, all it needs, is the scenery itself that tells the story for you. This makes exploration really engaging and fun because things rarely feel they're copypasted (except the subway tunnels but there's only so much you can do to make a ruined subway tunnel stand out, though some do stand out anyway).\n\nThe quests themselves have multiple solutions and most of the time offer choice, like a good RPG should, and trust me, you can do some extreme stuff in these which will literally change the landscape, but then again, these choices and this engaging writing are severely lacking in the main quest itself, which is clichéd and ultimately really linear.\n\nI prefer Obsidian's writing overall, so New Vegas wins out on Fallout 3 for me there. Fallout 3 though, like any good sandbox RPG should do, which New Vegas does not, is allow you to keep playing after the actual ending. In NV's defense though, there are so many endings that it would be hell to program into, but still, it's something worth keeping an eye out for.\n\nFallout 3's the oldest game of the two, so it will, gameplay-wise, lack a few features NV adds in later on.\n\nLike any modern Bethesda RPG, Fallout 3 adds much needed mod support which makes the PC version by far the best, allowing you to fix many of its faults, and become an even better experience than it already is. Though I'd recommend just sticking to performance mods the first time around, as some of these mods can change the game dramatically.\n\nThe DLC for the game itself is a bit hit and miss in my opinion. DLCs like Broken Steel which let you keep playing the game after its conclusion, or Point Lookout and The Pitt, which add areas of their own with stuff to do are great, but Anchorage and Zeta, though unique, don't add to the game all that much, and you wouldn't feel like something's missing if these never came out.\n\nAll in all, I totally recommend this game, lots of RPG goodness and with mod support, can have you keep coming for more.","February 25, 2014","true","119.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

The plot, another important aspect of RPG, is as generic and un-inspired as they come, a 12 year old could've written this.\n\nIn Fallout 3 there is NEVER any sense of danger, ever, you can traverse from one end of the map to the other with ease, unlike the older games in which travelling was a major risk and each encounter felt like it could be your last. I really hope they're using a better team for Fallout 4 because if it's anything like this dumbed down generic open world FPS it's going to stink, if you really want to play a modern Fallout, I'd suggest you play New Vegas, they attempt to fix most of the issues in this mess otherwise you're better off playing Fallout 1 and 2.","November 1, 2014","false","18.0"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","3"

Got it on a random sale, because I can.\n\nFallout 3 fails in everything possible. This game is so astonishingly bad, stupid, pointless and outrageously badly put together, being basically a huge Oblivion redone mod feeding on Fallout franchise's dead corpse. The broken engine with copy-paste assets from Oblivion would not be that bad if accompanied by a solid, logical setting and not stupid characters. Just look at New Vegas, which is a good game without any overhaul mods.\n\nFallout 3 tries to implement Fallout icons, but decisions made in the process resulted more of a terrible dead body ♥♥♥♥, that a serious title trying to follow original Fallouts' premise for many, many good games. Long story short: the whole setting, environments, characters and - God please make me forget it - something which laughably is called by some people "a plot", looks like a badly written fan fic by someone who knew Fallout only from 5 minute long cutscenes video on You Tube. It has been proven many times on the Internet that nothing in this game makes any sense.\n\nI refuse to accept a notion that a sane, mature person thought that it's a good idea to put in the Fallout game a settlement built around an active atomic bomb, just to let a player with 25 skills in explosives to set it off. It's insulting.\nBut it's ok, because the most annoying character in the video games history manages to live the explosion through and says it's ok. As long we're sorry, it's ok to blow up nukes. No one wants to miss out her GENIUS FETCH QUEST.\nYour idiot dad will be just disappointed in you. As if you didn't wipe yourself after using a toilet.\n\nPeople who claim that like the originals Fallout games and Fallout 3 and try to make a statement that god-mode V.A.T.S. is in the series since the first game suffer from a schizophrenia.

Slightly buggy and prone to crashing, this game is not as stable as you would hope.\n\nHowever, the general gameplay is amazing, With masses of replayability, Fallout 3 offers something different everytime you start a new game. Want to take an all-good play style and only shoot when you deem 100% neccesary for your own safety? You can do that. Want to kill every last thing on site with no piy or remorse? You can do that. Want to breeze through the story with no care for any of the side quests? You can do almot anything in this game, and I highly reccommend this game because of that.\n\nThe graphics are pretty darn good. For an older open world RPG with such a large world size, it has aged quite well graphically, and will still look good for years to come.\n\nI have been playing this game for close to 5 hours on PC, but I have completed Fallout 3 multiple times on Xbox 360. Making the jump onto PC gaming and playing Fallout 3 could not feel better. This game is buggy, but amazing on PC and (obviously) is the platform I would reccomend you get it on (although there is about 30 minutes of bug fixing you have to do yourself, but it is 100% worth it).\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10.

Daring to move away from the past installment's sky-view strategy look and gameplay, Fallout 3 moves up into the era of the first person shooter.\n"War, War never changes." It has been 200 years since the bombs fell. In the year 2077, following the battle for the last remaining natural resources, involving China, the USA, and the USSR, thousands of nuclear missiles landed throughout the world. Those who could afford it locked themselves away in underground vaults, which would not open until the radiation subsided. You have left Vault 101, your home since you were born, in search of your father. You are the Lone Wanderer, venturing the wastes and ruins of Washington DC, now named The Capital Wasteland. A heavy atmosphere looms as the story progresses, pushing you further into something more then just finding your father and unknown past. How do you battle the horrors of the wastes? Do you rush in with the Super Sledge, slither past and pick them off from afar, or do you hold your ground in power armor with the mighty Gatling Laser? Fallout 3 allows you to play it how you want, when you want. Rush into the thick of things or mosey along with the hundreds of side quests avaliable? From helping ghouls find a home to fighting The Antagonizer alongside The Mechanist and his army of Protectretron Robots to uncovering the secrets of your past, Fallout 3 is one of the true RPGs ever made.\nFor an added bonus: compare screenshots of your journey through the ruins of D.C. with real life photos of D.C. today and see how similar they look.

You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your postapocalyptic journey through the Washington, DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.\nGL HF ;D","January 6","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They buy the game and see it doesn't work when it clearly say's in the store page it is not optimized for windows 7 machines and they still give it a negative review!\n\nThe other great thing about this game and Fallout New Vegas is the modding. If you don't like how that tree over there looks well then download the G.E.C.K and move it yourself with the resource editor!. If you don't like this rock that's blocking your path and it seems sensible it shouldn't be there well then open up the console and type in the delete resource command. The one mod i always install with Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas is the invisible wall remover from the Fallout 3 Nexus, I HATE when they add pesky invisible walls that hinder you're ability to be able to climb a mountain and get out of danger or to climb over an obstacle.\n\nIn short Fallout 3 and Fallout New Veags are the 2 best games i have played in my life!.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/recommended/22370/","uknownuffin","Johannes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uknownuffin/","493 products in account","Almost 150 hours later, I feel like I have only scratched the surface of this game. No matter where I go, there are always new locations I have never visited before, waiting to be discovered and explored. These places may contain  a few enemies and definitely some loot, but the most important features within them are those little stories conveyed through tapes or, even better, the place itself, that expand the lore and that let me immerse myself in the year 2277 of this very special alternative universe. This was the game that introduced me to the world of Fallout and to Bethesda, and you can tell by the way it trapped me on my first playthrough. Bethesda knows how to turn minutes into hours without you realizing it, and this game can do just that… even after playing it for a second time.\n\nIt’s just… the post-apocalyptic feel, walking through a destroyed DC, entering for the first time in places like Megaton, Underworld or Rivet City, listening to Three Dog and all the amazing old music on the radio, wondering which decision to make in all the quests, visiting Tranquility Lane for the first time and bringing up your Pipboy, seeing Liberty Prime in action, shooting people while listening to the Andrews Sisters, discovering why Dad left… These are only some of the experiences this game has brought me that I absolutely loved and will never forget.\n\nMy favorite, however, is probably the scenic overview just after 101. The intro is definitely one of my favorite of any game. It just works so well. You feel safe, you feel loved, your problems are quite petty and then suddenly *bam* you are alone, stuck in an extremely dangerous and unknown place and all the problems you had before are pretty much ridiculous now. Great story telling right there. There are, of course, some things that make much less sense, like your father walking through the wasteland alone and not getting hurt, specially since the player can’t walk 10 steps without being attacked by massive monsters and crazy raiders. But yeah, that’s something we can easily forgive.\n\nAnd oh boy, the moment I discovered mods my whole fallout experience changed drastically. Imagine being able to modify the game just how you want it. Got it? Well, you can do just that! Among all the amazing mods out there, I really recommend GNR enhanced, which adds a ton of cool music and lines to the game, and Arwen Tools, which turns the game into a real hardcore survival experience.\n\nAs of the DLC, my favorite one was hands down The Pitt. They managed to create an amazing ambience, a lot of gray decisions and intense storytelling. Awesome.\n\nBe ready to invest a lot of hours into Fallout 3 if you decide to start playing the game, and then just let yourself be dragged into its setting and amazing lore. One of my all time favorites. I’d drink a nuka cola quantum in its honor if I could. And I don’t know about others, but I had no problem running the game on my Windows 7... besides the occasional CTD. When running a lot of mods (and even if you don’t), you should really look into the CASM mod. It really is a life saver while playing FO3.\n\nSo yeah, be sure to enjoy your stay in DC! And remember: DEMOCRACY IS NON NEGOTIABLE.\n","July 12, 2015","true","131.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course it could have been more than it became, and surely Fallout 3 did become more than it was when released in 2009 due to the large community of modders who saved this game from oblivion. Fallout 3 is a video game that began Fallout's debut into the modern era of video games, and it is a true Fallout game not made by Interplay.\n\nFinal Score: 9.25/10","December 23, 2015","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No two playthroughs will be the same. Unless... your just that type of person. I know your thinking "Why should I listen to this jackass, he only has 7 hours logged on this game." You are right to say that, but your also not. If you combine my time on the PC version, along side with my time on the xbox 360 and ps3 versions of the game, I've logged in around 400 hours. I am just now playing on the PC version because.. I just bought a PC! Fallout 3 takes you into the Capital Wasteland, a place that is mostly avoided despite it having such a lovely name. You are put in a chair and spun around untill your too disy to think, in a good way. You are literally born in the game, you then decide your gender, and your appearnce. You are then thrust in to the life eof an average child as you make your way from being in diapers, to your birthday party, and to taking you G.O.A.T which is a test that decides what position you will fill in the cault you live in when you grow up. This doesn't last long however when one day you wake up and chaos has struck. Vault 101 was your home, but it becomes a madhouse once your father escapes the vault. (No one's supposed to do that. Overseer's orders) This is now a madhouse that you try to escape in order to pursue after your father. Walking out of the vault and taking in the masssive view of the wasteland is breataking. You gaze among the surounding suburbs and the washington monument way in the distance. After you complete the breathtaking campaign, theres a total of 3 DLC's to extend you gametime. After you complete a DLC, you are free to return to the wastes with the treasures, and memories (both good and haunting) to use on your enimies you've made throughout your journey.\n\nIf your wondering about the notice saying "It's not compatible for windows 7 or later." that's because it's not. The game won't literally work unless you fix it. And that's putting it lightly. The amount of steps you have to do really depends on what processor you have. If you have something such as an AMD (Which is what I have) You will have less steps than someone who has an intel processor. The lucky owner of an intel will have to do only a few more minutes worth of steps, but it's worth it in the long run. Saldy I can't find the video that helped me get my Fallout 3 working a week ago, so you'll have to find it yourselve's :/ Believe me, I looked for 20 munites jus now D: I would post all the steps, but sadly I don't remember them (There was that many)\n\nFallout 3 is a must play, and deffidently belongs on all PC's gamers hardrive. This is truely on of the best games ever created.\n\n10 out of 10, would wasteland again.","April 17, 2015","true","51.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I especially loved the V.A.T.S. system, along with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. mechanic, that was especially unique for me.

Thought I lack the hours on PC I have played Fallout 3 over 500 hours on console. I have completed in all ways and I think it's the 2nd best game on the market behind Fallout New Vegas. This game is simply amazing and goes on sales quite often which gives you hours of fun for cheap. Even though the game is currently cheap for the amount of fun you'd have, it goes on sale often if you're tight on money. It's not hard to run either so many people are able to play. The game is very customizable with everything just like my review on Fallout New Vegas, nearly everything I said there is what is in Fallout 3. They are similar but not too similar where people complain that they are the same game. All I will say now that it's cheap/addicting/fun/easy to run/modable. The perfect game if you ask me :) Please buy xD","August 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are able to put experience into any skill you want, from guns to civil abilities such as barter or science. The game designers really made you feel as if you were in Washington D.C. (the wastelands of it at least), and have given you a very interactive world that you could mess around with.

If you're a fan of RPGs, or you're a fan of post-apocalyptic settings, then Fallout 3 is most likely for you. Set around 200 years after the Earth is devastated by nuclear war, you play the Vault Dweller, who has left Vault 101 in order to follow their father's footsteps and make sure he is still alive.\n\nOf course, it's never quite that simple, and once you are out into the wide, open world, you are on your own. For a while at least. You can go nearly anywhere, do nearly anything, shoot nearly anyone, so long as you can live with the consequences.\n\nEven without the DLC, this game is huge. Adding the DLC just makes it bigger, and offers more unique items, weapons, characters, and storylines than ever before.\n\nThis game is very highly recommended.","June 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And in just 2 days, I found the tunnel that takes me to the White House. I was so excited to see how cool a decayed, run down White House would look.\nSo I was attacked by ghouls upon exiting the manhole cover, and after that looked around me and thought "Where is it? It's got to be here." I have never been more disappointed in my life. I literally took 6 months off to find nothing but a damn hole in the ground.

The game itself has a pretty nice story and is actually challenging at first when you have nothing and don't know the controls too well. The massiveness of the open-world and the explroation really contribute to the game's wonder. Like the Fallout series are marked by, there are multiple ways to complete quests and there are quests everywhere. Once oyu get to a certain level you can even get explorer perk which allows you to see all the locations on the map. Go find everything and enjoy the game.\n\nAnother thing is that you can mod the game and replay the game in a differnet style in a similar sense to skyrim. You can mod the things you dont like or the bugs and even other major things. I played as a goody-two-shoes in my first playthrough and I intend to play as a villian in my second one. The replayability isn't as great as some games, but with mods and a different play style, one can enjoy the game once again.

If you read around there are a lot of fixes and most of them do not work. I tried so many and I can't even remember now which one helped.\n\nI played Fallout 3 when it came out but I only just now beat it all including DLC and here are my thoughts.\n\nThe game was ok, the main storyline and the series of quests that surround it are a little boring.\nThe game does nail the theme of a wasteland and it was an interesting new vision of Fallout after Bethseda got the rights to the series.\n\nThe audio logs kept the game interesting, some were funny and others brought deeper insight into the game. Overall the audio logs helped me enjoy the game and im glad they decided to include them.\n\n[DLC reviews]\n--------------------\nOperation: Anchorage\nThe first 15-20 mins of Operation Anchorage was really good. I was thinking while playing that I was enjoying this DLC more than the main storyline. It was a lot of fun to infiltrate the buildings in Alaska and do covert missions. The last part of the DLC didn't live up to the beginning and it wasn't as good as the start of it. Overall it was probably the best DLC for Fallout 3.\n\nThe Pitt\nI was excited to go to a new location like the pitt but it didnt live up to what I thought it was going to be. It had a questionable questline of what was the good path and bad path. I apparently did the bad path by not stealing the cure even though it made sense to not steal the cure so they can take their time researching it and not having to kill. The arena though was ok but it was way too easy for my character level.\n\nBroken Steel\nThis had to be the worst DLC for Fallout 3. It was a very generic military base attack. The only good thing that came from it was the Tesla cannon.\n\nPoint Lookout\nI thought Point Lookout was going to be a cool swamp carnival themed area which it was but the storyline for the whole area was filled with bad writing and the whole story for it was a bad idea. It's just a really stupid story and they wasted a lot of potential for the theme of the area.\n\nMothership Zeta\nAKA the alien dlc, it didnt live up to the idea. It started out strong with a cool escape theme but the whole ship area of quests really sucked. The audio logs were really interesting and got me excited to see if others from the logs were on the ship but most were not and it was a buzz kill. The theme of aliens allows you to do so much and they did so little.\n--------------------","January 1","true","49.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't try to alt+tab while playing cuz you will not be able to go back to the game again! Rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS on anything higher than Medium settings. I don't know how I'm able to play it on Win 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtyparkies/recommended/22370/","dirtyparkies","Dirty Parkies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dirtyparkies/","173 products in account","In truth, I've dedicated somewhere in the range of at least 400-500 hours to Fallout 3 across my life, including the PS3 version. Running the game through Fallout Script Extender prohibits time from being logged, but I've dedicated a lot of time to the Capital Wasteland, and yet I've only completed the story once, never explored evil karma, and have only finished two of the DLCs. There is just such a grand level of exploration in this game that it's hard not to daydream about your second, post-apocalyptic life whenever you're away from it.\n\nThough I found myself hard-pressed to engage in the original isometric Interplay titles, Bethesda's 3D take on the setting brings it all to an atmosphere that's borderline life-like, and was the foundation for Obsidian's New Vegas, my all-time favourite video game. Truly, Fallout 3 was a major part of my childhood, and remains a heartily recommendable action-RPG to this day, though I fear a vast majority of its content will become invalidated with the impending release of Fallout 4 (unlike New Vegas, Fallout 3 does not have the combat, dialogue, and variety to survive a direct successor).\n\nQuestlines are sparse and relatively linear, with only a couple of different outcomes for most, and many towns simply don't make sense (a village actually built around a bomb, a civilization made exclusively of children, an underpopulated and undergunned slum surrounded by raiders and mutants). There is limited weapon and enemy variety, and navigating sewers and metro tunnels can become enragingly confusing. However, on the flip side, the action is a gory delight, and all of the environments are lovably crafted down to the smallest of details, even if the world abides by its own bizarre sense of logic.\n\nAn easy argument in favour of this game is the modding community- an outlet for solving essentially every negative I have listed. However, it is also a display of Bethesda's oftentimes lackluster game design, and does not help anyone seeking a purely vanilla adventure. Overall, anyone looking for a game that's rich in content variety, solid RPG mechanics and a believable world should likely be pointed toward New Vegas (which I more strongly recommend regardless), but otherwise, this is a nice time sink until Fallout 4.","August 28, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course it could have been more than it became, and surely Fallout 3 did become more than it was when released in 2009 due to the large community of modders who saved this game from oblivion.

If you read around there are a lot of fixes and most of them do not work. I tried so many and I can't even remember now which one helped.\n\nI played Fallout 3 when it came out but I only just now beat it all including DLC and here are my thoughts.\n\nThe game was ok, the main storyline and the series of quests that surround it are a little boring.\nThe game does nail the theme of a wasteland and it was an interesting new vision of Fallout after Bethseda got the rights to the series.\n\nThe audio logs kept the game interesting, some were funny and others brought deeper insight into the game. Overall the audio logs helped me enjoy the game and im glad they decided to include them.\n\n[DLC reviews]\n--------------------\nOperation: Anchorage\nThe first 15-20 mins of Operation Anchorage was really good. I was thinking while playing that I was enjoying this DLC more than the main storyline. It was a lot of fun to infiltrate the buildings in Alaska and do covert missions. The last part of the DLC didn't live up to the beginning and it wasn't as good as the start of it. Overall it was probably the best DLC for Fallout 3.\n\nThe Pitt\nI was excited to go to a new location like the pitt but it didnt live up to what I thought it was going to be. It had a questionable questline of what was the good path and bad path. I apparently did the bad path by not stealing the cure even though it made sense to not steal the cure so they can take their time researching it and not having to kill. The arena though was ok but it was way too easy for my character level.\n\nBroken Steel\nThis had to be the worst DLC for Fallout 3. It was a very generic military base attack. The only good thing that came from it was the Tesla cannon.\n\nPoint Lookout\nI thought Point Lookout was going to be a cool swamp carnival themed area which it was but the storyline for the whole area was filled with bad writing and the whole story for it was a bad idea. It's just a really stupid story and they wasted a lot of potential for the theme of the area.\n\nMothership Zeta\nAKA the alien dlc, it didnt live up to the idea. It started out strong with a cool escape theme but the whole ship area of quests really sucked. The audio logs were really interesting and got me excited to see if others from the logs were on the ship but most were not and it was a buzz kill. The theme of aliens allows you to do so much and they did so little.\n--------------------","January 1","true","49.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You fulfill or dash the spiritual hopes of an idyllic society, side with slavers or their slaves, and decide the fate of more than one city over the course of your postapocalyptic journey through the Washington, DC wasteland. Your actions have far-reaching consequences that affect not just the world around you but also the way you play, and it's this freedom that makes Fallout 3 worth playing--and replaying. It's deep and mesmerizing, and though not as staggeringly broad as the developer's previous games, it's more focused and vividly realized.\nGL HF ;D","January 6","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You are able to put experience into any skill you want, from guns to civil abilities such as barter or science. The game designers really made you feel as if you were in Washington D.C. (the wastelands of it at least), and have given you a very interactive world that you could mess around with. In some cases, you will be given an option on whether to take the good, evil, or even neutral path to complete the quest.

The game mechanics were incredibly easy to use, and felt very nice, no problems with it. Mods were easy to install, and the game managed to hold it's own, while playing a Windows 7. I especially loved the V.A.T.S. system, along with the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. mechanic, that was especially unique for me. And over all, the game, though not always as colorful as it could possibly be, was most atmospheric, especially creeping in a shopping mart, filled to the rim with bandits, that would not hesitate to blow your head off if you looked at their shoes even remotely funny.

Attention: This is not a crappy "My game doesn't work!!" review, I'll try to explain why I was disappointed.\n\nFallout 3 started amazing, I love the beginning of the story and the different life stages my character went through. But just like Skyrim it failed to impress me because of the missing quality. Soon after I left the vault the game quality and the fun reached zero. I got totally lost in tons of boring sidequests (again Skyrim, remember) and forgot what my main quest was about. It sure is an open world game, but it felt empty, even though I know it's hard to fill every corner of the map, but at least a little bit interesting stuff or people would have been nice.\n\n++ good start and interesting character growth\n++ detailed setting, everything about vaults, the pip-boy/vault boy mascot and the bottle cap currency\n\n-- disappointing, skyrim-like story\n-- graphics, Mass Effect did a better job\n-- a huge amount boring sidequests\n-- confusing skills/perks, no tutorial or explanation\n-- combat feels more like a shooter than a rpg, maybe I just don't like rpgs with guns, vats isn't exciting, also alternative, but it's hard to fight without it\n-- those creepy and scary ghouls popping out of nowhere\n-- lack of content\n-- performance problems\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFallout 3 ist mein erstes Spiel aus der Fallout Reihe, die anderen hab ich nie gespielt. Achtung: Hierbei handelt sich nicht um eine "Mein Spiel läuft nicht!!" Review, ich versuche so genau wie möglich zu beschreiben warum ich enttäuscht war.\n\nFallout 3 hatte einen fantastischen Start, ich liebe den Anfang der Geschichte und die verschiedenen Lebensabschnitte meines Charakters. Aber genauso wie Skyrim schaffte es wegen der fehlenden/mangelnden Qualität nicht mich zu überzeugen und der Spielspaß sank auf Null. Ich verlor mich in unendlichen langweiligen Nebenquests (und wieder Skyrim Parallelen, ich erinnere mich) und vergaß worum es in der Hauptstory überhaupt geht. Für einen open world Titel fühlte sich das Spiel ziemlich leer an, obwohl ich weiß dass es schwer ist jede Ecke mit Content zu füllen, aber wenigstens ein paar interessante Orte oder Charaktere hätten schon gereicht.\n\n++ guter Start und interessante Charakterentwicklung\n++ detailiertes Setting, alles rund um Vaults, den Pip-Boy/das Vault Boy Maskottchen und die Kronkorken Währung\n\n-- enttäuschende Skyrim ähnliche Story\n-- Grafik, Mass Effect machte einen deutlich besseren Job\n-- zu viele langweilige Nebenquests\n-- verwirrende Skills/Perks, kein Tutorial oder kurze Erklärung zu\n-- das Kampfsystem erinnert mehr an einen Shooter als an ein RPG, vielleicht weil ich keine RPGs mit Waffen mag, VATS ist weit entfernt davon das System spannend oder interessant zu gestalten, obwohl es optional ist, aber ohne sind die Kämpfe viel zu schwer\n-- diese gruseligen Ghoule die immer aus dem Nichts auftauchen und einen zu Tode erschrecken\n-- zu wenig Content\n-- Performance Probleme","March 23, 2014","false","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Yes, the compatibilty issues with Windows 7/8 is a problem but once you get past that, this game is an absolute thrill ride. First, presentation is amazing here, never more have I just wanted to look out at the scenic view of the wasteland when you first leave that vault, as your eyes adjust to the light...and you see..chaos..deterioration. Gunplay is great, addictive, and will keep you going till the end. Side quests are located all around the map, some marked, others not, hundreds of hours of gameplay. Ever since day one, I loved the karma system, this idea of being good, evil, or somewhere in between always intruiged me and because of that I have had many playthroughs of the game. Doing a good run, then getting curious and doing all the evil, devious things, then started a neutral playthrough, then doing another good run, because I forgot all the quests, rewards, and the overall atmospheric changes you can have on the wastes. Which, I also loved, because you can actually make a difference in this wasteland. If you get bored with the playthroughs, there's also a thriving modding community out there with plenty of awesome mods to check out.\n\nYou know, some say New Vegas is an overall better game, with its factions, added gameplay, better mechanics, but there is one thing Fallout 3 will always have over New Vegas: That Dark Wasteland Post Apocalyptic feel, something New Vegas didn't really show.\n\n10/10","May 10, 2015","true","183.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Every now and then I still think of its dark atmosphere, its grim landscapes. And don't start with the jokes about 'muh fo3 dark ambient', because it's totally dumb.\n\nI do love the war between the Legion and the NCR too, but the two games reciprocally lack what the other has and are thus both good games depending on what you're looking for in a Post-apocalyptic videogame.\n\nThe feels that FO3 gifted me with, are so intense and peculiar that I guess very few games in my life will ever be able to grant me the same (let alone a better) experience.\n\nFinally, I believe as many other people that this game is a masterpiece. I was admittedly a very susceptible adolescent when I first played it so my first play-through was frightening and wonderful at the same time; if you didn't feel the same then it's your ♥♥♥♥ing problem lol\n\n\n26/10/15 EDIT:\n\nRevised my old review because the syntax was overall mediocre. I want to add that yeah the game needs a lot of fixing with contemporary operative systems so on w7 and 8 the game's definitely going to run like ♥♥♥♥ unless you install a few mods.

War? War never changes... but Fallout 3? It definitly does. Every playthrough, every character, every decision, every plot, every choice, changes the way the game is played. No two people have the exact same experience with fallout, so much so that I find myself constantly telling fallout stories with my friends as if these were real events. Everyone I know who plays fallout, has a story of their adventures, and thats what is beautiful about the game. No two experiences are the same, and it constantly offers the highest replay value and countless hours of mind blowing entertainment. Moral choices, sacrifices, survival, and even a bit of equipment management, this is a true gem that should be in every game library available. Its a game where someone can poor countless hours into exploring this world and universe that has been created, and interact with its inhabitents almost like they were real people. More often then not I find myself feeling guilty, or devious as I made plots for my own evil deeds. Fallout, either as a series or by itself, is a game of the decade, and with its current price, you'd be an idiot to pass it up. War may never change... but fallout? Its a new story every time you start, and its an adventure where you choose the results. No amount of words can do this game justice, and I wish I had connected the game through steam a long time ago.. because you would see over 2,000 hrs of time dedicated to such an enthralling experience. There are few games that have had such an impact, and for that reason it diserves a solid 10/10. And just like war.. that will never change.","June 17, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It took me some time to get into it, as I bought it in july and finished it in december, but once you do get the hang of the game, it's amazing.  Having played Skyrim and Oblivion previously, I will tell you Fallout is the superior game of both of them.  The setting, set in post apocalyptic D.C., is very immersive.  There's very few RPG's that are set in sci-fi or modern places, so this is definitely a gem to anyone who loves RPG but feels worn from fantasy themes.  However, like everything, nothing goes without some gripes.  As much I like guns in an RPG, the vanilla guns seem very lackluster.  I actually had to install weapon mods to add some more customizability.  Number 2 is the game is NOT optimized for quad core CPU's, something most computers have these days.  I can't think of the code from memory, but I had to put in some lines in my FALLOUT.INI to force the game to only use 2 of my cores or else the game would crash every 20 - 30 min. Number 3, is the vanilla character models, animations, and faces are terrible even for its time of release.  If you played Oblivion, those fugly faces are back so mods are essential if you want a decent looking character.   Number 4 --- too many super mutants -- enough said.  Now if you've gotten this far in this review, I will still say that the positives outweigh the negatives because I'm just trying to give everyone a good heads up, and if you managed to enjoy Oblivion or Skyrim, you can ignore half of these 'gripes'.  Everything else is good.  Overall it's a 9/10, so it's worth your money especially when it's $5-10.","December 25, 2013","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The feeling of being in a destroyed neo-50's american world has a great affect on gameplay; to be surrounded by a futuristic twist on what was probably the peak of American culture while listening to tracks of American Swing and Jazz Blues while beating a Deathclaw to death after it surprise-attacked you and made you soil your pants is an experience that will only be found in the Fallout games.\n\nThe story of Fallout 3 is very reminiscent of the plots behind Fallout 1 and 2, and whilst i would say that i'd rather see a completely different story to the original games, there is far more story and content to make up for the main storyline which in my opinion wasn't anything new.\n\nThis game has allowed me to understand and enjoy an old genre of music that is found constantly played through the Galaxy News Radio station. I can't begin to tell you how many times i've listen to Bob Crosby and Cole Porter.\n\nWhat this game does best and what i find Bethesda Game Studios to do best at in all their games is atmosphere and the feeling of being in the world that they are trying to portray. They did an extremely good job of capturing that post-Apocalyptic feel that aligns well with the classic games, but there are subtle differences because of the location and the different developers.\n\nCombat is very fun, but not as responsive as some of the best shooters out there, but i'll give Bethesda credit as they are known for fantasy games where there is no such thing as fast fire-rate guns, since this is there first time at making an open world shooter RPG they did a good job at least. VATS is definitely the best part about combat, and the gore is super funny. The reaction i'd make to a super mutant's head exploding after a 32. caliber round through the skull is again one of the perks of playing this game.\n\nThere is a split of opinion between the new fans and the classic fans. My first Fallout experience was Fallout 3 but eventually i bought the older games and aced both of them, and i think all of them are great. I love this franchise and always will. I definitely recommend this game if you're new to the franchise, and then move onto New Vegas and then the classics.\n\nOverall, i rate this game a 9.5/10. There is so much to do in this game, from taking in the lore, to the happy-go music, the rich culture and the endless gory fun, you will not go wrong by spending your money on this game.","June 18, 2015","true","44.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","5"

I did like Vegas (and still haven't completed it) but found I had strong memories of Fallout 3 and kept judging Vegas by its predecessor. Then recently a miracle happened and I found a fix that got 3 working again. I have never been able to put my finger on it but Vegas had something missing from it which Fallout 3 had.\n\nI think its a combination of things really. For a start I found the whole setting and atmosphere of Fallout 3 to be way more apocalyptic than Vegas. Thats probably down to the twisted wreckage of old highways that dot the horizon and vast skeletal shells of long dead cities. It really makes you feel that something extremely bad happened to the world (which of course did). The music varies and sometimes can be hauntingly eerie.\n\nThere are a ton of side missions and of course the main story. All that before you even touch the DLC's. The game has many good storylines with some that force you to decide what kind of wastelander you are going to be,\n\nWith our world supposedly on the verge of its next extinction event and heightened tensions between some super powers its never been a better time to play fallout and visit the maybe world of tomorrow.\n\nFallout 4 is on its way. It looks great so far but I expect it will be compared to the earlier games such as Fallout 3.\n\nA most definite 10 / 10 classic title that should be in every serious gamers library.","June 21, 2015","true","84.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

Now before I start I'll end the common debate most people have when they want to start playing the Fallout series... DO I PURCHASE FALLOUT NEW VEGAS OR FALLOUT 3? Well since I have both I'll write down the pros and the cons of both games so bear with me for now.\nFallout 3 Pros\n+ Very story rich, tells you about the Lone Wanderer and how he/she was born and raised.\n+ Is a very beautiful game in my personal opinion.\n+ Very nice radio that will keep you entertained while travelling the Washington wasteland.\n+ Multiple endings so you can keep playing this game over and over.\n+ THREE DOG AND DOGMEAT.\n+ Very big atmosphere that's entirely yours to explore.\n+ VATS is a wonderful gameplay mechanic that is introduced in Fallout 3.\n+ Karma meter which makes you feel like you're an actual person instead of just a mindless killer.\nFallout 3 Cons\n- No iron sight aiming.\n- Not optimized for Windows 7 or later. (This doesn't mean that it's unplayable on Windows 7 it's just that you have to modify the game files and that's really time consuming. Took me about 7 hours to fix Fallout 3 for my Windows 7 computer.)\n- Somewhat small level cap (20, but can be increased with the Broken-Steel DLC)\n- Very short main story line.\n- Companions AREN'T invincible.\n- Doesn't have an indicatior for when weapons are really worn thus making them more likely to jam.\nNow that I've talked a bit about Fallout 3 I'll talk about the pros and cons of Fallout: New Vegas\nFallout: New Vegas Pros\n+ Iron sight aiming.\n+ VATS is a returning feature in Fallout: New Vegas.\n+ Companions are invincible.\n+ Hardcore mode is an option for all you hardcore fans out there.\n+ Runs fine on Windows 7 and later (managed to run it on my terrible computer at a stable 60 FPS.)\n+ A better radio than Fallout 3 (in my personal opinion.)\n+ Weapon modification is an option.\n+ REX.\n+ You're in Las Vegas, what more do I need to say?\n+ Some fun gambling to do in The Strip if that's your thing.\n+ Increasing level cap if you have DLC installed. (Increases by 5 for each DLC, 30 is the base level cap.)\n+ Very big and beautiful world, but not as big as Fallout 3.\n+ The Kings.\n+ No karma requirements to recruit companions.\n+ Reputation for factions.\nFallout: New Vegas\n- Tons of invisible walls over the Mojave Wasteland.\n- No back story AT ALL about our player character: The Courier.\n- Very limited story endings.\n- A lot of walking must be done unless you have found some places to fast travel to.\n- TONS of bugs.\n- A.I isn't as good as in Fallout 3.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow for the review of Fallout 3: You start off as a baby that is newly born. You then have a time skip to you as a toddler, and another to when you're 10, and 15. Finally when you're 18 the game really starts. This game is beautiful the moment you step out of Vault 101 and see the sunlight for the first time. It's not too far into the game when you meet Dogmeat, a fan favourite companion loved by all. During this time you are already free to do as you please and explore the Washington wastelands. This game is entirely based by your actions so it's amazing that you get to choose how the game will end. Will you be a villian feared all across the wasteland? Or will you be the guardian angel of the wasteland? If you want to find out... BUY THIS GAME! (Ps. took me about an hour to write, enjoy XD)\n\n","June 29, 2015","true","18.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Bethesda has not released a perfect game, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is indeed a worthy heir to the Fallout lineage. What it has lost by leaving the 3rd person isometric view it has gained back 100 fold by an amazingly detailed world, storylines that go far beyond simple lines of dialog, and many different paths for the player to choose. There is in fact far more content than any single playthrough needs to experience, promising greater replayability.A masterpiece.","August 23, 2015","true","91.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

When FO:3 is talked about as one of the best games ever made it's not because of the main story, it’s everything else. The depth in quests and even unmarked quests, the interactions with other wastelanders or sometimes even just interactions with the ruins of Post-apocalyptic D.C. completely outshines the main story. FO:3 is so good because the emphasis of the game isn’t on some planned-tourist-guide of the wasteland instead it’s on what you want to do –whatever you want to do.","January 2, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scuutaru/recommended/22370/","scuutaru","Scoots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scuutaru/","39 products in account","Fallout 3 is one of my all-time favourite games, and was one of the first games i got when i started getting serious about gaming back in 2008. The feeling of being in a destroyed neo-50's american world has a great affect on gameplay; to be surrounded by a futuristic twist on what was probably the peak of American culture while listening to tracks of American Swing and Jazz Blues while beating a Deathclaw to death after it surprise-attacked you and made you soil your pants is an experience that will only be found in the Fallout games.\n\nThe story of Fallout 3 is very reminiscent of the plots behind Fallout 1 and 2, and whilst i would say that i'd rather see a completely different story to the original games, there is far more story and content to make up for the main storyline which in my opinion wasn't anything new.\n\nThis game has allowed me to understand and enjoy an old genre of music that is found constantly played through the Galaxy News Radio station. I can't begin to tell you how many times i've listen to Bob Crosby and Cole Porter.\n\nWhat this game does best and what i find Bethesda Game Studios to do best at in all their games is atmosphere and the feeling of being in the world that they are trying to portray. They did an extremely good job of capturing that post-Apocalyptic feel that aligns well with the classic games, but there are subtle differences because of the location and the different developers.\n\nCombat is very fun, but not as responsive as some of the best shooters out there, but i'll give Bethesda credit as they are known for fantasy games where there is no such thing as fast fire-rate guns, since this is there first time at making an open world shooter RPG they did a good job at least. VATS is definitely the best part about combat, and the gore is super funny. The reaction i'd make to a super mutant's head exploding after a 32. caliber round through the skull is again one of the perks of playing this game.\n\nThere is a split of opinion between the new fans and the classic fans. My first Fallout experience was Fallout 3 but eventually i bought the older games and aced both of them, and i think all of them are great. I love this franchise and always will. I definitely recommend this game if you're new to the franchise, and then move onto New Vegas and then the classics.\n\nOverall, i rate this game a 9.5/10. There is so much to do in this game, from taking in the lore, to the happy-go music, the rich culture and the endless gory fun, you will not go wrong by spending your money on this game.","June 18, 2015","true","44.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","5"

First, the game isn't optimized for Windows 7, as stated in the Store Page, but this is so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid I can't even. They release the game and give 0 ♥♥♥♥s about the new systems where people will try to run their game (that isn't even that old to begin with)? So, I have to go through the trouble of fixing the game myself so I can play it. And what a game.\n\nIt was kinda fun at first but it grew boring and repetitive pretty quickly: same scenarios, same enemies all the time, same "press V and aim for the head and blow their heads off quickly to be done with that" over and over again, with no new ♥♥♥♥ whatsoever to help make the combat more interesting as the game progressed. The side-quests are boring and if you only go for the main-quests you'll be done in a few hours. The map is gigantic with many "points of interest" you can find, but it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing the same desert over and over again with the same monsters and with absolutely nothing to do. I mean it. The side-quests, main-quests and DLC quests can't even cover one third of the whole map. You're left with no motivation to go exploring the rest of the game since there's nothing to do there and you will be bothered by enemies over and over again and engage in dull combat. Again.\n\nThe characters are so ♥♥♥♥ing basic I could probably kill everyone and not feel a thing. Actually the best part of this game is killing innocent people (although I always went for good karma so I saved the game before killing everyone and loaded it when I was satisfied). Your father has Liam Neeson's voice so that's cool though.\nThe other plus would be how your choices affect the world, although I couldn't care less about the world and its inhabitants in the game so that numbs down the weight of the choices considerably. The character building is kinda good, but if you like challenge then this probably isn't the game for you since I usually ♥♥♥♥ up while building characters in RPGs, but Fallout 3 was so easy it was starting to get annoying. Perhaps in higher difficulties it's really challenging? Dunno, didn't go through the trouble of trying it out.\n\nI believe the worst part is that two years after this pile of trash came out, they made the same game again. LITERALLY the same game. New Vegas is basically Fallout 3 but with cowboy hats. And the game is yellowish instead of greenish. The graphics are the same the gameplay is the same EVERYTHING is the same. Now we have Fallout 4 and guess what? IT'S THE SAME THING AGAIN. The graphics are better, but they're still far behind other games nowadays, and Bethesda just ends up charging the highest of prices I've ever seen on Steam, as if they deserved it.\nThe only reason I have 40+ hours in this game is because I ended up buying the GOTY edition and felt like I had to go through the DLCs as well since I already paid for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but that's it.\n\nDon't buy this game.\n\nStop giving Bethesda your money, they couldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about you.","December 10, 2015","false","45.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The game freezes every 5 mins or so.  I've been through multiple solutions from rewriting the .ini file to downloading patches and supposed fixes.  I would still give this game a thumbs up if any of those options worked, but they haven't.  I still can't play the game because I have to alt+ctrl+del and force close the program every few minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBiggestCuntAlive/recommended/22370/","TheBiggestCuntAlive","Imperial Tycoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBiggestCuntAlive/","50 products in account","[This review does contain spoilers. I mean, this game is 7 years old after all.]\n\nYou probably know all about this game. It came out a pretty long time ago, 2008 to be exact. Even though this is the GOTY version, I won't be reviewing the DLCs.\n\nSo, let's start with a bit of history you probably already know. Fallout is an action RPG. Fallout takes place after a nuclear war between 'Murka, China and the Soviet Union, which started and ended on the same day. The nuclear war turned the entire world into a wasteland. Fallout from the beginning wasn't a Bethesda game. It was originally a series from Interplay and Black Isle Studios, planned as a successor to the game Wasteland.\n\nFallout 1 and 2 are considered classics and were critically-acclaimed. Interplay later published the two major spin-offs, the favorable Fallout Tactics, and the unfavorable Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. Then we got Warfare and Van Buren, but let's not speak about those.\n\nBethesda later bought the series and developed Fallout 3. They later acted as publishers for the next game, New Vegas, which was developed by Obsidian Entertainment.\n\nMost gameplay would be impossible without the Pip-Boy (also present in the previous games) which is a device worn on the player's forearm, which displays the inventory, the quest log, stats, the map, item properties, a radio and even a Geiger counter which can be viewed in the upper right corner. The standard color of the Pip-Boy is Green, but you can change it to your liking. The color of the Pip-Boy also affects the HUD which displays health, action points, and a compass. Fallout 3 also has perks, which were in previous Fallout games. Vault Boy is the mascot and appears on most things, such as when picking up an item, when you're poisoned or when picking a perk.\n\nThe starting place is Vault 101, where the player was born. It is a safe haven from the nuclear wasteland, where people can live in peace and prosperity. Vault 101 is one of the only vaults left standing since most vaults were desimated by vicious experiments done by the Vault Overseers and personnel. Such as Vault 87, where citizens were transformed into hideous, deformed mutants. The game takes place in the areas in and around Washington D.C. DLCs also take you to Alaska, Maryland, air force bases, and even a mother♥♥♥♥ing spaceship.\n\nBethesda ♥♥♥♥ on the lore quite a bit in this game, but it's not really much of a bother when it comes to enjoyment. One faction has been the center of this complaint, the Enclave. The Enclave are the remnants of the US government, and are usually considered the ''bad guys''. They were supposedly eradicated in Fallout 2. The faction was only present on the West Coast, but somehow the Enclave appears on the East Coast....?\n\nHow does this possibly work out? How does mere remnants of a faction travel across one of the world's largest landmasses, without succumbing to the dangers of the Wasteland? They aren't even supposed to exist in the first place. They are quite powerful in Fallout 3 aswell, even proving a challenge for the other faction, the much more established Brotherhood of Steel, which are usually counted as the ''good guys''. They're all for freedom, liberty, you know the deal. That's another faulty trait in Fallout 3, it's extremely black-and-white morally. There's a bad side and a good side, and even though the game makes a meek attempt to change this slightly at the end of the game (the option to infect the water with FEV), it still hovers over the game like a gray cloud of blandness.\n\nThe appearance of the Enclave on the East Coast is just roughly and slovenly explained in one of the DLCs, Broken Steel. It was just like Bethesda slapped a book in your face and said: ''This is how it is. Deal with it''. It just doesn't make sense. Many appearances of non-East Coast tech either remain unexplained or badly explained. It makes me believe that Bethesda didn't even inquire with loremasters at Interplay or Black Isle. Even after researching the lore, I have found cracks in the lore that lack any explaination or meaning.\n\nFallout 3 is saturated with plotholes and inconsistencies. Where do people get their food for instance? There seems to be food in abundance, but I can count the number of farms or crops in Fallout 3 on one hand. Surely the food from before the war would've run out a good 200 years after the war? Oh, and the Super Mutants can keep the mighty Brotherhood stalled, but can't defeat a village of young unarmored adults protected by a small wooden barricade.\n\nThe "sacrifice" of your father in the purifier is such a forced plot element, and ofcourse the main bad guy survives with his magic drugs (available to no one else!), which he really shouldn't have access to considering that he's from a shattered faction with no influence whatsoever, that had its technology blown up in the previous game.\n\nThe story is the run-of-the-mill story that has been given to you in Fallout and Fallout 2. They're basically mashed together. Those stories were about saving your home from the bad guys. Fallout actually evolved the story from acquiring a water chip for the vault to defeating a deformed lump of flesh who had created the most fearsome army of the Wasteland. That's basically what Fallout 3 is, with modification. Your dad escapes the vault, you follow him, he tells you about his plan to help the people, you help him, the bad guys come, you need to defeat them etc. It's a pretty boring and plain story, and a lot of the situations that happen in Fallout 3 are very predictable and don't provide the shock value that Bethesda seemingly tried to implement. The side quests can be a bliss at times though. Tranquility Lane was a load of fun and one of the best quests in the game.\n\nThe side quests are unique enough and not the glorified radiant quests usually found in games like Skyrim. Some of the side quests have a large effect on the world, The Power of the Atom being the most notable. That quest can change the world 1-2 hours in, if you do it the right way. The biggest problem with the quests are that they are usually very linear, more choices and alternate paths in Fallout 3's quests would do it some good.\n\nThe combat is basic shooter combat (Oblivion with guns) besides from the system V.A.T.S, which pretty much aims for you. V.A.T.S makes combat too easy way too often. It worked in the earlier games, but coupled with Gamebryo it's ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBasically everyone outside the cities are empty shells. Main Quest characters and some people in the cities are the only NPCs I cared for. Atleast each city/town has one interesting character. For example Harkness in Rivet City, Confessor Cromwell in Megaton and Mayor MacCready in Little Lamplight. Sure, wandering the wasteland can have some interesting encounters and easter eggs, but otherwise you probably will meet uninteresting people, if you meet anyone at all. And let's not forget the uninspired, tacky writing and the horrible voice acting.\n\nProbably the most interesting character in the game is Three Dog. That man has brought me a lot of happiness when wandering the wastes. He's the disc jockey of the Wasteland's most popular radio station. He became a fan favorite, and is still my favorite Fallout 3 character. His jokes and speeches are radiant, but the list of lines from him is quite a long one. I enjoyed listening to that station a lot. The radio in Fallout 3 is very well done and Bethesda did a good job. The songs are great and they fit in with the atmosphere. I listened to both Enclave Radio and GNR.\n\nThe game uses the Gamebryo engine, the same engine used in Oblivion. The game uses the Havok physics engine.\n\nSo, Fallout 3 is an enjoyable game with large flaws. Still, it is counted among one of the best games of all time. Probably not. It's a good game, but I'd recommend New Vegas.","November 29, 2013","true","124.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a "Fallout" game.\n\nI cannot say I regret my  30+ hours of F3 because it led me to appreciate NV. This game was my introduction to Fallout. However, I cannot say it's a good "role-playing" game for what it offers, and I'll hopefully explain why.\n\nThis preface information is to ask that you should take any review of F3 with information regarding the player's history of Fallout. More often fans of either game will fall back on arguments of Bethesda messing with the lore or how old fogies don't like innovation. If I reference NV it's because those similar mechanics were changed for the better, and reasons given as to why F3's mechanics are horrid.\n\nI aim to explain why Fallout 3 is a bad "role-playing" game by the only objective aspects of a game: The Mechanics. You be the judge of whether the game is redeemable for what it does and does not offer.\n\n"Memories Are Made of This..."\nAlthough I want to avoid the plot, I do want to bring up F3's means of storytelling and of motivation because it differs from NV.\n\nF3's benefit/vice is its more personal approach of the Player and the father, James. The intro sequence, while repetitive for later playthroughs, goes to show how great F3 can be when it develops smaller, personal areas. You can read conversations about the Overseer's dictatorship's effects through a poem or medical notes, or you can overhear dialogue that explains things further. It also contextualizes S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and Perks in-game, and provides an easy means for players unfamiliar with FPS/RPG hybrids plenty of time to ease in.\n\nThat last statement is important because the hour-long intro does its job of hooking the player for the long run, especially in an open-world environment. Even if you don't like James, searching for someone familiar in a hostile wasteland is a good motivaton to explore.\n\nUnfortunately, that attention to detail is not reflected for the rest of the game.  There are areas like the simulation of Vault 112 and a few notable set pieces and landmarks that are memorable, but the majority of places to explore are one-stop fairs for quests and loot. The world of Fallout 3 feels very dead, and not for the atmosphere.\n\nIf the game is played as a one-time commitment, then why do people replay the game? The simple answer is that hidden caches, the ability to go anywhere from the beginning of the game. and the level-design of D.C. are all more interesting than the Mojave.  Being set at the start in the center with no overall scalling of enemies allows the player the freedom to find caches and bonuses.\n\nI wouldn't say the game is designed for speedrunning, but it's how the player feels like the roads they travel are their own that leaves these players satisfied of the memories they make. That is Fallout 3's strongest-suit.\n\nYou're Not S.P.E.C.I.A.L\nOn the flipside, F3's mechanics for role-playing are either shallow of your decisions or absolutely broken. The main problem is that for whatever character build you want to make your characters they will end all the same.\n\nThe first major offender are the S.PE.C.I.A.L. stats themselves. You are given far too many to be a jack-of-all-trades with no issues. And if you want more points as you play you can invest into them with a Level Up or by finding Bobbleheads,.\n\nWorse, some stats are arguably superior to others. Investing into Intelligence is always superior because you will earn more skill-points with each level (15 - 20), which in turn can be used to level up your stats faster. And when you level up, you can also choose perks that mainly increase two stats by five points each, or you can choose perks that may offer something slightly interesting. By level 10, I had accumulated enough points to max out two or three stats to 100.\n\nThe problem with this system is that the game expects you to max out specific skills because some content can only be accessed by improving the stat. Because there are no skill magazines (like in New Vegas) or various tools to supplement skills like Lockpicking, Explosives or Science you will invest your skill points into all of them so you don't feel like you're gated out of content.\n\nUnlike NV, however, leveling up takes more time to achieve but you'll make about as perfect of a character well before you reach max level. This issue mainly comes from F3's uninteresting perk-systems where as NV focused on character-building perks.\n\nA few starter examples of  NV's perks include Wild Wasteland's wacky antics, the skilled but not experienced perk, or something as simple as Four Eyes that gives a character with glasses +1 Perception. Perks in F3 will give you ten points for two skills, others may give you a few wacky effects, and even one will give you fifteen points per each level. They don't shape or define your character—they just make your stats better.\n\nI could delve further about weapon stats affecting damage and spread, but each game handles it similarly. I personally find it stupid for a stat to affect gun-damage. (Swordsmanship in TES can be rationalized by physical capabilities; bullets should not be affected by player stats.) However, I think my point had been made and it can be simply said that the leveling up system of F3 feels more like I'm playing a game rather than making meaningful character choices.\n\nGoody-Goody or Douchy-Douchy?\nSome may not consider builds or the "role-playing" of "role-playing games" that important when it comes to the decisions you can make. After all, shouldn't your actions matter more than whatever you define yourself as? F3, however, restricts your choices in such an arbitrary manner in what should be a morally gray world.\n\nThe extent of your choices are often in a good, neutral or evil response. It would be unfair to criticize F3 for lacking the factions' system of NV. Bethesda was focused on building the game from the ground up, and NV had the time to flesh out its systems. This morality doesn't excuse how blatant the choices you make are for goody two shoes or for heartless a-holes.\n\nGroups such as the Brotherhood or Enclave are portrayed in such a manner. Quest-outcomes, usually, result in a good or bad result. And because the storyline is a linear set of objectives that have no bearing on your actions, the extent of your decisions feels pointless except for when you reminisce for what you have done. None of these aspects are as bad as the Karma system.\n\nThe Karma system in both F3 and NV is either a hypocritical or broken mess that should enforce player's actions as consequences. Instead, the whole system feels more like a joke. If you kill a certain type of "bad guy", you will receive good karma. Kill a whole town by blowing up an atom bomb? Don't worry, you can pay off your Karma dues by giving purified water to a homeless guy.\n\nThis system lacks any bite or long-lasting effects to enforce any lessons to learn except not to be a d0uche to others. If there were more risk-rewards associated with the good or bad options, such as the Giant Ant quest where if you don't harm the queen you get a bonus to strength or perception, then the binary outcomes could mean something more so than a bland morality in place.\n\n"... I Just Want To Start A Flame in Your Heart."\nIf you want a Fallout experience that revolves around exploration, discovery and light RPG elements, then F3 is okay at best. However, if you are looking for something with more "role-playing" elements, then F3 will disappoint you as its mechanics are not thought-out.\n\nIf you did not find F3 interesting or NV as engaging, I am hoping that this review will spark curiosity to visit the Mojave.","May 16","false","30.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","14","26","3","11"

Ok so I bought this game on PS3 and Xbox 360 the year it came out which was 2008. Played the hell out of both of them. Then they started releasing DLC and it got even better. Fast forward about a year or so to when I got my first gaming PC. Bought the game again, this time Game of the Year Edition. Was blown away again from 60fps and no lag at all.\n\nThe game revolves around a teenage kid (you) who is searching for their father in the wide open wasteland of DC. There are over 100 locations without DLC and even more with it. The game should take you 40-50 hours first playthrough if you are just a casual player. However if you're a completionist like myself, then you'll probably be playing for around 100 or so hours. There are tons of things to do in this game with and without mods/dlc. Thats the joy of it, each playthrough will be different. On one character you might focus more on melee weapons while you might focus on guns on another. This is one of the only games that I'd truly rate a 10/10.\n\nI read some reviews and some people were saying "DAE WINDOWS 7/8 DOESNT WORK" I laugh at these people because they are either not tech savvy at all or just being ridiculous. I have had windows 7 for 3+ years and windows 8 since release an I have not had a single problem at all. The game has only crashed a handfull of times in ovver 5 years. Its kind of sad how people are being lied to with the reviews. This game runs perfectly fine. This game is well worth the money even today. This game still competes with Skyrim and is one of the most Amazing games I have ever purchased.\n\nSo overall this game deserves a 10/10 and is a "Must Play"","August 5, 2014","true","53.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As well as these brutally glorius things you also find that little speck of goddness you have buird inside your dark heat (no emo), you get many choices in the sence of karma and well just being a ♥♥♥ or being a saint. Not only is the story line amazinballz because it gets you engrossed the DLCs are also worth all the moneh ever the world + 7.

You play as a child, living in the vault with your father. But one day your father leaves and you leave the vault looking for him in the big wasteland of Washington DC. On your journey you can decide how your character will react, do or what weapons he uses. The world is amazing, almost breathtaking for a wasteland. Not to mention the soundtrack aswell as the character you will meet with be stuck forever with you. The DLC for the game is also great and enjoyable, a little bit too short unlike New Vegas but still very fun. This game is simply Legendary and a must have in my opinion, also a plus is that you can mod it so be sure to check Fallout 3 Nexus for mods.\n\nP.S: Get Dogmeat.\n\nP.P.S: Don't mind the low game time, I'm using a special launcher for modding.","January 5, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was full of loss and misery. Full of hopeless people and lost souls that stepped on this doomed wasteland.\n\nYet, it wasn't only damnation that followed my steps. I found my father, my love Amata, a faithful companions... only to loose them the next second.\n\nIf this was the road so far, what will follow it? I know you can't talk, my good, old, friend, dogmeat. Despite that, I know you can listen, you are the only one who does that. So, thank you, buddy.\n________________________\n\nAfter 95 hours I finally finished this unique game. It was a long journey that, sadly, or not, came to the conclusion.\nI have mixed feeling because I can not, but to notice, the flaws of this game.\n\nThe combat is far from perfection. Constant invisible walls interfere in the shooting so that stealth and sniper headshot from a far is not an option. It is frustrating at times, but the VATS does a perfect job to overcome the combat flaws. It balances it.\n\nWriting of the main story. It's not good. It's average. It does the job to send you to a different locations and introduce the world, but that's it. I do like the small stories, though, which this world is packed to it's fullest and the enormous attention to detail. But the main plot... At the end, the feeling is that the bone was thrown and if we search enogh we can find it. In any case, sadly, it's not there. A mere feel of a presence of something epic is not what we want.\n\nDon't take me the wrong way. I like this game. It's good. Not perfect but good enough. There isn't any very good highlights but the mixture and huge diversity make this game a unique experience worth to check...if you push by yourself and force to go throw the tedious start that keept me aways the 2 past attempts to play Fallout 3.\n\nFirst 20 levels are a joy to play. You keep discovering new things and some quite memorable moments. A very simple details engage with a perfection to this unworthy world: A text based story about Grognak that you play on a terminal; Tranquility Lane; Princess who is secretly in love with the leader of Little Lamplight; Brother who got two naughty nightwear; A old man who I saved from suicide attempts.\n\nDespite the average writing of the main plot where it shines is in the clues of the past. There is no history in Fallout 3. Though, it creates an understanding of the past by the logs, terminals and documents. And it does the job like non other game up this date. The contradictive information, the vision of people of the those past events - at times I felt like archaeologist.\n\nThere are a huge depth that you can completely ignore and focus on the aspects you like. Do whatever. The world is there. What do you gonna do in it?\n________________________\nIt happened before and it will happen again.\nSo many killed, so much destroyed... and yet it's not enough, it is never enough.

Seu personagem é filho(a) de um importante protagonista no jogo, e ele simplesmente desaparece e você tem que correr atrás dele.\n\nClaro que, como todo RPG, isso é só a Mainquest, e Fallout 3 contém muitas sidequests para se fazer.\n\nCom o decorrer do jogo, o personagem evolue, assim obtendo pontos para distribuir em várias classificações ( força,destreza,etc) e também colocar perks, que seriam habilidades ÚNICAS, que permitem ao personagem bonus exclusivos daquele perk.\n\nAlém desse sistema, há varios, mas muitos lugares mesmo para explorar no mapa do jogo, que por falar nisso, é gigante. Chega a impressionar o tanto de lugares, Fábricas abandonadas, prisões, estações de rádio, a variedade é muito boa.\n\nHá também no jogo, o fator Karma, que guia você para o lado do bem ou do mal,\nobviamente você já sabe o que é do bem ( ajudar,suprimir,cooperar ), e do mal (matar npcs,roubar, desrespeitar).\n\n\nMuitos desses lugares o fator de exploração é usado, pois há materiais como armas,armaduras, itens de cura e alimentação, e coisas quase obsoletas, notas\nde pape, canetas, muita porcaria. mas algumas valem bem a pena, pois mostram\n, vamos dizer, uma quase quest.\n\nO jogo tenta interagir com você a qualquer momento, NPCs aparecendo do nada, caravanas atravessando, mobs agressivos, as estações de rádio e por ai vai.\n\nNo jogo também há facções, como a Brotherhood of Steel.\nApesar de existir facções, elas não são muito concretas nesse sentido.\n\nExemplo: Se eu for vestido com uma armadura inimiga, não atiraram em mim.\nOu se eu roubar algo ( e se tiver com bom Karma ), não vai acontecer nada.\n\nDei uma boa resumida de tudo no jogo, há vários problemas também, bugs,glitches, coisas assim, mas nada que tenha me incomodado tanto, só\no fator das facções não serem tão consistentes.\n\nMas é um ótimo jogo, com uma vasta exploração e ambiente pós apocalíptico, onde sua história é formada através dos seus atos, e o seu ver das coisas.\n\n8/10.\n\n\n\n\n","October 15, 2013","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the most in-depth storylines I've had the good fortune to be able to play, and the detail of the post-apocalypse retro-Futurism setting is amazing. I do wish it wasn't as buggy, but the Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch on NexusMods takes care of most of the glitches and bugs. On the PS3, it will occasionally have some issues if playing for too long, but on the PC, there really aren't any. And the Karma system really decides who your character is. Just...

With Broken Steel, the level cap is raised to 30 and the game continues past the ending of the standard game (which ends the game, no continuing) so a must buy.\n\nThe world is full of characters you will come to love or hate and the way you deal with most of these can be from talking your way out of a problem to killing everyone in sight! The different perks you can choose as you advance through levels can change how you tackle problems and can have different outcomes.\n\nAlthough the store page says that the game is not optimised for Windows 7 and later it runs fine on Windows 8.1 after changing a line in the code (a quick google search of "fallout 3 randomly crashing" will lead you to a link which tells you what to add and where to find the file)\n\nOverall, Fallout 3 is a fun game with a good story and the freedom to explore anywhere in the game world and the DLC's only add to that experience. 9 out of 10 (because there are a few bugs but nothing seriously serious)\nWould highly recommend!","August 21, 2014","true","40.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, this is a hunk of a buggy mess, but that's because this was designed to run on WIndows Vista (and we know how much more steaming that is). Luckily, generous souls created freely availiable patches and resources to keep crashing and bugs to a minimum (which is surprising to hear from a Bethesda game). If you are interested more in map design, this is the game for you. If you are more interested in character and story, I'm pretty sure you should check Fallout: New Vegas. Don't worry, because both games take place in different places in a post-apocalyptic environment, the plot of one game will not reach the ears of the other coast in time to spoil the plot of the other game.

Pin point an enemy's body parts using the advanced "Vault Assisted Targeting System".\n\nI would recommend getting the GOTY as the dlc's add exiting and interresting gameplay. The ending of the main quest line is very anti-climatic, but this is fixed with the "Broken Steel" addon included in the GOTY.\n\nI run this game on a Windows Vista Ultimate PC, but if you are using Windows 7 or 8 then you might have problems playing.\n\n9.99/10","June 21, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly its better than Fallout: New Vegas, but thats my personal opinion.\nSimply so much to explore, dozens of game hours to play, modding available on PC providing alot of new content.\nI recommend getting the Game of the Year Edition, it includes so much more content for quite low price.\nThis game is more than perfect for its low price.\n\nThe Good:\n-Absolutely great storyline and sidestories.\n-Very good replay value, you can play the game multiple times. I guarantee it won't get boring fast.\n-Freedom to explore what you want, when you want\n-Fantastic, intricate quests can be completed in a variety of satisfying/exciting ways\n-VATS combat system results in all sorts of tense and awesome battle encounters\n-Outstanding art design for the whole world, voice actors, sounds, quests, weapons. Just pretty much everything.\n-Exploring, Killing, Looting, Questing. Everything has a mixture of excitement and rewarding.\n-Very well optimized, Runs VERY well even of very bad computers. Even a 200e computer can run this solid 60 fps with right settings.\n-Very excellent character developement\n-Karma system is pretty good\n\nThe Bad:\n-If you dont like open worlds, or running around huge areas you won't enjoy this for that long.\n-Combat will eventually get boring after quite some time (But this is the same for every kind of FPS, cant really be fixed)\n-Windows Live creates problems (Can be fixed with using Windows Live Disabler tool)\n-Game crashes alot (This can also be fixed with downloading patches and mods)","February 14, 2014","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can do that too. There is so much to explore. There is so many things to discover. Finding and completing quests in the capital wasteland is immense fun. Defeating enemies and collecting their loot never gets old. The story is great. Something I will never forget. From the moment you begin the game through to the end, you will enjoy every second. The soundtrack in Fallout 3 is great. You will get these songs stuck in your head. With top notch talent such as Liam Neeson and Malcolm McDowell, the voice acting is phenomenal. What Bethesda has created here is a perfect video game. But don’t stop at what they give you. There is a very strong mod community that adds even more to the game. Bethesda put so much hard work in to Fallout 3. It would be a true shame if you didn’t experience it.","March 15, 2013","true","219.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is astoundingly amazing, and if further interested is piqued during gameplay, the fallout lore series on youtube is a must to understand the concept of how this world in fallout came to be. Much like ours, it was a world where power corrupted, and even the highest fathoms of government were involved in experiments on their public, "vaults" they were called, safehavens for the survivors of the great war, but also social experiments conducted during the pre-war period before 2077. Being set 200 years after the events that devasted mankind, you as the lone wanderer must survive the true wasteland, from mutants to raiders, androids to deathclaws this is an adventure that will boggle your mind and make you really value the precious meaning of human life, outcomes are affected by actions, consequences depending on how you interact with others, Fallout is an experience rather than a game, it makes us think what it really means to be human, why we live, and what could happen if we let all of our past go to waste...........promptly set in the United States and with reference to "Communist China" is a huge focal point of this amazing game, the DLCs further expand on the fallout Universe in such a way to make it exciting and inspiring. 10/10 And the Enclave...well who says governments always served their people!\n\nWould recommend 110%, and looking forward to Fallout 4!.","August 3, 2012","true","92.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly its better than Fallout: New Vegas, but thats my personal opinion.\nSimply so much to explore, dozens of game hours to play, modding available on PC providing alot of new content.\nI recommend getting the Game of the Year Edition, it includes so much more content for quite low price.\nThis game is more than perfect for its low price.\n\nThe Good:\n-Absolutely great storyline and sidestories.\n-Very good replay value, you can play the game multiple times. I guarantee it won't get boring fast.\n-Freedom to explore what you want, when you want\n-Fantastic, intricate quests can be completed in a variety of satisfying/exciting ways\n-VATS combat system results in all sorts of tense and awesome battle encounters\n-Outstanding art design for the whole world, voice actors, sounds, quests, weapons. Just pretty much everything.\n-Exploring, Killing, Looting, Questing. Everything has a mixture of excitement and rewarding.\n-Very well optimized, Runs VERY well even of very bad computers. Even a 200e computer can run this solid 60 fps with right settings.\n-Very excellent character developement\n-Karma system is pretty good\n\nThe Bad:\n-If you dont like open worlds, or running around huge areas you won't enjoy this for that long.\n-Combat will eventually get boring after quite some time (But this is the same for every kind of FPS, cant really be fixed)\n-Windows Live creates problems (Can be fixed with using Windows Live Disabler tool)\n-Game crashes alot (This can also be fixed with downloading patches and mods)","February 14, 2014","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Woulda been nice if they added an option to move kinda like Dragon Age though, that would have added a lot of spunk to the game.

This fixes the inconsistent crashes of the game.\nNow that I've ENLIGHTENED you of that, Fallout 3 is an amazing RPG. If you don't like sandbox games, don't worry, there's a great quest with markers so you don't have to wander around for things. If linear storylines aren't your thing, you can wander the vast American Wasteland, pillaging shanty towns with an evil cohort, or helping the unfortunate as a lone altruist.\nThe game's graphics, as some mentioned, aren't state-of-the-art to 2013's standards. However, one needs to realize that this game is from 2008 and using anti-aliasing will fix jagged textures. There are plenty of visual mods for the game outside of Steam as well (no Steam Workshop support for the game).\nThe optional VATS combat system makes the game turned based in a sense. This is perfect if you aren't a great shooter, or you want to relax more while you play.\nThere aren't any vehicles to drive in the game, but I don't think that's much of a missing feature because the atmosphere isn't meant for driving around the Washington, D.C. metro area. The Quick Travel function in your map saves you from the fear of having to walk across the Wasteland, so no worries!\nThere are many trainable skills in the game that will keep you busy, ranging from Equipment Repair, Medical, Hacking, and of course, Marksmanship (not exact names, but in layman's terms). If you've played Runescape or the Elder Scrolls, the skills system is very reminiscent. In addition to this, the Perks system allows you to pick a special trait each time you level your character up.\nI give Fallout 3: GOTY Edition a legitimate 100% rating because I find no faults in it, hence my length review.","November 29, 2013","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadheadyates/recommended/22370/","deadheadyates","deadheadyates","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadheadyates/","135 products in account","This is without a doubt one of the most incredible games I've had the pleasure of playing. Its also one of the few games I can say I've ever deveoped an addiction to (seriously this game was like crack to me when I started playing it, the first week of me owning it saw maybe 18-20 hours of sleep).  The first time I played it was two years ago on the PS3, and replaying it again on the PC is so much better, mostly due to smoother gameplay and fewer bugs (special thanks to user BenWah for his amazing guide to not only making this game run properly, but the amazing mod community at the Nexus forums that he links in his discussion board posts for this game. Check it out and your experience with this game will be vastly improved/possible).\n\nAs far as the meat of the game goes, the story is centered around the quest for your character, the lone wanderer of Vault 101, to find his/her father who mysteriously leaves the Vault and stirs an uproar amongst the Vault-dwellers and the corrupt security forces that govern them. Along the journey you discover a greater purpose for delving into the wastes of Washington, D.C. as you unravel the conflict surrounding warring factions that inhabit the wastes vying for supremacy, whom you will ultimatley decide the fate of.\n\nFor those who played either The Elder Scrolls Oblivion or Skyrim, or have run through a story of Fallout: New Vegas, the game mechanics should be simple to familiarize yourselves with. For those new to Bethesda's brand of open-world RPG's, there are light survival elements (weapon maintenace, healthcare concerns, ability to sleep for resting bonuses to stats), a rather sparse but useful crafting system, and a wide variety of stealth and combat options that can be used to fit your own play style (heavier armor slows you down, leaves less room in your weight-based inventory, and impedes stealth abilities, but makes you much harder to kill and vice versa, things like that).\n\nThe Karma system does an interesting job of steering which companions you can recruit based on Karmic levels, and steers the outcome of future interactions based on choices made in conversation and dealings with other people. While they usually boil down to black, white, or grey choices, they have an amusing impact on conversations and how the denizens of the wastes react to your presence.An interesting mechanic  that I haven't seen outside of the last two Fallout games is the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. Costing a regenerating supply of action points to use, it stops time and breaks down the major sections of a targets body and lists your chances to hit each part with your currently equipped weapon. This is especially convenient due to the fact that there is a zoom aim, but no ironsight aiming with anything but scoped weapons (there are mods that correct this issue, but the orginal game is ironsight free) which can feel a lttle disconcerting in the middle of combat for those who are used to the tight gunplay of shooter based games such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most incredible feature of this game, for me at least, is the vast, rich world that from the very first moment you leave Vault 101 you have complete freedom to explore at your own risk. The series beefy lore is expanded and integrated into the game in numerous ways, and is thoroughly fleashed out in documents, audio logs, and items that you can find scattered amongst the ruins of the wastes (if you're into that sort of thing). In almost every settlement there are secrets to uncover and quests to acquire from a desloate bandit hovel to the crumbling ruins of downtown D.C., which can quckly fill your menu into an extensive to-do list. The world itself would be interesting enough to pick through were it devoid of life, but an enourmous and entertaining variety of characters keeps the experience even more engaging, whether you're recovering the last remaining Stradivarius from one of the several Vaults available to explore in the world, assisting the electoral campaigns of the residents of the isolated Republic of Dave, or deciding the fate of the patron deity of a cult of wasteland tree worshipers.\n\nThe game has als ohad plenty of post-release support, with five DLC packs that expand the already lengthy base game with several hours of even more questing and exploration. Each pack takes you beyond the Wasteland to decide the fate of a slave colony in Pittsburgh, travel to Maryland to explore a mind bending and dangerous swamp, enter a VR simulation to re-live the events of a key moment in the Fallout mythos: the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska, take the fight against the Enclave further north to Addams Airforce Base to finish them off once and for all, and even miles above the surface of the wasteland to join other abductees in a despearte bid to escape an alien spacecraft. Each pack adds several new perks and weapons that even further enhance the game, and each one can be started at any point of progress through the main story (except for Broken Steel, which requires you to finish the main story before it can be started). Coupled with the incredible support of its dedicated modding community, there are almost limitless variations and user created mission packs to explore and waffle around with at your leisure.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the game is among the best I've ever played, and obviously there's something to it given its lauded reputation as one of the finest games of the last generation. If I had to rate this game in terms of a sandwich, it would be a Reuben; a seemingly odd combination of elements that are already pretty great on their own, but when put together, create a wonderful and satisfying product that leaves you hungering for more (and kind of lamenting the fact that you powered through the damn thing in the first place).","December 3, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are thrown in the wastle land after leaving vault 101 and from there you have so many choices and decisions that must be and can be made by you which will shape your adventure in the wasteland,  personally, I searched for as many bobble heads and unique weapons that i could find and completed the dlc's which each were very different and added alot to the overall fallout expierience. Most people who play this game know the atmosphere and music that accompanies you on your journey throughout the wasteland is what makes it so great. Galaxy new radio music is what is great and suits the era fallout 3 is based in and the wasteland also. Although the main campaign is fairly short, its all the other things in fallout 3 which make it great, the vats system, the item pick up and repair system, the dark gloomy fallout environment, the overall atmosphere and freedom given to you from near the start of the game and also the perk and specials were very well implemented and encourage multiple playthroughs and experimenting. Problems with it is the short and not so difficult main story, but this is still enjoyable and combined with all other elements creates a game that will be remembered in the history of Games.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","It's like Borderlands, if Borderlands were better and a single player experience and actually built up some semblance of an atmosphere that wasn't all just ''sand sand sand epic memes''.\n\nYou explore the wastelands and, while there's a main storyline (search for your father), the side quests are honestly where its at. Unlike Borderlands typical ''go to area X, kill things and come back'', Fallout 3 has storylines to each side quest that range from the intruiging to the surprising. The areas were the side quests take you are also areas you'd expect to be part of the main storyline, since they're very detailed and numerous. Seriously, if you only play the main storyline you'd miss well over half of the game, and that's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe way in which you find out about quests makes the whole experience feel more realistic. You don't go to a bulletin board and pick quests, rather, you might run into a citizen with a request, pick up a strange radio signal in a particular area, find a note while exploring a new locale, or just happen to stumble upon a fight taking place. It all immerses you into the world and gives it a realistic feeling of exploration and loneliness. Some of the quests also present you with multiple ways to finish them, which means that you get a real sense of added importance to your choices. It got to the point where I was juggling dialogue choices and planning what to do to proceed, as I didn't wanna have one party come to an unfavorable outcome while the other struck gold.\n\nThe battle system gives options: you can realistically go through the whole game using only VATS, an RPG-ish system whereby you attack enemies with your equipped weapon; you select a body part of theirs and are shown the odds the attack will hit. Or you can play this entierely as a first person (or third person) shooter. Personally, I found no issue with the shooting, but apparently this is a point of contention as some say its like an attempt at a FPS in an engine that wasn't made for that. I'll say this: it isn't broken and there's nothing inherently wrong with it.\n\nA word of warning; this game isn't optimized for Windows 7 (Vista as well, I think), so you might have issues running it. I simply had to change the ini file to allow multi-cores, and the crashes stopped. But others have had a much tougher time at it, so give it a pirate first.\n\nBut issues aside, a solid 9/10 with hours of exploration. I'm 70 hours in and not even halfway through the main game cause I've been exploring and doing sidequests.","January 9, 2014","true","260.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

However, unlike it's "sequel" Fallout: New Vegas, there is little replayability to be found in Fallout 3. Nor is there much to do once you've beaten the main story. The DLC were all pretty bland, and I could hardly stand Mothership Zeta.The main story was great, if a tad more like The Elder Scrolls than hoped by me.\n\nThe characters were flat. Of the few with personality, I only enjoyed the player's father, who -Spoiler Alert- dies half way into the story, and the computer mainframe running the Enclave, who is also destroyed quickly.\n\nThis game was good for exploration, I will note. Even after playing it for atleast three days of my life, I still discover new locations and challenges. Look for the MIRV launcher, I dare you!\n\nI suggest buying Fallout 3 on sale for half-off, with it's DLC for the miniscule content they add. Your best bet for interesting play would be with mods, which are in abundance on the Nexus mod site, but that community is grinding to a halt. Buy it fast, play it slow, and mod the hell out of it.\n\nI would say Fallout 3 deserves a rating of, eh, 7/10.","August 14, 2013","true","94.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also the first modern Fallout title. Oddly Fallout 3 is critically acclaimed across the board as you can see with a 91 metacritic score, as well as overwhelmingly highly regarded by most RPG lovers, but is WOEFULLY underrated and under-apreciated by quite a few of the older fans of the Fallout franchise.\n\nIt makes no sense to me, because I love all of the Fallouts and don't see this heavily exaggerated "lore-bashing" that apparently Fallout 3 has/does. In fact, I as well as most people feel Bethesda Game Studios did a terrific job setting the tone of the old Fallouts and staying in line with the lore with Fallout 3.\n\nRegardless, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're an avid RPG fan and not playing Fallout 3 or the rest of the Fallout franchise. They're all terrific RPG's that all offer an equally unique, darkly funny, retro-futuristic, bleak and twisted tone. Each quest can be completed in multiple ways. Fallout 3 is a great RPG, and you should definitely play it, as well as Fallout: NV, Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Fallout Tactics ain't half bad either.\n\nFallout 3 is a 10/10 easily for me. Great RPG, that is part of a great RPG franchise. Go play it.","September 28, 2014","true","67.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So much replay value. Such a deep and satisfying world. Very well thought out characters who all have their own interesting and unique stories to tell. The wasteland is yours to adventure and you have the freedom to do as you wish.\n\nAlso has awesome story line, and side quests, which aren't just errrand courier quests. Every quest is unique and gives you great rewards for the effort and time that they take.\n\nPLAY THIS GAME\n\n","December 19, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Try this on for size! This gives you the core game plus its five add-ons. And now, would be a great time, I got this for 66% off retail value! Just think of it, the world has nearly ended, and Vaults were created as sanctums. As a survivor of Vault 101, your job, find your dad. Mods are possible to do with this game, but I reccomend playing it vanilla (no mods), first.\n\nThey said it's not optimized for Windows 7, big load of BS, just make the main game executable large address aware.

Three months of nearly constant play and I'm just a hair from finishing my first full playthrough.  The game is surprisingly stable for a BethSoft creation (elegant & elaborate code, yes...stable? umm...) and I'm looking forward to many more hours of entertainment from all the 3rd-party creations that people have brought about thanks to Bethesda granting us the G.E.C.K.\n\nJoin in the fun...","March 21, 2011","true","534.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The immersion is amazing and has been perfected, it sucks you into the core. The gameplay is exciting and fresh with some repetiton but in a good balance with exploration and fighting. The story is great and the ending is a brillant close. The level of replay value is amazing with so much content even in a single playthrough due to the vast expanse of the Capital Wasteland. Easily one of the best RPGs that has been made and will probably remain as one of the best.","December 8, 2013","true","55.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a must have for people that like the elder scrolls games if you did not like any of the elder scroll games you should not buy this game and you should also go to a mental asylum.\n\nAnd for people having trouble with getting it to work for windows 8 just go and watch some video on youtube on how to do it BUT once they tell you to change the prefs DO that bit but they will probably tell you to get something off the nexus and do some other things but you just need do the prefs part or atleast thats what happend to me.","November 15, 2014","true","75.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
