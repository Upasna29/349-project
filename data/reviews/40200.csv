It allows for clicking, reading (with speaking for children that cant read), drawing and puzzle solving.\n\nNot for older children and may be a little expensive for Â£7 however if you can find it in a sale and you have a child that wants to play games with you then I would highly recomend.\n\nThe puzzles are simple enough to complete most simply by playing the game in an exploratory fashion however there is a challenge to find all the puzzles for each level which will allow for more of a goal as your child gets older.\n\nRecommended age: 3-8 (Depending on your childs abilities)","June 9, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
