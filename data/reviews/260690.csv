Unfortunately, I am quite, quite dumb, and don't know why I even attempt these point-and-click adventures (perhaps the existance of rare ones that I can actually get my stupid head around, like Sam Peters).\n\nBut unlike, say, Scratches, which is essentially a poorly-designed imitation of this, I can recognise and appreciate that the puzzles in this are by-and-largely quite sensible and clever, I just honestly COULD NOT BE BUGGERED investing the many hours of my life it will take to complete this without constant reference to a walkthrough.  In other words, I'm happy to concede that in this instance it's not the GAME...it's ME.  Sigh.  The adventure games I "grew up" with were more of the early Resident Evil / Silent Hill-ish ilk - that is to say, more "action-adventure"-ish games - and I believe the more sporadic and generally EASIER nature of the puzzle-solving in such games may have stunted my intellectual growth.  Oh well.  Another failure in life that I will have to tuck under my well-weathered belt...\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, however, to those of you out there who can rise to this kind of challenge.  It's atmospheric, ever-so-slightly scary and as I said, very smart.  The sound design in particular is very impressive, with spooky noises aplenty and voice acting well above par for a video game from any era, not least of all the one that this is from.  It's a quality product, no doubt about it.  Just depends on your cup of tea, and the head that you're pouring it into.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","December 21, 2013","true","2.4"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","52","57","7","0"

Reasons why I loved it with a passion:\n\n1) It can be considered horror, but it's not a survival horror game. That means you can't die. Nonetheless, the combination of graphics, music and sounds make it wonderfully in horror mood. It doesn't have the classic "jump-scares" (which, for me, is a good thing), but it has an overall eerie atmosphere that had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Now, most players who enjoy survival horror can't feel scared if they know that they can't die, but this game is creepy enough to give me some occasional goosepumps.\n\n2) The puzzles aren't too silly or obvious, but the difficulty doesn't rely on the dreadful pixel-hunt for that little object that you don't know that you have to find*. Also, my favorite thing about this game is that there are absolutely no "inventory based" puzzles (meaning, combine items from your inventory in the most illogical ways until you find that specific combination that makes no sense to anyone except the developers). Not here. All the puzzles are logical puzzles, things that you solve by finding clues and using your little gray cells. And that's just my cup of tea.\n\n3) Even though you can't run (there isn't double click to move faster), I never got to the point of wishing I could. You don't really have to watch your character walking; it's first person view and movement feels natural.\n\n4) This quality for the price is unbelievable. I would recommend buying the Dark Fall Collection (1 and 2) together, even thought I haven't played the second one yet; that's how much I loved Dark Fall: The Journal.\n\n*Note: I don't particularly consider it a real puzzle using a key to open a door. I'm talking about actual puzzles that you have to solve.","August 8, 2014","true","10.0"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/260690/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","This is a really smart and creepy game! I bought Dark Fall 1 and 2 in a bundle sale a couple weeks ago and I have to say that knowing what I know now, these games are worth their full retail price.\nFirst the good stuff: This game has a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. This is an old game, but I think it still looks great. You are alone in an abandoned 1940's English train station, investigating the disappearance of your brother, and what happened to the people who were at the station. You never truly are alone, since there are ghosts all around you, watching you, and sometimes helping you along the way. The scares are all in what you hear, not what you see, which I think is more powerful. There are no jump scares, and there is no fear of dying. However, I always felt a little on edge which says a lot since I knew I couldn't die. There is lots and lots of reading. I personally like that because it fleshes out the lives of the people that worked there, the times in which the events took place, and the story the protagonist is involved in. As far as the soundtrack is concerned, for the most part we get ambient sounds that fit the atmosphere.\nNow for the potential negatives. I do not consider these things negatives, but for many gamers these may be stumbling blocks. As I mentioned be prepared to read A LOT of material. The puzzles are smart, but not impossible. They range from pretty easy to having to think for a while. While you do have an overall objective (help your brother) the game does not give you mini objectives, forcing you to just jump in and piece it together as you explore the train station and train hotel. YOU WILL TAKE NOTES! There is no in game journal, so be prepared to have a notepad and a No. 2 ready(Does anybody use No. 2's anymore?)! Since you read so much and the game does not tell you what is important or not, you will probably end of documenting a lot. As you progress through the game, it does become more clear on what to take note of. You will also need a notebook to decode two messages you find. Now the only negative I had with the game is that while it is a wonderfully creepy game that is meant to be played with the lights off, its hard to play that way when you need to take notes! However playing this at night with no interruptions has helped keep the mood creepy.\nSo for those who consider themselves true adventure fans (this game really brings out my inner snob), definitely give it a play. This may scare the adventure gamers of today who need the in game journal or constant voice over instead of reading. I thought this was a pleasant challenge and I look forward to playing Dark Fall: Lights Out.","March 8, 2015","true","15.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/260690/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","I liked this game a lot. It's very very similar to Myst (probably most like Myst 2 aka Riven) except spooky and about ghosts. There's no jump scares at all which is rare to find.\n\nIt's just a point and click about ghosts and you basically roam around learning what happened. It's actually really neat if you like reading notes. You pretty much slowly start to learn everything thats going on and get to know the ghosts that are there slowly. A lot of the notes are optional and only give you information about the place you're at but it usually comes together in a neat way.\n\nan easy example that doesn't give away much: you go into the womans bathroom and there's a flickering light. For just a split second in one of the flickering lights you see a shadow of a person. Sooner or later if you're looking around you'll find out that there had been complaints a LONG time ago about peeping toms and what not. It's just cool how they work it all together. Everything is there for a reason and easy to overlook, but neat if you focus.\n\nbig problem though is like Myst is its an old school point and click and expects you to write everything down or just know to click certain tiny pixels you'd probably miss. If you want to keep your sanity play this game with a guide on hand and just use it when you get stuck.\n\noverall its pretty cool. Really nice atmosphere and generally spooky without a single jump scare which I appreciate a lot. Play it if you like those old Myst games. If you're not a fan, it might not be best to start here.","October 13, 2014","true","11.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

It was hard to tell what information was relevant, so prepare to read a lot and write a lot of things down with actual pen and paper.\n\nThe slow exploration of abandoned locations with ghost hunting gear kind of makes this a ghost hunting simulator, which I thought was fun because I'm a big fan of Ghost Hunters.

Very decent story and interesting enough to keep your attention until the game's ending. Although be warned that the ending is a bit of a let-down and actually quite bland compared to the story leading to it. Anyway, you'll get a decent 7-8 hours of adventuring here if you're good with this type of games.\n\nThe puzzles are never too obtuse or complicated to solve and you have a chance to freely explore the different environments and find your own clues. Be sure to keep pen and paper around as you will be jotting down a LOT of clues and pictures and notes. This game truly makes you feel like a paranormal investigator who is trying to get to the bottom of a very intruiging mystery. A wealthy amount of notes and diaries flesh out the miriad of different residents of the haunted hotel.\n\nThe game looks dated and does not run in widescreen but that is not the point here. I still got chills down my spine every time I stepped into the hallways of the derelict hotel. The detail in every nook and cranny is very impressive and does not show any sign of true aging. The use of sound is limited yet strong and to the point. I loved every bit of audio this game had in it.\n\nIf you are looking for pure horror then this game will be a waste of your time. However, if you want a very atmospheric and spooky adventure classic with good story and challenging yet fair puzzles give this mystery a go. I'm very sure you'll appreciate it if you choose to take it slow and enjoy the full story.","July 15, 2014","true","8.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is a point and click adventure with a lot of examination and walking around a haunted station and hotel. You'll have to take notes during your adventure to set the "ghosts" free in this game.\n\nThe game plays like an older first person point & click and that is exactly what it is, don't forget that you have a game that is already twelve years old. It wasn't a smash hit back then, but it is a decent game nonetheless. If you like mystery adventures give this game a try, you might be genuinely surprised by the game. Also because of the ghost hunting fad of the recent years this game might also catch a nerve with fans of those Series.\n\nThe game is decent, as I already said. Decent means that it has no surprising features, but also that it's quite solid fare, nothing to grind teeth on. The riddles can sometimes be hard, but that is also no surprise to a game from the past, games back then were far less casual. Sound and graphic are of course dated now, but still good enough to keep this game in your library and actually play it.\n\nI can recomend this game, but you have to be an adventure aficinado to actually enjoy this game, more you also have to be a retro adventure fan and you require to have quite the energy to sit the game through.

I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys point and click adventures and doesn't mind some thinking. However, the game is TERRIBLE at explaining things. My advice would be if you want to play this to have a pen and paper to hand and write down EVERYTHING that you can. Often there will be some tidbit in some random book about some random character and that will actually be crucial information. Whilst this is not necessarily a problem, it isn't even mentioned from the outset you need to either have a notebook and pen to hand or be rainman. It's extremely frustrating to have to go back and re-read through everything (and worse, repeating completed puzzles - unforgivable!!!) just because there is some random word(s) you will need to remember.\n\nAside from those few nags GET THIS! It creates an awesome atmosphere and if you get into the storyline and follow it to the end it can be really satisfying.

The Darkfall games are indeed creepy at times but the scariness subsides when you don't know where to go or what to do next.  Frustration sets in and you're forced to use a guide to finish, which ruins this game for me.  You are constantly walking around the station looking for things to click on next even after you've already been in a certain area.  Backtracking is a huge deal in the DF games and personally I can't stand that.  The old pre rendered graphics don't bother me...its the lack of an explanation of what to do next that irks me.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think it's a terrible adventure title, I just couldn't get into it. Animations and sound bits will constantly recycle if you keep clicking on things, even much later in the game. For example, clicking on a portrait in one of the rooms will play a sound bit from a ghost. Clicking back and again on the portrait will just recycle the sound bit over and over. You'd think that ghost would get tired of saying that same line over and over. Just stuff like that ruins the immersion for me.

There are no subtitles so all I managed to catch were fragments of the conversation. The voice acting is unbelievably horrid. The man implies that something malevolent is going to get him, and that it's getting closer and almost reaching him, but yet the way he speaks sounds dead calm and monotonous, with zero sense of urgency. This, coupled with the absence of any graphics or animation (except seeing a map of London appear), made for a stupefyingly unexciting and underwhelming start to the game.\n\nOnce you reach your destination, all you do is wander around very dimly-lit places. There is the voice of a supposedly ghost boy or whatever at the start to guide you a bit, but there is no indication of who he might be, or why you should care. Exploring the individual rooms reveals stuff you can zoom in on, but not do anything with.\n\nThis is related to how fragmented the story is. You are thrown into the location and expected to explore, with no prompts or further hints as to how all of this is coming together. All you discover are loose pieces of information that have seemingly no relation to one another. The lack of cohesion and further instruction makes everything you do seem pointless.\n\nIt may have been due to the general cheesiness and tiredness of the plot and its elements (old hotel, dark trails, dimly-lit rooms, etc), or just the fact that the story (and how little we know of it) got off to such a lousy start and is so uninspired, but this game struck me as being more lame than scary. I wanted to roll my eyes and laugh at the fact that anyone could find this creepy, eerie, unnerving, frightening, etc etc etc in the least. It all struck me as being extremely B-grade horror flick. Now, if you want a truly nerve-wracking game, give Corrosion a try. This one comes nowhere close to matching it in terms of story, ambience and immersion.\n\nNo music, just sound. You hear a few ghost voices now and then, and weird clinks and clunks. And somehow it all adds to the cheesiness, not scariness. These developers were going by the book way too much.\n\nAll you ever see is blackness, really. It takes up about 70% of most screens. And yet, it's still not scary. I played Corrosion (mentioned above) just a few days before this game, and all the screens were brightly lit but you still felt a general sense of unease. Horror isn't just conveyed by dark corners and weird sounds.\n\nI couldn't understand why there was no option for subtitles. Voice comes on quite suddenly at times, and you have to wait till the person finishes speaking in order to get all the information. With subtitles you could readily click them away once you were done reading them. What a time-waster. It was also irritating because sometimes the voice came on when you zoomed in on an object, and when you zoomed out, the voice disappeared. Which meant you had to zoom in again and wait for the voice to completely play out. UGHHHH. And when I mean "no text", I mean that there are absolutely no descriptions of anything whatsoever in this game. If you hover over an item, all you see is a cursor change, telling you whether you can do anything with it or not. So very often, you're not quite sure what exactly you're looking at, which limits how you think about the item and its possible uses.\n\nSo, in addition to there being no subtitles, there's also no "return to main menu" option. No audio level controls, no brightness setting, no windowed mode, nothing. There's only "save", "load", and "quit" tucked in the right-hand corner of the screen. And when you click on "save", a Windows window (not the game's own window, mind you) pops up, prompting you to select a location to save the file. And - get this - the file is a .TXT file. Yup, a TEXT file. Wow, is it the 1980s again or something? I mean, I've nothing against this, but well, it sure shows how archaic this game system is!\n\nThis is a point-n-click adventure game, but it sure as heck doesn't play like one, in terms of controls and game quality. Items aren't labelled at all, so you've sometimes no idea what you're looking at. And I couldn't figure out how to use the items in the inventory, because they don't work like in other games where you click them and they become "active". No in-game help or tutorials explaining how things work either. And, as mentioned above, clicking on any item - whether or not in your inventory - yields no description whatsoever. This to me just spelled lazy programming, or extremely primaeval game mechanics.\n\nSince there's no windowed mode, I was forced to play this on my 1920 x 1080 screen. The graphics were very pixellated.\n\nLack of guidance, lack of clear goals, lack of understanding of what you're looking at, lack of understanding of location, lack of relevance of items to the story, etc etc all contribute to everything being too loosely tied together to matter. My patience wore thin really fast. Perhaps there was a great story underneath this mess, but if there was, the player sure wasn't given any indication of it!","April 28","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Ghostly music, creaking floorboards, disembodied voices, and the ever-present shadow of a malevolent specter combine to draw players in and electrify their nerves.\n\nThe object of the game, without disclosing spoilers, is to investigate an abandoned train station while searching for your missing brother. The mechanics are similar to the Nancy Drew mystery game series; players search for clues and solve puzzles to piece together exactly what happened in this eeire place. As the player progresses, they will learn that there is something very wrong at the station. Something is here - something evil. It knows who you are, It knows what you're doing, and It must not find you.\n\nOverall, the game is quite a spectacular, haunting piece.\n\nBUT BUYERS (particularly parents) BE WARNED:\n\nWhen the ESRB rated the game, they missed something. Room 3F contains a drawer full of photographs of nude women, which would quite arguably raise this game to an M-rating. It may be possible to complete the game without opening said drawer, but I cannot in good conscience recommend a game that contains such material - not when it has been published with a false rating.\n\nIt speaks very poorly of Darkling Room that they allowed this game to be published with what they most certainly knew to be an erroneous rating. I will not be purchasing anything from them in the future.\n\nEdit: Some clarification, since apparently people are misinterpreting the purpose of my review:\n\nMy primary beef with the game is not that it has nudity in it. My beef with Dark Fall is that, unless the ESRB process was different back when this game was first published, the developers lied to the ESRB to get a more favorable rating. That, or, for some strange reason, the ESRB didn't think a drawer full of playboy-style nude photos was worth mentioning in the rating. I rather doubt the latter.\n\nSo, while I disapprove of the nude photos, that's not the reason I'm bashing the game. The reason I'm bashing the game is for its developers' unethical business practices.","February 1, 2014","false","6.5"," 8 of 43 people (19%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","19","8","43","4","4"

Same for objectives.\n\nThe gameplay consists of the player clicking on various parts of the scenery to move about and explore.

I was pleasantly surprised by the rich story and immersive atmosphere. The game certainly has a Myst vibe to it; the player feels completely isolated and must put together the answers to puzzles without much in-game guidance. There is a small hint feature in-game but it's rather unpredictable and not particularly useful toward the end of the game. If you like this old-school type of adventure game, then I would certianly recommend playing Dark Fall. If you are not into puzzles or prefer games that offer a little more hand-holding this game is probably not for you.","March 27","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend it, but only to certain game players.\n\nIt's an old-school game in the sense that you don't have an automatic quest journal or a map with bright "here's where you need to go now" markers. You will have to do a lot of reading and note-taking in a paper journal (as in, one made of actual paper that will sit by your computer). The puzzles require you to do lots of hunting around for clues. Not everything is obvious, and you will spend time hunting around and clicking in random places. If you lose patience, there are a few good walkthroughs you can read, including excellent one that will give you just enough of a hint that you can get on the right track and solve it on your own. I got stuck two or three times and checked the walkthrough, and I didnt' feel like the game suffered much because I had to do so. I really enjoyed the whole thing - especially once I figured out where the plot was going (also not obvious at first).\n\nOn the other hand, if you're a player who is not willing to read a lot of random letters and keep your own journal of notes, you will probably hate this game. Just reading a walkthrough and going through the motions will not provide a good experience.","December 5, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to take note of all the clues, follow the story carefully as it unfolds and of course as in Myst you have no have no idea what your goal is right away. I never cared too much for those games where you get no clue as to what is going on, you have to figure it out yourself and you don't know the story or what your goal is until you figure it out but it's an ok game. Got it on sale so that is a plus. Plenty scary at times, but nothing nightmare inducing.","May 24","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
