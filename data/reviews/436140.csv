(So let's say we need 10 Wealth to win)\nYou can trade any reosurce for 2 of another resource, but you can only do this a limited amount of times.\nSo say you trade 1 life for 2 wealth, 2 power for 4 wealth, and 2 faith for 4 wealth = 10 wealth you win\n(watch the video above to get a better idea)\n\n+ There is a small bit of strategy, as you need to keep track of how many "transfer cards" you have, once they run out it can be hard to complete the objective if you transferred too much to the wrong resource pool.\n\n- Does a poor job at explaining what you are doing, and it's pretty odd to say the least. You are supposevely "building" statues and such, but all you are really doing is transferring resource pools to and from each other.\n- The portraits in the character selection screen look pretty silly, like photoshopped faces\n- The gameplay is far too simple\n- The upgrade screen is a bit out of place for a game like this...\n- Overall I just thought the game was a bit confusing, like a concept that just didn't work out in the end.\n","January 29","false","4.2"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

The concept is interesting, but doesn't have a lot of depth. Your only stategy is to beat the 'time' counter.\nI loved the developer's two 'Hero of the Kingdom' games, so I bought this one for sale at a buck. Then I made most of that dollar back through luck with dropped cards. I'm still not sure the few cents invested were worth it.\n\n- You're going to hover over the cards a lot (mostly for the bonus/extra cards). Well, the UI makes tooltips show up with a slow fade-in effect that makes you waste a lot of time. Easily a second per card. Grand!\n\n- More time wasters: the wall transition (so slow and ugly!), and the upgrade screen that still shows up even after you've upgraded everything. (Okay, most people will never upgrade everything, so it's not really an issue but...)\n\n- User interface in general is *bad*. Nothing is done to help the player. All you'll be doing in this game is read through numbers, and it doesn't want to make it easy or fun.\n\n- Story is non-existent, and totally unrelated to the actual gameplay screens. It's cliché and probably even insulting to Egyptians. And the story screens, while few in numbers, certainly don't lack in typos. There's only one character, and it's you. But you have nothing to say. You're just a fantastic, extraordinary god-like/snorefest of a person who's also so incredibly kind that they'll help others in exchange for a huge pyramid. Yeah, sure, that's totally someone I can recognize myself in.\n\nSo... Yeah, just play the other games by this developer, they're quite good, just not this one. If you want a good card/strategy game, I'm sure you can find it yourself, I'm not your mummy. (Ah. Ah. Egypt. Sorry.)","April 7","false","4.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

Rules are simple and everything is up to you to work out brain. Animations are a little slow, it would be good if there is an option for speed control. Game has everything, achievements, trading cards and lots of fun. Is not expensive and give ti a try.","February 17","true","2.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"
