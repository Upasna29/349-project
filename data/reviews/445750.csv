Messed up little horror game for a fair price with a well told messed up story. Reminds me of 'Home', but a little different, and without branching endings. Takes about 30 minutes to beat.

Settled lacks in length as a laid back 40-minute experience which isn't interactive enough as a game to be called much more than what people call a walking simulator. What excels is the execution of the narrative and the strange, eerie tale itself which would have all been marvellous to build upon as a point and click like the aforementioned horror series.\n\nUsing the arrow keys to move and back out from interactions and spacebar to interact with highlighted objects, you are introduced to the story much the way you would reading a picture book. You move your character mainly through a house among other locations whilst looking at objects and a variety of scenes to easily grasp a timeline to put together your own version of the events that seem to have unfolded. Excruciatingly tempting as it is to unveil a little bit of the story, it is the core of this game and as someone who went in without an ounce of knowledge about Settled I am glad I went in blindfolded and came out with a sense of uneasiness as I doubt I would have felt as intensely had I known any of the story beforehand.\n\nThis is what I yearn for badly written narrative reliant games to turn into, namely poorly penned visual novels or bland exploration games that lack any literal composition. Settled uses an elegant method of telling stories with minimal text yet still emphasising a narrative rich experience. You are presented with flashbacks or self reflection and these snippets of thoughts and scenes are accompanied by a bare minimum of text. Many indie developers have a wealth of creativity in them but don't possess the skills crucial to relay it effectively by utilising written word to the extent of a novella or even an anecdote. This leads to winning plots quickly morphing into indecipherable and wasted gobbledygook within an otherwise well made game and a mistake so many incompetently written games make. Even though it plays like a 2D version of Gone Home where you move through rooms and open doors to interact with objects that tell you a story, Settled is the better version since it refuses to use traditional narration and walls of text instead substituting it with visuals much more meritoriously. This game proves once again that even without intricate game mechanics, you needn't be so reliant on words to tell a worthy story and create a solid narrative experience.\n\nHaving played Sharf a day earlier (basically a mini-me version of Settled) and it being half an hour shorter, with absolutely no world-building and yet pulling off making my heart heavier than this game did, I am optimistic that the developer could easily build a much more comprehensive game with an even creepier universe for a more satisfactory experience. An outstanding example of gameplay and mood is Reveal the Deep (also a first time for these developers) which is a surreal pixellated adventure horror game set in the dark depths of the ocean, which keeps your hair on end all throughout and is a true hidden gem. If you are a fan of the horror game genre and have played a good number of similar games, it is unlikely that Settled will scratch that horror itch or scare you much even with the eventuality of it being a psychological thriller. Even so, the ending does make most of it worthwhile and though up until that point you'd have wondered when the game would end, you'll be saddened that it is so short despite it managing not to feel abrupt, and just want more. Hence, as an indie game made by someone inexperienced in such endeavours, it is well done and makes me look forward to future work from them.\n\n\nTL;DR Just over half an hour is much too short even for this price ($1.99), better similar games cheaper. Bright side, definitely worthwhile story to it, will want to play till end. For people who'd like to relax with a really short atmospheric game,  completely on-rails with a nice little bang at the end.","April 6","true","0.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

It tells a coherent story and brings the player into the mix, revealing narrative chunks at a good pace through text and cutscenes.

The thing this game does best is build a mysterious and creepy atmosphere that allows the other horror elements to work.

'cause that's gonna determine how much you'll enjoy this game. If it's high, you'll enjoy this little story. If it's low, give it a pass.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is just a process of moving from one checkpoint that moves the story along to another. There's enough minor things changing along the way that looking at objects multiple times is worthwhile, though if you're only interested in getting through the story you'll find that searching for whatever object gets you back to the story is annoying. Fortunately, there isn't a large swath of objects to interact with so searching is decently short. It's a plus that the gameplay caters to both the person who will click on every interactable object just to see what's there and the person who just wants to get through the game, but the latter type of player will find the gameplay unpleasant.\n\nIt's clear that Settled is more focused on its story and setting, because both are quite well-done (if a bit thin at times). There are a few semi-traditional jumpscares, but they don't come out of nowhere - they're built up to using the environments you go through and the sounds you'll hear. Things moving out of the corner of your eye, minor graphical changes in an object you think you've seen over and over - it's the little touches that really give the game an eerie atmosphere. It's good, but nothing in this game is going to seem revolutionary. Without spoiling, blood and guts get thrown around pretty liberally but I sometimes wondered why it was even needed. This is where your tolerance of weirdness is really going to come in handy. The designer clearly has a good understanding of how to build atmosphere and move a story along in a way that feels genuinely strange and uncanny. The somewhat gratuitous blood doesn't always seem in line with that. People with a high tolerance for weird will probably enjoy the story and be able to forgive some of the weaker points in the narrative. You just want some well-made weirdness? You'll get a decent dose of it from this game.\n\nPersonally, I had a great time with the game. I like a good short experience and I always enjoy seeing a game with a good horror foundation.

Firstly, the gameplay is very limited even for the standards of an indie adventure game. Namely:walk left, walk right, interact. That's all there is to this game.\n\nFurthermore, I can not really make up my mind whether I like the art style or not. True, that it is a brown-greyish (and ocassionally profound red), low-res, pixelated and rather fugly for the most part. And then there is the „devil” who looks surprisingly awesome for all his classic, horned, red – eyed image. Oh, and he is,but of course, symbolic, like it should be in a modern, ambitious, indie horror.\n\nThen there is this rather frugal use of sound. Still, I'd rather argue that the player hears exactly as much (or, more specifically, as little) as needs to be heard and precisely in the right moment. Furthermore, the game never stoops so low as to employ the jump scares. The atmosphere is built by … oh, let me have it in a separate paragraph, k? Trust me, the aura that Settled manages to create deserves a paragraph of its own.\n\nWell, the tension that Settled manages to build up and maintain is, unquestionably, the game's selling point. Although short, Settled manages to preserve that fragile balance between tension and gore without feeling cheap or incongruous for a moment. And in my opinion, that is enough to carry  a horror game through. Truth be told, I think that it would be prudent of Frictional Games (you know, these dudes behind Penumbra, Amnesia and lately Soma) to consider employing Allen Dayan (Settled's author).\n\nWhether you sway towards psychological or gore, there are plenty horror games on Steam. Truth be told, the only reason for this review's existence is the fact that Corpse Party hasn't downloaded yet. Still, I believe this game is worth attention. Sure it is a half-an-hour experience, but that's more or less a price of a hamburger. And for the most part, there is more meat in Settled.\n\nWersja polska.\n\nSettled to taka mała, urocza gierka ( jeżeli wypatroszeni ludzie przybici do ścian mieszczą się w twojej definicji słowa „uroczy” ) która wywołała we mnie sporo mieszanych uczuć. Po pierwsze, rozgrywka jest tu bardzo ograniczona nawet jak na standardy przygodowych indyków: idź w lewo, idź w prawo, użyj czegoś na czymś. Tyle.\n\nDalej; grafika. Nie mogę się zdecydować co o niej myślę. Przez większość czasu utrzymuje tonację szaro-burą ( z okazjonalną domieszką głębokiej czerwieni), atakuje oczy pikselami na pół ekranu i jest, co tu dużo gadać, zwyczajnie paskudna. I wtedy pojawia się „diabeł”, który to w całej swojej klasycznej, rogatej, czerwono okiej okazałości jest całkiem za*ebisty. I jest, oczywiście, symboliczny, jak przystało na ambitny, niezależny, współczesny horror.\n\nDźwięk jest zdecydowanie oszczędny. Powiedziałbym: słychać dokładnie tyle ile trzeba i we właściwym momencie. Dodatkowo gra nigdy nie zniża się do straszenia jump scare'ami i chwała jej za to. Settled buduje atmosferę w … pozwólcie że opowiem o tym w oddzielnym paragrafie. Nastrój jaki panuje w tej grze zasługuje na swój własny akapit, k?\n\nDo rzeczy: napięcie jakie Settled buduje i jest w stanie utrzymać aż do samego końca jest głównym powodem żeby zapoznać się z grą. Settled nie wystarcza na długo, niemniej jednak jest w stanie osiągnąć ten niesamowity balans pomiędzy napiętą do granic wytrzymałości atmosferą a wiadrami krwi bryzgającymi z ekranu bez uciekania się do tanich chwytów czy wywoływania uczucia niespójności. Prawdę powiedziawszy, w mojej opinii Frictional Games ( czyli goście od Penumbry, Amnesii czy ostatnio Somy) powinni rozważyć zatrudnienie Allena  Dayana (czyli gościa od Settled) do projektowania cut-scenek. Serio, dokładnie takie miałem wrażenie grając w Settled.\n\nNiezależnie od tego czy wolicie psychologiczny horror czy juchę lejącą się z ekranu, na brak gier na Steamie narzekać nie możecie. Tak właściwie, ta recka powstała głównie z powodu przeciągającego się downloadu Corpse Party z którym planuję się za chwilę bliżej poznać.Ale wracając do Settled, niby starcza na pół godziny ale kosztuje mniej więcej tyle co buła w Maku. A dużo więcej w nim mięsa.","April 26","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
