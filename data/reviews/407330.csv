"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308977000/recommended/407330/","76561198308977000","brotherjohnnybravo","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308977000/","","On October 31, 2013, a dungeon-crawling game known as Demon Master Chris was released. On May 31, 2016, its spiritual successor, Sakura Dungeon, was initially released on Nutaku, the version of which I have played for many hours already. (It’s why I have next to no time played on the Steam version, which I have purchased purely to leave this review. Yes, I care that much.) Now that it’s out on Steam, I can leave a more visible review of it here.\n\nI want to love Sakura Dungeon. I really, really, do. I have played and replayed Demon Master Chris for some triple-digit hours. I’ve sunk more than twenty hours into Sakura Dungeon already, on the highest difficulty no less. Unfortunately, I’m finding that the more I play Sakura Dungeon, the more it makes me want to put it down and instead boot up Demon Master Chris once again.\n\nWhere Sakura Dungeon Succeeds\nFirstly, let’s not sell Sakura Dungeon short where it inarguably surpasses Demon Master Chris. The artist has noticeably improved in the three years between the games, and the music and SFX are of much higher quality. Frankly, I think the plot might even be a little better; I enjoy the personalities of the main protagonists more. If you simply want to ogle cute and busty anime chicks in compromising situations, then stop reading here and buy Sakura Dungeon. It will be a purchase well worth your money.\n\nMy problem is that at heart, I’m a tryhard and a grognard who likes to delve deep into the inner mechanics of games. Just what is the game engine like underneath Sakura Dungeon’s new, sleek, and shiny chassis? What got tweaked from DMC that had me finding myself wanting to play the older version instead? In order to make a fair comparison and highlight the minor but important differences, I’ll have to explain DMC’s original system in more depth. Here comes a massive wall of text.\n\nDemon Master Chris’s Combat System\nToo long for Steam. Read the wall here: http://pastebin.com/1uCLbU4Q\n\nSparknotes:\n\nVP is health, AP is stamina; You only ever need 1 VP but your current AP represents your ability to dodge; keeping AP high is important to survival\nGuard command lets you use AP to temporarily boost dodge in the short term, while Recover command lets you recover AP for later usage but temporarily decreases dodge; Guard/Recover duality means that defensive play has meaningful choice and means that paying attention to the enemy is important\nRead your opponent, learn their general rhythm, then try to anticipate it to dodge their attacks and exploit their attempt to Recover\nAttacks against low AP characters turn into Critical Hits, which also cause clothing damage; naked characters lose all VP regen and thus can be taken down with ease\nRandom encounters remain legitimate threats unless you are absolutely positively ridiculously overleveled\nBosses absolutely must be outwitted and stripped in order to reasonably defeat them\nSakura Dungeon’s Simplications, Changes to DMC’s System\nStill too long for Steam. Read the longform here: http://pastebin.com/nyTx2yZs\n\nMoar sparknotes:\n\nSakura Dungeon replaces Guard/Recover duality with a single, one-dimensional command that simply restores AP with no downside or other effect, thus removing the rock-paper-scissors triangle of Recover->Guard->Attack->Recover for an overly simple continuum of "be defensive<-->attack more"\nDodge gain from high AP reduced, attacks are more accurate in general: now the majority of all attacks hit their targets without having to consider the target's own AP, meaning random encounters become boring and routine extremely quickly\nCritical Hits now far less dependent on AP state of target; attacks on low AP targets not guaranteed to crit, while high AP targets can sometimes still be crit anyways\nLess predictable nature of Critical Hits mainly serves to surprise and annoy the player, instead of directly rewarding you for playing well or punishing you for making mistakes\nStripping to eliminate regen mechanic simplified; changes rhythm of boss fights entirely, turns bosses into statchecks rather than actual thinking challenges; devs outright encourage the player to simply grind to prepare for bosses, rather than rethink their strategy or try different approaches\nCP/Flow system that Sakura Dungeon introduced feels snowbally without adding very much interaction with the opponent; since bosses have been turned into statchecks, CP/Flow system only serves to reinforce the mindless, boring "strategy" of "grind until you can beat the boss lol"\nWhere DMC plays like a fighting game with thinking forward and counterplay, Sakura Dungeon plays like a SNES-era Final Fantasy title where you just attack through random encounters and bosses alike repeatedly to eventually take them down at length\nHoly tl;dr Batman\nIf you enjoy anime girls having their clothes ripped off in not-so-honorable RPG combat, go ahead and buy Sakura Dungeon. I will honestly praise the art, music, and overall aesthetic polish that are all a step above what’s in Demon Master Chris. For all that I’ve vomited about how the internal mechanics are RUINED FOREVER(tm), the game plays out as a respectable turn-based RPG in its own right; I have not yet encountered any major bugs or obviously unintended game imbalances or exploits. I will also continue playing Sakura Dungeon to its completion, exploring the CP system a bit more, as well as replaying it on a lower difficulty; my views on the game may change and if they do I will revisit this review.\n\nBut as far as I can tell right now, if you prefer a better-oiled, more strategic and thought-provoking RPG underneath the exposed skin, skip out on this watered-down successor and play the original DMC instead.\n\n(Note: Demon Master Chris isn’t on Steam, for obvious reasons. Google it yourself. You’re an adult on the internet, you should know how. At least I hope you’re an adult.)","June 4","false","0.2"," 525 of 705 people (74%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","74","525","705","79","28"

The setting was a typical JRPG setting, the characters were interesting enough, and the music was fantastic. However my biggest complaint is the lack of depth and character building. My favorite part of dungeon crawlers is the character building, building an effective party, and equiping them properly. Sakura Dungeon lacks all of this type of depth I have come to expect from dungeon crawlers. All you have is 6 abilities per character (Half of which are chosen by default), and some basic stats. No gear, and hardly any stat or ability progression. I wanted to like Sakura Dungeon, but I simply couldn't, it lacked some basic elements which make the Dungeon Crawler genre so much fun.","June 4","false","2.7"," 213 of 320 people (67%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","67","213","320","48","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/407330/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1581 products in account","Product received for free\n\n(Disclaimer: I did QA for Sekai Project on Sakura Dungeon, so feel free to take this with the entire salt shaker. Also my playtime is inaccurate since the version I played wasn't on Steam, but my final playtime was 21:30 or so.)\n\nSakura Dungeon is one of the more self-explanatory game titles I've ever run across - it's a typical Sakura game, so there's a lot of well-drawn but kind of samey anime women, and it's a dungeon RPG, so "Sakura Dungeon" pretty well explains what you'll be getting. It's... surprisingly good, actually, in that I wasn't really expecting that much and it ended up being quite playable.\n\nHow does it actually work? Well, I'd say it's on the simpler side, but the mechanics still allow for some combat strategy - characters regenerate HP and AP each turn, and use AP to attack, but how much AP you have left helps you evade enemy attacks, so you're encouraged to use high-accuracy attacks against enemies with most of their AP left, and unload with high-power, low-accuracy attacks against enemies who have just drained all of their AP attacking you. In addition, each character has "concentration points", which work as a super bar, basically - it's used for some attacks, but more importantly, if it reaches 10, the character goes into a super mode, immediately refills her AP, gains significant accuracy/critical rate/dodge bonuses, has attacks that normally cost CP become free, and unlocks the use of super mode-only attacks, if she has learned any. Especially later in the game, getting your characters into super mode and keeping the enemy from getting into it becomes quite important, and makes boss battles (and normal encounters, in the postgame!) quite interesting.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, I'd say it's not all that hard - I played through on Hard and had some difficulty, which might be understandable given the name of the difficulty setting, but at worst I had to sit around and grind up one or two levels on about three occasions, with everything else being something I could overcome with effort and filling out the map. Normal probably wouldn't require very much, if any, grinding, while Abyssal intentionally requires a good bit by reducing the rewards you gain from battle and making enemies tougher. I'm not sure I'd find that fun, though, as most of the difficulty I had came from enemies that I just couldn't hit - a lot of combat results, such as accuracy, are determined by the difference between your level and the enemy level, such that defeating enemies more than four levels above you is somewhere between nearly and completely impossible for most of the game because you just can't hit them, and even with the ridiculous attributes I had on a few characters at the end of the game, that didn't really expand to more than five levels above.\n\nThere's indeed quite a lot of playable characters, and the game rewards replacing older ones with newer ones frequently, except for the main character, Ceri, who both always has to remain in your party and always remains useful. You can also probably keep a second character you like a lot around easily - I kept Sylvi, a dark elf NPC who joins you early on, around until the end of the postgame - but most of the other characters, both face characters and captured monstergirls, got shuffled out of my party quickly as I captured more monstergirls and recruited more face characters. The characters all come with different attributes and attacks, but those can be raised with attribute seeds and added/replaced by scrolls respectively, so the real differences end up being in resistances, special abilities and personality. Each character has their own set of resistances and special abilities, causing them to take less damage from certain attacks, critically hit more often, or even revive from 0 HP automatically once per trip to the dungeon. Since these can't be changed (except for resistances, which you will get a very few items to increase over the course of the game), selecting a character or two with useful special abilities to try and keep around is probably wise.\n\nRegarding the story... it's a Sakura game. Don't really expect much, but it's not actively terrible. It's about an ancient fox spirit and her pet human knight going into a hole in the ground to reclaim it for the fox spirit, as it used to be hers. On the way they meet and do questionable things to a lot of monster girls. I didn't test the unrated version, so I don't really know anything about that part.\n\nAll in all, would I recommend it? Well, if the words "Sakura Dungeon" made you interested, yes, it's exactly what you think it is and it's quite good at being that, so you shouldn't hesitate to buy it. If you're looking for a dungeon RPG and dislike the Sakura series, I'd be a little more cautious, but almost all of the better dungeon RPGs out there are on handheld, with a few entries on console and the PC selection being rather lacking, especially of non-indie titles. Don't expect Etrian Odyssey or anything, but it's a servicable indie entry into the genre. If you're looking for porn... ask someone who isn't a big ball of spikes. :<","June 3","true","2.2"," 131 of 199 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","131","199","7","20"

If all sakura games were actual games like this , not specificly a dungeon crawling game, but just any other type of game. The action is pree legit, and and character models are the same "type" as previous sakura games. Only complain i have so far is that during combat, the options like escape,  use items, switch party members are not on the main screen, and there is no button to change from combat action to secondary actions like most rpg games does, instead you gotta go in ESC and do it, just very odd.  You can go around capturing various girls, who can help you for your combat, do not worry if you cant play them all, since they all gain experience and level up just the same as your front 3 characters. No weapons, no armors, just weapons and skins, so it isnt complicated.\n\nOut of all the sakura games, this is one that you should buy.\n\nGiving it a 8/10\n\neNjoY =^-^=","June 5","true","19.7"," 62 of 86 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","62","86","4","0"

The artwork is decent enough. It's not that high quality though. I didn't personally enjoy it. $20.00? I mean, hey. If people will buy it and like it.

Sure, I've had to grind up a level or two on hard, but that is expected with a RPG.\n\nThe cast of characters each have their own personality and don't fit into that cookie cutter mold of a typical lemming. I can say that you will defidently be keeping certain characters and shuffling though others as they get outdated on later floors. I've encountered about maybe 15~ monster girls but I know that's barely scratching the surface. Also love that they have unique dialogue. (Great sprites aswell)\n\nHowever there is one big thing I hate about this game, the save system. I really don't like how this game doesn't auto save but that's just me. I've only died twice and I've had to makeup about an hour of gameplay by forgetting to save.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much beyond the standard fare of what we've all come to know of the Sakura series: mammories. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game has a level of depth that now places the Sakura series in the company of something greater than just VN eye candy. In my humble opinion, they really needed something to freshen up what seemed to be a rinse-and-repeat model, and I think they've done an excellent job achieving that here.\n\nRight from the start, the artwork is beautiful (as it is through the majority of the Sakura series), but there's something significantly wonderful in this game: excellent, memorable music! After digging into it, I found that Zack Parrish is the one who composed the music (he also composed the music for Sakura Fantasy, which was also quite excellent).\n\nOnce hopping into the game, it begins with a setup for events to come. Personally, I get bored with VNs pretty quickly, so I initially wondered how long I was going to have to click-click-click-click-click to get to something, uhhhh, enticing? Luckily, it didn't take long. Once stepping into the inn after a few minutes, there she was: my new waifu, Isabella.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to entering the dungeon, where you will roam and randomly encounter "monsters" (see: boobs). You get their HP down low enough and bye-bye clothes (not uncensored, unfortunately, but sufficient enough for a potential party in your pantaloons). You can capture them and add them to your party eventually, but this is a good time to mention the depth of the game's RPG elements: grinding ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to level up, XP, currency, buying/selling items, stats (HP, MP-equivalent, etc.), attributes (vitality, strength, element strength/weakness, etc.), and more.\n\nUltimately, this game is worth it for the music alone (and the fact that I've officially replaced Ellen Baker with Isabella as my new waifu). But in all sincerity, Sakura Dungeon presents something fresh to the Sakura lineage, as well as to VNs in general, thanks to its interactive RPG mechanics that bridge the gap between clickity-click-click-click-click VN and something akin to a an 8-bit-era dungeon crawler.\n\nI've only made it to the level-2 dungeon at the moment, so I think it's too soon for a pros/cons (primarily because I don't have any cons right now). All I can say is if you've indulged in the previous Sakura VNs and enjoyed them, I think you'll be impressed with what Winged Cloud has managed to achieve here--provided you're into RPGs. If you're as impatient as I can be with VNs, just tough it out for the first 10 minutes or so. After it holds your hand a bit, it sets you off on your own to move about the game world as you so choose.\n\nAnd now if you'll excuse me, Isabella beckons... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n#sakuradungeon","June 3","true","5.1"," 35 of 70 people (50%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","50","35","70","7","0"

Very well drawn colorful characters, and detailed backgrounds\n+ The girls are very cute with skimpy outfits with plenty of cleavage to show\n+ I suppose the real treat with hentai-esc games like these are the perverse (almost nude \ nude) photos or CGI images that you will get every so often while progressing through the game which can later be found in the gallery. All the images are very naughty and sexually pleasing.\n+ Uncensored patch\n+ The combat system is turn-based, and requires little strategy although you are able to tear off enemy clothing to make things a bit more..."interesting"...  I would say the entire system is kind of similar to Pokemon with some enemies having various weaknesses towards various elements along random dodges/misses and critical hits. If you don't like the combat you are able SKIP + AUTO MODE to essentially skip through most battles. All in all, I found it to be fun, but a bit reptitive after a while.\n+ You are able to capture any enemy girl, and add them to your own party and have them fight for you and level up. (again similar to Pokemon), you can even swap them out if they get injured.\n+ Great soundtrack with some great songs that go along with the action\n+ An interesting story and characters with plenty of content.\n+ Basically this game likes to tease you a lot, and when you do happen to find sexy pics or new characters it can almost be more rewarding than watching hentai\n\n- Too much dialogue...like....far too much which is mostly just random banter between characters that you will have to read through or skip. UNFORTUNETELY, you can not "skip" through the conversations until you have completeted your first playthrough so you have to MASH the keyboard / controller to get to the good parts ;)\n- No auto-saves, so remember to manually save if you don't want to lose your progress.

Good enough production values for the pricepoint (expecially if you got it on sale at some point), repeatative but compotent combat, and a lot of (unvoiced) dialouge. I dont really like ecchi games that much, but I like yuri games enough to offset that.\n\nI haven't gotten too too far, but I am disappointed in the fact that every character looks the same apart from hairstyle and clothing. Same body types and mostly pale complexions. There is also a lack of more modest clothing styles, so the "ripped clothing" feature of the game doesn't really make a difference, at least on the steam version. It's a shame, since its a neat feature to have in a game about cute girls, but when the ripped clothing and the unripped clothing next to identical it doesn't really acomplish anything. This is expecially true for the slime girl sprite, who I still cannot see the change in.\n\nIf it were me, I would have skimpy outfits be unlockables, and have really modest clothing as the starter clothes. I would  have also used a wider variety in character body types, specifically muscular characters and smaller characters. Also, I think the over-humanization of monster girls worked to the detriment for this game. The slime sprite specifically is very disappointing, as having the character actually made of slime would have added a lot of much needed variety to the mostly stagnet cast. I dont understand why a game that is supposedly marketed to cater to fans of the female body would only use one specific female body reskinned on multiple characters.\n\nOverall, gameplay is decent if you are looking for a generic RPG to play. I think its fine for the $20, as it seems to have more content than any of sakura game. It is also by far the best sakura game, though thats not saying too much. I never played that dungeon master chris game, but it sounds like it has a man in it and men are ♥♥♥♥. So this by default is better due to the exclusion of men.","June 4","true","14.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"
