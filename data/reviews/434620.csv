You could solve these with lots of algebra: label all unknown lengths with letters, make equations, and solve for x; however, that's not how it's done. Instead, you look at the puzzle sharply, maybe draw an extra line or two, and then solve using only simple area formulas and whole-number-ratios. (Despite the name, I didn't need Pythagoras at all, only to recognize the 3-4-5 right triangle in one puzzle.) That means geometric deductions, not number crunching! Fractions are not allowed! If you're good at geometry, you can do the whole thing in an hour (10 minutes for the first 20,  30 minutes for the next 29, and 20 minutes for the final 11 or so). Others may find this a bit more challenging (see here).\n\nI liked it.\n\nThis game runs on my old Windows XP computer.","January 25","true","1.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","3"

But as the developer updated the game in the good direction, I can't let my rant about fractions and whole numbers here.\n\nPythagoria is a game relying on maths. You have 60 puzzles to solve, divided in three chapters with 20 of them. The first one is mainly about rectangle surfaces, side lenghts, etc.. when the rest is kinda more complicated with triangles or circles (well I didn't say circles per se but well, you'll see it if you play the game).\n\nVisually, you have several geometrical figures with some indications (surface in cm², side length, etc..) and your goal is to find or a surface or a length behind a question mark.\n\nAnyway, my initial rant was about fractions and whole numbers. True, at first, many of us understood that the resolution used only whole numbers. In reality, you can use any number, fraction or letters - the only thing that matters is that the answer is always a whole number. So, when you see a surface of 32 cm² with a side of 14 cm, it's normal. Don't think that it's a mistake, nope, it's not. So, when this confusion is cleared, the puzzles are suddenly more easier to solve.\n\nVisual inconsistency is also an important factor in this game. While there is still problems with it as it's not with perfect proportions (and you have to understand that the game can't answer to perfection), at least, it's less disturbing, because when you 1 cm² being the same as 5 cm², it's not comfortable. Still, here, sometimes, you're under the impression that you have two exact lengths when it's not the case.\n\nAnyway, the last point that was also controversial was the help. Only the rectangle formula was included, so, when you're confronted to a triangle, you need all your memory to remember your maths. Hunter, the developer, expanded it after we pointed the lack of more explanations or formulas.\n\nThe good point is the possibility of using a pencil in-game so that you can write your reasoning directly on the screen. However, you don't have any voice for the color: it's red. And it's not smooth, my numbers are a series of clear dots. I know that there is a problem of hardware or GPU or something like that.\n\nThe soundtrack is a very good one, very enjoyable.\n\nBut I imagined the game as a tool for drilling in maths students. In other words, as I work in digital education, I've been interested in this game for that matter - as a gamer, I would have passed the game, because maths and I, we're not two but we're not really friends. In the education context, it's not usable, even with the help expanded. Because well, a good thing would also to have an explanation of how it's solved, which would be a nice bonus when you're only pressing the numbers and pray that it's the right answer.\n\nFor the price, it's still a nice bargain. I would say that now, the thumb up is really deserved and isn't one of encouragement for the developer. But I suppose that more challenges would be also a good idea, right now, I wish there were more - even if maths and I...","January 25","true","4.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","6"

I would argue with the maths, but you can't argue with someone who keeps changing the rules. The puzzles are inconsistent, incongruent, and irreverant. >:-[ It's like playing cards with some one who is making up the rules as you go. Of course many of the inconsistencies are intentional, like with the incorrect dimensions. Then there are the errors sprinkled in like salt, the fact that you can accurately assume the answer to many with no math, and the puzzles which contradict the designer's own rules. Oh, and what about the one with no question? 3.7 has no unknown to solve. [/]\n\n\nI will concur that the puzzles are intended to be "recreational maths." They are also deliberately represented by incorrect dimensions in drawing, presumably to force you to use the numbers. It doesn't always work, as in the case of 3.17, which is pretty obvious in a way that violates the game's design rules. And, 3.18 has glaring inconsistencies.  [/]\n\n\n\nIn defense of the designer, the game appears to be incomplete. I think he is still trying to "polish it up" a bit, from what I read in his answers on the forum. But, IMHO, that would be a bit like rearranging chairs on a ship that's sinking. My suggestion would be to come up with a way to represent the math without the shapes being drawn incorrectly, for one. But, then again, the answers are multiple choice and you are bound to get it right. [/]\n\n\nThough it's an easy 100% game I can't recommend it. I mean, there are better puzzles out there... and better designers who would take this great subject matter and make it work. But, hey... kudos for the great idea! [/]\n\n\n\n***Update:\nI had a second look at the game, afterwhat appears to be an update. I did not see any of the problems I mentioned changed in any way. My opinion of the game itself remains unchanged. I really do love Math puzzlers. And, I can recommend Two Digits, Three Digits, (which I'm still trying to beat) and Energy Balance if you're looking for great Math Puzzles.\n\nBut, I noticed recently that cards were added, and I have to add that the artwork is great. The backgrounds are great Math art and I'm using one on my profile now. If you are just looking for some neat Math art... here it is! The cards and emoticons are geometry shapes. But, the backgrounds are neat patterns and Math equations with a blackboard look. The profile badges have images of famous Greek Mathemations. If you're into art the cards are for you.","January 27","false","4.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","15","20","4","2"

And yet, everyone uses maths on a daily basis in one way or another. Now, you lucky devils, it is time for you to put your brain to the test with Pythagoria.\n\nPythagoria (or Area Maze) is a clever and challenging puzzle game where you have to find the missing value (number) in a specific area which will be identified by a question mark. All puzzles can be resolved with basic mathematics and the answer will always be a whole number, as decimals are not allowed.\n\nThe game has three sets of 20 puzzles to resolve (60 puzzles in total) and the difficulty will increase as you go through the sets. What you need to remember playing this game is that the diagrams are not drawn to scale, which will probably throw you off more than once. Well, it certainly did for me!\n\nAs I am writing this review, bear in mind that mathematics and I were never really the best of friends. However, I really enjoy this type of challenge. This game prompted me to look at the origins of this type puzzle and I am absolutely amazed to find out that it was created for Japanese school children and has now becoming extremely popular with adults (Area Maze)!\n\nAlso, I would like to mention that I really like the soundtrack in that game.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	60 good puzzles\n-	Great soundtrack\n-	Good price point\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Short game\n-	Needs a better tutorial, in my opinion.\n\nPythagaria is an interesting puzzle game for all ages.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

You are given a bunch of widths, lengths and areas, which help you with finding out the answer to the puzzle. This game requires some brains, time and knowledge, but it's nothing you couldn't solve without the use of a calculator.\n\nPros:    Interesting Puzzles | You can see on Store page screenshots what kind of puzzles this game includes. You have to calculate areas and edges with given information. This game kind of has two difficulties, which you can set with by following certain rules. If you want it hard, you can do it without fractions and if that's too hard for you, just solve it in any way you can and you'll still have fun.\nWrite and Erase | On the right of the game screen, you have two buttons: one to erase and one to write. This is really helpful if you can't or don't want to remember all edges you got so far. I tried to memorise them all and it wasn't hard in most cases, but sometimes it's just too much. That's when these two tools come in handy. You can also write your calculations, if you want to.\nMusic | Pythagoria has a very nice calming soundtrack that fits to the game well. There are a few different songs to prevent you from getting bored from only one track.\nSimplistic Look | As you can see on the screenshots, the layout is very clear and simplistic, which really looks great. There are also a few different colours of levels just to cheer things up.\nKind Developer | This is not a thing I mention often, but he really is kind. I was talking to him in a while and this is the kind of people we need in gaming industry. He is also active on the Community Hub.\nGameplay Time and Pricing | This offers about 3 hours of gameplay and for $2, I think this is a really good deal. And I think there is some replay value, since you forget at least some of the earlier levels.\nCons:    SteamOS and MacOS Support | So far, you can only train your brains on Windows.\nHelp Section | In my opinion, it's not helpful enough in some cases. Some equations would come in handy, especially in some harder levels.\nThe final verdict:Pythagoria is a really nice game for training your brains and having fun, if you're into math. I think that the difficulty is just high enough for an average player and if you want, you can also make the game harder for yourself by not writing down stuff and so on.\nThere used to be a problem with some levels and not being able to complete them, but this appears to be resolved now, so I really can recommend this game, especially for $2.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","January 22","true","5.1"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","0"

The game requires you to find the missing value in various area puzzles, the twist is that the puzzles can only be solved by whole numbers and not fractions or decimals.\n\nQualityGraphics - The graphics in Pythagoria have a simple look giving it a nice modern touch. The puzzles themselves are drawn nicely reminding me of a blueprint of a house or building. Overall the graphics are drawn in great quality.\n\nSound - Pythagoria contains a very calm sountrack that sooths you when playing and keeps the stress down from the puzzle. The game includes a few different tracks instead of just one to keep the lack of boredom up.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is pretty self explainable in Pythagoria, after you pass the first puzzle you'll get hang of it quite nicely. The controls are really simple, the puzzles aren't as easy though, the help section is quite helpful with some tricks and suggestions on how to solve the puzzle, but you still have to use your brain for this one guys! :P\n\n\nPros & ConsPros:\n- Easy Controls\n- Interesting and Unique Gameplay\n- Has cards (In the making)\n- Soothing Soundtrack\n- Challenging Twist (Counters to shortness of the game)\n- Great Developer (Kind and is concerned about the community of his game)\n- Has working out tools on right hand side (Pencil and Eraser)\n\nCons:\n- Can Restart (Can't restart game or tutorial)\n- Not customisable (Can't change colour or font of pen and you can only erase everything on screen instead of one thing)\n\nSuggestions- Make Pen and Eraser Customisable (as in colour\n\nConclusionTo conclude, Pythagoria is a well-made brain teaser for those who want a challenge, especially for a price of $1.99. I do hope the developer continues to work on it, by providing more puzzles and more customisability.  9/10 ^^My rating\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 23","true","4.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","1"

You will learn very little geometry or algebra or whatever doing these puzzles.  At best, you'll practice your multiplication and division skills a lot, but that's elementary.  Well, elementary school level.  So what do I mean by the game can make you smarter?\n\nWhen most people think of math, they think of boring drills where they plugged numbers into formulas and and other numbers.  It's mindless busywork because the students are just grinding through procedures like an automaton.  There's little need to be creative or think on their feet.  Take a look at Problem 1.1 in the screenshots.  If a student saw this on a standardized test, they'd probably start by finding the width of the area 10 rectangle.  But, oh gawd!, now they have a fraction.  Then they have to add 2, then divide 16 by the resulting fraction.  That sounds tedious in the extreme, and I have an engineering PhD, so it's not like fractions scare me.\n\nNow look at the solution given in the screenshots: by filling in the missing rectangle, we observe that we have two rectangles of equal size.  This is just one big rectangle cut in half, so the unknown height must equal the height of the other half.  No adding or dividing by fractions!  Rather than follow the obvious path, by being creative and considering alternative approaches (something modern math education doesn't do very well, sadly), we find a far less painful, more elegant solution.  What these puzzles do is make you better at solving problems: we have some information, and we have a problem we want to solve.  Someone with good problem solving skills can get there more quickly and easily.\n\nThat said, allow me to critique the problems in this game: Take a look at Problem 1.16 in the screenshots.  We fill in the missing rectangle as before.  We notice there are two rectangles of area 28 and 56, so right one is 2 times the width of the left, and we're done.  Now take a look at Problem 2.5 in the screenshots.  Again, the key is finding the area of hidden rectangles and looking at the ratio of areas.  A lot of puzzles in the game involving rectangles are like this, though you still have to be canny and figure out which areas and what ratios.  But there were only maybe a dozen puzzles that made me stop and say, "Ooh, that's new.  What's the best way to deal with that?"  I could have used more of those moments.\n\nEven worse, there a couple puzzles where the solution is the unimaginative tedious method of figuring out all of the side lengths.  I'm looking at you Problems 1.18 and 2.18.  You're well past the initial training exercises and have no excuse.\n\nLeaving the puzzles using rectangles, there are puzzles using triangles and circles, like 3.2 in the screenshots.  But they have to keep it simple since pi and geometric theorems are off-limits, so I found these problems to be pretty trivial compared to the rectangles.  Though there were a few problems where I resorted to algebra or using properties of similar triangles, which seems to violate the premise that these are puzzles that can be solved without math more sophisticated than areas and ratios.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, the whole conceit of these puzzles is that there are ways to solve them without using fractions.  What we could do with Problem 1.1 is to put it in the copier and enlarge it by a factor of 3: the area 10 rectangle now has height 9 and area 90.  Now it's width is no longer a fraction.  In fact, we can now solve this puzzle the humdrum way without running into any fractions.  We could do this to every rectangle problem in the game, making them tedious but trivial to compute.\n\nDon't do that though.  Despite my complaints that I wish there were a greater variety of ideas and fewer straightforward problems, the times when the game did make me say, "Ah!  I see!  So now this is twice that, and these two are equal, and we're done.  Cool!" was worth the $2.  These moments only happen if we accept the no fraction rule and are forced to get creative.","January 26","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was an insta-buy for me though.\n\nSCIENCE!\nIn Pythagoria you get to solve geometry and trigonometry problems. In a given puzzle there's a bunch of squares, rectangles, triangles and sometimes even circles. Your task is to find the correct answer to certain length or area.\n\nIt's certain that you need some knowledge of math to proceed and whether you like & know math will determine whether you like the game. All the required knowledge should become available to children of age 13-15 in most school systems. It includes calculating areas of triangles, rectangles and circles and using knowledge of (right) angles, trigonometry and Pythagorean theorem to deduce other angles and associated side lengths.\n\nThat said, every solution is an integer from 1 to 9. It doesn't mean that no other length or area in the puzzle could have a non-integer solution, but it does mean you could easily cheat guess all the answers and be done with it. I would argue you'd be missing the point but who am I to judge though?\n\nIt's a trap!\nThe problems are nice brain-teasers: some can be solved in a few seconds, others take tens of minutes of intense deduction (if you refrain from guessing). The in-game pen makes it simpler to solve many of the problems.\n\nSome problems look like they were pulled directly from a high-school math book (which is fine and likely) so it might look like a scheme to make you do math.\n\nBright background is inconvenient when playing in a dim-lit room in the middle of the night, but it seems to be the unfortunately established part of Unity puzzle games. At least it's not completely white, which alleviates it a bit.\n\nMusic is the usual forgettable but relaxed tune, though a bit on the groovy side. I think classical orchestrated music would have fit this game better, although the soundtrack was otherwise fine.\n\nThe end?\nPlaytime will vary tremendously depending on your knowledge of math, ingenuity and whether you guess. Without guessing I had completed all 60 puzzles in 4.5 hours and rehearsed a bit of my knowledge of trigonometry in the process.\n\nIt left me craving for more. Puzzles don't change on playthroughs but as replay value goes, you may come back to practice and try them again after a bit, having forgotten the solutions. However for $2-game I think it had enough content anyway even if you didn't. For the low price it's a nice little game. But probably only if you like geometry and math.","February 15","true","4.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","5"

It's not too tough and can actually be very enjoyable, assuming you're not the type of person who despises the sight of a triangle. The music and visuals are nice, the math is all simple enough to do in your head, with no fractions or decimals ever being required to come to a solution, and the puzzles can be truly headscratching at times. There's even a built in drawing tool to facilitate working out the numbers, which I found extremely handy. Calculators or any algebra past the Pythagorean Theroem are unncessary. Just remember that like in Geometry work, the visuals are usually not to scale.\n\nIf you get stuck, the answers are few enough to just brute force an answer, and there are two different Steam guides that provide answers and explanations for your benefit.\n\nAt this price, take the plunge!

I like the concept of the game, that is, the general idea. It's a fun idea. I love geometry, and while I'm by far no "expert" in general math overall, geometry math is usually my personal forté when it comes to math. I have a deep and strong love for anything to do with geometry on any scale - 2D, 3D - or even stretching into the more theoretical dimensions beyond those.\n\nThat said, maybe it's my computer monitor... Or maybe I need to brush up... but it seems that some of the puzzles are wrong, in my eyes. Judging by what my eyes are seeing, and then choosing what I'm "pretty sure" is the right answer, but then being told it's wrong, I'm thinking that either 1.) my computer monitor is stretching the diagrams creating an illusion as to what the actual answer should be, or 2.) I'm just wrong (I will admit, that is still a remote possibility, and I'm okay with making that suggestion), or 3.) The puzzles are wrong, and need to be fixed.\n\nIn any case, to be fair, I like the concept of this game. And I really hate that there's no way to give an "in between" rating (because I would prefer to do that). In all honesty, I don't want to say completely "no".

There is a good progression in the difficulties of the puzzles, and it was most satisfying to find a puzzle's solution when it had eluded me.","January 30","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are challenging and you will sometimes comes out with a fraction as an answer and have to go back and spot your (usually obvious) mistake. There are a few levels that are so preposterous that you do it as many ways you can think of, end up guessing all the numbers to find the correct one and STILL not understanding how it was reached.\n\nMy only and biggest criticisim of this game is that there aren't enough levels!!! I got this game about a week ago and have played it casually, yet ave already completed all the existing levels. An update is needed super soon!!!\n\nApart from the lack of levels this game is great. 10/10 would recommend and download similar games.","February 1","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the less nerdy may not enjoy it so much. As a suggestion, I would make the puzzles progress more logically, as there were times where I spent 5 minutes on a puzzle, but then the following puzzles took 5 seconds. Overall, though, it is a really fun game (for nerds).","January 31","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hope more puzzles will be added soon :-)","January 31","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
