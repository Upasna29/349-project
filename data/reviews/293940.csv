"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/293940/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Kill The Bad Guy is an indie puzzle game that revolves around assassinating targets using objects in the environment whilst remaining undiscovered and depicted in a simple, understated artistic design with plenty of dark humour. Though the game suffers from some key issues you’ll still manage to squeeze a few hours of good old fashioned puzzling fun out of it even if it is an incredibly slow starting game. This is a puzzle game that puts you at the heart of revenge murdering individual targets who are more often than not based on real life offenders.\nThe objective of the game is rather self-explanatory. In each level you must kill a bad guy in various, unusual ways. The game comprises of 60 of these bone shattering, blood splattering levels. For every level there are ways in which you can manipulate objects within the environment to bring about your target’s doom. At the start of every level, a fairly amusing profile about your intended victim which tends to include details of their crime and a name that vaguely points towards somebody in real life like ‘KimDotKom’, in reference to Kim Dotcom, or ‘Oscar’, in reference to Oscar Pistorius. After reading your target’s profile you’re then dropped into a white environment with black objects such as cars, ropes hanging on walls, steam vents and pianos that you can pick up, rotate and combine. You’re given very little guidance on what to do from here, except for the first few levels, so instead you have to work out what will kill the target. By selecting dark coloured objects you’re shown a large array of arrows that point to where you can place objects, such as atop buildings or anywhere on the ground. Objects that can be combined are coloured green picking up one of the constituent parts so it’s not particularly challenging to work out what goes with what.\nThere are very few controls other than picking up, rotating and combining items but after you have managed to pull off your mission,  camera controls allow for a cinematic execution of the target. The camera can switch angles to get the best shot but it does come across as a rather pointless feature. During actual gameplay you can, rather helpfully, pause the game and look around the area but objects cannot be manipulated meaning that, when you decide what you’re going to do, you need to do it quickly.\nAs you progress through the levels you’re not just exposed to new challenges like the police and cameras, there is also a pretty significant increase in the variation of objects you’re given to assassinate targets. It must be said, however, that the first ten levels of this game are by far the worst of them all. Truthfully, I was amazed that I even progressed beyond them and discovered that the game actually contained something challenging and interesting. The initial levels are intended to be tutorials that ease you into the mechanics of the game. Instead, the experience is painfully dull and excessively lengthy. Never has a ‘tutorial’ chapter dragged on so slowly and uneventfully.\nThankfully the game opens up after a couple of hours play and you’re exposed to more than one way to kill your target as methods gradually become more complicated. The animations of your dying target do become a tad more varied in that they fall over when they are electrocuted but overall there’s not much difference between driving a spear through your target’s head, dropping a car on him and crushing him with a wrecking ball as, either way, he ends up as a bloody smear on the pavement. In a game where the method in which you kill your target is designed to be the be all and end all of the gameplay I would have expected more death animations such as a crushed, flattened body or some pierced limbs.\nThe game has some degree of re-playability as each level have secondary objectives that offer some basic tasks: catch the tooth of your fallen victim, kill them on the first day and find a hidden passport. The only interesting additional objective is to kill your target in a specific manner as the rest are repetitive and restrictive. The passport tends to be in locations like beneath cars or objects and hidden within buildings that become transparent as you pan over them. By completing these unimaginative challenges you gain stars which count towards unlocking a bonus level at the end of each chapter. These bonus levels are, ironically, quite a bit more interesting than the main game.\nAs a final note I found that the game’s humour often borders on the tasteless as there are sometimes very graphic descriptions of real life crimes such as those perpetrated the Columbine killers that some, if not many, may find uncomfortable. Generally the profiles of your targets are humorous covers of less invasive crimes such as fraud and embezzlement but when the game describes in graphic detail the crimes of the monstrous Albert Fish then the vibe of what is supposed to be a carefree, slaughter orientated romp is very quickly killed and is instead turned into something much darker and not at all light-hearted.\nWhilst the game starts off slow and simplistic it quickly develops into a more robust murder simulation with some fairly imaginative solutions to the dilemma of how to discreetly kill your target. I particularly enjoyed the rather difficult task of luring your target to a particular spot or changing the path they were following by quickly putting obstacles in their way without them noticing. The level of difficulty scales as you play but even when the game becomes more complex there are moments where it comes across as pointless and repetitive.I would recommend waiting until the price has dropped but if you enjoy flippant murder simulation games with stark graphics and environmental manipulation then perhaps you’ll enjoy this more than I did.","August 3, 2015","true","26.0"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

There are some original(use tree as catapult and load a dead dog on it) and generic(run them over with a car) ways to kill them. Art is neat. With black are marked the stuff you can use and civilians,cops and cameras for which you have to look for. With yellow is baddie and rest is white. Game offers 66 lvls in total(60 story,6 bonus lvls) . So far so good.\n\nNow when comes to the bad stuff ... well.\n\nCamera ... camera is terrible. You can't change the angel,you can only zoom in and out and often because of that you will often encounter miss calculation or missclicks.\n\nControls - well I used mouse only while playing and can say that .... some stuff is way to sensetive to clicks which may force you to restart the level. When you click on your "catapult" you cant cancel it to do something else . It's just like chess, you play what you touch.\n\nLine of SIght - Well, every cop,civilian and camera got wall hack. Even though there is a button to show the line of sight of everybody it doesnt really matter when comes to buildings. Hell, cops and civilians can sense stuff from quite a far while the baddie barrely sees whats right in front of him..\n\nFast reflexes - some puzzle requires quite a lot of precision and fast reflexes .. well gl with that , its doable but after a lot of fails...\n\nHumor - game tries to be funny but falls flat with just few of the baddie's description that may make you giggle for few seconds , rest are just blant or taken from LotR,SW and the likes universes just to fill the spot...\n\nOverall if you got the nerves go for the game, else skip ...","February 21, 2015","false","5.8"," 52 of 75 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","52","75","4","2"

I highly recommend buying on sale as stated price does not feel worth it.\n\nKill the Bad Guy has been on my wishlist for a while. I like games where there is an overhead view of everything and seemingly anything can be manipulated. Kill the Bad guy is a puzzle type game where the player can use one or more objects (by combining them) to eliminate the target. The game doesn't change in any sense beyond that, you are buying a puzzle game where you will have about 60 levels of killing the target in certain scenarios given certain objects. Adding a steam workshop or some sort of community involvement probably would have added another layer of re playability to this game.\n\nObjects are selected and have to be moved by clicking the move icon (obviously). It's not quite drag and drop, but more of click, click, and try clicking over here to see if they combine. The indicating icons above objects help diversify what can be connected with what. What is neat though is that multi-player was given in the game. Once the game is done, there isn't really much else, but from time to time multi-player is worth coming back to. Just sucks if your friends don't have it because there is a shortage of players.\n\nThe game is good by premise, but I feel it could have been better. Adding a community mod behind it, allowing for customizable levels (or a level builder), maybe even custom items would have been interesting. Mini-games even could have made another impact. Multiplayer definitely does give it a backing now and makes it worth a second look. Re playability isn't critically high, but it's somewhat there.

To give you an idea of its quality as a time-waster, I've only given it two play sessions and am somewhere around level 60.\n\nMost of the 'bad guys' are based on real people or famous fictional characters, including Saddam Hussein, Freddie Kreuger and even Oscar Pistorius. It's kept fresh by the addition of obstacles to getting your target such as roving witnesses, security cameras and bodyguards who also need to be taken out.\n\nThe only frustration I've encountered has been in the emphasis on making a lucky shot with a spear shot from a makeshift ballista or with a box falling from the roof of a building. You can spend a good long while planning your moves, only to have them scuppered by the fixed perspective making it incredibly difficult to tell where you shot will go. These occurrences are few and far between, however, and you can speed up time and restart instantly to quell the anger they conjure.","August 15, 2014","true","3.1"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

The title says it all. There is a bad guy who you have to kill by any means possible. This game has a simple to use mechanic which makes it entertaining and fun. I put 102 minutes into it which is probably about the extent of what I see myself getting out of it. It is a good mildly entertaining game. I don't see it being replayable. It can get a bit bland. The creative concept behind it is good and cool. Everything is kept simple. You don't have to put a lot of thought into it and it is great for a laugh every so often.\n\nGraphically I think the game could use some textures. The models are black and white with red blood effects. and basic colors on some main items and explosions. Aside from that everything is white for the most part with little to no textures. I know this is the style of the game and it is how the developer intented to design it, but I think it would look a lot more lively if they took the time to actually texture it better.\n\nThe game was good for an hour and fourty minutes of mindless entertainment I will give it that.\n\nRating: 8/10","February 8, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaidrien/recommended/293940/","xaidrien","Infernal_Unicorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaidrien/","320 products in account","The review I did in full @ http://www.heypoorplayer.com/2014/06/killed-bad-guy-watching-porn/\n\nWell hello kiddies! Are you looking for a fun game that marches to the beat of a different drum? One that allows you to use that big ‘ole brain sack of yours to punish the evil doers of the world? Are you willing to operate above the law to get these guys? Well that is exactly what Exkee’s Kill The Bad Guy game will let you do. It’s already out now on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux. What is even better is that it does not even require really big balls on your machine to run either. Which is great for those who may not get into much PC gaming but would like to have a few fun little titles on their machines to give their controllers a rest and work out their underworked lonely mice that some of us seem to forget about. It crosses genres a bit in being a rag-doll physics based puzzler/strategy game…..Oh and I was dead serious I did kill the bad guy while he was watching porn…\n\nI really liked this game a lot and it brings some really good things to the table. Ok now upon first booting up the game I was treated to a really catchy hip-hop title track for the menu screen which made me crank up my volume a little higher, and the background music for levels continues the enjoyably catchy trend with a down tempo number that’s a bit reminiscent of some of the tunes you would hear in a 60s era spy flick which sets the mood very nice.\n\nThe game is really pleasing on the eyes too with its really nice monochromatic silhouettes of the buildings, yellow shirted villains, innocents bystanders, surveillance cameras, as well interactive objects are all rendered completely black, and last but not least the oh so satisfying red blood stain left after you do your job proper. The graphics are simple but in my opinion its a good way. When you put them all together you are upon first glance are viewing what appears to be a harmonious utopia that is of course until you leave the town painted with the blood of the guilty.\n\nOk. So let’s start to get a bit deeper into the game. There are 60 main missions and 6 bonus missions to unlock. Each mission has 5 objectives: of course there is the primary objective of killing the bad guy, a secondary mission you have to figure out by a clue given in the pre-mission dossier/or for those who aren’t good with riddles, through random experimentation with a levels interactive elements, kill the villain in the first day of the operation, finding the villain’s hidden passport in each level, and final objective is to quickly catch his tooth which goes airborne usually really far and very fast when you kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game can be controlled by the mouse exclusively but you can also control via keyboard with a default secondary layout or configure your own control preferences. The first few missions are relatively simple with very obvious ways to take out your target and usually very quickly. Before each mission you’re a presented with a dossier file on the bad guy in which you are targeting. This may seem a bit odd but this was my favorite part of the game to be honest. Each mission file was written very cleverly most times parodying vile people pulled right from news articles and tabloid both current and past with very effective and humorous tongue in cheek humor (and since I am a bit of a news junkie this really made me happy). Then after a completing a slew of missions you a treated with a cut scene advancing the story and reminding you of your purpose. Once you begin finally start the game you will quickly notice the bad guy strolling through town and will be travelling a pretty repetitive path (though a few times he changed it up randomly which caught me of guard) through that particular part of whichever city he or she may be hiding out in, and if he leaves before your masterful plans of assassination are able to be put in motion and you can’t taking his life a day passes…and you have to try again which means this objective is now lost. Fear not though because you can easily repeat every mission with your unlocked achievements already still unlocked for you in your menu screen. The first few missions also occasionally give you some hints on how get stuff done, interact with objects or on how to control the game, as well as what the icons in the gameplay screen do. Like clicking on the eye shows you the bad guys field of vision, which is important because if he you constructing something he thinks is even remotely dangerous or of suspect he will quickly flee and you will be rewarded with a mission failed screen. Other interactive icons allow you to pause the game and take a look at that particular map to try and make your gameplan, there is also a speed up time icon which is set at 1x by default and can also be toggled to 2x and 4x speeds. The display up top features an icon of the bad guy which when clicked immediately centers the screen on the missions target, there are also icons that indicate if you have achieved you alternate objectives.\n\nAs is with most games the further in the more complicated it becomes to take the bad guy out, as well as more and more interactive items become usable to kill your target. Remember in each mission you are trying to make it look like an accident so keep that in mind. Eventually after you complete a good amount of mission innocent people begin to show up wandering through your target sites, police are on patrol, surveillance cameras watching, and the Bad Guy’s bodyguards must never suspect you…If any of these see you take the bad guy out it’s an instant fail the mission.\n\nFor those gamers who are into being an exhibitionist there is the ability to upload and share your favorite kills with your friends and the whole damn interwebz if you so desire. In fact right in the settings there is a direct sign in option to Twitch for those who use it. Other community features are that the game has are Steam Achievements, Steam Leaderboards, as well as Steam Trading Cards\n\nIt is the perfect game when you only have a very small window of time to get some gaming in. Most levels can be finished in a few short minutes. You get to have some fun, kills some time and quickly run off to do what you must. You not left having to run off and be on some huge plot cliffhanger wishing you could have watched that 10 minute cinematic cut scene and having had venture through that dungeon which seemed like it took half the day to get the super laser sword of doom.\n\nOk….now for what really irked me in this game. There is really nothing in the game that tells you what the interactive objects do minus a few sparse exceptions…or what objects needed to be/or could be combined with other ones…and there were a few times I got very annoyed and spent way to long trying to figure out how to activate a trap or what I needed to combine to what to get the job done efficiently. And this happened every few levels pretty regularly. This really held back wanting to play for long periods of time as I was becoming somewhat frequent for me. There some missions I would end up wasting multiple days on me trying to get items to do things they were not even capable of doing. Also there were some traps I couldn’t really identify…so I had no idea what I was supposed to do with it. And it is not because of it appearing too small on my screen. I am playing on a monitor that is very large in 1920 x 1080 on the highest possible graphics settings here.\n\nSo the game isn’t perfect but it is still a lot of fun. It’s a great little time killer that will make laugh and some perhaps if you are the faint of heart wince a bit. It’s also pretty entertaining to watch as well. A few of my pals sat here and laughed over my shoulder for some of the kills for quite a while. I do hope that some of my gripes might be addressed in an update patch perhaps in the future if the team is able.\n\nI gave the game 3.5/5.0","June 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 36 of 71 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","36","71","0","0"

Granted, a god that will ultimately be faced with ending the life of a being lesser than itself in order to proceed, but a god all the same.\n\nThat's the basic premise of Kill The Bad Guy. It's a game where you'll be doing little else than what it says on the tin.\n\nCertainly there's some degree of enjoyment in the act of killing what the game builds up to be one of many comically exaggerated abominations toward humanity. Whether it be smashing them with an oncoming vehicle to see their body flying off into the distance or diverting their path so that they just happen to pass beneath a sign sharp enough to decapitate them. The array of options afforded to accomplishing the core goal varies from level to level, with some feeling almost depressingly empty at times.\n\nWhat the game lacks in an abundance of diversity, it attempts to compensate for by offering a stylized presentation and a (sometimes dark) sense of humor.\n\nThe spare use of color in the world opens up the possibility to have memorable death tableaus, with the previously white surroundings often becoming awash with the blood of a given bad guy. Think of it as a literal take on the opening credit sequence from the film adaptation of American Psycho. Much of the game's intended humor comes in the form of flavor text provided for each of the game's 60 or so bad guys. Many are parodies of real world figures (Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Justin Bieber, etc.) with equally fictionalized takes on their criminal acts or atrocities, as the case may warrant.\n\nFor all its style, humor and simple yet deceptively complex premise, Kill The Bad Guy suffers from a number of flaws. Chief among them being a woefully inadequate and frustrating camera system, an interface that often hinders more than it helps and AI that seems prone to random outbursts.\n\nOverall, Kill The Bad Guy is interesting, violent to an absurd degree and often challenging (though at times for the wrong reasons) but becomes repetitive far too quickly. Some questionable design choices and lingering bugs aside - you have a game that, once finished entirely, won't leave you with a strong desire to replay it.","February 28, 2015","false","35.7"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

It has a great visual aesthetic and soundtrack, but is hampered by a few design issues. First, this is a mobile port with touch-oriented controls that could have improved with pc-centric controls. The camera is locked into an isometric position, meaning that it is sometimes hard to line up the traps to score a kill. Lastly is that the NPC view fields are bigger than the UI indicates. Several times my kill was seen by a civilian or camera that should not have been able to see it. I reccomend against this unless you are not deterred by poor controls.","September 27, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Also, the multi-player has loads of bugs, kind of freezing and loads of aura-kills.\nPOSITIVE: The concept of the game is not so bad : you need to create your own justice and kill all the bad guys. You have a little selection of languages and the game is not hungry in memory.\n\n\nTHE GRAPHICS\n\nThey're not bad but not so good. White & Black are the most used colors in here. Only the blood and "the Bad Guys" are well made. Even with an high perfomance engine...\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOnly buy this game at the special offers, if you already know (a bit) the game and if you're just going to play for maximum 5 hours.

With varying degrees of difficulty, you will catch on quickly - or you will think you have, but it's so challenging to get everything just right to get a level completely finished.  This leads you to play through a level then play through it again. Why did I only need 10 minutes and three levels to write this review?\n\nSimply put:  This game is a lot of friggin' fun.  It's simple, but very cleverly designed and tricky at the same time.\n\nThe Looks\nThe graphics are simplistic, and in this case it's not a bad thing. Some games give me motion sickness or assault your eyes with very convoluded graphics. Not the case with this one. The animation is elegant, you can clearly see everything in front of you, and yet it still makes you laugh every time you kill the bad guy. The title is apt.\n\nFun Factor\nThis is one of the two strongest points of this game that I'm going to make - the fun factor is so high, not only from the descriptions of the bad guys (garbage collection and hazardous waste disposal), but to the screams when they get crushed. As I said, I may not have played it very long yet, but I'm keeping it installed - I don't do that for very many games, so if you look back here in a week, chances are I will have played it for longer.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up, as I said before, but challenging to master. The learning curve isn't steep, but it is challenging enough to make you think and concentrate.\n\nThe Soundtrack\nIf you look at my other reviews, you will see that I often critique soundtracks of indie games, and games in general. This game has a soundtrack that makes it worth the full asking price. I feel that strongly about this one. The soundtrack is fantastic, from the opening theme, to the field recording ambient sounds, to the secret-agent style "win" fanfare. It a modern twist on classic tropes that really add to the atmosphere and hilarity of the game. The soundtrack music, the sound effects, and the atmospheric ambience gets a flat out 101% A+ from me, and I'm very hard to please when it comes to this.\n\nConclusion\nI'm going to choose this as a curation for my group, because eXkee definitely deserves the exposure. My library is gigantic, and it can sometimes take me awhile to get around to playing everything. I wish I had played this sooner, because I highly enjoy it.\n\nEasily, 9/10, and I look forward to seeking out more titles by eXkee. If the graphics, gameplay, and unique take on classic set ups is present in a fraction of them, I will consider it money well spent.\n\nGo buy it, play it, turn your speakers up, and enjoy. Or else, you might end up being the bad guy. Absolutely recommended.","February 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

Except this is nothing like that, this is a puzzle game where your given a door and told to unlock it, and the single key is on the table right next to u. There is no challenge to this other than trying to see what an object will do, which after the first few levels, u get what will happen. It is suppose to be try and find a clever way to kill the 'bad guy' and each time u dont manage it takes another day to do so, except u can restart the challenge at any point no reprocutions kill him first day easily coz uv already seen that theres one car and he walks in front of it at which point u rev the engine.....done. This isnt creative and interesting its a very very bad 'puzzle' game where its already solved for you, might as well get  a childrens dot to dot thats been filled in, would get more enjoyment out of it than this. I serious do not recommend this to anyone, not even people looking for an easy game to pass the time because there is nothing to this, its boring, simple and plain. even the levels are just white buldings with white floor with 3 black objects represnting things u can move which are the only things to do in order to complete the level. This is seriously bad and i hope no body is fooled into buying this game","July 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"

Ex. starting a car to crash into him, or swinging a wrecking ball into him.\n\nI'm afraid I just don't personally LOVE this game, mostly because its levels are just REALLY hard. It will often give you items and doesn't tell you very well how to use them, and sometimes you don't even know you CAN use them. Because of this, I can't really even get past the third level.\n\nOf course, there IS a way past the levels, it's just extremely hard (to me), and I dunno what I'm doing in this game, so what I've said is all I can tell you. I would suggest downloading the demo to decide for yourself. I just jumped ahead and bought the full game because it was on sale and looked good.","June 23, 2015","false","8.5"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Well I'll tell you right now that you can ♥♥♥♥ right off! Being categorised as an indie game doesn't automatically entitle you to any privileges.\n\nIndie games should be created in such a way that they incorporate lots of insightful little things despite them lacking the necessary funds, and if you disagree with the fact that in spite of this I'm still critical of what is essentially a terribly boring little game, then you are seriously disillusioned and deserve absolutely nothing from this.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThumbs down doesn't necessarily make this a poor game, but all things considered there are more negatives than positives.\n\nKill The Bad Guy is a quirky physics-based puzzle game that's interesting at first, but which gets terribly boring very quickly.\n\nGood points:\n\n- Stylish graphics\n- Fun gameplay (for the first hour)\n- Lots of levels\n- Quite funny in parts\n\nBad Points:\n\n- Not always clear what needs to be done\n- Counter-intuitive because the artistic (though admittedly bland and sparsely textured) levels inhibit the player's ability to relate to the real world references jokingly made within the game; the player cannot be endeared towards it when the targets all look the same\n- Music won't be to everyone's liking\n- Controls are totally rubbish and also counter-intuitive. Tip to the developer - play Kingdom Elemental for an idea on how it should roughly be done\n- Real world references may be in bad taste\n\nMy video review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyn3t1_ots","October 13, 2014","false","2.2"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

I think most people wil be disapointed in the game at full price.\n\nHowever I still recomend the game. If you catch this game on a steam sale for $2 or less or as part of a humble bundle you will enjoy it for a short period of time.\n\nHow much you enjoy it will depend on your pain tolerance. There is a lot to like here. The concept is funny and the overall design though simple is effective for what is being conveyed.\n\nWhere the game falls apart is the controls and the almost random quality of the levels. Some will be so stupidly simple you will be done in seconds. Others will take you 10 minutes to figure out what you can and can't click on. And they aren't in any particular order. You'll be faced with interesting and satisfying followed by frustratingly hard followed by brain dead simple and so on.\n\nThe music also gets tired and repetitive.\n\nIf you like puzzle games this is worth picking up on sale. There's a couple hours of brain teasers for the average puzzle player packed into this. And for the hardcore perfectionist or over achiever there's secondary objectives you can bang your head against for even longer.\n\nOh and if you don't like puzzle games, stay far far away. Though the screenshots and pictures may make it look like there's a world to explore: there isn't. It's a moving puzzle box that you have to solve with traps, not an open world of any kind.\n\nAnyway I paid under $1 for it as part of a humble bundle and enjoyed it for almost 2 hours which is what it took me to finish all the levels with the most basic requirements. I'm not enough of a perfectionist to try and play through them for all the secondary objectives.","November 18, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem with this game is that is not so hard to figure out how to set up the trap, but - because of cartoon physics and poor controller - you may fail to actually make the trap work.
