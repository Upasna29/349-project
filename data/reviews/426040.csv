It's certainly not asking an unreasonable price for what it offers, especially on sale, and it's certainly not anyone's definition of "incompetent".  It is, on the other hand, a little hard to imagine just who I would consider "recommending" this game to, bar perhaps those masochists out there who think that constantly moving between rooms as instructed to perform myriad menial tasks, whilst avoiding the floaty ghosts of butchered beasties, constitutes something resembling "gameplay".  Hell, it would at least be a passable time-waster if the saves were regular, but every unspectacular death just means several minutes of getting back to where you were beforehand, and the satisfaction of a job successfully completed is marginal at best.\n\nNow...I know that this arguably sounds like an awful lot of games out there, including some which I hold in incredibly high esteem, such as Outlast.  I guess I maybe just require slightly "deeper" gameplay if I'm not going to be served oodles of ATMOSPHERE in the overall package, and the fine line between "horror" and "retro"/"arcade"-style antics is perhaps a little too skewed to the latter for my liking in this case.  It really may just be a personal taste thing, though, and the vegetarian in me definitely wants to like the sheer perversity of this crazy little slice of madness.  It's really, REALLY not "bad" at all.  Maybe it's just not my bag, and maybe it will be yours.  Hence the recommendation...that, and the lack of a "neutral" button for me to push, because this game really is about as "middling" as it gets in my book.\n\nLet me try putting it another way:  If you like super-duper old-school "arcade" games, with just a splash of horror (and the good old red stuff) to give it a bit of context, then you may well enjoy this.  I don't think it's going to hit anyone's all-time top-ten lists, but it may well be worth the two bucks or less if you're feeling suitably indiscriminating and just feel like killing a bit of time while you butcher a few cartoon carcasses.  For me, personally, its appeal ran its course pretty quickly.\n\nDefinitely NOT to be filed in the Lone Survivor/Claire-style category of genuinely "creepy" pixelated homages to Silent Hill, et al, though I guess it is at least marginally spookier than Commando or Pac Man.  The very definition of a "take-or-leave-it" proposition, methinks, and for now I'm choosing to leave it.  Good luck to the dev, though, as they seem sincere enough in their intentions, and who knows, may well go on to (much) bigger and better things...\n\nVerdict: 5.5/10.","December 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

It’s short but doesn’t fall short of the asking price.\n\nThe game is playable, and the dev says there will be updates. Which I hope will be timed and built on towards 2016’s Halloween as competing thematically with #Xmas and #StarWars doesn't sound like a good idea to me.  There’s a lot of potential here and it’s worth the asking price in it’s current state.\n\nPros--\n1) Music and sound are great.\n2) Map is simple.\n3) Controls are simple and work well when navigating the game.\n4) Graphics are retro and work with the tone of the game.\n5) Overall sense of fear is there. I felt tense and scared when the sound effects to opening doors. One door in particular was scary, and I thought a monster would be waiting for me. No monster, but I was scared during most of my first play through.\n\nCons--\n1) Story could be more developed and better. It would be nice if the butcher had a kid and/or a wife he had to provide for. Or, maybe someone will die if the butcher doesn’t figure out the mystery at work.\n\n2) Lack of variant game modes or gameplay. I think if the story was developed more, the game could be better developed. Like having a metagame to take care of a sick child in a hospital, etc. Or heck, even a love interest who visits the Butcher during the day. Eventually, as I got better, the tension was less, and thus my fear lowered increasingly.\n\n3) Lack of caring about if I die. It sucks “yes” that you have to start over if you are killed, but I just feel I have to redo the work I did before, that the only reason I want to live is to finish my work and not a meta game or a compelling story.\n\n4) No Steam Cards or Achievements.\nUpdate was promised in the community when I post this review, but steam cards wouldn't add to the game as other things could.\n\nAgain, I think this is rough version of what could be a better game for a higher asking price, and I hope come Halloween 2016 to see some major updates or even a sequel.","December 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

No major bugs that I've seen, little hard but that's what you want.  Actually survival horror too, not action putting on a mask and saying "Oh aren't I so scary, by the way here's your gun.".  There are a few things like making wasd work that I'd like rather than the directional buttons, but that's not a big issue, and frankly guys, it's two bucks, you'll spend that on like a soda, so don't expect years of entertainment, expect a horror game with a unique setting.","January 11","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My first play around went smoothly, couldn't find any bugs or issues with the cut scenes. Games flows really well and I like how they slowly add various challenges as it goes. I know some of you will say otherwise but kind of has a little serious sam meets 5 nights at freedies cross vibe going, but also very easy going. Music is good not over powering which for a lot of games I mute flat out. This is Def a game I'll be playing during streams in between match rounds.\n\nThe one con i feel is the no mouse option, not sure if this is going to be added in later or not but would add more elements to the game if it did. Will very much keep an eye out for updates and watch how they progress the game.","December 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Rinse, repeat. All while being pursued by a slow moving monster.\n\nThe first warning sign was when I noticed how many positive reviews listed the game being "bug free" as a pro. I guess in the age of Steam Greenlight that is kind of a rarity.\n\nAnd they're not wrong. The game works, and I didn't notice any bugs. I also didn't have any fun.\n\nI've played worse games for sure, but given the current state of Greenlight and Early Access that can't really be considered a good recommendation.","April 26","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of Indie Arcade/Horror game Goodnight Butcher. Goodnight Butcher was released on Steam on December 18th, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Perfect Square Studios.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ovz6tovJWaQ\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nIF you get it under a buck, ok. Otherwise, very meh. (Hopeful for future though) 1/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nUnfortunately, I was simply unimpressed with this little game. I figured at it's price, I would be ok. This came from a bundle I had bought before, and I am glad that is the case. I just cannot recommend this right now, as much as I want to like this game. The gameplay and graphics are simple but the music and sounds get old REALLY quickly. You find the meat locker, grab a carcass, take it to the saw, cut it down, then take each piece somewhere else to "craft" it into it's sellable item (hamburger, steak, etc), dump the bones, put meats in display, repeat. Avoid the ghost while you're at it. I mention it so casually because really, the fear lasts about 2 seconds, and that's it. The sense of dread, urgency, fear, anything simply isn't there. I feel like I am working while avoiding certain rooms at certain times simply by entering and exiting the room over and over until the "spooky" sounds go away. Sorry, this game just isn't doing it for me. Maybe if it was less than a buck I would feel different. I am hoping for updates, or a story that'll hook me or just some reason to care about NOT dying at all in this game. Meh. 1/5\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

Follow instructions to chop up meat and display it in the front case of a butcher shop that has been closed while trying not to get caught by the demons that randomly lock doors and try to kill you. That one sentance is the whole game but in a constant loop. I think you're supposed to making offerings of blood but it doesn't make sense that you're trying to apease a blood god but in return demons are coming after you to kill you which would stop you from making more offerings. The story could be good but I don't want to play more to find out. The repetative actions of getting meat, cutting meat, and putting meat on display is what's preventing me from wanting to play more.","March 26","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
