In terms of quality.  It's voiced, it has long routes, and the story can be pretty interesting.\n\nThat said, this is the quintessance of a japanese visual novel.  I don't think this game has a bad end, so there are no real bad choices.  But the idea behind most choices in these games is not to change things in the story to create a favorable ending.  Instead, at the junction where the common route branches into specialized routes, it's to determine which specialized route to jump onto.  So the complaint that you're reading a book instead of playing a game is pretty valid.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if you spot a girl who interests you, try picking choices that would allow you to spend more time with her.  You should end up on her route.\n\nAs for the story itself, most people that have seen Power Rangers would sort of understand its essence.  Villain attacks, Man with special powers appears, combats the villain of the day, and emerges triumphant.  Then he resumes his everyday "normal" life.  The good news is that there's much less posing and far more property damage.\n\nThat said, Overdrive visual novels generally have a light, dark, light pattern.  You're not going to read a story where the hero does hero things through the whole story.  You're going to read a story where hero does hero things up until some dark dramatic twist.  Then you realize that the characters suddenly have much much more depth than you would expect and you start to realize that the world is not all that it seems.  At this point the situation has become bad, to the point where it may be enough to break even a hero.\n\nI can proudly say though that, of the Overdrive games that I've played, I have rarely been disappointed by their twists so this game should be just as interesting as the others.\n\nBut, if it isn't to your tastes, you may need to forgive the silly light-hearted beginning.  I'm sure it's needed to balance out the deeper and more serious story that comes up later.\n\nAs a sidenote, it's English Subtitles and Japanese Voiced.  The Voice Acting is incredible, but if you listen to a foreign language for an extended period of time it tends to wear you down.","September 19, 2014","true","0.7"," 134 of 154 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","134","154","0","1"

It is definitely worth it.\nIt's by far the best visual novel on Steam.\n\nGreat background art, character avatars, background music, sound fx, natural environment fx, voice acting, humor and animation.\nThere are also some small interactive parts where you can make decisions to change how the story plays out.\n\nCho Dengeki Stryker reminds me of the visual novels that were out for the old CD consoles like PC-Engine CD and MegaDrive CD with Anime/Manga titles like 3x3 Eyes and Bakuretsu Hunter, back in my days. Yea I'm an old timer but I wish the new generation could have experienced those times. Those were awesome days for gamers. :)\n\nAnyway, don't expect to finish through this so quick because it is very lengthy and broken up into chapters where between them it will ask you if you want to save your progress, although you can save and load at any time you wish.\n\nThe menu system is has got a lot of options too. Sound settings allow you to adjust the voice, sound fx and music levels. It also allows you to turn on or off individual character voices. So if you find one character you might think sounds annoying as heck, then point on their name and click, that character is muted. lol\nOther menu options allow you to adjust text speed and turn on auto mode. You can also switch on and off to fullscreen and change the aspect ratio to fit the screen. There are other options you can check out as well like accessing the back log to see previous conversations.\n\nIf you are into Anime/Manga and visual novels then give this a try while it's on sale. It's pretty awesome. :)","September 20, 2014","true","21.6"," 88 of 95 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","88","95","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariurotl/recommended/321190/","ariurotl","Ariurotl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariurotl/","108 products in account","[Please note that the "Recommended" vote is directed to users who appreciate the fact that this title is a visual novel and contains no "gameplay". Furthermore, my lack of "play time" is due to my having previously read the non-Steam release of Cho Dengeki Stryker.]\n\nCho Dengeki Stryker is a visual novel developed by OVERDRIVE (makers of KIRAKIRA, Edelweiss and DEARDROPS, among others) and published in the West by MangaGamer. The adult version of the VN is available for purchase on MangaGamer website.\n\nFirst off, let's set the technicalities straight and alleviate some of the confusion surrounding this release. Cho Dengeki Stryker is an upgraded version of the original Dengeki Stryker novel with three additional arcs and a number of visual upgrades. In other words, it is NOT a sequel to Dengeki Stryker, and the original title is included in this release in full, with the exception of the aforementioned adult content.\n\nWhile Cho DS is not an entirely kinetic (i.e. lacking choices) novel, it is almost completely linear. In three original arcs (or "Sagas"), the choices you make are irrelevant and yield only a few bits of alternative dialogue. Upon completing the original game, one of the conspicuously greyed-out decision options becomes available, thus unlocking the additional content.\n\nPresentation-wise, Cho DS boasts a number of decently animated sequences scattered over the course of the story. Sadly, despite being a rather recent title, it is not presented in high definition (the default resolution is 800x600). Character art by Katakura Shinji (KIRAKIRA, Edelweiss) is, in my opinion, an acquired taste. The supporting cast (especially male) looks delightfully silly, but I can't say I enjoy this artist's work when it comes to female characters.\n\nMusic is a strong point in all OVERDRIVE games (partly owing to the fact that the company's president is Takeuchi Hiroshi aka Bamboo from the band "milktub"). The soundtrack to Cho DS is no exception, providing several impressive vocal tracks and decent, if not outstanding, BGM.\n\nAnother highlight is the usual brand of surreal humor typical for OVERDRIVE titles. In an effort not to spoil the story, I'll just say that Clark Kent and his famous glasses have got nothing on the extremely oblivious heroes of Cho DS. Most of the humor is delivered by the exceptional and diverse supporting cast, which is another of OVERDRIVE's good traditions.\n\nSadly, the same cannot be said for the main heroines, which are as cookie-cutter and bland as they come. You've got your usual childhood friend and your usual tsundere to start with, and when you get to the additional content, you'll have to endure Rin, who is undoubtedly one of the most boring characters ever written. Luckily, romance in Cho DS takes a back seat to action, comedy and an occasional philosophical dilemma or two, and thus the overall story does not suffer too much from the vacuous personalities of the heroines.\n\nSpeaking of the story, I found it solid if not particularly spectacular, with some interesting plot twists and a few poignant moments in the later scenes. The plot goes "meta" fairly early, but the writers don't go overboard with deconstructing manga tropes, and the story remains well-balanced.\n\nIn conclusion, Cho DS is a good read that I can recommend without any hesitation. It is quite a few steps short of a masterpiece, but it's solid and entertaining enough to be well worth your time and money. Among the visual novels available on Steam, however, Cho Dengeki Stryker is firmly near the very top in terms of quality of storytelling, humor, music and presentation.","September 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 83 of 94 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","83","94","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonjustice/recommended/321190/","crimsonjustice","Crimson Justice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonjustice/","492 products in account","Having put more than 30 hours in this Visual Novel and played it to utter completion (all routes + all of Jack's Diary pieces), it's time that I give my full opinion regarding the VN in its entirety.\nI personally, whole-heartedly, recommend this VN to anyone, especially those who are familiar with superheroes and the desires of heroism and fighting for justice. If I had to compare it to another anime or story out there, it would be Samurai Flamenco in terms of the whole wish fulfilment topic and desire to be a hero - however, unlike Samurai Flamenco, Cho Dengeki Stryker had enough time and resources (plus being a VN makes it more convenient) to explore the entire topic of what it means to become a hero, its struggles, its victories, its desires, how it can clash with reality.\n\n=STORY=\n\nThe first route you'll (likely to) experience is the Zero Saga, and while I consider it one of the weakest routes of the story, it's a solid introduction to the story of the VN. You get a global view of all the characters surrounding you, and the main character comes to terms with the results of the wish he made 10 years ago. It also has a sweet love story that doesn't form an obstacle to the flow of the general story.\nThe second route is Heaven's Saga. It's somewhat less dramatic compared to Zero Route and is more focused on being epic and all-around action-packed. Its side characters are way better treated compared to in Zero Route. However, when it comes to the love interest I'm not all too enthusiastic. It's basically your average tsundere girl that has some competence going on. While I like her moments of attitude and quirkiness, the relationship between her and the protagonist feels somewhat forced. I think that's the case because little has been done to show what the protagonist feels for the love interest and why, whereas Zero Route was more open to describe the feelings of the protagonist towards the love interest and what they should strive for.\nThe third route, Sky Saga, is a continuation of Heaven Route which focuses on a different character, whom in my opinion is the true protagonist of Cho Dengeki Stryker. It's a short story that carries quite the dramatic weight similar to Zero Route yet carries the action-packed badassery of Heaven Route but on a smaller scale.\nThe fourth route, Love Saga, is a story on its own with an emphasis of being a dramatic yet touching love story. It did its job superbly, making me appreciate a female character I somewhat ignored in the previous routes and turning me into a gigantic cry-baby when the credits rolled.\nThe fifth route, Steel Saga, is a continuation of Zero Saga and one of the routes exclusively available on the Cho Dengeki Stryker version (the original version is the Dengeki Stryker version which only contains Zero, Heaven's and Sky Saga). It's starts off being a slice of life story dealing with the aftermath of Zero Saga, but it escalates into a fusion between Zero Saga and Heaven's Saga in terms of characters, drama and action. Certain characters obtain a sense of complexity throughout the route (going beyond their initial role and position in the previous routes) and the newest leading lady is just a badass. While she might be a love-or-hate case, I really adore her because she isn't as waifu-ish compared to previous girls, is similar to the protagonist in various ways, including badassery and competence.\nThe sixth and final route, Light Saga, is a continuation of the Steel Saga and the conclusion of the entire Cho Dengeki Stryker VN. You will only be able to access this route after clearing Steel Saga twice, unlocking of both two leading girls (thank god there's a SKIP button). It's all-around the most satisfying route since it's the closest to an happy ending Cho Dengeki Stryker has. It's action-packed as well, but I find Sky Saga having the most epic battle while Steel Saga has the action-scenes which come across as very grand-scale.\n\n=CHARACTES AND MESSAGES=\n\nIt's still hard for me to decide whether Cho Dengeki Stryker is a plot-driven story or a character-driven story. While it's generally a slice of life story centring on the life of Yuuki Yamato (Dengeki Stryker Zero) and to an extend the misadventures of the Balbora Vanguard, it doesn't shy away from having extensive commentary on wish fulfilment and the various facets of being a (super)hero.\nYuuki Yamato / Stryker Zero is your average no-nonsense character, straight-faced and focused on his primary goals. What's initially charming about him is how he's out of touch with reality (being a manga character from an alternate history Japan that takes place in the 1930s that got transferred to 201X) and has to deal managing his daily school life with being a superhuman crime fighter. To prevent from spoiling way too much, I can only say that Steel and Light saga manage to flesh out Yamato's character even more, struggling with self-doubt and the consequences of his actions.\nTexas Ninja Jack, Yamato's sidekick, might lack any complexity, but is an all-around crouching-♥♥♥♥♥-hidden-badass type of character that's all around memorable and hilarious whenever he's caught in his silly antics.\nThere are various female characters in the story and they all have their important role in the story depending on the route you've chosen. You've got your childhood friend, your tsundere, your maid girl, your insecure girl, et cetera. Most of them are quite enjoyable and interesting whether your leading girl / love interest or not.\nThe enemies are for the most part forgettable and underdeveloped with the exceptions of Mirror, Curtis, Roches, Hilko -- and to a lesser extend Murray and Phoenix.\nTo me, the messages regarding heroism and wish fulfilment that are evoked through the story's plot and the struggles of the main heroes stand out the most. It goes beyond the mere "fighting for the girl you love" shtick and it actually deals with loss and not always being the big glorious hero out there. Light Saga, Steel Saga and to a lesser extent, Heaven's Saga and Sky Saga show that a hero is more than one lone guy with fancy weaponry. That it takes more than one person to save the day, that heroes are just people with their own misfortunes and flaws yet fighting for a better future, that you won't always manage to tip the scales, that you won't always get the people's favour on your side and that even being there for someone and brightening his or her life makes you an hero as well -- those are several messages Cho Dengeki Stryker evokes throughout the story. It can be a bit cheesy at times but to me it was dealt with in a more mature yet passionate way (compared to other Shonen or Shonen-styled stories), hitting it close to home.\n\n=OVERALL=\n\nDue to character limits, I can't go all too much in lengths but the music and graphics are all-around a pleasure to see and listen to, especially in regards to the CGs, anime scenes and vocal tracks. While it's my very first VN, I still stand by the claim that this is so far one of the best stories I've ever experienced regardless of medium and that I really hope that the future might offer a story similar to Cho Dengeki Stryker. Hopefully, this time with more warriors dressed up in colourful spandex and karate-fighting bugmen riding on motorcycles. It's obviously far from perfect, being riddled with various plotholes and confusing moments, but it makes it up with the themes and messages it presents and the enchanted mixture of decent character development, well-detailed action scenes, drama, comedy, visual presentation and soundtrack.\nWhat are you waiting for? Give it a read, enjoy the ride and be charmed by its action-packed narrative with its moments of laughter, tears and inspirational messages that are a necessity for your inner justice-loving hero-worshipper/wannabe.","October 14, 2014","true","71.3"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

The music never dissapoints, as is OVERDRIVE's forte, and features vocals from awesome artists like Masaaki Endoh.\n\nIf you've ever dreamed about being a superhero as a kid, this story was created for you. It's packed to the brim with lots of hot-blooded and intense superhero action. Also, in addition to that great story, this game takes a good look at identity and definitions of identity.","September 20, 2014","true","16.6"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","44","52","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nishastra/recommended/321190/","Nishastra","Bit Risky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nishastra/","760 products in account","Cho Dengeki Stryker is a Visual Novel.  There is no "gameplay".  It is the first large Japanese Visual Novel on Steam, by which I mean that it is genuinely over 30 hours long as the store page says.\n\nThe story revolves around a young boy who makes a questionable wish of a questionable wish-giver that results in him being transformed into his favorite superhero, but losing all of his memories.  Once he reaches the appropriate age to be the hero in question, villains from his world also start appearing and of course they fight.\n\nThat part isn't actually particularly exciting, ironically.\n\nAs it turns out, being a full-time superhero doesn't make you any money, nor does being a "villain" generally unwilling to do harm to civilians.  So both sides of the conflict end up as neighbors living in crappy apartments trying desperately to make ends meet, while miraculously maintaining their extremely flimsy secret identities.\n\nThis is where Cho Dengeki Stryker shines, for me.  A slice-of-life story about a group of people extremely out of their element in more ways than they even realize.\n\nOf course, this eventually devolves into some kind of battle for the fate of something (depending on the route), but two routes add significantly more slice-of-life beyond the common route.  One of them (my personal favorite) has almost no combat scenes at all!\n\nOutside of the few fully-animated scenes, battles can be a drag.  Many go on too long, and given the kind of Japanese superhero basis for them, the destination is usually obvious from the word go and the players just have to dance around for a while to get there.  I don't mean to imply that it's bad once fights start breaking out.  There are still plenty of interesting moments in the "darker" parts of the story, but I more enjoy the characters interacting with words than explosions.\n\nStill, the VN does have a lot of fun times, and I enjoyed it immensely.  It may not be on the level of the great classics, but if you're in for watching the everyday lives of some very not everyday people who eventually have to save the world by way of shouting move names, Cho Dengeki Stryker might be for you.","September 25, 2014","true","41.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","3"

As it stands, Dengeki Stryker and Planetarian are the two best visual novels available on Steam.\n\nDengeki Stryker is a visual novel that I feel is hugely under-appreciated. It’s not particularly deep but it’s a lot of fun and should appeal to a wide range of people as long as they are willing to give it a chance.

A couple things though seem very unlikely to change, and if something does change I'll edit my review.\nFirst: All Ages Version does -NOT- mean it is appropriate for all ages. This is T for Teens given some of the dialogue - and Jack's Diary, which is frickin hilarious.\nThat said, this is a great visual novel. Not an epic one like Demonblade, Princess Waltz, or Fate/Stay Night, but still a great one, and possibly the best action VN on Steam. The best part I think are the characters - you will learn to love the Balmoran Vanguard. While not super-original, they are still more than 1 or 2 dimensional archetypes. The humor is excellent. The fighting... varies. I found some outright boring, with victory being as dramatic as "wow, good job dropping a boulder on the villain after your allies did all the work." Other fights were appropriately dramatic and required the main character doing something suitably crazy/difficult.\nThe first 3 paths have to be done in order. The story starts off good and gets better each path so far, with each path being less predictable and more complicated.\nI can't comment much on the music or voice acting because of speaker problems on my end, but I know that I did manage to catch some very dramatic and moving lines just the same.\nRegarding censorship: When most hentai VNs get censored to change the rating, it is done terribly. Either they put stupid mosaic blurs that does nothing to make it less sexual and serves only to tick off the people looking for hardcore porn, or they tend to chop out everything remotely related to sex and the entire romantic encounter is reduced to (and I am quoting almost word for word from one game) "And with this and that, it happened."  in Stryker, the actual sex (and any nude images I assume they would have) is removed, but enough of the beginning and end of those scenes remain that you still get a decent sense of the emotional intimacy. Female characters don't walk around in bikinis or find every excuse to show their panties, and to my incredible surprise, there is no character with an 11 year old body, attitude, and voice whom is nevertheless of legal age according to the legal disclaimer.  In short: if you want romance but not nudity or fanservice, this delivers.\n\nPerhaps my biggest annoyance is the Memory Collector. You will learn to hate him more and more. He's a cross between Kyubey from Madoka and Marcus from Borderlands in the worst way, but my biggest grief is that nobody in-universe seems to mind. The following scene never occurs in the  game as I made it up to avoid massive spoilers, but captures the essence of the problem.\nM. Collector: "I see you want to make a wish. I can grant it but I take payment in memories."\nWisher: "I want all the money in the world. You can have my memories of my parents."\nM. Collector: "Deal. Here you go."\nWisher: "8 billion, 9 billion... this is only 10 billion. We made a contract for all the money in the world. I want my memories back."\nM. Collector: "No refunds."\nWisher: "You didn't even give me what I was buying."\nM. Collector: "Paragraph 5 of the contract says that's your problem, not mine."\nWisher: "When you put it that way, cheating me and then blaming me for your failure makes perfect sense. Have a nice day!"\nM. Collector: "I'll be back to invisibly voyeur on your hentai scene tonight."\nWisher: "Gosh, that Memory Collector sure is a swell guy."","December 23, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Visual Novels are few and far between here, and the ones we do get more so often fall into the dating simulator sub-genre. If you like VN's, I reccomend supporting Cho Dengeki Stryker to show interest on Steam (also buy Higarashi)/\n\nNow, Cho Dengeki Stryker is by all accounts a straight forward VN. It has multiple endings with an enforced play order, it has some brilliant voice acting, it has great CG art, and a few well-animated cutscenes. The plot is 'different,' and thats good and bad. The good: it has a great set up, I mean I was pretty hooked from the beginning. The whole idea of exchanging memories for wishes was great. And the back story behind the Strykers, and Balabora was all interesting. The bad; the set up leads to typical VN/Anime humor, with our characters attending high school, going to festivals, and generally acting like teenagers. Our primary antagonist cast is also relegated to some low-brow jokes as the 'wacky' neighbors. It makes the moments that delve into the Dengeki Stryker world/lore so much better, and makes you wonder what a game of the Dengeki world would've been like? Or rather, a smarter more intricate plot involving the memory collector?\n\nRegardless of its no-frills execution and plot, the characters are all so great, and make the VN so much more enjoyable than it has a right to be. Essentially any plot point focusing on the character Mirror is fantastic. I love Cho Dengeki Stryker, but unless you are already a VN fan, I'd probably skip it, unless the concept interests you.","May 29, 2015","true","22.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Never had any game grated me this much... and I tried my very best to like this game. I mean, with so many positive reviews, it oughta be good, right? Right? Unfortunately, this was not the case for me.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my personal opinions, you are free to agree or disagree with it. We all have different tastes. And oh, SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nI repeat, SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nBefore anything, let's start with the good. It's always best to start with the good.\n\nThe Good:\nAwesome soundtrack (JAM Project and Masaaki Endoh never ever disappoints)\nExcellent animation (even better than some anime!)\nMirror T_T ;_;\nJack~<3\n\n\nNow for the bad... let's just say... RANT MODE ON.\n\nI've played tons of Visual Novels and Kinetic Novels. I'm used to having my choices having little to no matter at all and just be in it for the ride, so to speak. I've cried playing Narcissu, I've laughed playing Nekopara, I've facepalmed playing one of the Sakura games, I've shuddered in fear playing Higurashi, but this game... this game... Cho Dengeki Stryker is definitely unique and not in a good way.\n\nPlaying this game is watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Veeeeeeeeery slow motion. It's worse then watching an episode of the three stooges. Both the protagonist and the villains are actively in a competition to see who's the most incompetent of them all, and that's an understatement. It's like watching Home Alone and everybody's the Wet Bandits (e.g. the robbers), even our protagonist... and Jack is Kevin McCallister. >.<\n\nLet's start with our protagonist, "Yuuki Yamato". The hero of this "super hero epic" that... well, never legitly won a single encounter the whole game. At the very best, he fought the enemies to a standstill (that's his debut, ladies and gentleman) and then proceeded to get his ♥♥♥ whomped every single battle after that, the last battle notwithstanding, but that's with some sacrificial last-minute-power-up, which is why I put "legitly won".\n\nAnd oh, guess what? When our hero was sufficiently beaten up, the sidekick character of the story shows up and... defeated the current villain opponent in a single move. Yes, the villain that was giving our hero so much trouble? Defeated in a SINGLE MOVE, by the sidekick: Texas Ninja Jack. Yes, he/she (don't ask) is a ninja... from TEXAS. And surprisingly, Jack happens to be the most competent character in the whole game.\n\nAs for the villains... meh, I'll just cut my rant short and say the whole group of villains are as incompetent as (or worse than) our hero.\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS STARTS!!!\n\n\n\nFortunately, however, we do have a diamond in the rough, and that is in the character Mirror. Mirror, to me, is the most interesting (and most tragic) character in the game. Who's Mirror? Why, he's the real Yuuki Yamato. The child who made the wish that started this whole tale. Because of his wish, "Yuuki Yamato" became Dengeki Stryker, but that's not the real Yuuki Yamato, the real Yuuki Yamato and his memories, all became trapped in a "monster" that's the character of a book (the same book Dengeki Stryker and the villains originated from) not really knowing what's going on and just want his mom and dad. It's all very very tragic. and the only part I like about the whole game, but at that point I'm already grated to hell and back and thus the thumbs down.\n\n\n\nMASSIVE SPOILERS ENDS!!!\n\n\nThe other thing I disliked, albeit minor, is despite the animation being excellent and we get great quality cutscenes, there's just too much reused clips. Especially the Stryker equip Clips. I guess it's something of a homage to good ol' anime and tokus where they keep reusing the transformation and attack clips. Unfortunately, it works in animes/tokus because it's once per week, whereas as this is a game, and I'm playing it in one sitting... let's just say the reused clips gets annoying after the nth time it's reused within the very same hour and I every much want to (and do) skip it.\n\nThis is a "super hero epic" with nothing heroic at all. The hero doesn't win (at all :P), there's little to no heroic or gripping scenes and... is our hero even actually a hero? What this is is a tragic tale of a wish made by a child who, as a child, does not know better. In other words, it's like Madoka Magica being advertised as a magical girl show. It's true, but it's just not what one's expecting.\n\nWell, I'm done for now. Did I say the most competent character in this whole game is Jack? I did? Well, I'll say it again. The most competent character in this whole game is Jack.\n\n(And randomly: How does a Cyborg grow up anyway? I always figured the Stryker stuff are just armanents, but they keep saying he's a cyborg.)","December 19, 2015","false","10.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","1"

I wish the censorship wasn't there (it was blantantly obvious what was censored). The story is engaging from start to finish, It felt like a full manga/anime series. It has a few animated cutscenes (about 5-10 minutes worth) & full voice acting which is a huge plus! If you're into action anime such as Dragonball Z or Trigun and don't mind some typical slice of life anime tropes to be thrown in here and there, then you'll have something fantastic to read! The store page says there is 30-50 hours of gameplay but I managed to read it all in 5. There are supposed to be 6 routes and I am going to go back and try out a different one but I don't know how much different it will be. If it's worthwhile to do the other routes I'll update this review but as it stands, it's definitely worth the asking price (and it was a steal for $20 on sale!).","October 3, 2014","true","5.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You know when the devs see that there is this niche market out there that is willing to dish out cash for them then hopefully more devs will follow. Therefore more interesting games will be released.\nMy reasoning aside, was my purchase worth it?\n\nYou can probably see this big red thumb down but before you jump on your defence band-wagon read my review and then you can disagree or agree.\n\nThis game costed me around 15 pounds ( it was on 45% discount at the time ). I read the description and I was looking forward for those “animation” sequences, graphically it presented itself good too.\nEager to sink into the story I clicked “New Game”.\n\nWhat hit me was an intro of the game talking about “cyborgs” well nothing wrong there but the music was totally mismatched for the pace and atmosphere... it's like dancing waltz on a heavy metal concert... You would feel awkward.\nHowever music later on, was not an issue. It's actually quite good and you will have “every day's life” tunes and when there is a tension, music will also accommodate. Only on this one instance music was mismatched.\n\nStory started pretty normally ( well rather cliché but it's not an issue ). It was later on that I had laughed hard. There aren't many jokes out there but rather than jokes its the situations the main character gets in that will crack you up. Because I don't want to spoil too much all I will say that character images most likely will make you laugh hard. I mean it's Japanese silly, over the top humour at its best.\nAs for the story itself. It's lack-luster. Most likely because character development in this VN is just very bland. At the very end I haven't felt anything towards those exaggerated characters and in fact I wanted them to loose for some strange reasons. This game on mangagamer website is aged for people over 18 years old and yet this story is immature and outright stupid. How many times I have found myself shouting inside ( * Spolers * why the main character is such a hot head? Never thinks things through which is exploited by his enemies and if it weren't for his friends a lot of times he would be dead for good * Spoilers End* ) Well this could've been easily solved by letting player to have a choice whether to save this or that person and then have a different ending. However this VN doesn't offer you such important choices. Instead you will have few choices along the way that will set you on the right “chapter” like Zero Saga or Heavenly Saga. You have no power over who dies or who get saved ( and it's a superhero story... ).  Same goes for the characters you want to have romance with. They are hard wired into the chapters so if you had chosen * Spoilers * Zero Saga then you will end up with Haruna ( main hero childhood friend ). Again you have no choice which character you want to end up with. Then again one could argue that this game is not a romance sim and fair enough. Nevertheless lack of choices was a disappointment for me, especially because the story is not that interesting or mature. In fact it seems that the only reason why this game was 18+ on mangagamer website was because of adult scenes ( which is most likely 1-2 CGI and awkward voice acting ).  Stripped from those scenes game became “For all ages”. That in itself should tell you something about the game story. It's fun in the beginning but it gets tedious and novelty of it wears off quickly and you ask yourself why this dumb game was even made...?\n\nTime for those animation sequences and graphics. Animation scenes are too far spread out and some of them are overused like “Stryker activation scene”. For a game that is around 27 pounds on steam store you would expect quality. However some of the CGI scenes ( especially the one with Cherry Blossoms ) look like child drawings. On top of that I have noticed anatomy issues and foreshortening problems. As a VN reader I do expect and Eye Candy from time to time that's why I pains to see that some one cut the corners, slapped some paint over it and said “job done”. No. We have to stop accepting mediocrity in the games. I don't expect mind blowing graphics but at least make it up to the standards and erase those errors.  In some VN you can forgive graphical mistakes but when the game has a weak story, weak character development you would think that at least graphics would be good... It's not an eye sore but It tells you that it's unpolished, fan service money grabber. As for the menu screen and hud layout I have no problems there.\n\nSummarising : I would not recommend this game to anyone. Price tag for this quality is too high. I bought it only to support VN releases on steam but thinking back I shouldn't have. I regret supporting mangagamer on this. In fact I won't support them in the future simply because of the adult content and bringing such games that relies on fan service rather that quality story and character development.\n\nFan boys can bring their rage now but hey blind people can't see.","September 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 50 of 122 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","50","122","0","13"

This is not a game. It's essentially a digital comic with voice acting, and zero interaction and gameplay.\n\nI don't have anything against visual novels per se, especially when they are actual games. For example 9 hours - 9 persons - 9 doors is an excellent visual novel that takes great advantage of the medium to make an interesting, story-heavy game, but which has some actual gameplay in it.\n\nBut this isn't a game. This is literally a visual novel. There is no interactivity, there are no branching narratives to speak of, no puzzles to be solved, no gameplay, nothing. It's just that: A novel. Text with pictures. Like a comic, but more limited, with some animations here and there.\n\nI understand that a distinction is made, especially in Japan, between actual visual novels and so-called adventure games (which use the same idea as visual novels, but incorporate interactive elements, such as eg. puzzles to be solved, and branching storylines.) But I wasn't expecting this gameprogram to be this non-interactive.\n\nThe art is excellent (probably the best that can be found on Steam currently) and the voice acting is ok (especially if you are a fan of japanese).

If the answer is yes, this will be a good fit for you. If however you come looking for a VN expecting some decent love development with potential love interests, er........\n\nWARNING: The Steam version is the modified version where the adult content has been removed. If you are bothered by the lack of sexy time, buy the game straight from mangagamer instead.\n\nI've picked up the game during Steam's first anime sale while checking out the sales page. After many a so-so looking VN or Simulator I chanced upon this particular VN. It's a bit atypical for me because it seems to depict a very hot blooded Shonen protagonist with a cyborg theme going on. I happen to like the 2 so I thought I would give it a shot. Steam could certainly use more VN players. Price point is a bit steep for the usual VN on Steam even at 50% off, but personally I enjoyed the game and it's worthed it for me.\n\nI'm quite pleasantly surprised by Cho Dengeki Stryker. Despite it being incredibly, disturbingly linear, it was still quite an enjoyable trip. Sure some of the cliches are quite by the book if you know your anime and tokusatsu well. That still doesn't stop me from enjoying the daily comedy life aspects of the game. There ARE some very glaring anime wacky logic in place, such as the superhero/villain identity thing. If you can buy the fact that all you had to do is change your outfit and no one would be the wiser, you'll probably enjoy this game. (It's like Sailor Moon all over again, not even a mask or anything. Even Superman has a better disguise than everybody in this game. Honestly.)\n\nThe titular main character may seem like an incredible bore but he quickly grew on me. You know he's acting with all the logic and personality of a typical do gooder from 90s and before, but you couldn't help but like the guy for this anyway. The supporting casts range from typical incompetent evil lackeys, generic childhood love interest, that one tsundere character, the one with misunderstood tragic backstory, so on and so forth. Seems like a cookie cutter action drama, but it actually plays out fairly well and drastically different in the 6 character routes the game presents. The villains' daily lives remind me of the "evil" organization in Astro Fighter Sunred: still want to take over the world, but they are great model citizens/neighbors. The love interests' performance is a bit weak compared to how long and well thought out the battle sequence is. For a VN, they definitely could've put some more empahsis on the girls. Love Saga does manage to remedy some of that, but still not enough.\n\nThe battle and action sequence is fairly well done and you can see the writer is definitely a fan of the genre. The accompanying soundtracks is excellent. The voice acting really brought the characters to life. The few bits of animation sequence works well, but not really needed IMO given their location and timing in the routes.\n\nIn terms of choices, there are multiple routes. A flag option in the Menu allows you turn ON story route flags if you choose to dive straight into different character routes; I however highly recommended trying to play the game in sequence. The original Dengeki Stryker chapters may feel a bit weak and unsatisfying compared to the additional routes added in the Cho version. I've mentioned how incredibly linear this game is even by VN standards. Yes, in the terms of actual choices the game lets you make very, very little decisions. It's all one route, one ending. Beats farming for bad ends I guess.\n\nRoute opinions and recommended order:\nZero Saga- Typical anime ending. Feels like a Normal End or Bad End +.\nHeaven Saga - Explosions, excitements, more character development! True End -.\nSky Saga - A further expansion on a previous character route. Very bitter sweet.\nLove Saga - Cute, then it gravitates to diabetes sweet. Expect some Deus Ex Machina.\nSteel Saga - Continuation from one of original Saga. Expect the same level of quality from Heaven Saga, minus even more romance.\nLight Saga - The complete end. A decent wrap to most of my problems I've had with the VN concerning story issues.\nShadow Saga - there's no such thing. Could've really used one though.","January 14, 2015","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Currently in the middle of Steel.\n=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-\nJust finish the Zero route (the first route) and I'd say that alone is enough to justify the purchase. With regards with what to expect from the 1st route:\n-Very Shonen-y (depends if you're into it or not)\n-Dry beginning (pretty much until the timeskip but I still enjoyed the intro)\n-Likeable antagonists (escpecially Mirror)\n-No H Scene (it's on Steam. You'll definitely tell where it's suppose to be but I think given the circumstances, I should have been there)\n- ~1 hour per chapter (11 chapters in the Zero route, though a few chapters are longer/shorter. I finished it in 12 hours)\n\nWarning: If you didn't already know, this is a visual novel. It's very story-driven with a few slice-of-life sections to break up the story (though it's more for characterization rather than "filler"). Also, there is an enforced play order (Zero->Heaven->Sky->(Zero)->Steel->Light. Love can be read anytime but I recommend it after Sky) so you won't be romancing other heroines to enter a route (think F/SN's play order).\n\nJudging on the Zero Route alone, this is worth a purchase on sale. The other routes may possibly be better, similarly to F/SN. I'll update this review when I finish the other routes.\n\nUpdate 6/7/15\nHeaven Saga is equally as good, if not better, than the Zero saga. It introduces new characters, which will raise unconsistancies/questions about the Zero Saga (but they will be answered later!)\n\nSky Saga is the "epilogue" of the Heaven saga and is personally my favorite so far. It ties everything up and even adds a "new" character.\n\nLove saga is a nice sort of "spin-off" and deals with love between the opposing sides. It's a nice read  overall and good if you read it between the 2 story heavy sagas (I managed to skip over it and into Zero the first time playing)\n\nI have yet to read/finish Steel and Light but both are "epilogues" of Zero saga and answer the inconsistancies of why characters appear in Heaven saga and not Zero.\n\ntl;dr It's well worth your money and time if you enjoy VNs and anime","January 21, 2015","true","37.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
