It's a cute idea that seems like a blast to play with friends. However, the game needs more people playing it. If you're on the fence about buying it, here is what you should know:\n\nPros:\n-Cheap! Game is a steal honestly. Its not at its peak value yet because of the small playerbase, but it's a tiny investment.\n-Simple concept. Gets the job done with streamlined gameplay that really gets to the core of class based "shooter." Doesn't really fit that title much, but its more akin to TF2 than other games.\n-Quick rounds! Doesn't take long to play honestly which is great! Haven't played with people yet but should be a blast with friends!\n\nCons:\n-Game simply doesn't look all that nice. This helps gameplay by simplifying interactions with very little clutter and helps keep the game running smoothly on any machine, but be warned, it doesn't look any better playing than the screenshots do.\n-Poorly optimized. Even though it plays well on any machine, the game is more sluggish than a well optimized AAA game or even most indie games. Early access does mean some of this is expected.\n-No players. This might bug potential buyers more than it should because the AI isn't exactly great, but buying this game helps in this regard!\n\nAdd me if you want to play, this game is cute and cheap and frankly I think its a good example of what an amateur early access title should look like.","July 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","0"

So i thought it is a really "cheepy and dumpy" game, i mean the most games with those prices (IF they are not some %-off) are not really in the best quallity and i more or less "know" what i will buy.\n\nWith Warriors & Castles (in short WandC now) i was not really full sure what i will buy with this low price and if the creators themself say something like i quote i only was thinking worse of it, if not even a really "bad" game.\n\nHonestly, i played it just some rounds against bots but i had the hell of fun with it.\n\nThe Pros\n\n-VERY very cheap price, i would even buy it for 5-8€, honestly. I guess the creators just doesnt know what they created! Its really more worth than 3€.\n\n-Easy to understand. The game has (so far) not any tutorial but its very easy to understand if you played it a bit, its like (at least with the 3 classes i played it) a Rock-Paper-Scissors system, let me explain about without spoiler:\n\nWarrior\n- Good against Archers (coz they have pretty low health)\n- Weak against Magicians (cant block the dmg full from them)\n\nArcher\n- Good against Magicians (they move pretty slow)\n- Weak against Warriors (coz of the low health)\n\nMagician\n- Good against Warriors (they cant block the dmg full)\n- Weak against Archers (coz of the slow movement)\n\n- Simply "cartoony" like grafic. Really, it just fits! Its not really the "best kind" of grafic but it fits to the game and gameplay, even the splatters from blood and like\n\n- Nothing unfair. It gives (so far) 3 classes which are well balanced and there is nothing unfair so far. Archers have limited range (magicians too), the cooldowns are good set and the building HPs are not to high set.\n\nIt also has some negativs, still...which are:\n\n- The Animations look weird sometimes, like the characters has a "stick in the A**", if you know what i mean.\n\n- Not really or pretty quiet "soundtrack". It really needs some good bg music if i dont use my own Heavy metal music to give the game some more "emotions" on the battlefield X3\n\n(not really negativ but still)\n- this game needs just some more "love". Really. more players, a bit more work and done. for 3€ i cant complain about that much\n\n\n\nFact:\nWandC is a hell of fun game for such low price and i wish only it had some more players, really. The animations doesnt look so much right but i guess with some animators or some more work, the creators can still work on that. The Classes are well balanced and not "to strong" or like. If you die it is coz youre just stupit or the enemy comes in masses X3.\n\nFor 3€ its VERY good and well made, at least in the gameplay. It really just needs more players and some more "love".\n\nI give it a 7.8/10 so far coz it really needs some more active players and maybe better animations. The rest is well made for such a low-price game!","August 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

But Warriors and Castles shows promise. The developers are dedicated to it and are actively working on it. The price is very cheap, and this makes it a great candidate for a party game with friends. The system requirements are modest (though it does need some optimization.) The idea is somewhat like Chivalry Medieval Warfare, though it is much simpler. There are currently three classes, Warrior, Archer, and Wizard. Their functions are relatively self explanatory, and the type of game I've played is a battle in which there are two castles, you must breach the gates of your enemy castle. The dev's are working on setting up dedicated servers, and the game does contain a decent enough AI which does allow the AI to be able to complete any objectives. The Wizard seems a bit underpowered as his abilities are defensive. He can fire a magic missile, which I think does more damage than an arrow. He can heal himself and I am pretty sure heal allies, but Warriors have a spinning attack which can only be countered but a warrior holding his shield up. This spinning attack as a large radious and can wipe out a cluster of enemies pretty quickly. The game is in very early stages of development, it is no where near it's final product. But since the developers are very active and EXCEPTIONALLY responsive to suggestions and criticism, this game is definitely worth supporting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVGYq0tIvwA\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/recommended/372380/","Sawadegan","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/","605 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is simple and fun, no class is overpowered, no class is underpowered.\n\nThere are 2 sides, red, and blue; each side has the three simple classes known to many people, Archer, Mage, and Knight.\nThe visuals are nice and simplistic, nothing complex like other games, which makes it kind of nice to play, except for the fact that no one is on (due to the fast that this is a 'new' game).\nThe controls are the same as other games, you have your class, the special skills, your weapon (which can either discharge something or slice).\n\nThere are 3 gamemodes; castle conquer, capture the flag, and moba, all self explanatory, but I'll list them out anyways:\n\nCastle Conquer - Your team's job is to destroy the other's castle, and defend yours.\n\nMoba - An arena for people to enjoy, kill a few people whilst there.\n\nCapture the Flag - Stand and hold your position over the flag in the town square.\n\nKnight - The melee user, you have your shield and your weapon; your special skill is 'spin-and-slice' as I like to call it, fairly easy class to use, vulnerable to mages and archers at far range. The shield can block arrows depending on where they land (obviously it won't block if it hits you in the head), good if you can manage to get close enough.\n\n1st skill - Slice-and-dice, twirl around and slice people for 5 seconds\n2nd skill - Quick-dash, run fast enough to catch up to an opponent or get behind them\n\nArcher - The long-range user, it's exactly what it sounds like, you sit form afar and shoot arrows till your enemy dies. Close range is fairly weak, so I suggest far range. Vulnerable to mage and knights.\n\n1st skill - Arrow-band, shoot 7 arrows at your enemy(ies) for maximum efficiency.\n2nd skill - Bear-trap, set up a trap below you for enemies to fall into.\n\nMage - This class is neither long-ranged nor short ranged, meaning that, it doesn't shoot quite as far as the archer, but it does shoot far enough. He shoots out colored clouds (the color depends on your team's), and has melee like the archer. I suggest staying away from the Knights, due to the fact that they have shields and don't penetrate ( ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the character.\n\n1st skill - Wall, summon up a wall before you with the same color as your team.\n2nd skill - Heal-well, heal up to as many of your mates (provided they're in your circle) for 5         seconds.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, I definitely recommend buying it, and it's obviously incomplete (Early Access, duh), but I trust the developers with a game like this, adding cosmetics, new skills, features, that would be awesome (especially hats, costumes, stuff like that).\n\nThank you for your time ^^","June 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"capture and hold the town's central square" is the only objective i've ever seen.  game starts with a decent size map, but you won't need to worry about that. all the bots are going to do is spawn and immediately march to the middle of town to fight.\n\nlucky for you, weathermanlandfaerietruck is here to give you the forecast. expect a heavy downpour of projectiles in the center of town. if you wanna be a smartass and pick the knight then expect to get crushed by projectiles before you get within 10 yards of an enemy.\n\ni decided that the exact center of town must be the location in the center of the giant pool of blood. it's the exact spot, the middle, the place where everyone meets to fight like men. just bring your character over there and shoot arrows or merlin's magic juice into the pile of blood and corpses and see what happens. the game says i am 4/10 so it looks like i've killed a few people, but really i have no idea what is going on or how to 'hold' this spot. it seems that my bot team must be ♥♥♥♥ because once every 5 minutes or so the word 'defeat' appears on the screen in big red letters. it doesn't feel like a loss though. it is more like the game lets you fight for 5 minutes then flips a coin and picks a side to win.\n\ni guess in the end, although it is comforting to know that there is a place i can go to see bots do nothing other than meet in the middle and fight like men, i cannot reccomend this game to actual humans.\n\n","June 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 24 of 54 people (44%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","44","24","54","25","5"
