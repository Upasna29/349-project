He will meet a cast of colorful characters and he will go to varied and weird locales.\nAs far as adventure games go, this one has a very simple, yet fun and interesting story that will keep you engaged for three hours. It's well written and it manages to keep your attention also thanks to its pacing.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unity engine, it is very polished, with detailed backgrounds, good models, decent animations and gorgeous colors. Its vibrant look makes it stand out from other more depressing indie games.\n\nGAMEPLAYYour standard point-and-click game: pick up items, use them to solve puzzles, talk to characters. The only thing that makes it different is the possibility to rotate the camera in 360°: it's not really a gimmick or a mechanic, just a small feature that feels like a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale genre.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game offers a decent challenge while never being frustrating or hard. Plus there is an hint system that can be used twice before waiting two minutes for it to recharge that basically spills out the solution to each puzzle, so you won't be stuck. Ever.\n\nSOUNDThe game feels really empty: the soundtrack is too calm and relaxing for its own good, the sound effects are few and far between, and there is no voice acting.\n\nREPLAYABILITY\n\nOverall, this is a surprisingly well done adventure game: even though it's short, the funny story and nice graphics are worth the price alone. Recommended to all point-and-click fans.\n\nStory: 8\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 6.5\nReplayability: 4\n\nENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","April 1","true","2.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","16","18","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJessaChannel/recommended/442770/","TheJessaChannel","TheJessaChannel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJessaChannel/","16 products in account","I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL GAME\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen I first discovered this gem of a game, I immediately fell in love with the sweet art style and the Minim characters. But boy, was I in for a treat: the story is just as sweet and wonderful as the art. The story is, in essence, about the pilgrimage of Mii, a minim, to find his partner Mo who has gone missing. But in his travels to find her he ends up exploring himself and learning about important choices. But the game is not preachy or saccharine - it hits all the right notes that make your feel as if you are exploring right along with Mii. Plus, he is adorable.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nGameplay is simple - this is a point and click game so most of the interaction is with the mouse. I did, at first, get stuck with the "looking around" mechanic - it involves holding down a key and moving the mouse - but I soon got used to it. Some may find it annoying but I did not - once I understood it. I think that it could be simplified to be honest; instead of holding down a key just moving the mouse should move the view.\n\nThe puzzles are just right - not too hard - but keep in mind that I HATE puzzles - so I was really happy with the tips system. If you want hard puzzles, this might not be the game for you. The developers did a great job in keeping the tediousness down with one exception: at one point you need to keep a hamster fed in order to go up and down a mountain. Having to constantly go through three steps when the milk ran out was annoying.\n\n\nPros\nThe Mimims and other characters are adorable\nThe story is interesting and thought-provoking\nThe game runs smoothly and is GORGEOUS\n\n\nCons\nThe camera mechanic is clunky\nThe time restriction on the tips feature is annoying for puzzle-haters like me >.<\nHaving to constantly feed the hamster to keep going up and down the mountain was tedious.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is, so far, my favorite game of 2016. One of my viewers says it best:\n\n\nOnly one word "BEAUTIFUL" this was an amazing adventure. Thank you Jessa for taking us along for the journey. Now that I have watch you play it, my daughter and I will see if there are new discoveries to learn. I recommend everyone watching to buy and try this as well :) We need more sweet games like this on the market for young ones, family and those that want variety. There should be balance of more games like these to choose from. <3\nSo yeah, The Minims is a MUST BUY. ♥❤\n\n\nThis review was submitted by The Jessa Channel, a YouTube channel that focuses on gaming Let's Plays served up with a soupçon of silly and a whole lot of story. Though 	beyondthosehills provided a copy for review, all thoughts and opinions are entirely my own.\n\nIf you would like to check out the game in action, here's a gameplay video to enjoy:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5TXPSgdi58","April 25","true","5.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

A lovely game with no violence, netherworld creatures chasing you, or the protagonist trying to saving the world against dark magic while precious time is ticking away.  This game is set in a serene, simple world all its own.  I want to stress the word serene here because the music and pace of the game are very calm and slow.  Part of me was thankful for the change of pace from most games being released but another part of me was going crazy not being about to skip through dialogue, walk faster, or jump to known locations.  I kept going, though, because the animation, score, and story line are all outstanding and the puzzles were unique and inventive.  I would recommend the game but only if you can handle a slower pace.","April 24","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls were a pain to use, had to use both hands and you can't change them, the camera turns by itself when transitioning areas and you can't turn that off which is unpleasant for the motion sick prone and uses up a lot of time. Cute I guess but I wish I'd skipped this one.","May 14","false","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It isn't the best point and click game but I have played considerably worse point and click games. The story is pretty good, the controls work well, and the graphics are nice. If you like points and click games you should like the game.\n\nThe two biggest problems with the game are the length and the difficulty. The Minims is too easy in my opinion which leads to the game being pretty short. A lot of the puzzles are pretty straight forward and thus aren't that hard to figure out. If you ever get stuck you can always use the hint system which should make it impossible to get stuck in the game. The easy difficulty is not necessarily a bad thing but if you are looking for a challenge I don't think you will be challenged by The Minims. The easy difficulty makes the game only three to four hours long so you aren't going to get a lot of time out of the game.\n\nIf you don't care for point and click adventure games, The Minims isn't going to be for you. If you like point and click games though and the premise interests you I think you will enjoy The Minims.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for the review.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","April 1","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

From what I've read and played so far, I'm interested in playing more.\n\nThe word minim derives from the Latin word minimus, meaning "least" or "smallest."\n\nMeet some Minims: cute little creatures who resemble a kind of gourd stood on-end with two eyes at the top. The Minims is also the name of a new adventure game for Windows and Mac (previously released on iOS) by indie developer beyondthosehills.\n\nStory\n\n\n\nThe game's story is imaginative, well-written and touching, with some humor thrown in for good measure. There are three Minims in The Minims: Mii, his wife Mo and, briefly, Mii's Elder Minim.\n\nOne day, Mii discovers Mo has gone missing and sets out on a journey to find her. This occupies the balance of the game (which is relatively short; I knocked it off in a single afternoon).\n\nMii discovers that he not only needs to find Mo; he is told by his Elder Minim that he must make a choice: to follow his inner path -- which is located in his mind -- and be transformed forever, or choose to return to his old life as if nothing had happened.\n\nMii is also told that Mo has already made her choice. How could he choose anything but to go on? (I didn't have the heart to choose "go back," so I don't know what happens in that case). He is then teleported into his own mind, which turns out to be quite an interesting place.\n\nDuring his mind-journey, Mii visits curious, unusual locations inhabited by some rather odd characters. Each one aids Mii's progress in some way; however, this being an adventure game, he's also obliged to do things for them.\n\nPuzzles\n\n\n\nDuring his travels, Mii must solve a variety of inventory-based puzzles. Most aren't particularly difficult, although one refused to budge for me no matter what I tried. Even the game's generous help system was of no use, and I ended up solving it by accident. I found this a tad frustrating, but it's the only trouble I had.\n\nNavigation and Mechanics\n\n\n\nThe developer has given point-and-click navigation an interesting twist. The game also offers 360-degree panning, and you can look up and down as well.\n\nEven though the game is played in 3rd-person, Mii doesn't always move when you do. There are times he'll wait for you to check out an area of interest and return to him afterwards. In these cases, you're often able to shift your view around and see him standing in the distance.\n\nThe camera will also pan on its own to show you various things. I particularly enjoyed the camerawork used as Mii traverses a very long, very high bridge. It's quite cinematic.\n\nThe Minims can be played either windowed or in full-screen.\n\nThe game offers no user-initiated saves. It does let you return to the beginning of each chapter once you've played it. If you need to leave mid-chapter, you're taken back to the point at which you left the game. If you start a new game, the slate is wiped clean.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\n\n\nThe Minims' quasi-cartoon visual style is colorful and quirky. I think it's quite appealing.\n\nThere is no spoken dialog in the game; instead, bubbles filled with text appear over characters' heads, which suits the game nicely. The music is very well-done, as are the ambient sounds.\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nThe Minims is generally quite pleasant and relaxing to play. It has an imaginative story with characters and locations that are fanciful and charming.\n\nIf you're looking for a point-and-click adventure that's practically stress-free (albeit somewhat short), The Minims is for you. Kudos to beyondthosehills for making such a sweet, enjoyable game.\n\nGrade: A-\n\n+ Great story\n\n+ Pleasant and relaxing\n\n+ Appealing, quasi-cartoon visual style\n\n+ Music and ambient sounds are very well-done\n\n- Somewhat short\n\n- No user-initiated saves\n\nhttp://justadventure.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3367","April 14","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
