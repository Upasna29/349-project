I decided to take a couple hours off work to play the game and give it a quick and honest review of my first impressions, and it pulled me in enough to get me to dedicate the time to finish it.  I went into this game with the knowledge and expectations one should have of an indie RPG, and came out with a pleasurable experience.  I can sense the love and care that went into this RPG, and could recommend it to anyone who is interested in an indie JRPG experience.\n\nDURATION PLAYEDI finished the game with one character and grinded to max level (30) in about 15 hours.  The average I've seen reported seems to be around the 10 hour mark.\n\nLIKESFirst off, I was impressed to see that you can play the story from the perspective of 6 different characters.  So far, from what I can see, these are not major branching storylines, but instead allow you to choose the "main character".  Depending on the main character you've chosen you will get different dialogue scenes at different points in the game.\nThe character spritework is great.\nYou see enemies on the main map, which is something I very much enjoy.\nThe combat in Celestian Tales is very standard JRPG, like Final Fantasy.  Each character takes a turn and the player chooses from a menu.  Each character has HP and Sta.  The combat mode is very tight and polished, with a dynamic camera that seems inspired by Radiant Historia.  You will heal to full HP after every battle, but your Sta is regained by defending or attacking.\nThe music is very appropriate and pleasant to listen to.\nThe storytelling and writing is well done.  I like the dynamic between the different character personalities, and I can see a lot of character development just within the first few hours of play.\nThe art style is very unique.  I can't think of any other JRPGs I've played with this art style.\nThe characters are each given interesting and unique skills that seem to fit their personalities and backgrounds well while maintaining a unique balance.\nYou choose 3 characters to take into combat, and can easily swap out the party whenever you feel like.\nThe leveling system is unique in that your entire party has a single level rather than each individual character.\nYour characters can each carry 4 active and 2 passive skills into combat and you can equip them as you like in the menu before combat for different strategies.\nThere is a weapon upgrading system a few hours into the game where you can use materials you've gained from combat to upgrade weapons.\n\nDISLIKES    I've come across a few obvious, but minor, bugs and 1 critical, but un-reproducing bug.  I just had to relaunch my last save and the bug never occurred again.  It is surprisingly stable for such a large project with a small team on a tight budget.\nUsually the environment art looks very nice and polished, but there are some points that seem like they could have been touched up more.  These spots are usually the interiors to houses and the towns.\nThe quest log is sometimes not descriptive enough on where to go or do next or doesn't update for some of the small milestones in the chapter quest.  This made it a little confusing at times for me.\nThe world map is a bit barebones compared to some traditional RPGs, but is enough to give a feeling for the size and shape of the land.\nThere's a lack of instructions in the game for some of the different features, so it took some experimenting to figure them out (like how to regain Sta), though this could be a positive for many people.\nChapters 3-4  were very easy, then there was a sudden jump in difficulty at Chapter 4.  The step up in difficulty was very much welcomed by me, but it may come as a surprise to some and could probably use a little smoother by ranking up the difficulty of fights before this point.\nA difficulty mode that switches between varying HP and Damage output of enemies could have benefited this game for some simple customization to difficulty level.\nCutscenes aren't skippable.  So if you die on a hard boss fight, you'll have to go through it again.\nNo New Game+.  Maintaining character levels and equipment between games would have made it more enticing to play through again and see other character dialogue scenes.\nNo sidequests.  Some simple fetch and kill sidequests would have helped add some texture to the main storyline.\nThe game's pitch might lead one to believe that there is a lot of branching story options.  However the game is pretty much linear with a few small encapsulated options scattered about.  I would approach this game with the idea of it being a linear storyline like the classics and not a modern "choose your own adventure" type of RPG.\nSUMMARYCelestian Tales focuses its energy on delivering an interesting story through smooth and familiar gameplay.  I recommend Celestian Tales to any JRPG fan that is acceptive of indie production qualities and is looking for a game that focuses heavily on its storytelling.","August 10, 2015","true","10.5"," 209 of 239 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","209","239","0","21"

This review is based on that experience.\n\nPros/Cons+ The music is great\n+ The graphics as well, surprising amount of 8-way sprite variety considering the budget, and they have some neat little touches like weapon drawing/sheathing animations\n+ The pacing is very good throughout the game, there's no filler and nothing feels like it wastes your time\n+ Equipment is more interesting than most JRPGs so far, quite some trade-offs and unique effects\n+ I really like the skill/character advancement system, see below\n+ Battles so far have also been fun, I'll describe the system below\n+ You have more choices than what you'd expect in a JRPG\n+ The characters are pretty interesting, and have a decent party dynamic, however...\n- The writing is somewhat let down by a number of grammatical errors\n- Bugs: worst one was a wrong trigger which teleported me somewhere, and the game also referred to itself as a "test build" in one instance; edit: Both of these major issues were patched within the first 15 hours and are no longer in the game at this point.\n- Minor stuff: the run speed could be a bit higher, and I'd like to be able to use the d-pad rather than joystick with gamepad controls\n\nCharacter advancement systemFirst of all, your entire party levels at once, which is very convenient and makes a lot of sense really.\nYou get 4 slots for active skills and 2 for passive skills per character. Since you level up very often, you soon have to pick and choose the skills for each, and there are some interesting synergies. It has something of Guild Wars almost in that aspect.\n\nBattle systemThe game employs the smart mechanic of healing you back up fully after each encounter. In any game which is not about resource management (which most non-dungeon-crawler JRPGs haven't been about in ages) healing up after battle is just meaningless routine, so I really like that choice.\n\nI also really like how they do stamina management, which is really the main battle mechanic.\nYou start with a set amount of stamina (which can be adjusted by some equipment and passives), and all skills require a number of stamina points. performing a normal attack regenerates 1 stamina, and defending regenerates 2. There are also ways to transfer stamina from one character to another, and attacks which reduce it in the enemy.\n\nSince stamina is per-battle, like everything else, you are never not thinking about using it. This mostly prevents the "trash mob" button-mashing scenario.\n\nBattles are also generally quick, which is something that I always appreciate. Difficulty is pretty well-balanced and what I'd call moderate so far (I consider most modern JRPGs too easy).","August 10, 2015","true","10.9"," 118 of 133 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","118","133","0","0"

I'm probably doing a negative review because the game really frustrated my expectations.\n\nThe combat is too simple and unexciting...\nThe choice of choosing a  character is probably a mistake, it would be better to play with all of then in the same game. I say this because there is no point in replaying the game...\nThe bigger issue for me was the story, i felt it was kind weak and really a bad cliche, i dont mean that a cliche can't be good, but it need to better written and make more sense. I was progressing to see if the game would show me something, but nothing happened.....i think they need to hire a good writer, they have something nice, but badly done.\n\nThe good thing are the graphics, they are very nice to see. The game has e few bugs but nothing that can stop you.\nThe battle system is very nice, the skills and everything is good enough, but still the combat is boring and very easy to manage, it would probably be better if they made something like suikoden and let all the 6 character's together in battle, of course balance would be necessary.\n\nThe game felt too straight forward, there was no freedom and very little chance to exploration, didn't like that.\n\nThis game is only part 1, and i know more will come, but from what i just saw, IDK if i'm going to jump in...\n\nI'm very disappointed....\n","August 14, 2015","false","10.9"," 154 of 214 people (72%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","72","154","214","16","9"

Together with the other houses, these will be in war with World Enders (big demonic vikings that want to destroy everything).\nTo be able to do this they will have to make choices between things important to them... devotion to their god, their family, their habits, their heritage and more.\nHow far will you go to protect what you love?\n\nOverall its not a bad turnbased jrpg at all and the overall gameplay feel is very nice.\n\nAs i said before... the game doesnt go for over the top futuristic "we got so many unseen gaming features" and "look at these new mechanics" ... instead they simply build an well-made game that is basically "good" ... not "super amazing hypetrain 2060", but still a good distance above "avarage".

If you were into old school RPGs like Lunar, Suikoden, Breath of Fire, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 1-6 (NES/SNES era) then you will absolutely love this. An instant classic in my opinion.\n\nIn terms of inspiration, I would say Suikoden is the biggest at hand here.. the warrior is even referenced as "Young Master".\n\nMy views:\n+: Amazing, hand drawn graphics style. Really works in today's market flood of 3D.\n+: Fun battle system, engaging and much more on offer than RPG Maker style games.\n+: Not an RPG maker game.\n+: Story is engaging and well thought-out. Writing style is fairly relaxed which isn't for everyone.\n+: Multiple character approach is interesting. Instead of a 40+ hour game with one character, it is broken out into 5-10 hour chunks with each character.\n\nFully recommend for anyone looking for that piece of nostalgia - I'd even recommend for people who haven't played this type of isometric sprite RPG before as it effectively bridges the gap between old and new gaming.","August 10, 2015","true","2.8"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","48","60","0","1"

I really like the characters and the conflicting personalities, and Yli is super cute and funny :) The battle systems are not bad etc, and the story is quite engaging as well. I'm only a couple of hours in and I've heard the game is quite short - that being said it's a three part story and the second part will be released sometime in the future. There's also alot of reading dialogue, but I enjoy that so all good.\nThe only thing that I was disapointed in was there was alot of potential for story to be taken further in side-quests based on characters you meet telling you about themselves and what is unresolved in their life. EG A young boy has never left\nhis village and wants to so he can find his father, but just when you think "Ok this is an interesting story moment" he\nbasically shrugs his shoulders and says "Maybe I will one day" and thats it? From what I have heard of the games length\nit can't be revisited and expanded on because the game is too short to do this and alot of other story side-quests that\ncould have been really interesting and added more to the feel and depth of the game. Pity. Hope it's revisited in the later\ninstallments.\nTo be honest the game doesn't rival old JRPGs and is not a patch on Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3, Earthbound, Phantasy Star IV etc\nbut if you like classic JRPGs that are new, you could do a lot worse. I also think it's still on sale, but that might have past\nnow.\n\nI will update this review when I finish it and also later when the other two episodes are released.","August 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","13"

Unfortunately I think it's not stated well enough on the starting page, as I bought the game without knowing it. Further on why this information is crucial.\n\nThis game is a traditional RPG with a nice and well orchestrated story line and a good soundtrack. I think that the developers did a nice job with the  game overall and for that I recommend it, however there are many pro and cons in this game that made the overall judgement of the game not easy to reach.  To convey why I felt a little torn about the positive judgement I gave to the game in the end, I'll listen each pro and its relative con one after another.\n\nStory\nPRO\n-Heavy store line, the devs were quite transparent with their Game of Thrones inspiration yet the story has a dignity of its own. On the other hand, there are some recurring tropes, and if you don't like the GoT setting, well, this would make the game quite less enjoyable for you.  Also, during the game you will have a couple occasion when you will have to make important decision regarding the story and the setting...\nCON\n...but it won't matter, since the game is a trilogy and as stated from the Devs in the game discussion those decision will only come to play in the two future installment of the series. As you can expect, the game will also have some loose ends and an ending that closes the chapter but leaves the story open for the future installment. Some people might be quite discouraged from it.\n\nCombat\nPRO\n-The Combat System is interesting, and altough it might look simple at a first glance, it is quite rewarding to learn and master, with a few sore notes regarding some whacky scalings and mechanics.\nYou will control a party of 3 and will be free to change composition out of combat.\nCharacters have a resource called Stamina that ranges from 0-8, attacking restores 1 stamina while defending restores 2, skills are used consuming stamina while items are free but also don't restore stamina. Managing stamina between attack, defense and skill is how you win your battle. Stats are also quite relevant, and characters are differentiate enough in their skills, with, for example, a Crossbow wielder that is effective against high armor targets, a character using dagger that is efficient against humanoid targets, and so on.\nCON\nWhat I previously stated about the combat system is true, but for the most part of the game the battle are so easy that you can just spam attack and occasionally heal and still get through the game. Things get a little more heated up during boss fights and the last 2 chapters of the game, where they actually spike insanely, but overall I lost a grand total of 1 time during 2 playthroughs. And the main reason because I lost, was because I didn't expect for enemies to spike that hard between chapters.\n\nArt\nPRO\nThe style reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, and the OST is very well done, characters portraits and art is well made and even their sprites are quite "cute" (considering the 16 bit style).\nI already covered the OST but I have to add that the developer placed care in tieing the key moments of the narration with a fitting track.\nCON\nCertain aspects of the game show how the developer had to make tough choices with the little budgets they had.\nWhile the character art is really well done, other things like the overworld map, or how town and indoors are made look really quaint and poorly executed. I can't blame them since they game is quite cheap, but I expected something more polished.\n\nReplayability\nPRO\nThe 6 characters are all well designed, and they have an unique prologue chapter each.\nThey also have some unique cutscenes where they have to make certain decisions, and paired with how you can play different character compositions it adds to replayability\nAlso, save games will be carried over to the next game.\nCON\nAs for the story, their unique decision don't affect the game that you buy now, but the later installment.\nIs something that quite bugs me but that I can come to term with.\n\nOverall, I confirm my positive review, as Celestian Tales: Old North is indeed a solid game  but with a few caveats: I understand that the game is cheap and that it's just the first chapter, but I really hope that the next game will straighten up some of the problems that the first chapter had.\nI don't expect them to change the whole game world and upgrade all the arts, but some things like the issues with enemy scalings during chapters could be fixed with a little number tweaking.\nI also expect that the decisions we took during this chapter will have some implication during the lategame and won't just alter a cutscene, but I'm not sure if they will able to deliver that with the budget they had.\nAnd, lastly, it has to evolve the game: If the next 2 chapter will make me feel like they fragmented the game to sell each chapter like it was an adventure game like Deponia, or a Telltale game, I'm not sure if my judgement will stay the same, as then I will have to consider it as a single game that costs as the sum of its parts.\n\nTL;DR= Positive review, but they have to deliver with the next 2 games as it's a story-driven game that is part of a trilogy","August 13, 2015","true","9.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

Follow their journey from the point of view of one of the six characters as you are presented with a number of moral decisions that affect things in the world. Decisions you make will carry over into the next 2 installments of this series, according to the devs.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nOld North features a lot of the familiar RPG mechanics we are used to, most notably the turn-based battle system. Each character takes turns in battle, with you being able to choose each character's action each turn. Attacking, Defending, using items or skills, or even run away. Your characters have a pool of health called HP (Hit or Health Points) which drop as they take damage. Instead of the usual MP (magic points), Old North uses an interesting Stamina gimmick for spells and abilities. Each action you take in battle (attacking, defending, etc) stocks 1 Stamina point, and you can hold up to 8. Skills and abilities cost various amounts of stamina points.\n\nWhile you do have 6 characters to choose from, only 3 can be used in battle at a time. However, outside of battle you are able to freely swap them out at any time. Each character is suited for a specific purpose, Lucienne, for example, is best used as a tank as her abilities allow her to hold the attention of enemies and take reduced damage. Aria has access an array of healing abilities, making her best suited as a healer. Other characters do share some abilities that can allow them to play these roles as well, such as Reynard, who is best suited as a melee fighter but also has a taunt skill. This allows him to be a secondary tank when needed.\n\nEven though characters each have these abilities, the game is easy enough to where you don't really have to utilize them in such a manner. Most battles can be won by simply attacking. Only a few boss battles require a bit more strategy, in which an understanding of each character's abilities really come in handy. Enemies roam about each area in plain sight, and can be avoided if you so choose. If you touch one on the field, a battle ensues, allowing you to gain experience points, loot, and level up. Earned loot can later be used to upgrade your parties' weapons.\n\nPerhaps the most unique feature is that instead of your characters individually gaining levels...your entire group gains them as one. As the party level increases, each character learns new abilities. This streamlines the experience quite a bit, as it eliminates a lot of grinding that we see in many RPGs, allowing players to focus more on the story. Speaking of story, each character has a different background that is unique and compelling, but I will not spoil anything here!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nNearly everything in Old North is hand-drawn or hand-painted, and that's quite impressive. Every detail is expertly drawn/painted, and look amazing. Environments in particular look great, but lack depth. Sometimes it's hard to tell if an archway is a door or simply architectural design. Some shading here or there would have helped solve this problem.\n\nPerhaps the characters and enemies are the only things not hand-painted or drawn, though one could argue that pixel art is done by hand. Their sprites look really good, and remind me of those found in the Suikoden titles. One detail I noticed is that as your characters or enemies take damage, they show signs of fatigue. This is a small detail I wish more RPGs would use.\n\nI simply love the art design of this game, I can't praise it enough. Even the animated cutscenes (especially the opening video) look really nice, albeit a bit...primitive. Still looks great regardless. Character portraits are perhaps my favorite aspect of the game, as they reflect how a character is feeling or expressing themselves at any given time and are very detailed. Their expressions change during dialogue and do not remain static for too long.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nOld North features a score that really captures the pace of the game and helps convey the emotion of the story as it goes along. Low and somber tracks for the more emotional scenes, while battles and more intense scenes have a more upbeat and dramatic sound to them.\n\nNo annoying footstep sound effects here, which is a plus! Weapon attacks and opening chests sounds are oddly satisfying. Using buffing abilities like Protection or Toxic Touch all have the same effect/sounds, which becomes glaringly obvious after awhile. Perhaps a bit more work or tweaking of the sound direction of the game could help to improve the experience.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nOld North runs very well, though I did notice one thing that other people will undoubtedly see as well. During scene transistions, flashes of the scene that is loading can be seen for a moment. Not a huge deal, but it's definitely noticeable. Aside from that, I did not see any framerate drops, stuttering, lag, or slowdown. The game has full controller support, and plays very well with one. You'll feel like you are playing a console RPG!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nCelestian Tales is a nice JRPG with enough depth and a compelling story that most RPG fans should be able to enjoy it. It's few flaws pale in comparison to everything else the game does right. An excellent addition to RPG fans' libraries, I look forward to the next 2 installments of this series in the future!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BaY4-TMMHM\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 28, 2015","true","13.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","2"

Ninja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodninja87/","191 products in account","A for effort but his game failed to deliver in a lot of ways. There were a lot of good concepts here that were just poorly executed. I'll list a few of the bigger complaints just as a heads up.\n\nThe idea to choose from different perspectives is really neat and interesting, but the actuall difference is so shallow that it hardly warrants an actual replay. The most you get for playing different characters is a few cutscenes, nothing that drastically changes the game. Maybe if I beat it with all 6 characters I would see a greater impact, but as it stands now, it isn't worth the investment.\n\nThe story had a chance to be interesting, fighting giant barbarian like creatures in an epic war, however you never actually get to do that. Your ragtag band of "squires" just run around doing meanial tasks that frankly, just feels like filler. I get that you're squires, and not exactly battle tested, but you don't do anything exciting. The boss fights are weak (and I'm just assuming the dire wolf and pig you fight are the boss fights) except for two of them, and one of them you don't even fight as the squires.\n\nThen there is the end of the game. After about 7 hours of boring chores and vague cutscenes (which at the times I just assumed would be better explained later, but now I'm pretty sure that if you want a better understanding of them you have to replay the game as said character) there is a drastic plottwist, a boss fight (which was pretty challenging and fun) and then an abrupt end. No explanation at all, just a massive cliffhanger then the credits roll. Which is a shame because it ends right as the game gets interesting.\n\n\nThere are other minor cons and pros, but anything else I could say would just be parroting other reviews, and honestly a lot of them are just opinionated remarks that players could take as either or depending on what they like in a game. I just wanted to hit some major fall offs so anyone thinking about getting this game knows what they're in for. The game info is pretty accurate when it says "you are not special".","November 24, 2015","false","8.0"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","32","42","0","2"

Reminiscent of Suikoden which is awesome btw.\n\nAllowing replayability with 6 different characters.\n\nFirst little bit of gameplay if you'd like to check before you buy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye22I2FmOuo\n\nDifferent gear and tactics do change it up a bit\n\nRather good storytelling.\n\nNow for the cons:\nFirst off, does have a few bugs. Like showing a summary of chapter 7 when your in chapter 1. Kind of a spoiler and some nps go a little funky hopefully gets patched out. SPOILERS! And when your at the war camp and go back to Levantine and they are already talking about the victory that hasn't EVEN happend yet. I'm sorry but how do you mess that one up? Did they think you would stay on the rails and never look around lol.\n\nBattle is rather boring and you'll find you can just spam the attack commands as you will usually get the same results using tactics most of the time.\n\nOther than your main character you will never feel like your getting any in depth character knowledge of any other characters in the game. You could replace the supporting characters with potatoes and I'd get the same feelings and at least we'd have french fries.\n\nIf you poke around other than the main questline you'll find it all rather empty and linear forcing you back on the main quest. Pretty  scenery but all the npcs say rather generic stuff.\n\n\nStory tempo is crazy fast paced as beating this one with each character reportedly doesn't take too long. The game is part of a planned trilogy.

Yes that is true, but nowhere do you actually ever have a choice on what to do.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game defintitely qualifies as a work of art. harkens back to a better day of JRPG'S.\nSuffers from too fast paced storyline and not enough side stuff or a real vibrant world you feel you belong in.\nThe battle is standard JRPG fare and defintely a step up from RPG maker slush filling up steam on a daily basis.\nThe story is pretty good, just makes me wish it was slower and a little more, but wanting more is never a bad thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/315860/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account",""Celestian Tales: Old North" is supposedly the first entry in a three part J-RPG series that lets you experience the game from the perspective of one of six different characters. Set in the "Old North" (a region of the game's wider world), the player will experience a story about the Enders and their attack on the North while along the way dealing with conflicts of other types. Is the game as fresh and invigorating, though, as the devs say? Hmmmmmm...\n\nWhile I applaud the effort in making a game with different perspectives as this group has, in my experiences with it thus far, I can say that while the Prologue chapter and a couple bits and pieces along the way do differ, overall the story is linear enough that I didn't feel as if it mattered quite as much who I played the game as. But, that said, it's still a neat mechanic and maybe they will find a way to better flesh this out in the future installments.\n\nWhat is neat, though, is the combat mechanic and the fact that you will have six playable people in the party but can only field three at a time. Just like with any good JRPG, each character offers their own strengths and weaknesses and it might be best to keep certain people around for certain situations while swapping out in others. However, once you really understand the play mechanics, you may still find yourself favoring a certain party structure (e.g. the character with the healing magic is almost invaluable in many cases), so to what degree it helps is up to you. Nonetheless, the combat flows very well, the skills of both the enemies and player characters are fun and engaging, and overall it's a very strong component of the game.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, I found that I enjoyed the tale quite a bit. One regret I had though is that a lot of themes are examined, but many are glossed over and the game moves on, leaving you, the player, to merely think about them. Most of the characters you have to play as are nobles or minor nobles of the class system, and so the game teases at thoughts on division of the classes, the divine right of kings (basically), and things of that nature, but it really doesn't go too far with them. Maybe that's good, as preachiness isn't needed, but on the other hand, sometimes you find yourself wanting a little more. Also, you do make moral choices in a couple spots that could have an impact on the story, but the impact feels a bit less so currently than it could be (so don't expect far-reaching things quite like in The Witcher series, for example).\n\nAll that said, although the game is a bit on the shorter side in some ways, it tells a good story and offers fun gameplay, and so I feel confident in recommending it to people looking for a nice, engaging JRPG that tells a nice story.\n\nOn a scale from 0 to 10, with 5 representing an "average" score, I give this game:\n\n---------------------\nGOOD...... 7 / 10\n---------------------","September 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

All this game has to offer are its aesthetics & super short story. Also, most of the choices you make in this game do not have a long-term effect in the game yet which will make some people (especially hardcore RPG fans) left dissapointed.\n\nIf you are looking for an RPG that can be completed in just a few hours because you are too busy in real life and if you are a completionist who are looking for easy 100% steam achievements, this game is for you.\n\nIf you want to get into more details about this game, continue to read, which you should.\n\nThere are 2 things that I found after I completed this game with every single character :\n1. If I want to recommend you which character to play :\nReynard (he has the highest amount of moral choices in the playthrough. he's probably the one with the real character development)\nIsaac (he has the best background story & plot twists)\nCammile (interesting ending, play as her if you wanna know about what is going on in the game)\nAria (interesting whole story, play as her if you wanna know more about the potential villains in the game)\n\nI find Lucienne & Ylianne story as the most unexciting, uninteresting ones.\n\n2. The harsh truth about this game is there is almost no reason for you to replay the game with another character unless you are a completionist like me. Even if you want to know the story, you can simply ask someone else who have completed the character's story that you are curious with. Besides that, the only thing that makes this game a bit longer is because you are forced to re-visit the same place over and over again.\n\nPros :\n- Interesting story and lore.\n- Distinct character personalities makes dialogues more interesting & enjoyable.\n- Beautiful hand-drawn environment combined with plenty of great soundtracks.\n- The whole party level up at the same time including the characters who do not participate in battles.\n- The game encourages you to explore each map to find honour medals, weapons, and some items.\n- No random battle. You can avoid all monsters if you want to.\n\nNeutrals :\n- Typical old school JRPG turn based combat system. Nothing special except for the stamina system. Some might enjoy it, some might find it pretty boring.\n- 30 max level. Some may think it is too low, but some may not because the game itself is pretty short. I don't see any reason for the developer to increase the level cap above level 30 for a game with short playthrough.\n\nCons :\n- Even though the developer has added a few mechanics to add more depth in the combat (stamina, skill builds, whole party level up, 3 upgradeable weapons for each character), combat still feels unexciting that I wanted to skip most of the encounter. But sadly, I couldn't, or I'm gonna get wrecked at the last chapters because of the next con below.\n- Combat difficulty spikes at late game.\n- For an RPG, the amount of places you can visit is lacking in this game. You will be forced to visit the same places over and over again just to prolong the length of the game. This makes your adventure a bit boring and less exciting.\n- Choices you make do not matter on this episode, but probably they will matter on the next episode. I can see that maybe your choices you make now will determine your characters personality & backstory in the next episode. Celestian Tales is a trilogy after all.\n- For an RPG, I personally think the game length is super short. I suggest the sequel to be at least twice longer than this.","August 29, 2015","false","37.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

With one playthrough consists around 6 hours of gameplay, it sounds like it's a good incentive to playthrough other characters... Except the differences with playing each of them is bare minimum, just some small cutscenes. The battle does have a nice system on the paper, but they don't use the most of it. They don't go full all out for the enemies' strategy. They'll simply just use an attack with status effect or buff themselves. Nothing more.\n\nRegarding the story, I'd lie if I say I didn't enjoy it one bit, and does present a brutal and simplistic world with simplistic people around it with us playing (lyingly) not special party members. Gritty. Still, the interaction is mostly wasted with philosophy sharing. Their time for talking weighs more than doing anything. Maybe it's thanks to our Yli that needs some short crash courses about the world's things.\n\nI do can say the sprites are well animated and nice to look at, and at a glance, the backgrounds are pleasant to, until you know that they exist to disorient your perception of depth. Things are too flat to judge the depth for navigation.\n\nPlus, near the release, the game is riddled with glitches. And they claim it this is a full release? I do give the developers a credit to act fast for fixing the game, but, it's like us, the first buyers, are just testers. Not much different than early access, except the content does tell you it's complete.\n\nI can say if you play this game, it's pleasant, but it doesn't provide you anything extraordinary nor it has anything special to brag. If you don't play this game, you don't lose anything.","August 14, 2015","false","9.4"," 40 of 59 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","40","59","0","0"

I think?) CT:ON is fairly good. The story is intriguing, the characters are well-written and developed versions of typical fantasy tropes, the combat system is turn-based (which after all the action RPGs coming out lately is a nice change), and unlike most fantasy games, the party is made up of more women than men (4:2). The music is good, if a little repetitive in the field (though I think I liked every event score), and ultimately I enjoyed it.\n\nThere are a few flaws, though. For one, given that to unlock all the achievements (and likely the different story paths) you have to play the game 6 times is a little annoying, especially since it seems the deviation is really only about 5 scenes (prologue, 3 scenes within the game, epilogue). So I imagine it'll get boring fairly fast and it feels like a way to artificially add time to the game, when the game play itself could probably be finished in 5-6 hours (especially if you're like me and you spent your first playthrough running around over-leveling and making sure you do everything). Also, when you get to the epilogue, the English gets a little messy... like missing words and sentence fragments (possibly for stylistic effect that's just gone wrong). Finally, when you finally do get the world map open, it frustrated me a little to see all the areas I couldn't visit in this game.\n\nBasically, I'll probably run through the game 2-3 more times, with the characters I liked the most, but I don't expect the kind of replay they really must have wanted with the 6 different stories.","December 13, 2015","true","13.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

I have only played through one of the six characters thus far. So please take that into consideration when reading my review. I really enjoyed this game while playing it. I loved the combat, story, art syle, and characters. (Except Aria xD) I was really into this game so I played a lot. It progresses very quickly. Surprisingly after a few hours it was over. This game is very short. I would say it has about less than 10 hours of gameplay if you are not messing around. However, they intended that you play through multiple times as different characters. I was a bit let down since there is a level cap at 30 which is very easy to obtain. There are only a few weapons and armor available. Also, the videos trailers on steam portray this game being very moral decision involved. I found that there were only very few instances where it seemed to be the case, and felt like they really didn't impact the world very drastically. In conclusion, I really enjoyed the mechanics to the game and the story line, but i felt as though this game was way too short. I reccommend this game if you like short stories with good game play. But if you are a hardcore RPG gamer that likes to have a long story, really get into maxing characters levels, gathering the best armor and weapons, having a huge world to roam and explore, and finding hidden content, this game might not be for you.","August 11, 2015","false","12.1"," 56 of 88 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","56","88","4","6"

If there's an overworld, towns, lots of monsters to fight, and levels to gain, then I'm usually satisfied. This is what I consider to be my "comfort" genre. Even with that in mind, I find myself not recommending Celestian Tales: Old North. Why is that exactly? This is an ambitious JRPG with multiple protagonists, decisions to make, and a number of other interesting ideas; surely it should be considered a cut above the mundane. Unfortunately, all this game really has to offer is promises. Its intriguing elements aren't fleshed out enough to satisfy fans of the genre.\n\nOne of the first aspects that is liable to catch your interest is the choice of main characters. There are six to choose from, all with their own introductory sequences. There are also a handful of character-specific cut-scenes. For my play-through, I decided on Cammille. During the quest, she frequently came across as the most level-headed person in various situations. I also thought that she was one of the only likeable characters. Part of what makes ambition a double-edged sword is that the player develops their own ideas on how the story should progress. A few decisions in this game are made, and I imagine they will have serious ramifications in the sequel, but I'd also like to cut a little dead weight.\n\nAira. Aira, Aira, Aria. For her it's always Deus this and Deus that. Yes, I get it, her beliefs are strong. I just can't shake the feeling that one day, 10 years from now, I'll want to backhand her. Reynard, whose personality can be summarized by the words "giant axe", looks like a donkey when he talks. Then there's Ylianne... blech. Yli talks in third-person because Yli is absolutely insufferable. When she's not playing up the "sweet and innocent" angle, she's crying about how terrible humans can be. Maybe in 10 or 20 years I can send Yli back to the dinky Elven forest she came from, and then burn that over-sized toothpick-stand to the ground.\n\nThese are the sort of consequences that are rarely explored in RPGs. Kingdoms rise and fall, worlds are driven to the brink of ruin, but you're hardly ever given a reason or even an excuse, to bring misery to your closet allies. Admittedly, I'm asking for a little too much, but I guess what I'm really trying to say is that there are too many protagonists. Having six party-members is fine. The problem is that in order to get the full-story, you're obligated to play through the game as everyone. The Romancing SaGa franchise toyed around with this idea, but they were still reasonably large and involving RPGs. A play-through of Celestian Tales: Old North is going to take around 5 hours. Not many people are going to replay a mostly un-changed adventure 5 more times just for a few extra cut-scenes, even if it is really short.\n\nThere are a few incidents in Old North where you decide the fates of others as well as yourself, but you won't know the results until the next game. Now I'm perfectly alright with this aspect, to a certain extent. Less significant decisions should have its results known to the player before the current game's end. When I choose to allow apprehended bandits a trial, instead of executing them outright, I should get to know how the trial went. Unfortunately, I have to wait for the next game to find out that important piece of information.\n\nIt's doubly frustrating, because the next game is supposed to take place at least a few years after the events of the first. Those bandits could very well have escaped from prison, formed a small army, razed a nearby town, became farmers, settled down, and started raising children. This news would eventually be relayed to Cammille (or whoever the main character is) and... there's nothing that can really be done about it. Basically, there's too much of a time-skip for decisions to continue to hold weight. I might have also angered one or two nobles, but if they aren't attempting their revenge in a year or less, they'll probably forget or stop caring.\n\nEven with a scant 5 hours, Old North still manages to wear itself thin. There are not that many enemy-types, the dungeons aren't numerous or expansive, and there's even a some padding. Near the end of the game there's a part where you have to backtrack. This adds very little to the storyline, and there's no pay-off in the form of an additional dungeon or a boss-battle. It's more like "Here, run this errand because it'll take up a few minutes of your time". There aren't any side-quests, aside from a bonus boss if you find all of the hidden medals.\n\nThis is another reason why ambition can sometimes come at the expense of the game. The in-battle sprites are nicely animated, but I would have traded them all away for different kinds of enemies, and some more areas to explore. The battle-system is pretty solid, as it's based around managing stamina for various skills and spells. The problem is that there isn't enough variety to every encounter. The bosses don't necessitate tactics. I cruised through all of them in just a few rounds. The only time my party-members were defeated, was due to some oddly high-damaging attacks in end-game random battles.\n\nI played a lot of RPGs with poor or even nonexistent storylines, but they still felt like complete games. With Old North, I get a few portions that don't really add up to enough. I have to settle for the expectation that the next two games in the trilogy will deliver a complete adventure. Honestly, I would have preferred a 15 or even a 10 hour RPG, with just one or two main characters (instead of 6). All that really needed to be done was offer some decision-making with consequences that occur in a reasonable time-frame. The character-specific scenes could still be implemented, only without relying on the player doing 6 play-throughs. More variety in the enemies as well as dungeons would have been welcome as well. Even with all of those changes, there would still be plenty to look forward to in the following games. As it stands, my advice is to wait and see. Right now it looks like Celestian Tales is trying to do too much with too little.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 29, 2015","false","8.3"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","1"

Too simple. Should be called Celestian Tales Chapter 1. At $10 you are paying the right price for quality art and music, and some good, but under expressed ideas. The story itself is short - when the game ended I thought it was the end of a prolog. I think that when the developer is done with all of the games the Celestian Tales title will be a play worth RPG and a great value at a higher price.\n\nYou can replay the game as all 6 characters, but a majority of the content is the same, and not so interesting to be worth playing again.\nGrinding is necessary a few hours into the game as the difficulty of enemies spikes wildly and without warning between zones.\nThe few moral choices that you make have a minimal impact on the game.

I had seen this game come up on my suggested list when it first came out but didn't have the time to play through it so I held off.  Boy am I glad I finally bought it.  I have now played through it twice at the time of this review and will most likely play through all six times.\n\nWhat makes this game replayable?  A unique feature of this game is that you get to select from 1 of 6 characters to lead the party of three through the game.  You get a unique character intro, at least one small perspective view of the story somewhere in the middle, and a unique ending to the character to give you more of the story from their perspective of the events going on in the world.  This gives you a little more of the story for about 4-6 hours worth of work playing through the game (again).\n\n(+)Good quick story, if that is what you are looking for.\n(+)Great music track\n(+)Good replayability through the leader system\n(+)Unique standard RPG characters with their own weapons and abilities\n(+)Pleasing graphic style and character art\n\n(=)Standard JRPG\n(=)Nothing new brought to the genre\n(=)Ending leaves the player wanting more from Old North and beyond (give us a series!)\n\n(-)Game length could be a turn off or having to replay the same story 6 times to get the whole story\n(-)Level 30 cap on characters\n(-)Only three levels to weapon system\n(-)Limited challenge from battle system\n\nIn closing if you are looking for a decent story with some great JRPG elements this is a game worth playing through.  If some of the even or negative comments sound like something that would steer you away from the game, then this might not be the game for you.  I would still encourage anyone to play Celestian Tales: Old North because it has a classic charm to it reminding me of early Final Fantasy or Suikoden games.  It is not these games, but the developers have set the basics that could make this game a classic if developed further through future games.","January 3","true","36.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I loved it. It did feel short at 12 hours, but it does have multiple playthoughs with different main characters so we'll see how much that changes things. The plot was very character driven and you begin to love the characters a lot. The overall plot is still ongoing when this game ends, but the plot twists make it work for me. It does have a lot of loose ends which I imagine will be filled in as they finish parts 2 and 3 (hopefully sooner rather than later).\n\nThe music is lovely; at times I would just let it roll instead of moving on with the game.\n\nI do wish you could run faster at times, like in the towns or that there were more reasons for exploring because I really liked the look of the areas. Still, what I did find I did like. And I'll definitely be playing through again with the other characters so it's worth playing through at least twice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhosTagE/recommended/315860/","GhosTagE","Sovereign","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhosTagE/","256 products in account","Impression: Not bad, but get it at a discount. ~10 hours of gameplay (one playthrough) - controller is advised.\n\nAbout me:\nI enjoy a lot of different games, singleplayer and multiplayer. I'm not the kind of person who goes out and does every quest while earning every achievement. I rarely deviate from the main quest and I don't do multiple playthroughs without a reason. I play a lot of visual novels though, and try to complete every heroine arc in those because each playthrough is almost nothing like the others.\n\nWhy I bought the game:\nI thought the art looked cool and the music was nice. The gameplay did not look too complicated either.\n\nGood thoughts on the game:\nCelestian Tales: Old North was pretty entertaining. There are these artifacts you can find throughout your journey which attribute to a secret encounter later if you find them all. You can also find up to 3 weapons for each squire. The combat difficulty was pretty well-scaled as well. I have finished only one playthrough (Reed) and I thought the music combined with Reed's perspective turned out to be a pretty enjoyable story. It took me about 10 hours to complete, including grinding to max level and for items.\n\nBad thoughts on the game:\nThere's only a couple of bad things I can think of. One was the random spazzing out of NPCs. It completely broke any sense of immersion that I had when I saw these people just freaking out everywhere. This should not make it into the final product. The other is the poor layout of the towns. When poor layout is paired with an art style that makes it hard to tell which floor belongs to what, without a map this becomes really hard to navigate. By the end I was still getting lost.\n\nImprovements that could be made:\nWhile I am fully aware that this is supposed to be a series of games, there is a lot shown and far too little I am able to access. As you play, some areas are opened up for exploration. This is not the case for all areas though. There are many locations I had hoped to visit at least once because they are on the map, but none of them ever became available to me. I would like to see the ability to interact with places that I am shown, or otherwise I should not be lead to believe that I will get there in this title.\nI did mention earlier that I don't do every single quest, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy the occasional side quest. There are 0 side quests in this game though, making all of the NPCs feel a little boring and a lot of the areas unused.\nAs the story progresses, you move to various areas and some merchants follow you so that the same 3 shops are always available to you. This is fine, but for reasons I won't spoil everyone packs up and leaves at certain parts of the story. This means that if for any reason you are still in these areas (farming for items, exploring, whatever) you need to travel really far away to access any of these shops. It also becomes very annoying to have to pass through these empty areas on foot to get to the other side.\nI think a combat tutorial would have been nice for those who aren't accustomed to JRPGs. For anyone interested, each person has Stamina and Health. Stamina is consumed when using a skill and is replenished when attacking (+1) or defending (+2). Each turn you can either attack, use a skill, use an item (consumable items), or defend. The player's party may consist of 3 people (the character you choose +2) and the opposing party may consist of 1-6 people.\nI think there should be scenarios where the player's party could have more than 3 people. I will be honest - I only used Isaac, Lucienne, and Aria the entire game. I never even considered using anyone else. Because they weren't useful to me, I have no feelings for these characters.\nAllow custom controller mapping - and while you're at it, allow me to map things to my mouse as well. Include multiple buttons for the same action.\nImplement a backlog system that allows the reader to see previous dialogue. In visual novels it's as simple as scrolling up if you accidentally advance too soon.\nAllow the skipping of previously-seen cutscenes. That last fight was so painful because of the long scene before it.\nIntroduce some sort of New Game+ with the above bullet. This would give some incentive to actually see the other characters' perspectives if they're going to have the same story.\nRemove that saving shrine. I don't see a reason for it to be there.\n\nThat's all for now. I'm looking forward to the next installment.","September 8, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I love how you can select the character you want to role play. After selecting one character, the rest of your game would be in that character's perpective. Really nice feature and offers great replayability. Sprites are well animated, but somehow the battle animation is a bit lame. Sprite animation for battle should be more intense. When you swing a sword, it should be animated like it is a really strong swing that will make the enemy bleed. Music was great, I enjoyed it. A footstep sound would be a nice touch. Artwork are great too! but there are some that needed more work. I really recommend this game if you like titles like Suikoden 2 and such.

There's quite a few loose ends storywise and the climax is a huge wtf moment and even after the final boss theres no resolving at all. In addition there is way less moral choice in this game than i've imagined. it boiled down to 3 with 2 options.\n\n\nNow some general likes and dislikes:\nLikes:\nGorgeous Sprites\nLovely Artstyle\nA solid Combat System\nDislikes:\nSometimes the world seems badly put together with textures not transitioning well from one to another (Castle Walls in Starting town, Indoors in general)\nAlmost no guidance in terms of where to go especially when the game tells you to go to the village in the west and has you leave through the right side of town and then travel northeast.\n\n\nThe length of the game is fine for this price point i feel. My Savegame just before the final boss clocks in at 5:06 hours. Given how little deviation there is even with having 6 characters to choose from i dont see much replay value.\n\nFor some points on what buggered me loose end wise heres my opinion in a spoiler block:\n\nQuite early you enter a city where one of the characters asks you not to go into because you yould meet their father. this is never adressed again and remains unresolved. You're never able to enter.\nOne Area of the starting city is blocked from the start and cannot be entered the whole game\nThe creator of one of the bosses escapes (Mad scientist trope type btw) This is never adressed again\nOne Mentor type character is exiled which is fine but its never brought up again afterwards.\nThe ♥♥♥♥ with that ending o_o\n\nThis game is full of loose ends and could've gone so much farther.\nIf such storyholes bother you like they do me do not get this game. It provides little to no closure on anything.\n\nIf you want a solid JRPG with enjoyable combat and dont care much about loose ends or wtf endings feel free to get the game!\n\nEDIT(August 15th): I was notified that i've overlooked that this is a trilogy which explains the issues of the loose ends. it does hoewever not explain the 'ending' of this first part then it still comes out of nowhere without context and even knowing its part 1 of 3 it leaves a bitter taste. I'm goign to leave my former assesment then for historical purpose but i am going to change it to this then:\n\nI'm still not recommending buying this game YET if loose ends annoy you, rather wait for the other two parts and thus the conclusion fo the game and buy the trilogy hopefully in a bundle then. if those still not bother you then go and buy this","August 13, 2015","false","8.8"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","2"

And for what it costs, it's not that bad. But I can't recommend it, at least not until they fix some glaring issues.\n\n\nI'll start with the pros.\n\n1 ) The character art and sprites are very well done.\n\n2 ) I liked the stamina mechanic, and the inclusion of aggro into an otherwise old fashioned combat system.\n\n3 ) The music is what you'd expect for this kind of thing.\n\n4 ) I liked the range of character skills, and the weapon specialization system.\n\n5 ) I liked that combat is not random, and is avoidable.\n\n6 ) I liked that experience applies to your entire group, not just the characters currently in your party.\n\n\nAnd now for the cons.\n\n1 ) The story, which is supposedly the most important part of this game, is non-sensical. Characters often behave in ways that completely contradict previous scenes. The ending is particularly bad because of this.\n\n2 ) The story is so bad it needs multiple spots. The promised over-arching theme: war between different nations, is completely absent from the game. You instead spend the entire time fighting incredibly generic blue viking monsters called, i'm not kidding, 'World Enders'. Yay.\n\n3 ) Many plot points are never given any background whatsoever, seemingly important characters come and go, and the main villain looks likes he belongs in a TMNT episode.\n\n4 ) The grammar is terrible. FF Tactics got a lot of flack for poorly translated prose back in the day, so much so that when they re-released it on the PSP they rewrote it (and it was good). This game makes FFT's prose look like shakespeare. I understand that the writers of this game probably don't speak english as a first language, and that's fine, but they could at least hire a copy editor or something. Spelling mistakes are rampant, the way characters talk to each other reads like bad fan-fiction, and there is literally no reason to ever talk to an npc.\n\n5 ) As others have mentioned, the game environment is not done well. The background sprites, especially in cities, completely lack depth, making it very difficult to move around at times. A few shadows here and there is all it would have taken to fix this.\n\n6 ) Travelling it tedious. Why not just have a fast-travel option to revisit places you've already been? Literally no one likes to run through multiple zones they've already gone through just to get to one place.\n\n7 ) The game's trailer promises that your decisions have weight, but you only get to make a decision 2-3 times throughout the entire game, with no discernible difference in outcome.\n\n8 ) The ability to pick a 'main' to start the game out with is a neat idea but not executed well enough. The prologue chapter is too short, and the minor differences past that do not warrant replaying the game.\n\n9 ) Despite the fact that I said I liked the combat system, you often rarely need to use the full extent of your abilities. Enemies don't do much, there isn't a wide variety of them, and most of the time you can get by just spamming attack until everything dies.\n\n10 ) On that note, the difficulty often varies wildly, spiking without warning. One minute you're fine, the next common mobs can 2 shot you. You rarely ever see mobs with new abilities or buffs, they just all of a sudden have a ♥♥♥♥ ton more life and hit a lot harder, which just makes the increased difficulty annoying and not necessarily challenging.\n\n11 ) Because of the lack of variety in combat, there's never a reason to switch out your party members, other than to perhaps alleviate your boredom for a few minutes. I never even used 2 of my characters, and I don't see why I'd ever want to.\n\n12 ) Opening sequence animation is pretty cheap, but I guess that's not really a big deal considering the game is also cheap.\n\n13 ) Who closes their eyes when they're happy? What the hell is that? Can you stop? Jesus, maybe this kawaii ♥♥♥♥ isn't for rme.\n\n14 ) Chapter 5 is a complete waste of time, nothing important or of interest happens, and it feels like it was just included to pad out the play time. You could completley cut it and I don't think anyone would notice.\n\n\nI might be coming off as too harsh, but tough love and all that. I wanted to like this game. I am aware that this is supposedly part 1 of a trilogy, so the issues can be addressed . But this is steam, so there's no reason why they can't release a patch to address the issues that have been reported with this game, as it currently is, especially if they want people to actually purchase parts 2 and 3.\n\nThe simplest fixes that would go the furthest, at least for me, would be to:\n\n1 ) Smooth out the difficulty (or even just scale enemy difficulty to your level)\n\n2 ) Fix the stilted english, even if it means re-writing the entire damn game. At the very least, fix the typos and mistakes.\n\n3 ) Add some depth to the most problematic environments (cities).\n\n4 ) Fast travel\n\n\nAnyway, if all you're expecting is a generic, mediocre rpg, you'll be fine. I have certainly played worse rpgs on steam that have gotten higher ratings. But if you're looking for something on the level of say, suikoden, don't waste your time.","August 20, 2015","false","8.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","1"

Combat has a unique element to it however, as abilities/skills cost stamina, stamina which replenishes due to number of factors and choices you make during the battle.\n\nIt offers one of the best aesthetics in an JRPG game that i’ve came across in a long time, indors and outdors. The music is absolutely fantastic, and is beautifully orchestrated all throughout the game. It really blends in well and sets the tone for the game.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous and overall desing of towns, forests, battlefields and even world map is top notch. The music and artwork of Celestian Tales: Old North is beyond most Indie JRPG standards and by some margin.\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","September 21, 2015","true","11.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I was in no particular hurry and made plenty of mistakes, and it took me just over 6 hours to complete. Considering this is going to be a 3 part story that in total will still only be a relatively short RPG, I think it's over-priced. I bought it on sale from Humble Store and it was still a little expensive for a relatively straight-forward 6 hours.\n\nThat said, it's fun. The graphics are charming, the combat is almost the standard JRPG fare, but with enough of a twist to keep it intersting, and the story is refreshingly not so epic. I think the backgrounds of the different characters are varied and interesting but they don't delve very deeply into them during the game. The description makes it sound like you have tremendous control over the flow and outcomes of the story, but that's not true at all. You get a couple of choices that make almost no difference, so think of this as a fully linear game.\n\nI recommend picking this up if it's on sale for more than 50% off.","January 30","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some have a grat story, some have great gameplay, others look beatiful, and I buy them, and try them, and soon forget. Since 2010, only 3 times I have bought a game and played it from start to finish without playing anything in between: Bastion. The Banner Saga. And now, Celestian Tales: The Old North. They show us the amazing potential of these smaller companies, how good and beatiful can something made with love be.\n\nOld North is a traditional turn-based RPG, with leveling up, equipment customization and all these thing a RPG has. It's not long, but each of the 6 main characters (one of which must be chosen at start) has his or her own story, leading to a lot o replayability. It's a beautifully made 2D game, the soundtrack is quite good, all the characters are very well portrayed, with complex and believable personalities and the story is absolutely amazing. It looks like an interesting cross between The Banner Saga, Game of Thrones and Suikoden 2, so just buy it, you won't regret.","December 25, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Every character is much more complex than he or she first appears, and no individual has the full picture. With each playthrough, characters that I’d dismissed as one-dimensional suddenly became sympathetic, and their perspectives lent new emotion to scenes I’d seen before. One playthrough just isn’t enough to judge the game.\n\nEach run, assuming you take on the secret boss and don’t grind, takes about 5-6 hours or so. That “don’t grind” bit is really important; the combat becomes considerably more interesting, since you're forced to be resourceful and creative instead of steamrolling everything.\n\nEvery time you clear the game, it creates a clear game save file, which will be imported into Part 2 with your choices. Speaking of choices, some of them are not available for certain characters. Depending on their history and psychological profile, some are only going to be able to take one of the choices available to other characters. It seems to me this creates a real sense of foreboding: There’s just no way this ends well for everyone. It’s pretty clear that as difficult as the events of this game were for some of the characters, Part 1 was the idylls of their youths; you get the distinct feeling that by Part 2, when they’re all likely to be knee-deep in intrigue and deception, they’re going to look back at these simpler days with a sense of longing.\n\nAll this points toward a game series with a great deal of replayability; it’s pretty clear that you’ll have to take all six characters through the three games to get the full experience. Definitely recommended.","October 30, 2015","true","41.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't quite decide if I should vote "yes" or "no".\n\nIt has many nice aspects, like the artwork, animations and interesting story dialogues. I really liked the resolve of the major event (a war) storywise, and it generaly gave me a very good feeling, reminding me of why I am a big fan of the Suikoden-Series. (Is it just me, or does the running animation seem almost copied from the Suikoden artstyle?)\n\nThat being said: It is super-short.\nAs soon as you think, that the "main plot" would be starting (in most other full-priced games of this genre), you will see the credits rolling. The game proposes replaying the game for the "different perspective" of another character. But as much as I see it, the differences will only be a slight sub-plot which runs in parallel and is shown between different situations of the main event. I can't really say that I am too eager to rinse & repeat through it with the other characters.\n\nConclusion: It is a nice game, done with some artistical love.  If you want a short but involving story in Suikoden-Style, you really won't regret it.\nBUT 13$ is way overpriced from my point of view. Get it when it's 50% off or something. I'd say 5-7$ (per chapter, as the Devs seem to plan a trilogie with it) would be a more appropriate price.","November 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Check out my video review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_QwTmo6lDmk\n\n\nVideo Transcript:\n\nHello viewers!  My name is Endeavor, and I'm here to present the first episode of A Bird's Eye View for 2016.  To kick off another year of reviews, I'm taking a look at the turn-based RPG Celestian Tales: Old North.  Developed by Ekuator Games and published by Digital Tribe, this game was released on August 9th, 2015.\n\nCelestian Tales: Old North is the first of a trilogy of games.  It follows six squires on their path to knighthood.  They are sent to a noble lord to receive instruction.  The story truly takes off when war breaks out and the protagonists are thrust into the conflict.\n\nEach of the six squires has their own background and personal story that is told throughout the game.  The player chooses one squire to act as the main character, which determines the story.  Throughout the tale, hints are dropped about the other character's backgrounds, engendering a need to play through the game multiple times in order to see the other perspectives.\n\nThe biggest selling points of the game are the story and choices presented to the player.  In every situation where a moral choice was presented, there wasn't an option that was clearly the “correct” answer.  Each choice involves ideals of duty, honor, and morality that complicate the issue at hand.  Unfortunately, due to the story arc spanning three games, none of the repercussions of those choices come up in this chapter.   This means we don't know how big the story payoffs are going to be.\n\nThe art of Celestian Tales is another of the game's strengths.  Vibrant hand-painted scenes and backgrounds draw the player in, and the character sprites animate very smoothly.  Adding to the atmosphere is high-quality music, which blends seamlessly with the visuals to invoke a storybook aesthetic.\n\nMechanically, Celestian Tales will feel very familiar to fans of classic Final Fantasy games.  This is especially true of the game's combat, although there are enough twists to make an old idea feel fresh.  Characters and enemies face each other in a line and attack in turns.  Special attacks and techniques are used by spending Stamina, and Stamina is gained by using a normal attack or defending.  Health and Stamina reset at the end of combat, so there isn't any between-battle maintenance to worry about.\n\nWhile there are six characters, only three of them participate in combat at once.  When a character is knocked out, they receive the wounded status: a stacking penalty to the character's maximum hit-points.  When that happens, the best practice is to swap that character out with one of the reserve heroes until a trip to town can be made.  Unfortunately, this strategy doesn't work when the main character is wounded, as he or she is required to be in the forward party at all times.  This is my biggest complaint with the gameplay.  While this mechanic makes sense on paper, in practice it's an artificial restriction as all characters are involved in the dialogue and story regardless of what position they take in combat.\n\nEkuator Games is currently working on DLC for Celestian Tales.  According to their Kickstarter, development has begun on the second chapter: Realms Beyond.  No word has yet been released regarding how much these expansions and chapters will cost.\n\nWith a retail price of $12.99, I give Celestian Tales a strong recommendation.  Pick it up if you're a fan of classic turn-based role-playing games.  This game is available on Steam or Good Old Games for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\n\nThat concludes my review for Celestian Tales: Old North.  Thanks for watching!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slkvc/recommended/315860/","Slkvc","KorkyPorky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slkvc/","84 products in account","As a Suikoden fan, I just had to buy this when someone mentioned by name that there's similarity between the 2.\n\nThe GOOD and BAD\n1. Design. Similar to Suikoden, 2D models of characters and cities just brings back memory. World map is kind of the same too. I hope it's more similar to Suikoden II, but the whole thing feels more like a HD version of the first Genso Suikoden.\n\n2. Story.\n### THE UPDATED VERSION ###\nI've completed both Aria and Reed. Story is definitely good, but to play through 6 times... That is to me, grinding for a complete storyline. Furthermore these 6 characters will be together almost all the time, hence you're looking at the same story over and over again.\n\nDecision making is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and mean nothing in this game. The way I see it, this is probably like an episode 1 in a Telltale game, whereby your decision will probably affect what's coming out next. Thing is, I totally lost any interest for this game after running through 2 storylines.\n\n## OLD VERSION ###\nSo far I've just reached Chapter 4, story wise is still very linear, nothing like Suikoden. "Situations are presented to the player throughout the game that force players to face moral questions and beliefs." They make you think, not choose. Sucks for me. The only decisions I've made so far is whether I want to end the day or not lmao. This is more of a story-telling game I would say, in different main character's perspective. Most likely you'll have to play through it 6 TIMES to find out though. So far I'm still on my first run, so I'm not sure if I'm gonna do that.\n\n3. Combat. I like the combat system. It's the typical turn-based battle. I won't explain more into this but 2 things stand out for me. I like how health is been restored after each battle, which means less after-battle-portion-eating for me. There's also aggro when you perform actions, something new in a turn-based battle. [UPDATE] There's no grinding. If you have difficulty at later stage it's because you suck. Some characters work better together. Basically like most games you need a heal, a tank, and a DPS.\n\n4. Music. No complains, but nothing explicitly great like Suikoden II Reminiscence. ;)\n\n5. Gameplay. Like point 2, everything is painfully linear. Nothing else I can do besides progressing the storyline.\n\nThe Conclusion### THE UPDATED VERSION ###\nGood story-telling. Better off going youtube to watch someone finish it than buying and playing this yourself. Give it a miss. I give it maybe a 3/10.\n\n## OLD VERSION ###\nAll in all it's something refreshing to play. Hopefully there's more things to do in later chapter. As of now I give this kind of a 6-7/10 for good story-telling, with design and battle system that brings back memory. If this linear way of doing things run throughout the game it deserves only a 5 in my book. Something you can consider playing if you just missed Suikoden too much. This at least satisfy some thirst for a good story-telling experience.","August 11, 2015","false","13.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

The problem is that although it does a pretty good job on the graphics and battle system it hasn't been able to write a story which makes sense.\n\nI understand that the developers wish to create a trilogy. That's why every single plot point goes nowhere at all and why there's so much of the map that you never ever visit. All it makes you feel like is that you're playing a demo. A four hour demonstration of a future game that isn't out yet.\n\nThis isn't helped by areas of the "main" city being cut off, telling you to come back later. Nor is it helped by the strong focus on the Soldier's story. I'm very glad I played her first because the game fitted around her in a way it doesn't fit around the other characters.\nAt first I felt impressed that the character I had chosen managed to feel like the central character and assumed the other characters would have their own story that somehow also felt natural.  Unfortunately this is not the case and every character plays through the same thing with a few very vaguely different discussions along the way.\n\nI was also very disappointed at a final boss battle that is thrown at you from nowhere and doesn't help to tie up anything that's happened. In fact it makes the final fifth of the game feel genuinely pointless.\n\nI do enjoy the aesthetics of the game. The maps evoke Suikoden or Lufia and they're not unattractive for the most part. However they're flat. Exceptionally flat. There are many areas where you'll find you're bumping up against nothing at all because a roof is in your way of walking behind a house or an invisible wall is there that just looks like a flat piece of ground. I'm not sure this could be fixed and it's quite irritating.\n\nThe enemies you encounter are in the world and you can walk into them which triggers a fight. Any enemy you see outside of a combat sequence is a literal grey blob with angry eyes. I do not know why this is - the sprites for boars, spiders and giant men (which are almost all of your enemies) do exist in the game and you DO see them in the world other times.\n\nAs the game gets closer to the end it starts to feel less finished as well. Post level 20 you do not get any more abilities - I am not saying you need them but after getting them every other level it 'feels' weird - and the grammar of sentences gets noticably worse.\n\nDo not spend your money on this short and uninspiring game.","August 20, 2015","false","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are many areas where you'll find you're bumping up against nothing at all because a roof is in your way of walking behind a house or an invisible wall is there that just looks like a flat piece of ground. I'm not sure this could be fixed and it's quite irritating.\n\nThe enemies you encounter are in the world and you can walk into them which triggers a fight. Any enemy you see outside of a combat sequence is a literal grey blob with angry eyes. I do not know why this is - the sprites for boars, spiders and giant men (which are almost all of your enemies) do exist in the game and you DO see them in the world other times.\n\nAs the game gets closer to the end it starts to feel less finished as well. Post level 20 you do not get any more abilities - I am not saying you need them but after getting them every other level it 'feels' weird - and the grammar of sentences gets noticably worse.\n\nDo not spend your money on this short and uninspiring game.","August 20, 2015","false","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At level 20, reached easily, you maxed out all characters.\nCombat system is simple, almost weak, but it has a few challenging battles (with some trashes) near the end. I think it can be improved a lot, it gets repetitive after a while.\nEquipment are nice, but there are 3 weapons per character? I'm ok but extend my choice a little bit, especially because the 3rd weapon per character is obtained so early on, you'll wear the same gear for half of the game thinking you'll get improvements (and you don't).\n\nWhat's nice? The graphics are well done, even animation, and I know how painful is to work on them with a small team. The combat system has solid basics although fairly incomplete.

My recommended price is 5 dollars or less.\n\nNot entirely sure where to begin. I'm extremely disappointed. I wasn't expecting anything as grand as Suikoden, but when a game promises moral choices that shape the world I don't think it's unreasonable to expect moral choices that shape the world.\n\nI played through as Cammile. There were three moral choices. None of them had any far reaching effect on the game. I know that the devs are supposed to be putting out other parts for the game, but that's not an excuse to put out a lacklaster game in hopes that customers will stick around just to figure out what three choices MIGHT have influenced.\n\nPlus when random interesting things did happen, you don't get any choices. Big things are happing that cause actual moral dilemma? You watch them play out. *SPOILER* I just have to say that taking a ♥♥♥♥ing recipe book that's in a forgein language does not count as a god damn ethical conundrum. I don't care if it's in some crazy dude's lab. I don't care if the recipes are for "evil" things (which the game didn't really explain exactly what kind of recipes were in it. They could have been foreign pastry recipes for all we know).\n\nThe art style is okay. The character portaits are nice, but the background art is meh. Near the end of the game I still got stuck in random objects. Slightly different colored ground in the middle of the layout? You probably can't walk over it. You'd be going along in a town and SURPRISE you can't actually go that way, but you thought you did because that wall that looks like it should be further back is actually right in your path. There's really not a lot of depth, and I dreaded having to go through the first town. Sprites are okay.\n\nI didn't like the chacacters. I hated the elf. I honestly think that the devs only put her in the game so she could go "Oh my goodness! I don't understand your strange human ways! Explain this odd thing to me!", and then you get force fed history, culture, etc that every character that grew up in the game's country knew but wouldn't have any reason to spout off for the player to learn. The rest of them are flat too. Any character development that does happen does so suddenly and without proper explanation as to why they're having these changes of heart.\n\nThe war that your taking part in does have an intersting ending, but what should have been spread out across more time gets thrown at you in a span of like ten minutes, tops.\n\nAlso, soooo many unanswered questions. They introduced quite a few things to pique interest, and I stuck around despite all the things that annoyed me because I wanted to see what would happen. The story had so much promise, but it's so slap-dash and rushed and worse left unfinished that you're just left with disappointment.\n\nAnd the ending? I hated it. I can not stress this enough. I hated the ending. Utter garbage, and it made it worse because I thought *maybe* I'd actually get to make a decision to effect the outcome. Nope. After everything is all said and done *then* you get to make a decision that, you guessed it, doesn't make a damn bit of difference in the game.","October 5, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You have been warned.##\n\n##Introduction##\n\nAlright so I've finished the game after (according to my record) 7 hours of gameplay and I've had some thoughts for a while now about the game and what I've payed for. I'm an old school RPG player with extensive experience in games so I'm hoping I can give a fair judgement of this game with this review.\n\nLet me start by saying, that the game is actually quite short. Some people have stated that it is up to 12 hours long, but I really dont see how they could have played for that long, since I played 7 hours and collected almost everything, i think i was 4-5 items short (achievement items), I'm one of those who basically wants to collect everything in game, as long as it doesnt take forever (there is a limit!).\nYou could in theory complete this game in less than 5 hours and basically see everything there is to see. With ONE character, let me be clear about that, because the game do encourage you to try the game with more than 1 character.\n\n##Trying to be make a list##\n\nI'll just start by stating the obvious stuff:\n\n## Graphics ##\n\nThe game has a pretty art style, atleast if you look at the trailer, but if you look in the details you'll see that it's really sloppy. A lot of the background melts into the actual gamplay, and you often walk right into walls at the start of the game. Later on, you learn what's a wall and what's not, but you still get irritated at "being slowdowned" whenever you touch a wall. I can see why, but it's really annoying. I would'nt hit that wall if it was made more clear.\n\nLater on you realise that the "walking-graphic" and background graphic is really limited and it feels like a cheap version of a JRPG where you cant really move anywhere without hitting a wall, you want freedom, but you get none.  And in that sence this game is really linear. The walls prevent you from walking anywhere than where your supposed to. But this also leads to a really slow and boring experience, because your limited to where you can walk.\n\nYou also recognise a lot of the sprites of the characters, especially if you have played ragnarok online. The Dev's have stated that they have been inspired by ragnarok online but that they have drawn all the sprites themselfs, but I simply can't see their own "touch" to these sprites, it really looks like they've just almost stolen it completely and put it in their own game.\n\n##fighting##\n\nAnyway, lets move on. After you have grumbled a bit about the graphics and start playing the game, you will soon start fighting. There is no real tutorial in the game, nor is there any manual that will help you out if you're wondering about stuff.\nFor example, after I had played for a while i was wondering what "power" does, or what "dexterity" does in this game, since I found some accessories that gave me these stats. I actually inquired about this on the forums, and the devs were fast to respond about the actual meanings of the statistics. Which is really nice, it shows that they care. But the game need this info to be in the game, in the lore book for example, not in the steam forums.\nBut even without that knowledge, the combat in this game is quite simple. They do try to make it hard by making some enemies hit you extremly hard. I'm not kidding here, the enemys hit you 1 time, and you are down to half health.\nYou can ofcourse prevent this with several abilitys, and characters, and this leads down to you selecting your preferble setup. And there is some number chrunching here, but not that much. I actually had to change my setup once.. at the end of the game. But that was it. I've even seen someone state that they didnt even use a single heal in the game, they just powered through the whole game.\n\n## the story ##\n\nThe story if great, that is all. Experience it by yourself. I'm not going to spoil, there is enough of that in the forums.\n\n## other stuff ##\n\nSo alright, I think I've covered most of the stuff, but here is a few things that annoys me.\n\n## Rant to devs ##\n\nTIMESINKS, im not kidding. I sometimes get the feeling that the developers in this game put in timesinks in this game just to make it longer. Just so they could say that the game was 7 hours long, instead of 5. These timesinks are so blatantly obvious it makes me so angry. While i was playing i was talking out loud that "why do you do this? It's stupid!" because it was.\nAs an example: You get a chapter in the game where you're mission is to go to a place and investigate a persons home. You have to walk first to the person who gives you the quest, then through the whole city (as stated earlier, you have no freedom, you can only walk on certain paths, so walking through the whole city takes atleast 1,5 min), walk through a forest of enemys, and once u get to that house you get some boring conversations about nothing, and then you have to walk all the way back.\nYou do not do this only once, you do this atleast 4 more times in the game if not more, but in other circumstances. It's really obvious, and its really annoying. Do not do that again in you're games, its stupid and obvious and really takes away all feeling. Atleast, atleast put an event when you finally reach the place, not just conversation where you have to walk up to the person and talk and they say something, and say the same thing when u click again. At least put an effort and make an event or boss fight, or bandits, or.. whatever! Don't be so lazy, that you dont even put anything there, but the "idea" that this is a good time to visit other places (without hinting about it). You walked all the way there, to do what?\n\nurrrgh. Anyway. This game is what you pay for. It would probably do better as a novel than a game in my honest opinion, cause the writing is alright. The game, no not so much.\n\n\n\n\n","August 13, 2015","false","7.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The artwork is forgivable considering that it's indie and the music is nice as well.\n\nThe reason why I vote this down is because of the price--you don't get much value with the price you pay. You can finish the whole game in about 7-10 hours with 1 character. Moreover, certain characters (e.g. Reed) don't really get to make a lot of decisions. I played the game with Reed as my first character, and I was really really disappointed because the only time I was allowed to make decisions was at the end.\n\nNaturally I played another character, and I did get more chances to make decisions. However, those decisions won't impact the story at all, you'll just get a different cutscene and that's pretty much it.\n\nGo wait for a Steam Sale and buy something else worth buying for the same price.

The graphic and overall visual look is really good. There could have been more varied enemy types but it's ok. Character design and animations fine as well, for an indie game it's rather more than I had expected.\nMusic and sound effects are nice, nothing feels out of place.\n\nOn the other hand though...what bugged me the most about the game is the characters, their behaviour and "character developement" if it can so be called. Same goes for the story, which feels kind of shallow, there isn't that much to talk about, and the plot twists are unexpected because things turn up you can't possibly know, so not the good kind of plot twists (except one very obvious).\nThere are 6 playable characters in total, because nonsensical reasons you can only have 3 fight, the actual reason probably being it had made the game too easy. The biggest problem is, that the characters don't add replay value, not to me. Differences in dialogues and "cut scenes" aren't that notable. Almost every character has despicable traits he/she doesn't get rid off, or only partially gets rid off. This may just be my personal taste, but I don't like to play characters that put religion above all else, or feeling okay with treating the less fortunate like they're my possession.\nI could go on.\n\nOn top of that there are some bugs/glitches and plot holes. Bugs/glitches like characters having their top level skills when starting a new game or graphics popping up behind the character when they should be in front, or vice versa (i.e. walking in front of a house's corner, but said corner suddenly popping up over the character leaving only the feet visible).\n\nAll in all the game is rather small and short. Max Level is 30, max playtime should be 7 if you're really slow. If you're quick and know what you're doing you can finish the game with everry collectible in well under 4 hours. Take this into account if you want all achievements. Finishing the game with all characters is a chore. It's not hard, just time consuming.\n\nThough there are some upsides, the downsides are too much for me to recommend this game. Though that doesn't exactly make it an actual bad game. It's just wasted LOADS of potential, and anyone with expectations should step away from thinking of buying this game.\nIf you're fine with short and simple turn-based RPGs go ahead and buy. If you expect something of the style, quality or complexity of a Suikoden or anything like that, you should only get this on high discounts.","October 15, 2015","false","23.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is not a horrible game, in the least, however it is, by and large, a very poor part 1 of three. i would've preferred to see the whole series in one game @ a $30 price point, instead of 1 of 3 at ~15.\n\nThere were are a number of hooks just left hanging in nothingness. The write up of the game makes it sound like you've got a lot of choice. I can count on one hand the number of story choices I made, and none of them really seemed to make an impact in how the game played out. The key to an episodic or trilogy style series is to have enough immediate answers, to make you want to know what the longer term repercussions are. Here, none of my choices had any immediate impact, and so I can't say I have faith that anything i DID choose will resurface later.\n\n"6 playable characters" well, yes. you have 6 people in your party. However, you lock yourself into 1 based on your starting choice, and there is only one main tank, and one main heal type character, as far as I could tell, out of the remaining 5, with only 3 allowed in the party in combat, and no in combat switching, it boiled down to me quickly finding a party and sticking to it.\n\nGraphically, this one is a tough one, for me, because while yes, the graphics are pretty, there is something off about them, at the same time. The best I can say, is it didnt look like the perspective was right.Buildings looked abnormally tall/stretched, compared to the size and shape of the roofs for example. Everything, more or less, looked flat. I had a difficult time, especially in cities, telling one level from another.\n\nSteam says i played almost 11 hours, the save game file said just over 6, to give you an idea how of much time i lost sitting through the same cut scenes since they can't be skipped or even fast talked through.","January 13","false","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This would be OK if the game were priced accordingly, but 7-8 hours of gameplay is not worth what they are asking for it.  There may be some minimal replay value in playing through each of the six characters, but the main storyline is the same and there's almost zero choices to be made.\n\nThe art style is a bit jarring at times because it has no transitions, and there's definitely a lack of depth (meaning that they artist(s) did not convey 3D space very well) to it.  The hand-painted look is nice though.  The character sprites look pretty good, but their animations feel a bit off.\n\nIt's worth a playthrough if you come across it on sale for $5 or less, but otherwise you might find yourself, like me, very disappointed after finishing your first playthrough.\n\nThe monsters are all very one dimensional, and there's nothing really flashy or exciting about any of the battles.  Pretty much you can just defend, heal, attack your way to victory the whole time.\n\nThe characters are all very one dimensional, with a few exceptions and some minor 'growth.'  If the game had been two or three times the size, I think it had potential to become a very good game, but as it stands now it just fell completely flat.\n\nWhile a more minor nitpick, there are also a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes in the character dialogue.  Some could be attributed to 'character dialect' but most of them should have been caught by anyone doing some proofeading.\n\nI bought this game because a review said it was 9/10, the JRPG we've been craving.\n\nUnfortunately I believe that review was made by a Kickstarter backer or something familiar to the company, because I am not sure how anyone who played through it could give it a 9/10.  If you excuse it being shorter than watching the LotR trilogy, it still only earns a 7/10 in my book.\n\nGiven its length though, I have to say this is 3/10.

I had a good base but overall seemed to lack a lot of content. If I had to sum up this review in a few words I would say this feels more like a 5$ game than 15$.\n\nStory:\nThe story had a good base, but there are tons of holes and dead ends as you progress through it. For instance, you will meet someone who seems like they are going to have a large role in the story, but then you will never see them again.\nThe variance between the 6 characters as far as storyline is rather minimal, not something that i feel is worth playing through again. All in all, this felt more like a prologe or DLC to a larger game and I sincerely hop they dont try to plug the holes in the story with dlc and they just fix things in the next game.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat system and items etc are kinda shallow. I suppose they are about equal with how much story there is but you basically get 3 different types of each weapon with 2 upgrades (C-the standard,C+ and B quality) The only time I felt it was necessary to use any skill other than heal was the final boss, everything else was spammming auto attacks. That being said, the final boss was actually a challange (everyone in my party died and got ressed at least twice throughout the fight). And there seems to be no upgrade for armor.\n\nI'd like to do one more playthrought before I go any futher on this, but right now...

It is not a horrible game, in the least, however it is, by and large, a very poor part 1 of three. i would've preferred to see the whole series in one game @ a $30 price point, instead of 1 of 3 at ~15.\n\nThere were are a number of hooks just left hanging in nothingness. The write up of the game makes it sound like you've got a lot of choice. I can count on one hand the number of story choices I made, and none of them really seemed to make an impact in how the game played out. The key to an episodic or trilogy style series is to have enough immediate answers, to make you want to know what the longer term repercussions are. Here, none of my choices had any immediate impact, and so I can't say I have faith that anything i DID choose will resurface later.\n\n"6 playable characters" well, yes. you have 6 people in your party. However, you lock yourself into 1 based on your starting choice, and there is only one main tank, and one main heal type character, as far as I could tell, out of the remaining 5, with only 3 allowed in the party in combat, and no in combat switching, it boiled down to me quickly finding a party and sticking to it.\n\nGraphically, this one is a tough one, for me, because while yes, the graphics are pretty, there is something off about them, at the same time. The best I can say, is it didnt look like the perspective was right.Buildings looked abnormally tall/stretched, compared to the size and shape of the roofs for example. Everything, more or less, looked flat. I had a difficult time, especially in cities, telling one level from another.\n\nSteam says i played almost 11 hours, the save game file said just over 6, to give you an idea how of much time i lost sitting through the same cut scenes since they can't be skipped or even fast talked through.","January 13","false","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To clarify some points in the negative reviews:\n\n1.  This is part one of three, I believe.  So, yes, plot holes and a cliff hanger ending are appropriate.  I am, in fact, looking forward to how some of those things play out in later games.\n\n2.  I did not find grinding necessary.  Just use your team wisely.  For the basic battles I went all dps; for boss battles I might swap in the tank.  All team members level up regardless of who is used in the battle, so that's not a problem.  Understand your teams abilities and use them and there is no need for grinding.  I liked the battle system and the fact that some thought is required.  I look forward to that being more fleshed out in the future games (such as bigger emphasis on skill combinations that build damage).\n\n3.  The way the description is worded did make me think there were going to be moral decisions for me to decide.  This was not really the case, save one or two instances.  There are many moral situations the characters face and interact with, and, with a quick re-read of the description, I can see how that might be what they meant.  However, this does not mean it's a bad thing.  The character's interactions with the moral problems did cause me to think about them, right and wrong, and see the problems from different perspectives.  And I think that is a pretty cool accomplishment.\n\n4.  The setting may be a little cliche, but the plot and characters, at least to me, are not.  It was fun to see the characters grow a bit as people as they face and deal with the issues that arise through the game.  Again, that's something I look forward to developing in future games.\n\n5.  Game length:  Steam says 11.5 but in game time says over 16 hrs, I believe.  I don't know how people are beating this game so fast (glitch that was patched out?)  I do take my time with these games and look around and talk to people, but still.  Anyway, take that for what it's worth.\n\n6.  I personally did not have a problem with navigation, and that skill is not one of my strong points.  Just pay attention to the conversations, and you'll know where to go.\n\nNit pick time:  The main city took a bit too much time to navigate for my tastes.  I wish there was a super dash button or something.  There was one instance where the story required me to do a lot of walking that just seemed entirely pointless.  Cut scene me over there or something.  Also, no d-pad support for the controller.  I just used joy-to-key, but it would be nice if that was something we could do in-game.  Lastly, no side quests.  The pace of the story was quick, and perhaps side quests would have distracted from that, but I do hope they throw some in in future installments.\n\nWith that out of the way, I liked it!  I wish there was more (weapons, armor, skills, story), but this is only part one and wanting more is not a bad thing!  I would recommend throwing your money at these guys for a great game and so we can see what more they can do.","August 13, 2015","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played through once on Lucienne's story, then started Cammile's.\n\nPros:\nI can certainly recommend if it you like condensed, fast-paced storytelling.  It's a JRPG pared down to the essentials: good storytelling, interesting though not particularly challenging combat, and strong characterization.  Your ability to mix and match characters' active and passive skills is engaging, though the combat doesn't really push you to strategize. There were some effective challenging battles that happened at key plot moments, though. I myself am a big fan of good story-telling and atmosphere, so I have to give CT: ON serious props on those counts. Some moments are genuinely emotionally gripping, particularly near the end.\n\nCons and Suggestions:\nThe game does seem to end a bit abruptly and your sense of agency and moral challenge isn't yet there. I would suggest that the following installments emphasize these last two elements further in slightly longer storylines: it's great that it feels so packed, but it feels a little slim content-wise. Particularly your relationships with your party-members could use a less automatic feel: it would be so cool to have a sense of negotiating these friendships. Additionally, character skills stop being added at about level 24, so even though there's a level 30 cap, you stop having much of a sense of development even before hitting that cap. The specialization was a strength: sustain it until the cap.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhat's here is solid work. I'd just like more of it. However, I look forward to the next episode and wish the dev team well.","August 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, although the story puts you in several moral choices, it ultimately does not have an effect. (Just few dialogue changes when selecting moral choices, but that's it.) If you like story-driven JRPGs, this should cling you for like 6+ hours.\n\nCharacters: 7.5/10\n\nAll characters have interesting backstories especially when you have chosen your main character. However, it's a hit or miss if you like their personality and the role they play in the story.\n\nArtwork: 8.0/10\n\nDon't expect this game to be the sight to see with its 2D graphics. The artwork is quite scenic and nice. Character sprites and their portraits are really cool, especially in turn-based combat.\n\nProgression (The Grind): 7/10\n\nEnemy scaling is weird. Easy at the very beginning, but it spikes randomly at like 4-5 chapters in. Grinding is not important in this game, though I feel that the developers should emphasize grinding a bit more because the skills and equipment are really good.\n\nI know they lessened the "grind" due to the replayability of playing different main characters. However, since there is no New-game+ option, it would seem very unappealing to most players.\n\nMy personal score for this game: 8/10\nSimply because I like story-driven JRPGs. It's good, but not the best. If you really like story-driven JRPGs, even though it's quite pricy for a $13 game, it's worth it. If not, bust.\n\nHope the developers can learn a bit from these reviews and make major decisions/overhauls on certain things in the next installment.\n\nLast few words:\nFor the first game of the triology, it's a good game and you should go get it. However, if you don't believe 8/10 is a good score, wait for the second game of the triology.\n\n","August 14, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Likely it should cap your level based on chapter and there would be less walking over enemies at the start.  Although the trailer makes it seem like you make dozens of decisions you really only make a couple that seem to have no real bearing on the outcome of the game.  And once you hit a certain level before level 30 and you stop gaining abilities its kind of disappointing and feels incomplete.  There are also completely useless abilities on deforet, combat never lasts 5 rounds and by the time you have 6 stamina its usally over unless you've been defending.  That and some of the abilities dont seem to work, I swear with his regular axe and the one with beast slayer both do 900 dmg to boars.  I feel like one should do a lot more damage.  I thought the story was interesting, but short, although the climax seemed out of place based one what the characters had been saying the rest of the game.  There are of course areas you cant go to and your weapon goes from C to C+ to B and storylines left hanging because there are apparently going to be 2 sequels.

But, the more i play the game the more i'am getting bored with the story. Frigid movement, too simple story. Let me tell you something, what makes a JRPG success is its story which contains every aspect of story essence.\n\nAt the very last, that's the biggest climax of my disappointment that the game is so SHORT ! with different character but same scene over and over. The different are only at the prolog and epilogue.\n\nMoreover, i heard a song that's the same as a game called EXIT FATE which is better story than yours. You got Unity as a game engine, but EXIT FATE only uses RPG MAKER but alas EXIT FATE has deeper story telling ♥♥♥♥. Unlike "Celestian Tales: Old North"\n\nI'm an indonesian, i'm a big fans of JRPG. So many games i've played, yours is one of the unworthy one to play for JRPG fans.\n\nfrom 0-10, i gave this game 6/10.\n\nPROS\n\n1. Graphic is good\n2. The game is not so heavy\n3. The healing concept after battle\n4. Good songs, though i felt that there is a song i've ever heard from game EXIT FATE\n\nCONS\n\n1. TOO SHORT STORY\n2. Funny movement on running\n3.

But I'm not a fan of the reviews giving 6/10 or whatever; what game there is here is pretty good, even if it's extremely blatant the team ran out of cash.  I'd still be happy to support it so that we can see some more game, as the first ~10% or so that we can see seems interesting.\n\nAnyway.  The combat system is interesting and plays well.  Encounters are very easily avoidable which is nice, with the proviso that this means that it's very possible to have unwinnable boss fights until you go grind a tad.  The setting is interesting enough, and most of the characters are fine with 1 exception.  The writing is...  a tad erratic, but I'm mostly positive.  Sometimes it's *great*, offering compelling in-setting justification for some of the weirder "involve the characters" angles where the characters react properly (surprise) but then puzzle out what's really going on.  Sometimes it's a bit...  1st-time author / fanficcy, where it's a tad too blunt/sincere about the Big Point they're trying to make here.  But hey, I'd rather that then no point at all, so I'll take it.\n\nIf you're curious about the one character I didn't like, it's the half-elf; she has all the "I am an alien outsider so let me ask naive questions about human culture and then have the others explain how brutal and illogical we are, as if to a child."  Think Star Trek Spock except way more cloying and saccharine.  This kind of character can work, but it doesn't here.  Oh well.  She isn't that important anyway.\n\nIt's good!  And short!

The artstyle definitely has the feel you'd find from SaGa Frontier 2 on the PS1, having well animated sprites with a watercolor look and the music is very well done. The combat is also pretty interesting as well, having some various forms of depth due to the way certain AoE attacks work (Some are full groups, other hit in a straight row), tanking abilities to mitigate damage, but best of all... as advertised, there's no need to grind every party member. Why? The character level is, in fact, the party level. At a level up, EVERYONE benefits, and no one is left behind, allowing you to safely swing around your party line-up to suit yourself best against whatever the area throws against you.\n\nStill somewhat early in it, having only hit Ch. 3 on Lucienne, but I can definitely recommend this.","November 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To clarify some points in the negative reviews:\n\n1.  This is part one of three, I believe.  So, yes, plot holes and a cliff hanger ending are appropriate.  I am, in fact, looking forward to how some of those things play out in later games.\n\n2.  I did not find grinding necessary.  Just use your team wisely.  For the basic battles I went all dps; for boss battles I might swap in the tank.  All team members level up regardless of who is used in the battle, so that's not a problem.  Understand your teams abilities and use them and there is no need for grinding.  I liked the battle system and the fact that some thought is required.  I look forward to that being more fleshed out in the future games (such as bigger emphasis on skill combinations that build damage).\n\n3.  The way the description is worded did make me think there were going to be moral decisions for me to decide.  This was not really the case, save one or two instances.  There are many moral situations the characters face and interact with, and, with a quick re-read of the description, I can see how that might be what they meant.  However, this does not mean it's a bad thing.  The character's interactions with the moral problems did cause me to think about them, right and wrong, and see the problems from different perspectives.  And I think that is a pretty cool accomplishment.\n\n4.  The setting may be a little cliche, but the plot and characters, at least to me, are not.  It was fun to see the characters grow a bit as people as they face and deal with the issues that arise through the game.  Again, that's something I look forward to developing in future games.\n\n5.  Game length:  Steam says 11.5 but in game time says over 16 hrs, I believe.  I don't know how people are beating this game so fast (glitch that was patched out?)  I do take my time with these games and look around and talk to people, but still.  Anyway, take that for what it's worth.\n\n6.  I personally did not have a problem with navigation, and that skill is not one of my strong points.  Just pay attention to the conversations, and you'll know where to go.\n\nNit pick time:  The main city took a bit too much time to navigate for my tastes.  I wish there was a super dash button or something.  There was one instance where the story required me to do a lot of walking that just seemed entirely pointless.  Cut scene me over there or something.  Also, no d-pad support for the controller.  I just used joy-to-key, but it would be nice if that was something we could do in-game.  Lastly, no side quests.  The pace of the story was quick, and perhaps side quests would have distracted from that, but I do hope they throw some in in future installments.\n\nWith that out of the way, I liked it!  I wish there was more (weapons, armor, skills, story), but this is only part one and wanting more is not a bad thing!  I would recommend throwing your money at these guys for a great game and so we can see what more they can do.","August 13, 2015","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's call her... Velma.\n\n\nThankfully, the party is formed of intelligent characters, which shows in their converstations and the paths they draw upon.  Too bad the supporting cast of NPC's, which the story spends a good amount of time establishing as sane, falls apart in plot-driven Chaotic Stupid. Naturally, as with any morally astute story there's a moral compass, and as such she plays the child very well.  Plus she finger paints and spent most of her years high (Upon a Tree)  in the clouds with other hippies.  Let's go with Shaggy here.\n\nI liked the combat system, especially the concept of juggling aggro.  To bad that this means your healer will probably suck it all up with skills and items, like the uptown girl who plays jack of all healing trades and can't tank... I dubbed her Dauphney.\n\nRather than buying new weapons, the game has you upgrading existing ones, while each person as enough to adapt to a particular playstyle.  Sucks that there's no real way to compromise for a middle road though, like the pragmatic-yet-idealistic soldier-woman who's equipment can't agree on giving or taking ♥♥♥♥... Madame Fred, I call thee.\n\nOf course, they've also implemented a skill system, which further allows you to customize the characters to whatever playstyle you enjoy.  It's a shame when you realize certain characters are a far superior than others, like the po' boy poster child-turned murderhobo's E-skill.  Such a lovely character, that Scooby-Doo. (Pro-tip: Just feed Isaac power and the highest dps you can, and he'll wipe an Andori... Rons... Or... ...Blue-thing a turn.)\n\nThe problem with these two systems, though, is some characters clearly blur without synergy, especially towards the end, their skills and equipment make them prime for backwards strategies and I can't decide if it's intentionally clever or a natural reaction to the emplaced system(s).  Prime culprits include the loud-mouth who's character growth chart looks like a big O expression.  Rather 'Scrappy' fellow.\n\nIf the above seems somewhat harsh, and you're still here, I'd like to soften a little: This game isn't bad, but it has two flaws, It's rushed, and it's not complete.  Yes I know there's supposedly more, but this isn't EA, and while well done for a group of hindi trying their hand at Western motifs and imagery it's no GoT.  (Though it's on par with Tactics...'till the end...)\n\nYep, that final boss  soured the whole thing for me, and if you sit back and think, it probably will for you too.","December 15, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's nothing really fancy about it, as there is no voice acting and there are no extra-impressive animation sequences. The game does look and sound good, though. So what's so refreshing about it? Well, for one, it took me 15 minutes of walking around the city, just to figure out where's the exit I needed. Unlike many other modern games, this one seems to be also about exploration, as it lets you wander around and get to know the environment, instead of leading you by the hand from one place to the other.

I picked Isaac Goldenlake as my character. In the  first five minutes you learn there are miraculous healings but only the nobility can have  them, regardless of income. If you are noble, you get free miracle cures. So Reed's mother dies because they farm out of the world's worst hovels.\n\nFast forward a few random encounters. Fights don't seem to give XP, but you heal HP and MP(think FFTA style MP) before every  fight so it doesn't matter. Combat's not bad, it seems, but ultimately pointless, unless that changes off the prologue.\n\nWe find Isaac Goldenlake having been wounded. A priest will heal him, of course. Reed, enraged, stabs him, only to find he is POOR and the ONLY SON of a SUPER SICK DYING FATHER. So he takes the place of the son of a nobleman and decides he'll change things. He goes on a boat and tries to offer the crew money but NO, COMMONERS CAN'T TAKE MONEY FROM NOBILITY, THEY MUST DO EVERYTHING FOR FREE.\n\nI submitted my refund there. Maybe some of  the other storylines are okay, but this one was so hamfisted I couldn't stand it.\n\nLet's clear some things up. 1) I am perfectly in love with down stories about the true struggle of humanity, but you can't force them through quickly like this game did in trying to set up Isaac.\n\n2) There are first five minute spoilers.\n\n3) Serfdom was a form of bondage, but it was rarely out and out slavery as came about, say, in the early Colonial South. You treated your serfs well so you could get crops back. Commoners didn't have amazing lives but they were rarely neck under bootheel slaves.\n\n4) I'd love to see some reviews about the exactly story writing of the game in depth, as all the ones so far just talk about the combat and the graphics(the graphics aren't even that great.) Does the storywriting get better? Does it make up for some of the early mistakes?

It was funded on Kickstarter, a campaign which I managed to miss although I certainly intend to throw some cash at them for the next one!\n\n\nOld North is a JRPG-style game.  Fairly short - my first playthough was 7:46 - and easy.  Battles are turn-based, and your characters have stamina points which build up each turn to allow you to use skills.\n\n\nThe most interesting thing about the game is the six main characters.  You can play through as any one of them (and get an achievement for finishing the game as all six).  While the main plot remains the same, each character has a unique viewpoint, with their own scenes and knowledge.  Camille, for example, learns something very important from her brother near the end of the game which the other five characters remain totally unaware of, while Aria, the dogmatic Paladin, seems a lot more human when you see her defying her father and struggling with honouring a dead soldier of another religion.\n\n\nThe overarching plot is that of these six characters becoming Squires, and taking part in a war and various political events which shape their world.  As the game is the first chapter of three, it ends of something of a cliffhanger.  Throughout the game you make choices - such as letting a group of bandits go to trial or be hanged by the villagers - which, in theory, will change the shape of the future games in the series.\n\n\nThe game is short and simple enough - with one hidden boss to beat and some weapons to upgrade as side-plots - that playing through it six times only feels like a bit of a chore, especially with the added intrigue of new scenes.","September 10, 2015","true","42.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also think that each character should of had their own quest/goal like Saga Frontier did or like Suikoden 3 where you play different storylines and all join together further in the game.

Took me about 11 hours of play time.\n\nOverall I liked the game and highly recommend it. It broke away from a lot of most tired JRPG cliches (e.g., you aren't a chosen one prophesized to save the world from an ancient evil, you're not a pre-teen, and no one has amnesia!). There are no random encounters and all of the enemies are avoidable (except for bosses and story related combat, of course). The game is fairly linear, but there are a a few points in the story where you get to make narrative choices, but the consequences won't become apparent until future installments (this game is the fist of a planned trilogy). The combat is also a lot more interesting than the typical JRPG because you have some character customization options, there is actually an incentive to use "defend" at times. Very little if any grinding is needed; the game isn't padded with lots of filler combat.\n\nOn the downside, cut scenes are not skippable (which becomes extremely annoying if you have to replay boss fights in a couple areas), new weapons are not be sold by merchants and must be found somewhere on the map (a few of them are rather easy to miss), there is currently no difficulty setting; although I found it close to my personal preference for the most part, combat was too easy in the beginning of the game. A few other minor design issues, but otherwise a very enjoyable game; it's like an JRPG for RPG fans who are usually disatisfied with the sub-genre.","August 17, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it is good rather than great.  The game itself was nicely executed, and the fact it was hand-drawn definitely increased my enjoyment, as that is a labor of love rarely seen these days. Each of the six playable characters had a unique back-story and  personality. The combat system was fluid and fast paced. The controls and movement were seamless and responsive - I was pleasantly surprised I could navigate with the keyboard, another rarity I have found with isometric games.  The story was fairly contrived - an army invades the Old North, and the Heroes gather to protect the realm.  There were a few plot twists which surprised me, however. Even the twists, though, felt somehow unfinished, as if the game is a prequel or an installment of a larger idea. The ending feels that way as well, as though there is something waiting just beyond the next scene. The actual end itself, for the character I played (Ylianne) offered no resolution of any kind. While the combat was good, much of the game was slow. I retraced my steps quite  few times running errands/quests/missions. I kept feeling like like I was waiting for something to happen, but that something never materialized. Although I finished the game at level 27, I maxed out all the characters skills at level 20. There were few weapon upgrades and fewer armor upgrades. The apparel items were likewise sparse.  I was a little frustrated when I cleared out an area of monsters, but when I travelled back through that area they had all re-spawned. I understand this in relation to the game mechanics, but, again, it slowed down the gameplay a little.\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. The hand-drawn art is terrific, expecially the character and NPC portraits. The unique personalities of the playable characters highlighted some interesting sociological ideas, especially in regarding the concept of "Noblesse Oblige",  the role of individuals in [Feudal] society and the nature of religion as a social, as well as spiritual, institution. The combat was smooth and the characters possessed different abilities depending on their favored weapon and class. The few plot twists were interesting, but could have been more fleshed out, as could have the story in general. Again, it often felt like a prequel, prologue or installment of a larger game/world concept.","August 17, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a great game for people new to jrpgs / turn based combat as it's not expressly easy but simple to learn tactics and lack of damage system makes simpler for newer / younger players. I found the majority of the gameplay pretty boring as a long time jrpg lover due to the lack of depth in the fighting system which looked like it had deeper potential, but wasn't overly tedious or annoying due to low level cap and small xp pool required little grinding to accomplish it's tasks which was nice. The majority of the game is doable in roughly 9 hours, probably 10 if you look up where medals are and laze your way through it for the first run. The game also teaches to newer players to the genre alot of basics for jrpgs between point management and time limited events and secrets encouraging exploring during the entire experience.\nStory it'self is interesting and flows along fine, but the character stories and choices dont feel to hot with the lack of them pretty much only appearing once every 2-3 chapters out of 7. Some of this could be that the game is incomplete Part 2 coming along the tracks ..etc. The characters are said to be relatively cliche'less but pretty much all of the main players kinda were, only ones i felt broke the mold a bit were Issac, Camille, and maybe Ylienne depending on how you look at her. The most interesting story after poking a save into each character is definately Issac. Also the game does have it's share to witty dialouge and humorous pokes to keep you going even on the slower scenes.\nThe visuals were 50:50 to me, looks great and the backgrounds are nice buuut towns and prefab tiles hurt the fresh unique looks of the maps, mostly Levantine and Moncalm and don't totally match the perspective. speaking of perspective the game has an odd considering for direction, in which that the games compass directions are not relative to the camera, Game says go West, you have to head east to get there. The directions don't match the games camera perspective and can be confusing for people who don't catch onto this. The music was solid and pretty good but alot of scenes just didn't have music and there's no text scroll sound so a number of cutscenes have no sounds just text rolling which felt odd and was kinda disappointing.\nThe game is kinda buggy but never really had any issues with it aside from the menu is unresponsive a bit sometimes and the movement glitch in Astori's house but otherwise no major issues that ruined my experience.\n\nOverall great game to start a friend of family member on the jrpg genre, but isn't likely to appeal to long time or hardcore players looking for a good PC jrpg. Some of this could be wrong in the future with the upcoming parts as this isn't the whole story but still for -this- game i stand by my opinion.","August 15, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only problem is that the game is TOO DAMN SHORT! I know the company that made this is rather small (Congrats btw because to still make a game of this calibre is amazing with a small team) however when you see an rpg with a large map and at first seemingly large story, you'd probably expect at least 20 hrs out of it if not more, at first i thought the actual end was the end of the prologue or something. I feel this game has great potential although it is currently untapped, there is so many possible storylines to follow and continue but they were just left there. Overall, for the short while you get to play it, its amazing but don't expect something like Final fantasy esc. out of this (story wise).","August 22, 2015","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played Aria for my first playthrough. She is easy to play with (healer) and goes well with any party combination you want to play with.\n\nPros:\n+ Music is fantastic. It sets the mood really well. Keep in mind, there is no vocal dialoge, so the music and some scattered sound effects are the only thing you'll hear.\n\n+ The game emphasizes its fantastic storyline and choice. This was the main reason I bought the game. The story is well developed and very thought provoking. However, there was a bit of a let down that I'll discuss later.\n\n+ The game looks great. Don't expect 4D 4K graphics. The game's look very much makes it seem like a story that you'd read in a book. The whole game, between the music, dialogue, and design, makes me think of an old story book that I would have read.\n\n+ The basic history lore was good. Not killer, but it gave you enough to wrap your head around\n\nCons:\n- The difficulty rises in an abrupt manner. It comes as a bit of a shock. It's not too difficult to adjust, but it was unpleasant. It comes in around the War with the World Enders.\n\n(BIGGEST CON and ONLY REAL CON, IMO) - When I say real con, I mean it was th eonly con that really detracted from my playing experience. The story is well designed, but stops very abruptly. The whole games hints towards the ending, but just as you hit the ending of the game, the game stops and feels unfinished. This may be because they plan to put out a sequel, but it made this game feel undone. A lot happened at once and I felt cheated out. The entire game spends a very long time putting each pieece of the story together, but at the end, too much happens too quickly. A lot goes unanswered too. I still have about a dozen questions that are unanswered. I don't mean the little kind either. Like major plot questions. I don't think they ended the game in the best way. It's a great story with a let down of an ending.\n\n- Character lore was weak. I feel like the game preaches the complexity of the story (which it is), but then leaves their characters pretty simple.\n\n- The game says you aren't special. You definitely are. You save the entire world. They literally say in the game, we would have lost had it not been for your party. You personally help the "heroes" of the game, sit in on their war meetings, and complete vital quests. This doesn't detract from the game at all, but I thought it would be worth pointing out.\n\n\nIf you want to play a game with a well written story that makes you head think a little, then play this game. Its not your boring hack and slash RPG. Its very deep. If it had a better finish, I wouldn't really have anything to complain about.","August 17, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Clocking in for me at seven hours for one run, honestly, I think it's a great little game, especially if you can get it when it's on sale.\n\nIs the combat simplistic? Yes. But that's not necesarily a bad thing. At the end it proves to be much more reasonably challenging and ejoyable, though the first five chapters are pretty much just basic attacking until they die.\n\nThe sprite work and art work in general was great. I honestly enojyed looking at the character models when battling and in cut scenes, very well done.\n\nThe characters themselves are fairly enjoyable, particularly Yli shining with her stark simplicity and innocent contrast to the rest of the group. I do complain though, that there really is no need to ever swap out party members. Find three early on that you like and you're solid for the first chapters, with only needing possible adjustments at the end where you will need a consistent tank, dps, and heal.\n\nAs far as the story, it's pretty much what you'd expect, but pick up right at the end with a cliffhanger-ish ending that closes the game well, but leaves the sequels open to a lot of possibility.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a casual RPG, this is likely the one for you.\n(And even if you hate it, gotta love that steam refund).","August 19, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
