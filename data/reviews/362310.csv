No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nDungeon League is a hack n' slash co-op dungeon crawler in the theme of a TV show. Your goal is to fight through seemingly endless hordes of monsters all the way down to the bottom level of the dungeon and defeat the Dungeon Master. So far, the game only has Local Co-op, which is somewhat of a letdown, but there is a chance online multiplayer will be added at a later date. Fans are certainly rallying for the devs to add it!\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThere are several game modes for Dungeon League: Tournament, Gauntlet, Survival, Dungeon Ball, and Free Play. Tournment is the standard mode, pitting 2-4 players against a series of random objectives in a monster filled dungeon. Gauntlet is similarly for 1-4 players, throwing waves of monsters at players. Survival is described as endless waves of monsters....simply last as long as you can! Dungeon Ball is a sport of sorts, where the objective is to defeat monsters and get the ball to the endzone. Lastly, Free Play is simply....you and your friends in a room with monsters spawning every so often. Only Tournament and Free Play are available for play now, with the rest of the modes coming soon.\n\nWhen you choose a mode, you get to choose from 4 teams. They all have a name, but they simply assign your heroes a color. Once a team is chosen, you have 6 All-Stars (Champions) to choose from. Each All-Star has their own unique abilities and playstyle. For example, Reginald is a sword and shield bearing knight, whose shield occasionally blocks frontal attacks.\n\nEach All-Star has their own unique skill set, each assigned to a key or button. These skills are obtained by obtaining Skill Points, which are earned by leveling up. As you clear stages of the dungeon, you earn experience for all of your kills. You can spend your skills points any way you wish, up to 3 per skill (this i sthe maximum rank). The more points you invest in each skill, the more powerful or useful that skill becomes. This is extremely important for survival, so make sure you spend those points!\n\nLastly, there is a shop. As you battle your way through the dungeon you will pick up loads of gold. This gold can be spent in the shop between matches. The shopkeeper typically keeps several items up for you to purchase, but you can bribe the NPC to change the pool of items you can choose from. The more you bribe, the more it costs. Each All-Star can equip up to 2 items. Item have different effects, such as increasing HP or movement speed, or something more substantial such as giving a chance for a lightning attack when struck in combat.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nEverything is pixel-based. Not a ton of effort was put into the look of the game, but it still looks good. The characters have simple animations, and enemies are distinguishable enough. Attacks have some animation as well as All-Star abilities. Not much though. The general look and feel of the game is pretty good, but everything else can use a little bit more work. It's Early Access for a reason I suppose!\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe game's soundtrack is pretty pumped up for what it is. Like the look of the game, the music can use a little bit of work as well. Sound effects are pretty good, as well as the limited voice work each All-Star has. An example would be Reginald's cyclone attack, where he might say "Helicopter!", which is hilarious. Enemies also have limited voice work, like Minotaurs saying "Mooooooo!" when damaged or dying.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nDungeon League ran extremely well on my mid-tier rig. 60+ FPS was observed constantly. The game also has full controller support, which is a plus in my book! No stuttering, lag, slowdown, or random crashes were observed.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDungeon League is a fun co-op game that can use some extra features and polish. It's fun, but lacks online multiplayer. Once online multiplayer is added, it'll be one heck of a party dungeon crawler game. Hopefully more time in Early Access will see this feature added at a later date!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2hyx30pRHM\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 19, 2015","true","10.0"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","32","37","2","2"

Not the naughty way, but the less naughty way of doing it in this 80s composed indie pixel dungeon crawler.\n\nReally excited to see more modes, classes and items but the current state of the game provides a lot of fun testing and slapping as you go through the levels.

One issue is the aiming often a pain and you often run headfirst into enemies because of it. Another issue is that there isnt much content at the moment, especially without online play. Make sure you have friends to play with if you are going to get this game.","July 23, 2015","true","3.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooodyssey/recommended/362310/","ooodyssey","Odysseamonkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ooodyssey/","397 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, it looks great and the gameplay is fluid and fun. As it is at the moment you will need to have friends to play with locally otherwise you likely wont get much playtime out of it, it currently has very limited single player and no online multiplayer. Also I would reccommend you use a controller if you can as I'm not so sure about the keyboard support at this time.\n\nThe positives:\n\nThe current playable characters are awesome and fairly well balanced, plus the developer has stated that he has plans to add more and more characters as the game progresses.\n\nThe multiplayer is quite competitive and loads of fun, game modes such as 'capture the flag' and 'capture the point' aren't too common in RPG style games but they work extremely well here.\n\nThe art style and animation is very well done, pixel art isn't for everyone but this game does it well and if you give it a chance I'm sure you'll come to like it.\n\nA few things I noticed which need some attention:\n\nFirst up - ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, this is a big one, this is a great game which could really strive but in my opinion a game like this NEEDS online multiplayer otherwise it could potentially die off very early. If this game incorperates some sort of online matchmaking/lobby system where you can play with your friends and/or randoms it could really take off.\n\nNext up, the keyboard supports feels a bit weird, I almost immediately switched to controller. Giving access to the options so we can remap keys will mostly fix this I imagine however my biggest problem is that it just doesn't feel right, the menu scrolling can be laggy and sometimes pauses if you scroll too fast, i.e. you can't mash up or down to quickly select things because it will stop registering key presses or something. This isn't noticable while using a controller as far as I could tell.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed is the free play mode could do with a bit of work, I tried playing on level 1 and was just getting mauled and dying instantly as soon as I respawned because it seems like the monsters don't scale to your level or anything like that. Free play isn't a big focus of the game and you can set your level higher to make yourself stronger so this is a minor issue but more options such as difficulty or number of enemies couldn't hurt.\n\nHopefully I can improve this review over time but overall I'm really liking the game so far, I just hope that online multiplayer is implemented soon, the developer said he's open to it just as long as there is a demand, so get on it people, let him know you want it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Only it's lacking a lot in content. There are only two of the five modes available now. But I have high hopes for the new modes. The game looks and plays pretty good. There's only local coop. So don't buy this game if you don't have any controllers. I myself have four controllers making this game big fun.\n\nIt's early acces during the time of this review, I have high hopes for the future modes.

There are a decent amount of characters to choose from with unique skills. Also character had some type of chemistry with one another if using their skills correctly. We got super competitive, brought out some booze and had a great night. Played for 4 1/2 hours straight.\n\nReal review:\nI've had this game for super long and my friends and I haven't had the time to come together to try it out until recently. We were able to pick it up very quickly as the concept of the games and skills/items were very straight forward. Every game led to finding something new about the characters or the pairs of them together. The versatility of what type of fighter you want to be was easy to switch around through skill orders and the items you bought. The full potential of the game definitely came in when we had 4 players (2v2). My friends and I were communicating throughout, calling out objective or to focus down the enemy and so on. The game is quite simple but complex at the same time which made the replay value so high.\n\nI understand this game is still under early access but the balancing of this game defintely needs to be reworked though. We ran into characters (mainly albert) that was completely useless in all situations of the games, and found that freya was super overpowered if you max out here trees first, which could be maxed averaged at round 3. We found counters for the over powered skills and combos in the game, but it soon became a rock paper scissor match, which definitely showed the imbalance imbetween characters, damage scaling or items.\n\nTheses games are definitely made strictly for a team game, because when we tried 1v1, we found that it didn't take as much skill or just seemed very dull in the 1v1 aspect. (Race is the best example of that) Along with that, race just didn't seem like a good game mode, maybe it has to be reworked to make it less one tracked mind?'\n\nAside from all that, I really hope the game is still under works and does come out with patches and releases with in the 1 - 2 months time as it says.","February 21","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Admittedly, when walking around the game didn't really catch my attention from a distance. However, I'm *really* glad I gave it a go because it turned out to be incredibly fun to play!\n\n2v2 Tournament (League) mode is highly strategic and seems to be the core of the game. It basically blends elements from a variety of genres into a round-based competive party game. Unfortunately, 1v1 means you miss out on the team based strategy elements and didn't seem quite as interesting. 1v1v1 (and presumably 1v1v1v1) was a bit more interesting, but can't really compare to 2v2.\n\nI've only played a small amount of Survival mode so far. My gut feel is that it won't ever measure up to 2v2 League mode (which sets the bar pretty high), but should be interesting enough, particularly if you don't have enough players or just want to play co-op.\n\nWith the right marketing (and perhaps a bit of luck) I can definitely see 2v2 League mode becoming an extremely popular e-sport - get on it now!","November 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Survival mode is fine with just 2 people, but when you do Tournament 2 people is no where good from my observation. It's fun, but does lack that online feature, I know this is just Early Access. So hopefully online does get implemented for this game.
