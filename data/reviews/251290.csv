I have worked hard since i left school at 17 and in the past 2 years i grinded my way into a nice promotion at a job where a lot of people hate or see as a dead end career wise. I'm going through the toughest time of my life right now with personal issues and the troubles that come along with being unemployed during a crisis in your life is weighing heavy on me. Don't worry this is not a sob story, everything ties in with the game.\n\nSo, being depressed and unable to get out of bed and generally live my life ( no exaggeration i swear ) i found myself reading up on old video games that i loved as a kid, in an attempt to try and feel happy again. Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VIII were my favorite games growing up. In recent years i haven't been that much into games as i was as teenager. Work commitments and adulthood takes a hold of you and gaming kind of took a back seat.\n\nAnyway, i stumbled upon Trails In The Sky FC whilst reading up on good JRPGS on Steam ( JRPG's were my thing as a kid ). I saw one review that described Trails as better than Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VII, and it was going so cheap on Steam, i had to see what the fuss was about. Thank god i did.\n\nAs i played FC and SC consecutively i'll count this as a combined review but as i mentioned above. I haven't played games much in recent years and an in depth review is something i wouldn't be good at so i'll keep it short and sweet.\n\nFirst things first, the storyline in this game is absolutely fantastic, So many good characters and interactions, a lot of text to read through but i love that. A game without good text/dialogue will struggle to be a good game. Trails has the best storyline i have ever came across in a game. It's very long but well worth it, look at it this way. Would The Lord Of The Rings be the story it was if it were not a gigantic beast of a novel? This kind of is the same with Trails. It's a slow burner at the the start but about 20 hours into FC it picks up and does not stop. It grips you in and will have you laughing, crying and screaming before you know it.\n\nThe characters and character relations are amazing. Sometime the highlights for me weren't beating a tough boss or finishing long quests/chapters it was the small moments when the full team are together and each individual character shines through in the dialogue. Simply fantastic.\n\nI had mentioned before playing SC that the only thing i could say that was keeping it from being the complete game was the music, although the music is great i did say that it wasn't comparable to say a Nobou Uematsu score ( but what is eh? ). I'm going to backtrack on this now, after playing SC ( Which is considerably longer than FC ) i can say that the music is absolutely fantastic. It's up there with Nobou's Chrono Trigger soundtrack for me now.\n\nWell, that's about as much as i can say without tangling myself up in knots over a game review. The reasons i wanted to write this wasn't to critique the game but to get the message out there that games ( no matter what your preference is ) are magical. I'm now in better spirits and feeling more optimisitc about life after finishing this game. Yes, that may sound sad to some people but the joy this game brought to me will be something i will forever cherish. Given the impact this game has had on me, it will now be my " Greatest Game Of All Time ". Sometimes you need somthing in your life to pick you up and Trails was my shoulder to cry on. Thanks Falcom and Xseed, you basically saved my life.\n\nIf you like long JRPG's with amazing storytelling, characters, combat systems and addictive side quests. You need to get this game. It's an absolute must.\n\n10/10","December 16, 2015","true","117.5"," 825 of 875 people (94%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","94","825","875","50","42"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iridium077/recommended/251290/","iridium077","Sora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iridium077/","112 products in account","I don't even know where to begin. I finished the game today and loved it enough to immediately want to write a review, but... frankly, I can't find the words. Let's start with the ending, perhaps: this is by far the best JRPG on Steam, and one of the best of all time.\n\nWith that aside, let's gets down to business: this game is a direct sequel to another game on Steam entitled simply "The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky". You should absolutely not play this game if you haven't played the previous title first, because this game is an incredibly direct sequel to it. That game, henceforth "FC" (for "First Chapter"), should prove to be a pretty decisive litmus test determining whether or not you'll like this game -- and if you're on the fence, know that SC has everything FC did well and more.\n\nAs you should know from FC, there are a few things that will either make or break the game for a lot of people:\n-This is a turn-based game\n-This is a game from the mid-2000s\n-This game heavily involves anime-like aesthetics in its character and world design\n\nAnd if any of those things turned you off, SC won't really change them. If you're fine with all three of those things, though, then you're in for a real treat. SC is basically the perfect sequel to FC, expertly answering many questions FC asked and resolving a great number of personal conflicts, taking great pain to give character even to those who previously had little. The orbment system is drastically refined for the better, and while combat is largely the same, the greater focus on crafts makes it feel significantly more strategic. The game as a whole feels more challenging than FC even from the outset, but never to the point where it feels unfair -- at least, on Normal mode -- so that extra bit of strategy is necessary. Even the artwork is nicer and crisper than anything from FC, and the soundtrack is just as excellent as you'd expect from Nihon Falcom. And, of course, the localization -- the part that took four years, you might remember -- is just as high-quality as the excellence that was this game's predecessor, worth every second of effort XSEED and others put into it.\n\nTo those who find no issue with the three points above, this game might well be one of the best things you ever play. In all my hours of playing the game (66, and not even on a completionist run), I only had two trivial issues: a somewhat slow prologue and enemies that feel a touch too bulky at two specific points in the game. Both of these things are fairly transient and do little to diminish the game's overall quality, which shines through at almost every other point.\n\nThis game's predecessor released in English over four years ago. Ever since then, I've been waiting patiently for this title. Four years of hype, four years of expectations... and I'm the sort of person too prone to disappointment to ever get hyped for anything anymore. And with this game finished, it would be an understatement to say that I'm not disappointed. Every expectation I had was met, every bit of hype I had was exceeded, and this game will likely end up being one of the most satisfying experiences I've ever had. If you're reading this, you had the luxury of not waiting that long -- and you'll likely find the game even better for it.\n\nI give this game no less than the highest recommendation I possibly can. This game is the culmination of practically a decade of work between Nihon Falcom's development and XSEED's localization; I thank both of them, from the bottom of my heart, for the many wonderful hours I spent playing the game. My only wish now is that other people can share in the joy I felt while playing Trails in the Sky SC.","November 7, 2015","true","89.7"," 128 of 131 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","128","131","0","0"

A lot. But even if you are not into reading I do advise this game to you, it may even change your opinion on the topic altogether.\nPositive  Mediocre  Negative    + Finally the conclusion  ~ definitely don't play it if you haven't finished FC        + NPCs welcome you home  ~ don't know if it's from my save file of FC        + Breathtaking locations (old and new)           + MORE loveable characters  ~ you still have to part with them at some points       + Improved Orbment -> more Arts          + More Crafts, especially Chain Crafts          + I found the 'moving' more useful   ~ is it just me?        + Extremely fun minigames          + Still beautiful art style  ~ and still old textures       + HD Portraits of characters in dialogues  ~ for important characters only       + Goosebumps music  ~ not the opening of FC          ~ no more all different chest-catchphrases        + Increased replay value\nRecommendationIf you haven't played through The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (First Chapter) yet, don't consider playing this game either.\nBetter head back there, read my review ;-), get this masterpiece of a game, play through it and then come back here!\nSeriously, this is in your best interest since this game is a direct spoiler to the first one, the best would be to not even watch the trailer and not to go into the community hub of this game!\n\nIf on the other hand you played through the first one and still couldn't get yourself to buy this one - then I don't understand you...\nSecond Chapter takes off where FC left you and you will definitely feel right back at home in this game, the music is great as ever, the atmosphere takes you in and you want to keep playing until the end.\nIn the first two hours I played the game it already brought me to the edge of tears and made me laugh out loud in front of my PC - just to convey some of the early feelings in the game.\nSo do yourself a favor and grab it!\nAnd if that still couldn't change your opinion - you can defeat enemies with Estelle's cooking - I guess some Monsters would die to get a bite ;-)\n\nCombatYou can really tell they made an effort to improve the combat in this sequel and... they succeeded.\nIf you read my review of FC you know about my opinion on turn-based combat and the combat in this series and they made me enjoy myself even more with the additions they made.\nOK, I'm not to sure on this one, this will need some confirmation ;-). I used the 'moving' in my first 12h more than in the 52h of playing the first one. Somehow it felt more useful and the delay until the next attack not so huge.\nAt certain points 'moving' is the only logical move to make - to dodge an enemy's attack, get into the healing range of an AoE-heal or position yourself for your own AoE attack.\nI still have a slight problem with the mechanic of it, but then again I found it more useful.\nSecondly, the introduction of a brand new - fresh out of the Central Factory - Orbment, (check back my review of FC for explanations) which enables you to use more quartz resulting in higher stats and, more importantly, more arts to play with, turns diversity in combat up a notch.\nLast but not least due to your extensive training as a 'Senior Bracer' you acquire the ability to utilize a new, so-called 'Chain-Craft' which lets your party members join in an attack that grows stronger in range and damage the more combatants take part in it.\nNaturally you will also gain access to new 'normal' crafts for each bracer you get to add to your fellowship, as their levels increase.\nAdditionally, as I already mentioned above - you can now use certain kinds of food to hit your foes with, with different damage and varying 'target systems' (if anyone knows a better word, tell me please), meaning if it will effect a circle around your enemy, a line outgoing from the point you are standing at, etc.\nMini-GamesOh boy, I love minigames and they added some in this game, namely gambling and fishing.\nOf my first about 8h or so, about 1.5h were spend doing these activities.\nWhile gambling you can choose from a slot-machine, poker, black-jack and roulette.\nAfter exchanging some of your mira for medals, you can start in the fun of losing it to the bank again. Personally, I enjoyed poker the most (as I did not lose as hard there).\nFor fishing, you will need a fishing rod, bait and obviously - a place to dip your pole into. Different combinations of all these factors will result in a different game (mostly location and bait, but without the right rod and line you can't utilize higher level bait), but stay focused not to let those slippery suckers get away.\nThanksOn the one hand to Nihon Falcom who developed this series and on the other one, even more so to XSeed and Carpe Fulgur for putting in all the localization work including all the extras they made for us to enjoy and the great translation.\nAlso, remember that it cost these companies a lot of blood, tears, sweat and the tiny thing that some people tend to forget - money. Well, we can't help much with all those body liquids but the latter one is something we can help them with.\nSo don't be a cheapskate, get this game - full price - so that we all may enjoy wonderful localizations of this series to come.\n\nBugsQuite a few bugs already got fixed, for those still in the game read this thread to see how bad it still is and how to fix problems if you encountered some yourself.\nPersonally, I didn't have any problems whatsoever.\n\nNoteAs this is a pre-review you might as well not do anything yet, since I will change the whole thing over but otherwise --\nI hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.","October 29, 2015","true","17.5"," 131 of 155 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","131","155","6","16"

But the level of detail and effort that is poured into the whole thing really elevates the experience into something far more than the sum of its parts.  Not only do the main characters change and grow in believable and appropriate ways as the story progresses but so too do hundreds, yes hundreds, of minor characters that populate the setting.  It’s the kind of storytelling that is only really available to games.  Trails in the Sky SC does it with style.\n\nWhile it may not change anyone’s mind about JRPGs as a genre, I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend the Trails in the Sky games.","November 2, 2015","true","77.3"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","60","67","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guppyforce/recommended/251290/","guppyforce","GuppyForce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guppyforce/","23 products in account","In Chapter 4, there is a segment of the story where, if you choose to visit the general store, you can spend a little bit of money to buy chocolate for your party members that have been staying up patrolling the whole night. This action does not change the course of the main story or unlock additional sidequests or equipment. It provides absolutely no benefit other than a couple of lines of dialogue.\n\nIt is the little details like these, put into the game with the hearts of the developers, that are what makes Trails in the Sky SC amazing.\n\nTrails in the Sky is not an open world sandbox game, but the amount of effort put into the world and characters of the story is simply astounding. Your party members are a vibrant, well-developed cast of some of the most memorable characters you will meet, and a great deal of thought was put into each and every line of dialogue as the characters interact with each other, bringing their personalities to life. The NPCs which inhabit the cities and villages of Liberl are also lavished upon the same treatment, with almost all the NPCs having unique names and distinct personalities, down to even the airship crew and shop owners. And given that all of the NPC dialogue changes after each segment of the main story, you'll also be able to follow the little happenings in their daily lives. Yes that's right---most NPCs in the game have their own mini-storylines, a few which will tie into your Bracer Guild sidequests, but most which are just their to simply add life to the world.\n\nMy favourite of these even spans multiple regions and games, involving the grandma of Rinon, your Rolent General Store owner, who wants to find a wife for her son. She eventually gives up on Rolent and travels to Grancel at the end of FC, to no success. On the airship back though, she meets Kitty, a tea seller girl from Edel Department store, who is on the way to Bose, and gets along quite well with her (while her sister rejoices at being able to take over as #1 tea seller). Well, thanks to the airships being grounded, Kitty ends up working at the store in Rolent, and Rinon while suspicious of his grandma, can't help but admire the girl's enthusiasm and hard work. Later, in Chapter 8 the wedding of a couple (whose story began in FC, and whose ring you retrieve on a sidequest in Chapter 4) takes place, and well, no points for guessing who catches the bridal bouquet.\n\nTo anyone who loves a sprawling world with many secrets and lifelike characters, I can't recommend Trails in the Sky more.","December 6, 2015","true","107.5"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","0"

I've played contless games and rpg's especially and i find this game story to be one of the best. Despite it might look "childish" etc, it's really well designed from start to very end, with ridiciously attention to every detail going in game. There is no "side missions" or "quests". Whole game is one big story.\n\nSomehow it strikes more like a book, rather than a game. I had this feeling only few times probably, it's really close to the planescape torment story level in my opinion. Even so, some fights are interesting and even challenging. I finished a game on hard difficulty, would probably do at nightmare, but prologue has ridiciolus last boss so i decided to play hard. Most fights with enforces are really cool, especially with number II. It might have disbalance in battle design, like Zane being absolutely the best with his crafts and Kevin is actually super handy when you going to fights with enforcers, i kinda couldnt change Zane and Kevin since they are amazingly good thought i wanted to see some different interactions :) Also one of really good sides of this game - despite it being jrpg it doesnt force you to grind anything, level your teammates is really easy if you need to bring them on. After playing "tales of zesteria" which has very good combat system but really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, and forcing you to grind equipment with it stupid system ( on highest difficulty levels ).\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game for anyone who look for deep story with unexpecting twists and lovely ending.\nReally looking forward for more "Legend of heroes" series on PC.\n\nAnd yes, you definetelly want to start from original game.","November 22, 2015","true","200.9"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","36","42","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/recommended/251290/","xaerock","xaerock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaerock/","160 products in account","Second Chapter follows the story directly where Trails in the Sky First Chapter ended. The game goes on a much grander scale in both story and battles, and does it well. You're expected to have have played First Chapter in many places and are rewarded for remembering small details.\n\nLike the first game SC has a bit of a slow start as it builds the world and backstory but really picks up and gets crazy later on.\n\nThere's some small changes to the combat system with 'chain crafts', new spells and crafts but it's still very much the same. It's sort of like a grid-based strategy RPG battle system but simplified. However there is a lot of customizability to your characters and party and many ways to approach each battle. For environments the dungeon design is good and varied, especially later on.\nUnlike a lot of JRPGs there is almost no reason to grind enemies for experience. The experience gained from battles scales massively with your level so if you bring an underleveled character to a boss it might actually gain enough XP to go above the others.\n\nA big part of what made FC great for me was that the characters had a lot of personality and the dialogue was well written. In SC a lot of characters remain effectively the same and there aren't a ton of new ones you learn to know. But especially Estelle and Joshua have a lot of character growth as you might expect. At the same time you certainly get a lot of backstory on everyone as the story progresses.\n\nThe music throughout the game is superb. Especially in the final areas of the game I was really awed by this. In my opinion it's a big part of what makes the game so good, as it's effectively switched around to set the mood.\n\nIn general the game builds on all of the things I liked about the first chapter. As for a few (mostly minor) dislikes:\n\nI expected Second Chapter to be darker toned than the first. The 'secret society' tends to follow anime tropes and hide behind mystery rather than truly seem evil or do horrible things (with some exceptions). This is a matter of taste of course. I sort of preferred the political plotting of the first game and how the society appeared very sinister there. Speaking of anime tropes, the 'saved at the last second' thing is used so many times in SC that it gets pretty silly.\n\nI think the game could've had a little less of the same kind of content as First Chapter. Things like fetch quests walking around Liberl to progress the story. A playthrough of SC can easily take 70 hours. I wouldn't have minded it being some hours shorter and having less of the same from FC.\nIn a way because of recycling many areas SC obsoletes FC content wise, which isn't necessarily a good thing. They're two halves of the same story, and the first half should still be fun to revisit after playing SC.\n\nThe battle system is fun, but like First Chapter normal difficulty doesn't have many challenging encounters if you use all the tools at your disposal. While it's easy to make your own challenges by setting limitations you can't be expected to know which ones work well on your first playthrough.\nThis is personal preference but being able to mindlessly beat certain bosses by repeating the same strategy draws me out of the story, so better difficulty options could make it more fun.\nHard and Nightmare difficulty don't appear balanced without a New Game+ save file. Most people seem to agree that the final prologue boss is impossible to beat without getting a lucky pattern when starting a new save. Difficulties apart from normal were unlocked after beating the game once in the PSP version so it's not intentional but still unfortunate.\n\nJust like in First Chapter all animations in battles are still unskippable and watching them makes up a lot of time in a playthrough. I didn't mind the slow pace caused by this because the game is so good overall. But I'm sure it could get annoying, especially on repeat playthroughs.\n\nIn short, if you enjoyed the first chapter this is a must buy. It's a bigger game that expands on the world and directly continues the same story bringing it to a satisfying end. The game is well paced without much filler and has an impressive endgame. The combat system is fun and tactical but on normal difficulty will not be particularly challenging for veterans of the first game. A great soundtrack brings the story and combat together nicely.\nFor people new to the series I would still recommend starting with First Chapter, since SC assumes you remember what happens there without recapping it.","November 4, 2015","true","69.7"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

SC's average run will probably be around 70-80 hours give or take.\nWhat SC excels in is building upon the first titles gameplay in pretty much every sense. Party management, character skills, and it's turn based combat have all had tweaks and updates in SC. It's as addictive and enjoyable as ever, with the added bulk of choosing from a bigger selection of part members as the game goes on.\n\nHowever, Some of the games story elements leave me a bit impartial to it when compared to FC.\nI don't exactly agree with the games pacing either, which gives a prologue/tutorial that overstays it's welcome for returning players.\nOnce the game builds up it becomes appearent that most of the game is running across FC's world in an opposing direction with additions of previously sealed off areas, this could be a turn off for some, but I managed to enjoy it regardless.\n\nIn short:\nIt's a good lengthy follow-up to FC, I'll just be the odd one out in saying I enjoyed FC more.","December 29, 2015","true","77.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

That should explain my playtime\n\n\nThis game is what I call a proper sequel, it jumps straight to where the last game ended and spares no second to throw you in it's plot. You visit the same places and talk to the same people, however, the circumstances are different. The game gives off the feeling of continuity that a lot of sequels fail to live up to, an environment that progresses along with the player.\n\nHaving just recently finished LoH ♥♥♥♥ FC, the intro of SC was gratifying for me in the sense that I immediately get to jump to exactly where I left off, no vague introductions, direct to the point I've been craving for. After the rush of familiarity settles, you quickly become oriented to the world that you've already explored. You're confident that you know every nook and canny, you're ready to sprint and blaze through the game...but not so fast Mr. Sonic the Hedgehog. Although the map is still technically the same, the quests will push you in places that were inaccessible before. This gives the Liberl the aura of authentic reality, just because you can't go somewhere doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's a world that you happened to explore not a world that happened because you're exploring it.\n\n\nPlot-wise, a lot foreshadowing pays off and more of those questions are answered although not all. This game may fall short in novelty in terms of the "first time" adventure experience (since you've already been here) but it doubles your vision, letting you see the bigger picture as your role increases in relevance to the events you couldn't affect before, hence giving you the satisfaction from all your hard work in the previous title.\n\n\n\nThe battles are harder but you and your friends are stronger. Having more skills, orbment patterns, and party members really gives you the creative freedom to develop your own fighting style. Thanks to these upgrades, you can try multiple "builds" to tackle bosses using your own personal style. It also gives you more reason to leave no chest unturned and no monster unslayed.\n\n\n\nCharacters are as lovable as ever, though not all get the equal amount of spotlight they had during the FC, but they don't fade into the background either. Your choices on whom your party is made up of greatly affects the important and minor dialogues, this really increases the game's replay value as well as giving the player a personal touch on how to influence the flow of the story. You can really explore each character's personality in-depth in this game compared to FC. Their uniqueness really shines as their responses to different situations vary greatly (depending on who's on your party) PLUS, they don't just randomly speak up they actually interact with the rest of your party which leads to some of the funniest moments in RPG I've ever witnessed, all the more reason to replay and mix up your party.\n\n\nThe game feels faster than the first for me, maybe because of the sense of urgency in the plot that doesn't give a lot of room to breathe, but don't let that fool you, though there may be less "official" grace periods, you still have plenty of time to finish every quest and simply explore the world. Personally I was just so engulfed by the story that I really felt it was a rush against time and blazed my way through the game because I wanted a happy resolution ASAP. Eagerly looking forward for my replay as I'll surely take it slow next time around. I hope XSEED works on the Third Chapter, having things end here might just give me blue-rpg-balls.\n\nIf you need any more opinions about the game, just ask the NPCS, I'm sure they'll give you a piece of their individual minds.","November 24, 2015","true","0.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

SC is the second game of the series set in Liberl, so play the First Chapter first.\n\nThe story is stunning. There are trips and turns all over the place in which you can never guess what will happen next. The character interaction is stellar. It can be hilarious at time (cue Olivier), but serious at others. The characters fit together to create a perfect setting. The NPCs all have their own story. They don't seem like just NPCs, but people that actually have a life and don't rely on the player characters so much to do everything. They travel around and react to different situations in the game. The villians have their own reasons to be the villian and not just "because lel"\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good. The battle screen uses a grid based system, where positioning matters. Staying close together increases your chances of taking AOE damage, but makes healing and buffing easier. The orbment system allows you to customize what your characters do... especially people like Estelle who have balanced orbment slot setup. Art casters (magic casters) became more balanced vs taking physical attackers than in FC. Sidequests don't seem repetitive (except a very certain thief), and can range from monster hunting to helping a guy impress a girl by keeping sober while drinking lots of alcohol... (don't ask.)\n\nThe music brings it all together. Falcom Sound Team jdk really does do an amazing job at creating music that fits into the story.\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget the localization team that brought this game to the West. Hats off to XSEED for pushing through a project that was cursed by Murphy's Law.\n\nTLDR: Buy this game right now.\n\nP.S.

Trails in the Sky Second Chapter completes this metaphor absolutely. Trails in the Sky 3rd, a bridge installment in the series, answers lingering questions for details/characters from FC and SC, but the most important conflicts and holes resolve by the end of SC, a massive Japanese adventure wargame. It's no coincidence that, going by interpretations of the Japanese name for this franchise ("Kiseki"), Trails in the Sky also means Miracle in the Sky. Falcom, back in the mid-2000s when they were juggling games like Ys Origin, Gurumin, and Xanadu Next within a tight schedule, released SC to finish a JRPG epic of local scale, one they needed to make when FC proved too little. XSEED's localization of this game, meanwhile,  approaches the miraculous, augmenting it with PC-exclusive improvements even long-time Kiseki fans in East Asia have been wanting. The only caution I must offer to series neophytes: try playing through FC before tackling SC (at worst you can read/watch an LP for the story). Much of SC's hidden story depth depends on you making connections with events and characters revealed in the prequel, and playing FC makes the process of learning all this more satisfying.\n\nI'll be direct about SC's flaws: accessibility + quality-of-life features are in limited supply, and new, non-East Asian players accustomed to refined menu systems could have a rough time playing SC (and FC to a lesser extent). Sara, the programmer for the Steam/GOG PC version, did a great job making SC's launch smoother compared with FC's, but perhaps it would have taken much too long to fix how you switch playable characters' equipment when in Camp mode. At every point in SC where you have too many characters to fit into your 4-member battle set-up, you need to manually reset party formation just so you can access non-party-mandatory characters' items and Orbments (personal instruments needed for casting magic/having stat bonuses during battle). This becomes tedious later on when your full party reaches 10 members and beyond. Falcom could have let you switch between every character instantaneously when at HQ areas! Then comparing equipment between characters and specializing your immediate party would be easier and faster, something that feels protracted in the final chapter but also earlier. I'll say the same for SC not giving you an Orbment Quartz to increase your in-game running speed. The reasons Falcom gives in-game for you not having fast travel are fine, but not providing a means of fast-ish travel when you want it is disappointing. Also, few if any of the in-game animations can be skipped, which drags out playtime more than necessary.\n\nThe writing style in this game is predominantly like that of a play, where telling, not showing per se, is critical. I personally love the dialogue in FC and SC, as there's plenty of nuance to conversations and internal monologue for main characters. But more than a few characters wait around during the story for the right time and place to reveal more about themselves, which can seem evasive on the scenario writers' part. The gambit here is that Liberl is so multi-faceted that much of the kingdom and its characters needs description, then mystery. At no point did I ever LOL at the story Falcom's written here—I laughed with it for most of my playthrough, rarely feeling coddled. Other JRPGs would handle MCs and non-player characters like Joshua and Mirano in a ham-fisted manner. The level of emotional contrast and development of character relationships in SC is complex, yet never for complexity's sake. When death finally comes, it's only after you've gotten to know these characters so well, almost as if you were there in person alongside Estelle. All the while comedy in Trails in the Sky has both levity that stands out and implications of despair, landmines which bomb you into thinking deeply about what you've read. Those expecting darkness akin to stories like Berserk or Watchmen aren't going to find that here, but SC, within its trope and genre confines, runs a roller-coaster spectrum of introspection and plot twists bound to entertain and affirm its central theme of mutual redemption under powerful skies.\n\nDungeons in this game aren't strong, though I can't say they're awful. Chapter 7 illustrates this by having a few new dungeons, half of which smartly adapt their region's characteristics into cool areas to explore, the other half being easy dull corridors. What is clever, though, is the final chapter remixing FC's last dungeon's concept, and that's not the only standout. There's generally a sense of history to dungeons both old and new in this game, which is essential.\n\nSC isn't a hard game, though unlike FC it's not easy-ish. Having a battle system where you can view, then manipulate turn order using stat buffs/de-buffs, the Move command, and effects like Faint and AT Delay makes for dynamic fights even against mob enemies in dungeons and on the overworld. There's more than a few challenging monsters to exterminate as a member of the Bracer Guild, and many ways you can beat the game using different party members. On top of the non-linearity found here, you're still a licensed vigilante after everything that happened in FC, so fulfilling side-quests is a helpful duty. You're encouraged to get as many Bracer Points in each chapter so you can earn items from the Guild, and the side-quests in this game are genuinely fun, developing many NPCs in detail other genre examples reserve only for plot-relevant individuals. Such a mix of battling mobs in new areas, doing exterminations for the Guild, fighting off members of the Society and their peons, and ultimately making a huge difference in the lives of Liberl's citizens helps you embody the game's heroes and their struggles. Chapter 8 has all of the above, in fact, yet still manages to avoid being formulaic due to things I cannot spoil. Formulas definitely persist throughout SC, particularly the monster-of-the-week plot structure defining the chapters between the prologue and your return to the Bose region—I don't think being a little predictable in that sense hurts SC, making but a mere nick.\n\nThose ragging on graphics might be ignoring Falcom's great art-style and world design here; same goes for elevating SC's music at FC's expense when both clearly play to strengths needed for their stories. SC's OST introduces many new context themes for cinema scenes, dialogues, and boss fights which heighten the adrenaline and gravity of so many plot and exploration sequences. Once again the series leitmotifs are in play, constantly renewing in the face of complacency just like the dramatis personae. I won't hesitate to proclaim the game's score as era-defining for the developers, though Ys Origin's music is more familiar over here. The graphics have aged, especially whenever you visits areas where backgrounds are large 2D backdrops meant to evoke space without crushing (presumably) under-powered PCs Japanese players used in 2006, but the Tetracyclic Towers and other places still impress. Monster designs here are underrated, ranging from benign to alien often even in earlier parts of the game; Art and Craft animations, though slow (and which can't be skipped, argh), are superb to watch, especially when you've just decimated an entire battle's worth of foes. Bugs aside, the optimized performance and engine scaling means anyone can enjoy SC the way they wish on most PCs, even toasters. Falcom, using their limited resources, did their best to invest reused content from FC with new dungeons/areas and even a few dramatic changes to centers like Rolent and Grancel. You'll be investigating every nook and cranny of Liberl in SC, such that each vista's implanted in memory.\n\nSC is honest, reverent Japanese-made video gaming, deserving its place in the limelight.","November 12, 2015","true","112.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I recommend this game to every JRPG fan....unless you REALLY hate text. This game has a lot of dialogues, it always flow exceptionally well but If you don't like text, go see some gameplay footage before buying the game. The dialogues are always good to read, they're never meaningless and are very well written. They make you laugh and sometimes you feel the need to shed a tear.\n\nThis game focus heavily on story and character development but even if you're not interested in theses you may find Trails in the sky sc to be one of your favorite games thanks to it's gameplay. I think the trails's series gameplay is awesome. This game use the same battle system than the first chapter and makes it even better. The heavier emphasis on crafts (rather than arts) makes regular battles faster. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Trails in the sky's battle system, it's a turn by turn battle system that takes place on a field in which you can move your characters. You have to consider both you positioning and the time bar that indicates when comes your turn to succeed. It's a solid system that requires the use of careful planning. Don't worry tough, the game's difficulty is well balanced and if you found it too hard or too easy, you can always change the game's difficulty settings.\n\nI recommend anyone who haven't played the first game to play it before playing this one as sc's story begin the day after fc's ending. I won't spoil the first game just in case. I don't think anyone ever disliked Trails in the sky's story. It is at worst good. I personally think the story is amazing. Far better than theses confusing and complicated stories that makes no sense. If you're expecting a revolutionary story, you're at the wrong place. Trails in the sky's story is simple yet excellent and it's better that way. The game have some really good plot twists and the way the story is presented to you makes it even better. If you're a fan of good stories, this is a must have and I'm sure the story will please you and you'll end up thinking like me that this story could only be surpassed by the trails games to come.\n\nStory and gameplay are top-notch but sometimes, you need you take a break from all that non-stop greatness. It's at theses time that you can fish, take a look at the casino or take on some sides quests and there are a LOT of side quests. If you're tired of side quests, you can read the in-game news or read an in-game novel. Yes there are in-game novels and they are very good. What you'd expect from Trails in the sky. There are three sets of books in sc (don't forget to check out the embassies). One of theses sets is only obtainable by talking to npcs. What!! Talking to npcs? That's boring! may be what you're thinking right now but worry not. Talking to npcs IS fun in this game. They each have their own stories. Not always relevant to the main plot and the writing in this game make dialogues flow very well. This game should serve as a model for JRPGs to come. Hopefully, it will sell well and the future installments will be localized. There is one thing that I forgot to mention higher and this may be what will make you like the game the most, The soundtrack. It's a Falcom game! Do I need to say anymore? In case I do, In my opinion, this game has one of the best soundtracks ever created. I particularly like fateful confrontation and silver will which sound greater than ever when they play in-game. This game is a masterpiece that will keep you occupied for at least 60 hours and there's a new game plus option. In case you were wondering about replayability. You can choose between numerous characters to make a party of four. Each of them having different dialogue. You also have a choice to make early on between two characters that will accompany you during half the game.\n\nIf you haven't played the first game, I urge you to go play it. If you have played the first game and still aren't sure whether or not to buy this one then you should know that this game practically take everything FC did and makes it better. If you liked this game than you should try to play the other game of the series At the date I'm writing this, the only games available to us non-Japanese speakers are The Trails in the sky duology(Yes, I did say duology. The 3rd chapter is more like a bridge to future games and isn't needed to finish the trails in the sky duology). The cold steel games which are part of the same series should come out soon  (2015 for cold steel 1 and 2016 for cold steel 2).","November 15, 2015","true","160.4"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The land of Liberl is still a living, breathing thing, and Estelle's is not the only story that unfolds. Keeping up with NPCs and their travels and experiences keeps being fun, and there are many mentions of past exploits, and if you did extremely well in the first game, a carry-over save bonus is going to be rather neat.\n\nNow, it's not wrong to say that SC is "more of the same" compared to FC, but that's not a bad thing, oh not at all - in fact, they were supposed to be a single game in the first place...but then the project kind of got too big to handle. Just for reference, playing through both, I put 150+ hours into it (maybe minus 5-10 thanks to reloads and distractions). Thanks to that, however, many things I would say about SC are already covered in my aforementioned review of FC. Go read that for more info.\n\nThe protagonist dynamic, however, has changed. While the first game had us guide both Estelle and Joshua through a story that was bigger than themselves, this one is Estelle's show, this time it's personal, and her growth as a character is simply wonderful to follow. And yet even so, things happen on a larger scale, many other characters could be heroes of this same story if it was told from their perspective.\n\nA nice refresher from the common JRPG problem of static and homogenous world being driven purely by the actions of the protagonist - quite the opposite, a huge national crisis in the kingdom of Liberl has the population, both civilian and uniformed, act realistically (as in, there sure are *some* people who talk of doom and gloom, while others ponder more immediate practical concerns), and even an international response to the affair will occur. Estelle herself also brings a nice refresher with a protagonist that's not a cynical, brooding bishonen type with lots of emotional baggage - even managing to help snap Joshua out of it somehow.\n\nThe battle system is pretty much the same as in First, arts and crafts and all; with the addition of "chain crafts" that lets you have several characters attack together. Limit break interrupts are still a thing, and managing the initiative order to steal turn bonuses from the enemy is still what will mean the difference between life and death (or at least "life and a distinctly more battered and bloodied life"). Good luck beating the later bosses without a sound tactical plan.\n\nThe Nihon Falcom musical team brings back some awesome tracks from FC and adds some awesome new tracks (my favorite being a certain very dynamic boss theme), but Falcom games having good music is nothing new. Even so, "Silver Will" must be one of the best soundtracks ever created.\n\nFinal judgment: Highly recommended, but whatever you do, *don't* start playing this one before you finish the first game.\n\nPS: Oh, there's also a fishing minigame now.\n\nPPS: Sieg is one seriously overpowered bird.","November 9, 2015","true","83.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It's basically the same style dungeons and combat.  Combat has slightly evolved in that now you can chain combos together which gives a nice option for those time when you need to hit a few enemies, do burst damage, or just manipulate the turn order to line yourself up for a critical hit.\nEven the opening "Training" dungeon is quite large and the early bosses can be somewhat challenging.

It's not perfect, but it comes close in pretty much every area.\n\nThe gameplay is as refreshing as ever; the battles are still on a tactical grid, where you and your enemies take turns to attack each other (and depending on how fast you are, you can potentially take multiple turns before your opponent even moves your way). However, there were several features added to the Trails in the Sky battle system.\nThe addition of combo crafts, where you and your whole party can gang up and wreak havoc on enemies is a fun feature, though outclassed towards the end of the game.\nNew spells are also available for use; if you detested Lt. Lorence spamming Silver Thorn, you can now do the same to those annoying monsters blocking your path, among other great spells.The overworld has a few minigames to help melt the time away, such as a casino and fishing. Fishing's especially something to note, since there's an achievement tied to it, if that's your thing.\nAdditionally, XSEED's even taken some PSP-exclusive content and backported it to the PC version. One of those features won't be seen until the end of the game, but it's worth the wait.\n\nHowever, the overall story lacks a bit, especially when compared to FC's gradual but well-tempered buildup. Excluding the Prologue, every chapter from Chapter 1 and including Chapter 5 is rather formulaic in nature; strange happenings in a province lead to Estelle and friends investigating them, only to find out that an Ouroboros Enforcer is behind it all.\nThe game picks up pace during Chapters 6 and 7, but leaves you at a pretty bad drop during Chapter 8 (which I can honestly say was my least favorite chapter in all the Trails games I've played, gameplay-wise). The Final Chapter more than makes up for the tedium of Chapter 8, however, and wraps up Estelle and Joshua's story very cleanly.\n\nSpeaking of which, the characters and dialogue in SC are top notch; while the plot may be a bit predictable at times, the characters more than make up for the lacking moments.\nParty members receive actual character development (save Schera, who doesn't really change much), and characters you may have despised in FC have a chance at redemption; Agate comes to mind easily. Additionally, new characters enter the fray, and they're just as good as the established characters; praise Kevin Graham.\nThe dialogue flows naturally, and outside of one very, very small encounter in Zeiss, I couldn't help but eagerly read every line of dialogue that popped up. Even NPCs are relatively lively, which you might not expect from a JRPG where they might get just a single flavor line.\n\nLastly, the quality of the game is just perfect; I haven't encountered any technical issues at all, despite the somewhat troubled localization process. It even works quite well using Wine and/or WineSkin, if you're using Linux or OSX.\n\nHere's to Trails in the Sky The 3rd, Trails of Cold Steel II, and hopefully Zero/Ao no Kiseki!","May 3","true","111.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

There might be mild spoilers in this review.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of all of the story threads this game introduced. The first game had a cunning and scary villain who puts together a grand conspiracy, and even though it doesn't give you all the answers up front it gave you enough motivation to want to stop him. In SC, there are too many bad guys and their characterization is hit and miss. They are just doing Bad Stuff that seems mostly isolated in each chapter and you have to stop them. And even when you do stop them it was just "part of their plan", which is a common thing on both moral sides in this game. It's really silly how many times something happens that seems like a pro for your party but turns out it was just part of the bad dude's plans, or part of Estelle's dad's plan, the game overuses this trope so hard. It also overuses the whole "bad guy is about to [actually kill] someone but then someone shows up and saves them at the last minute" trope. Maybe the first game had these issues as well, I don't remember being so annoyed by it. Overall the chapters are hit and miss, as are the villains, and the overarching story doesn't really come together in a very satisfying way like the first game does.\n\nWhat the game does have is a really great arc for most of its main characters. Estelle and Joshua shine throughout, there's some great sisterly conversations between Estelle, Kloe, and Scharz, and overall the game does a great job of giving you a lot of party members you care about. It's actually kinda disappointing you can only pick 4 of them at a time,  as the game is really good about giving your optional party members dialog and you miss out on a lot of it. That's a good problem to have, honestly, given how rote a lot of RPG party members can be. Even when the overarching narrative gets drab at times, the main characters really carry this story and ultimately make it worthwhile.\n\nThe combat remains strong...though the more powerful nature of the quartz you get in SC compared to the first means that it is much easier to trivialize the combat by the end of the game. The whole experience could have been about 15 hours shorter, there's so much combat for the sake of combat towards the end. Chapter 7 has a bunch of boss battles that seem ultimately pointless (and are indeed lampshaded as such by the characters). The world of Liberl is still an amazingly detailed place to run around in, which is good because you will sure be doing a lot of backtracking in the main story. What makes the backtracking more bareable is that the game is really good about changing the NPC dialog based on stuff that has happened in the world, which makes it nice to just walk around talking to random people. Graphically the game is of course fairly primitive, but it's still very good at making each environment unique, and the final area of the game is amazing.\n\nThis game doesn't make good on all of the promise of FC's amazing cliffhanger ending, but it's still a stunningly crafted RPG world with great main characters. If you've played FC I definitely recommend it.","December 24, 2015","true","76.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The stakes get to ridiculous heights towards the end, which I couldn't help but love. You also learn more about the previous game's characters touching pasts. The same goes for all the bosses of this game, who your party members have somekind of history with. It really is great to learn more about what the kind of persons they are who you're fighting! And realize their true motives.\n\nThe combat has new added depth to it with the new Orbal Arts and 3-ranks system to it. You can give each character unique builds with those. Although certain characters do specialize in specific school of Orbs. The boss fights are really excellent, and offer great amount of challenge where your tactics and timings play important role.\n\nI gotta give extra praise for the finale chapter which is just excellent in design of its boss fights, but also adding a completely new area to explore your way through. It's optional, but learning about the history of the place through old computer terminals was something I found really cool.\n\nI dare say it's one of the best J-RPG series of all time! The cast of characters is super likeable, the story is really engaging and yeah I really can't wait for the 3rd and final chapter!","March 22","true","101.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

No, I am not talking about lame anime trope nonsense like tsunderes, schoolgirls, or any of that garbage. I am talking about: well-writen characters that provide fun dialogue, an insanely deep storyline that keeps you entertained all the way through, and a plot that ties between both games smoothly while wrapping up nicely.\n\nI wish I can tell you how great the stories and characters are without spoiling any of it but it's just something you have to play for yourself. Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nIt's a masterfully crafted video game and we are blessed to have the best localization possible thanks to XSEED.\n\nBattle-wise, it's easily one of the greatest turn-based combat systems out there because of how fun your strategic options are. Position is important for optimal plays, buffing allies actually makes a difference rather than being a minor nusiance and the same goes for debuffing. And lastly, its customization option makes anyone and everyone a fun and viable character. Everyone has a place in the party, in terms of both the story and party composition. Unfortunately, the battle speed IS a bit on the slow side but that shouldn't turn you off completely.\n\nIn terms of content, this is by no means a grinding game. I spent 87 hours on this game and this was all for the story, doing sidequests, and exploring every nook and cranny for all of the possible secrets in the game. All of those hours spent was pure fun and not because I was grinding my characters up, getting lost in a dungeon, or retrying difficult boss fights over and over again. But that's just me being crazy in love with this game, anyone else can beat it in probably even half the time if you really wanted to.\n\nLike I said, this is one of the best jRPGs of all time. It shares a lot of good traits as Xenoblade Chronicles so if you've played that, then you'd love the Trails duo. Please give this game a try or recommend it to a friend so we can support XSEED, Falcom, and more masterpieces like these coming over to us!","November 26, 2015","true","106.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberxspeed/recommended/251290/","cyberxspeed","Flame-X","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberxspeed/","207 products in account","This is by far the best JRPG I've played in recent years. Trails in the Sky FC was pretty much the appetizer of the trilogy, but here is the real meat of the story. The game starts right after that heartbreaking cliffhanger from the first game, so obviously it's absolutely required you play FC before SC, otherwise nothing will make sense to you.\n\nI think Trails in the Sky SC's biggest strength is definitely the writing. It's a surprisingly well thoughtout world, richly developed and lovable cast of characters, and memorable story that will reward you with a satisfying JRPG experience. I would even go as far as saying it's better than any of the Final Fantasy or Tales of franchise I played. Although the characters are pretty much your standard anime or Japanese game character archetypes, each one is fleshed out and executed well. The interactions between characters are gold, especially anything involving Estelle and Oliver since they add comedic value. While I can't say much about SC's storyline due to avoiding spoilers, if you thought FC's story was great, well you're in for one hell of a ride. FC took me around 20 hours to beat, SC took me 60 hours. Just let that sink in. Yes, the story has a few extra layers added but it's not overly complicated as long as you pay attention.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as FC but with some improvements to the turn based battle system. I really liked the addition of chained special attacks which let's you use multiple characters attack at once. More artes have been added and crafts upgraded for stronger effects. Other than that, just expect FC's gameplay.\n\nI would describe the visual to be modernized retro style graphics you see in playstation rpg games, except a lot sharper. You can tell the production values just by looking at it and the presentation. Let's not forget the wonderful soundtrack. It adds a perfect level of immersiveness invoking a spectrum of emotions on certain scenes of events.\n\nLastly, I really have to give props to XSEED for their amazing efforts in localizing SC. They released the game not out of business/profit priority, but labor of love. And double props to them for announcing the final game of the trilogy that's currently in the works. While SC can be seen as the finale story, there are some loose ends that will be resolved in the 3rd chapter (I hope). So once the 3rd chapter is up for pre-order, I'll immediately snatch that up paying full price showing my support just like how I did with FC and SC. Thank you XSEED for letting me experience such a magnificent game.\n\nNormally, I don't replay JRPGs as much, but this is worth going through the 2nd time. Overall, Trails in the Sky SC gets my highest recommendation for any RPG players out there.","April 13","true","68.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The first time I played FC was back in 2011 when I was in the 3rd year of junior high,today I'm sitting at the 7th semester in a university.

They're putting a lot of effort into this universe especially how they're able to tell the specific economies of cities & how every new technology affect the NPCs,even NPC have their own story!\n\nI guess playing Trails is like playing a novel book in a form of video game,the shocking ending in FC is what makes me patient enough to wait. May not as great as the JRPGs giant like FF,Tales, or maybe Suikoden,but Trails have something that the other great JRPGs don't have.

And isn't that the truth - Trails is BACK. The atmosphere hasn't changed much from the first game, and honestly, that's a great thing to see. The characters are very lighthearted & happy go lucky, despite their being a lot of bad stuff going on. It's a refreshing break from other RPGs, where cracking so much as a smile is a rarity. Trails' approach to storytelling, combined with the quality of writing and attention to detail, put it above most JRPG franchises out there.\n\nThe Bracer quests are also back, and while the ol' familiar "X Monster needs to be eliminated" request, there's also plenty of new & unique sidequests to go on. It's pretty amazing how varied the dozens upon dozens of quests are, but if you see one you don't like, you needn't worry about missing out on the rewards because the game is generous enough to give you what's required to get by well with just picking the ones you fancy (personally, I try to do them all).\n\nA lot of music from the original game has popped back up without so much as an alternate mix, which is somewhat disappointing, honestly. I do like the soundtrack to the original game, and while I do like the new additions made in SC, I feel the original pieces could've done with a bit of oomph to help them stand out, y'know?\n\nOne thing I will say though is that you definitely want to play FC before jumping into SC. Not only will EVERYTHING make a lot more sense, but you can effortlessly carry over some of your choices & interactions from the first game into SC, which will make the experience both more personal & enjoyable.\n\nJust like FC before it, I recommend Trails in the Sky SC 110%. SC is probably the stronger entry, but the entire series deserves playing through from start to... Well, SC and beyond.\n\nThanks to XSEED for bringing this over!","November 3, 2015","true","49.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Before playing FC my favorite RPG series was Fire Emblem. I love the Fire Emblem series for the huge amount of character interaction, the great gameplay, great music, great stories, extremely charming graphics/animations/art styles, and amazing replay value. In my opinon those features are what make RPGs the best video game genre.\n\nTrails in the sky FC alone bests Fire Emblem in most of those aspects and is equal in art style and gameplay. Obviously two very different games but speaking in over all RPG experience. Add the Second Chapter (which picks up mere hours after FC's story making it basically the same game) and there is no longer any room for comparison. There is just too much (good meaty) content in Trails in the sky for any other RPG to compare. There are 13 games in the Fire emblem series and I believe there is more content in just these 2 games.\n\nIf you plan on trying out FC just prepare to sit back and read for hours on end. These games are mostly reading, they are RPGs after all. Don't go in expecting action packed gameplay or amazing AAA graphics. You are going to read, explore, talk to 100s of unique NPCs who all have something to say, read, do sidequests that have their own little storylines, read, and sometimes play through some satisfying turnbased combat (which in my opinon is on par with the fire emblem games)\n\nAlso Hard mode in SC is very challenging and really forces you to utilize the items/skills at your disposal immediately after the tutorial. If you are looking for a challenge then SC delivers. You can also choose Hard for FC as well although I haven't tried FC on hard.","November 1, 2015","true","147.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Both the first game and this sequal are in a word, amazing.  With a deep story, engaging combat system with massive options for customization, and characters you cannot help but love, this game has it all.  An absolutely wonderful gaming experience from front to back.  I salute the men and women who made this game.

It everything the first games, but heavily improves on almost every aspects. It even more challenging then the first game. The reason why this game is good, it based on the game's dedication on it npcs for world building, and the emotional baggage that affect each and every character throughout the game. This is easily one of the best JRPG on PC, if not of this generation. Objectively, the gameplay requires strategy over mindlessly hacking and slashing your way through, thus creating a much needed challange. In addition, the massive improvement on the orb system is so much fun. I waited 4-5 years for this game, and the payoff so far is Superb and Amazing. If you haven't played the first one, do so now.

It feels more like the "do it yourself RPG Kit" ... it´s nothing you´ve never seen before, but nevetheless - Falcom and XSeed with their localization still manage it to make you play further on - you´ll still want to know how the story will develop any further and how the individual paths of your (possible) party members will turn out. In my case, thats something no game since DAO has archieved.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid and fun to play - combat is strategic and deep enough, to keep you busy with various Quartz / Magic combinations but at the same time it´s easy and understandable enough for not to overburden you - in my opinion it´s simply almost the perfect mix.\n\nOne last point: in this game you´ll read. You´ll read LOTS. I´d probably even say, this game (as well as FC) is almost as much a VN as it is an RPG. XSeed managed it to localize and write it in a way, which is easy-going and fun to read (at least for me, as an vivid reader) and at the same time, it won´t overburden people not native in the english language, as myself, for example. So, once more, i´d like to tip my hat to XSeed for granting us a game which must have been one hell-of-a-struggle to translate and localize. Please keep going like that, your work on these two games as well on the others you´ve published, is very very appreciated.\n\nOkay - last but not least - Recommendation or not ?\n\nWell ... for people like myself, who already "devoured" FC I don´t think I have to recommend it, do I ? But what about other players, perhaps even those never to have laid hands on a JRPG ? If you like classical RPGs, like Baldurs Gate or Albion ... I think, you should give it a try - get the first part, it might turn out quite an interesting experience.","November 8, 2015","true","57.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

And if there's nine chapters, I'm pretty sure the amount of playtime for SC is going to be double or even triple that of FC (I averaged about 45 hours in FC; 90 in two playthroughs). There's TONS of content in the game and, if you are playing the game with an imported save from FC, it's worth it to talk to all the NPCs. They actually remember you! And stuff you did! There's even a SC achievement for talking to a specific NPC multiple times!\n\nEven aside from the frankly remarkable amount of effort that went into integrating the two games (enough I was grateful I replayed FC a few weeks before SC's launch), the story itself is compelling, the character interactions are great, and I spent pretty much every cut scene going "why am I not fraps'ing this????" Even more, there's enough variation to make replay worth it as there's a choice early on if you want to travel with Schera or Agate as your primary companion (basically filling the space Joshua did in FC); I understand the main jist of the quests, main, side, and hidden, aren't changed but the interactions and dialogue do have some differences depending on your choice (for the record, the Agate path which I'm playing is great and every single interaction between Agate and Olivier is basically magic).\n\nAs far as game play, there's a lot less bugs than I would expect from a freshly launched game; especially since I remember some of the gamebreaking bugs of FC's launch. Basically the only thing that actually effects gameplay is the lack of chest phases (which I read on the forums that will be fixed in a later patch?). There's about five or six different chest phrases that seem to be on rotation, rather than individual phases of the first game. Something that's a minor disappointment but ultimately I'd rather have the game than the return of Chairman Meow.","October 30, 2015","true","88.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elkichen/recommended/251290/","elkichen","Kichen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elkichen/","820 products in account","I have played this game for 75.8 hours, and the best part is it has taken just over two weeks to do it. Once you get sucked into this story, you'll only want more and more. I rarely write reviews but I'll do it for this one. Let's get into the meat of it.\n\nTrails on the Sky: SC starts immediately after the conclusion of the First Chapter and concludes the story of Estelle. Just so I don't spoil anything accidentally, I'll just say the identity of your enemy is revealed to you from the beginning, which is a nice change of pace compared to most JRPGs, which throw evil guy after evil guy at you only to reveal there's an even bigger evil guy pulling the strings from behind.\n\nThis doesn't make the journey to beat that enemy boring, though. The lengths said enemy will go in order to fulfill their evil plot will make you shudder every step of the way. And there resides one of the strongest selling points of the game. You will FEEL what's happening in that beautifully crafted pixel world. The anger, the joy, the fear... every character is so well written and developed that their emotions can touch you quite deeply. We should thank the localization team for that, too, thank you based XSEED and Carpe Fulgur for a job well done.\n\nThe attention to detail gets a honorable mention here too. There are TONS of dialogue lines which you will never see in a single playthrough, but only because every possible choice (mainly party configuration choice) you make is covered. Special dialogues if certain characters are present, interaction between characters even in the most menial of sidequests, a lot of NPCs reacting to a particular teammate because they know each other... Detail, detail everywhere, and everything adds up to the feeling that those characters have ties to people and places, that they live in cities and know half the neighbourhood, that they're not just personality clichés detached from the world and designed just to fill a particular role in your party.\n\nThat's about it for the story and immersion parts. The graphics are... well, Trails graphics. If you're interested enough in the game to look at the reviews, you don't give a damn about the graphics. The only particularly ugly thing I've noticed is that certain characters are introduced by showing a full screen image of them against the background, and the borders are BADLY pixelated. This could be easily patched, so pls fix. Slight framedrops/stutter occur in certain areas, I'm almost 100% certain it's a game issue, since it always happens in the same places (Grancel entrance, for example) and my computer runs it at 120 FPS with zero problems the rest of the time.\n\nThe soundtrack is so exquisite I have a playlist of jdk songs saved on youtube so I can listen to it whenever I'm just fooling around in my computer. A friend of mine described it like this: "I'm feeling nostalgia listening to songs of a game genre I've never played".\n\nFinally, the only downside I can think about: the game abuses the mechanic of having someone appear juuuust a little too late and save the day for our heroes. It happens a number of times and it's pretty well explained so it always makes sense but... how about appearing five minutes earlier and saving me the trouble of going through that boss fight?","January 4","true","75.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That being said, I don't regret a single hour of this beautiful sequel.\n\nAlthough the gameplay hasn't significantly changed much from the original, the magic (orbment) and skills (crafts) system has been expanded upon tremendously. The original three pages of magic has been expanded to five; introducing newer strategies to the abundant amount of character choices. The new skill, chains, finds itself to be useful in some scenarios. These additions made the gameplay always refreshing, seeing that I've played more than 100 hours fighting shiny pom poms.\n\nThe team system has significantly improved since the first chapter. This shouldn't be a surprise since the entire game revolves around changing teammates and parties, but first let me explain the difference. (Minor Spoilers) In the original game, two characters (Joshua and Estelle) would always be playable characters while each chapter offers two other characters that make up the rest of your party. Each chapter changed the party and thus your team strategy. The game struck a nice balance of difficulty and adaptation except for the last chapter. The chapter which allowed you to make your own team with all the characters you've met along the way wasn't very balanced. The enemy encounters grew extremely repetitive and boring, and the final boss could be described in the same manner.\n\nHowever, the second chapter struck a good balance while letting the player create a team themselves. Although the first chapter was pretty repetitive since your options were limited, I found difficult monsters and interesting monster attacks that kept the combat intriguing. In general, bosses were more interesting and carried a 'mood' about them. Again (minor spoilers), but the last chapter's boss fights were beyond amazing. By far the bosses and 'road monsters' are the best thing about Trails in the Sky SC's gameplay.\n\nNow a small paragraph about the OST. I read on a forum somewhere that the OST for SC was supposed to better than FC. For the majority of the game, I questioned this opinion since it reused alot of songs from the first game. But all of a sudden near the end of the game, the soundtrack dramatically improved with new songs. The credits song gave me chills. Good job music writers, although I'd appreciate if the same songs weren't used every single time in the first few chapters.\n\nRetrospectively, I should've talked about the graphics/textures of the game in the first paragraph. If you've gotten used to the graphics in Trails in the Sky FC, then this game should be no problem. Although walking through the same landscape as Trails in the Sky FC is a bit boring, some of the new landscapes introduced are beautiful and well worth it.\n\nStory and characters. Amazing. Marvelous. Hella GOOD JOB Nihon Falcom. Pretty much every character gets their back stories introduced and expanded upon. Some scenes are so fantastic that they definitely should've made a scene select option in the menu. The hidden nature of the Society and some of the plot twists make the game so much more interesting and hooks you back in the next day even after you've spent one entire day playing the game. Afterall, story and character development feels like such a lovely reward after defeating bosses with a sliver of health remaining. By far, Estelle's character development was done beautifully well. My only complaint is that you have to switch around characters in your party to obtain extra dialogue which sometimes can't be done without grinding character levels (looking at you, last area last chapter). Otherwise, the story is great if you enjoy anime stories with a touch of the shounen genre.\n\nHonestly if you enjoyed Trails in the Sky FC, then this game is a must buy. As anyone does, I EXTREMELY HIGHLY recommend playing through the first game first. This game assumes you've already played through FC, so there are many spoilers and the difficulty curve is quite steep in the beginning. If you haven't tried either, I'd recommend buying the FC on sale and testing the waters before you delve deep into this trilogy.\n\nI'm writing this review as I just finished this game and it feels great. However, I can see in the future I'll be impatient and sad waiting for the third chapter. Xseed, you better deliver the damned third chapter or I'll be coming over there with a Bo Staff.","May 21","true","115.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

After playing SC, I can see why FC and SC are split into two parts, and that both are worth getting. I've been following XSEED on their development on translating SC and they weren't kidding about the script size. It's huge and plays a huge factor on why this game is so good.\n\nSC (Second Chapter) is significantly darker than FC (First Chapter) in many respects, but still maintained a light tone throughout. I mean, it goes deeper into the overarching group Ouroboros and explains a lot of the things which FC doesn't.\n\nComparing with other JRPGs, the most unique thing about Legend of Heroes is the parallel storylines that takes place throughout the entire series. Most of the NPCs have their own storyline that runs in parallel with the main story, and sometimes they overlap and change the scripting around based on the actions our heroes take throughout the game. So, while the game can technically be rushed, the full magnitude of the world of Liberal can be appreciated simply by talking to each NPC after completing each milestone. It's a tedius process but it's very very worth it. It brings so much life to the game, it's actually really impressive with the amount of detail they went into the scripting. I can go on and on with examples, lets just say pretty much nearly every NPC with a name has a story one way or another! I would get this game just because of that! And after starting a new game+, not only does all of the main characters have this nostalgic feeling to them, even the NPCs have a nostalgic feeling... something I do not normally get from other games.\n\nWhile SC was significantly darker than FC, both FC and SC stayed very true to oldschool JRPGs. The style, the character development and the unravelling of the main antagonists and twists. The progression and the fact that there's already a diverging storyline early on in the game makes the game have replay value. I honestly did not expect the game to be this thorough, something that I find to be lacking in more modern rpgs. Most playable characters have so many ties to the world and from it there is a great deal of character development throughout the series. Every character was unique and enjoyable. The plot turns in the story was also very good, the cutscenes are great and there were a lot of funny moments. Olivier is my favourite character in the series =P.\n\nThere are also side quirks in the game, like gambling, fishing, and cooking which all ties with how the scripting is handled in the world at various times. They also help you in same way as well so there is incentive to work on them. There are also bracer points to maximize, which gives you reward items and scripting changes as well. There are some puzzles in the game, however they are not an integral part of the game.\n\nThe music is fantastic. The battle system is great, with some battles being very difficult, especially near the end! The customization with the orbments gives some unique tactics throughout the game. Every character also has their own unique S crafts and weapons, which brings additional flavour to how each battle is played out. One major difference between SC and FC are that there are interchangeable characters throughout most of the story, meaning that you can pick, from a group of characters, 4 to take with you to progress the story. This changes the scripting based on what characters you choose, and adds to the replay value to the game.\n\nWhile the graphics is a bit lacking compared with modernized RPGs, I must say it adds to the nostalgic touch to the game. However some might enjoy this because it allows room for the imagination to fill in the gaps. The cutscenes/fight scenes are still very good.  And honestly, albeit the lack of graphics, how Falcom made use of it still captivated me throughout.\n\nWhat can I say, I banked a good 110 hours on this game and that's just online. Looking at some other recommendations some of them banked 200 hours even! As far as the bang for the buck for an RPG is concerned, this game is pretty much worth it, as currently I am paying ~30 cents per hour for the game, and I suspect this number to decrease after this review is published. Most other JRPGs I would expect aronud 50-70 hour play time.\n\nBuy this game, not only because it's good, but also if you also want to support more JPRGs that focuses more on the storyline/character development itself! Also, SC practically one-upped FC in so many ways as well, so if you liked FC then be prepared for a treat!","November 27, 2015","true","116.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was full of praise as to how this game differs from any other JRPG I had played prior to the games in the Legend of Heroes series. As result, I purchased Trails in the Sky Second Chapter (SC) almost immediately after it was released on steam. In terms of gameplay and the overall mechanics in SC, they remain largely identical to FC and therefore there is no need to dwell on them in this review. I recognise that this review probably will not mean much to those who loved FC as it is likely they have already bought and finished SC. Likewise if you did not like FC, then I would be surprised if you are considering buying SC.\nI can confidently say right off the bat that FC and SC together are among the best games I have ever played, with SC expanding on the greatness that was FC.\nThe consequence of playing and adoring FC is that I had extremely high expectations going into SC. Whilst those expectations were entirely met, this time around my review cannot be so clear cut as it was for FC. In order to review this game fairly and without bias, I intend to mention a noticeable flaw I identified because it would be ignorant to ignore it.\n\n*No spoilers*\n\nStory  The story in SC is definitely a step up from FC, with enough plot twists to make you run around the room in excitement... I know I did. Every main character is developed from the first game in a meaningful way. Even Estelle develops from a largely clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person to a more mature... clumsy, hilarious and enthusiastic person.\n\nLike FC, the story is split into a series of well-structured chapters, however in SC the game is separated into 9 different chapters rather than the 4 main chapters in FC. As expected the story neatly follows from FC. My main criticism of the game is based on the first 4 chapters. The problem with these chapters is that by chapter 2, the story gets largely predictable with the similar kind of occurrence happening in each chapter (I'll spare the details). Of course the predictability ends soon after the 4th chapter. This may not necessarily be a problem for many who have played SC, but it did get a tad repetitive, especially in conjunction with the side quests which do not vary that much. However, this is largely where my noticeable criticisms end and I appreciate this is largely a subjective criticism.\n\nTo this day, the 5th and 6th chapters of SC were... Some of the best segments of a game I have played in my entire life... And I have played a lot of games!\nAlthough I will not describe the contents of those chapters, they were the most deeply engaging, emotional and thrilling parts of a game I have ever played, galvanizing anyone into adoring the game. I wish I could describe the details.\nThe ending of the game is satisfying. That is my greatest hope for any sequel of a JRPG. It is far too easy for games to conclude having left more questions than answers. Although there is a cliff-hanger which sets up the Third Chapter (TC), it is not the kind of cliff-hanger which leaves a lack of fulfilment and a taste of disappointment. As I mentioned to a friend, I would not mind if the Third Chapter is never localized... That’s not to say that when it is finished being localized I won't play it. I will buy it on the day it is released! Hell I will stay up all night with a countdown clock till its release! Nevertheless, what I am concluding is that the Second Chapter had a satisfying ending; it felt like the hours I had put into the game actually meant something significant in the end, rather than leaving a lingering anticipation for what happens next.\n\nGameplay There is very little which can be said about gameplay other than it is almost identical to the First Chapter. In my review of FC, I mentioned the way in which gameplay differs from other JRPG's I am familiar with such as games in the Final Fantasy franchise. This difference remains the same in SC. The main new mechanic in SC is the ability to combine attacks with different characters (Chain attacks). They were a nice new addition to the game, but nothing revolutionary. If you loved the gameplay and the battle system in FC, then it follows that you should feel the same about SC.\n\nMusic The first thing I wanted to know when I bought the game is how the music would differ from FC. I have invested hours into listening to the music of FC outside of the game and I will probably spend many hours more listening to FC's OST. I can gladly say, the soundtrack in SC is a masterpiece - my favourites being: 'The Dream Continues,' 'Silver Will' and 'I Swear.' I do not recommend listening to any of the soundtrack before playing the game, solely because of the emotional effect they have within the game. None of the pieces are overused or underused. The first thing I did after finishing the game was search for the pieces on YouTube.\n\nConclusion FC and SC felt like a dream. I say this as the two games felt like perfect games with very few flaws. Although I stated my noticeable criticism of SC, it is insignificant when looking at the overall standard of the game. The characters remain as funny as they were in FC, the story is brilliant, the music is sensational and the localization is without flaws. Only Aidios knows why this game is not as popular as it should be. I have always felt that it is the most well-made games which receive the least credit. I am now in the process of playing Trails of Cold Steel. As for the Third Chapter, I can only hope the dream continues.\n\n9.5/ 10","May 23","true","87.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigiModify13/recommended/251290/","DigiModify13","Butter-fly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigiModify13/","39 products in account","Trails in the Sky SC (short for Second Chapter) is the long awaited and direct sequel of Trails in the Sky (often called FC, meaning First Chapter). If you played FC and you're wondering if SC is any better, let me tell you: it is, in every way you can imagine. Trails in the Sky: The 3rd, the next game in this series, has its own story and Estelle and Joshua aren't even the main characters in it. The 3rd will likely be localized in the future, but even if it isn't, rest assured that SC delivers a satisfying conclusion.\n\nIf you haven't played any Trails games before, here's an overview of why you should direct your attention to FC and SC.\n\nAs most fans of Trails in the Sky will tell you, these games do an excellent job of world building. You'll learn plenty about the Zemurian continent and its regions and citizens just by following the story. What really sets this series apart from most JRPGs is that if you like the fictional setting and want to learn more about it, there is a lot of optional reading that you can indulge in at your own leisure. There are over 500 portraitless NPCs, each with their own side-story, and their dialogue will change after every story event. There's also a plethora of optional but entertaining side quests that further flesh out characters and locations, and even short novels that you can read. NPCs that you helped in the first game will remember you if you carry over your save file, which I thought was a nice touch. The in-game universe feels well built and ever-changing, and the result is a story that flows logically. With everything being so well planned, there is no room for deus ex machinas, and plenty of room for masterful foreshadowing.\n\nThese games have a lot of text so sometimes you'll feel like you're reading a book rather than playing a game. Luckily, the English translation is wonderful. The dialogue is brimming with personality, helping to make even the least important characters feel somewhat memorable. The visuals, as you've probably seen, are dated but not awful by any means. What the series lacks in eye candy, it makes up for in other areas. In terms of music, FC's soundtrack is good, but SC's soundtrack is amazing, greeting you with one of the best piano pieces right at the title screen, and sending you off with one of the best final boss themes ever composed. The battle system isn't groundbreaking but it is refreshing. Each character can be equipped with "quartz"; different quartz combinations will grant you different magic, which the game refers to as "arts", and they consume (EP - energy points). There are also "crafts", which are skills unique to each character, and they use craft points (CP). Whenever you attack or receive damage, you will recover CP, and filling the CP gauge grants you access powerful turn-interrupting moves called S-crafts (which are also unique for each character) at the click of a mouse. SC differs adds new arts and crafts (heh), as well as chain crafts: combo attacks that can deal serious damage when abused. The turn order and turn bonuses are displayed on the left side of the screen, and unlike the usual turn-based game, manipulation of delay to take the turn bonuses for yourself adds an extra layer of strategy to the combat.\n\nTrails in the Sky isn't the most original series, and its story isn't full of plot twists, so you shouldn't come into it expecting a mind blowing story. What this series offers is something that I feel a lot of JRPGs today lack: a coherent plot with a few well placed plot twists and excellent use of foreshadowing + layered, realistic, and developed characters, all wrapped up in a cozy setting that's rich with lore. Depending on how fast you read, FC takes about 30-45 hours to beat and SC takes about 50-70 hours. Double that if you're going to talk to everyone and do all the side quests (which you will need a guide for, since this series is notorious for missables). With the NG+ feature and difficulty settings, these games are designed to be replayed and you have no obligation to be a completionist the first time around. You also get 999 save slots in FC and SC, which you can take advantage of to revisit pretty much any point in the story.\n\nThese games makes me feel like a kid again while somehow meeting and even surpassing the high standards I've developed from 18 or so years of video gaming. Considering how much quality content is packed into each, they are worth every penny, especially if you're a JRPG fan who likes reading.","November 7, 2015","true","107.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

AND YOU'LL LIKE IT, CAUSE YOU'RE A NAUGHTY PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥.\nCombat doesn't boil down to a battle of who can subtract higher numbers while adding high enough numbers.\nYou aren't punished for picking the wrong party members, you can make anything work (just don't go above normal difficulty).\nAll the music is memorable, and with how Falcom choreographs the cutscenes, seemingly innocent music will invoke feels.\n\nWait, I shouldn't be making a TLDR, because this game is bigger than any novel you could probably think of in terms of reading. So, if you're just going to overlook the rest of the review, you probably should just turn away right now because you may not have the mental stamina to endure this game. It would be a massive mistake to ignore the story in this game.\n\nI'm going to put my grievances with this game FIRST so you know if you want to commit to this series.\nYou _NEED_ to have played the first chapter before you tackle this game. The game is balanced such that you apply your knowledge from the first game into this one; no tutorials on how to attack or anything that was already present.\nYou ♥♥♥♥ing better dare not even try hard or nightmare difficulty. There's no additional reward except artificially inflating your playtime by granting every single enemy in the game a monstrous stat increase across the board. The community will not judge you for playing on easy. Even normal difficulty will ♥♥♥♥ you up at some points.\nIf you're an achievement hunter, a lot of them are glitched and unfinishable no matter how detailed a guide you use. A glance at the global achievement stats will give you enough hints as to which ones are flat out broken.\nA large resolution makes this game a little rough around the edges; you can start seeing into the nether space the devs didn't want you to see.\nThere are a couple of glitches regarding missing sprites, and in one case, a sequence break that you may not even notice happening.\nThere's a third chapter that may not get translated for a few years.\nAs mentioned before this game is INCREDIBLY text heavy and if you're the kind of person that usually mashes the 'skip cutscene button', well too bad, because you cannot skip any cutscene in this game. You can flip through text fast by holding down control, but that's only text; and some cutscenes can go on for at least ten minutes straight when you're reading.\nThe developers are cruel ♥♥♥♥ers when it comes to missables; essentially everything in the game is missable. This is what you call a gamefaqs game. They're also going to be testing your patience quite frequently with some tasks being monumentally tedious and/or obscure. There is no fast travelling of any kind unless the story demands you to.\nOn the theme of missables, getting the full amount of Bracer Points is impossible without a guide. It is simply im-♥♥♥♥ing-possible to have the intuition to do every quest, every sidequest, every HIDDEN sidequest, answer every dialogue branch correctly, and meet criteria during quests for extra Bracer Points on your own. If you want the achievement for getting all the Bracer Points, you better crack open that walkthrough and bookmark that ♥♥♥♥. Make sure you make a separate save every single time you decide to save, so that if you do end up missing something you have plenty of points in the game to load to. At the end of the game I had about 135 save files, and that still wasn't quite enough. Don't worry, they give you 999 save files to work with, and 10 autosaves that happen with each map transition or battle.\nMouse controls are the best way to play this game, but you will need to get used to the fact that every time a menu appears, the mouse will instantly teleport to the first option of the menu as this game originates from the PSP. That can get annoying, but you get used to it. You can play the entire game with the mouse and Z/X to spin the camera.\nIf none of the above is enough to make you turn away, then you'll be able to enjoy what follows. If it is, I'm afraid it may be too much of a problem and will get in the way of you soaking in the story.\n\nNever before have I gotten so invested in a RPG's storyline. The combined 95 hours it took me to finish both games had me by the balls the entire time. Almost every single playable character and the villains have their own backstories, that at some point during either game get a portion of screen time. You feel for everyone at some point. Select NPCs have their own mini-stories which still feel integral to the plot, and often make you think "♥♥♥♥, what if I didn't do this sidequest?". If you import a complete save file from the first chapter (and you will because you absolutely must play the first game to even care about what's going on in this game), depending on your performance you'll get some neat little goodies, plus some little mentions here and there about what you did. Even the little things like keeping your notebook from the first game to flick through.\n\nIf you pay attention to the story (as a byproduct of it being amazingly enticing), you'll often be able to figure out what's coming next and feel like a badass when you predict the next plot twist. You feel like you're actually immersed in this world because you can tie things together without them being explicitly told to you point-blank. You get an idea of the world, its mythos, and you become part of it to an extent.\n\nThe arts system allows you to bend any party member into whatever role you see fit. That's important because there are many points where you're stuck with a certain character with no ability to get rid of them; but that's fine, you can just equip them and you're good to go. While it's true that some characters are better suited as a caster or a melee, nobody really feels useless.\n\nSpeaking of combat, it takes place on a Final Fantasy Tactics style grid adding some strategy as to where to position party members, predicting enemy movement so they'll fit in your AoE spells, and positioning to get as many enemies in a line for line spells. Unlike some more traditional JRPGs you actually have the means to avoid damage by simply moving out before an enemy finishes casting, by spreading your party out wide enough, by interrupting their casts, or hijacking enemy turns to eke out that last bit of health; so battles don't necessarily always end up as trying to keep an ever-leaking bucket from emptying as the boss spams spells that hit all party members with naught you can do to stop it except constant healing.\n\nParty members falling behind on levels get to reap the benefits of the relative EXP gains from defeating higher level monsters (e.g. you have 3 party members at level 55, you dig up your level 45 character; ordinarily you'd spend hours grinding just for them, but instead a level 57 monster can potentially give them at least four levels). I was worried I was going to be saying "I wish I could use you, but I'd have to grind experience with you for about five hours just so I can use you" quite a lot with how often party members switch in and out because of the storyline, and was relieved that never happened.\n\nDEAR GOD THE MUSIC WILL STICK WITH YOU FOREVER. By the time you finish the first chapter and load up the second chapter, you're going to have some feels hit you with the first chapter's most recent events fresh in your mind as soon as you hear that title screen music. You'll appreciate _all_ the music too, from the calm field map music to the myriad of evocative battle themes.\n\nThis game is responsible for any lowering in grades I may suffer in the coming weeks. Thank you Falcom for making me stay up until 4am nightly because I can't put the god damn game down.","December 10, 2015","true","61.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","2"

It's hard to review something you like as opposed to something you dislike, so I'm going to do my best to not sound biased.\n\nI'm gonna start with the bad:\n\nFirst off, the Heaven's Eye Quartz is bugged.  It does not have it's secondary 'radar' function, which can be irritating until you get a Quartz that can replicate the second function.\n\nSecond,  this game has some fairly easily done exploits that make mass enemy destruction easy, removing from the intended tactical portion of combat.  And even then, some of the pre-existing encounters can feel sloppy at times, requiring these exploits to survive.\n\n\nWith that out of the way....\n\nSecond Chapter is a lot better than first chapter was, and it gets started a lot faster.  I refuse to spoil first chapter here, but Estelle's goal isn't to save the world or anything lofty like that (at first), but a more personal goal, which helps make the plot something that can be related to.  And as the story develops, the world around you (That is, the Kingdom of Liberl and it's neighboring countries) get ever moreso fleshed out, with every NPC having something unique to say, sometimes changing what they say midway through a chapter.  While the plot is very trope-y, it's how it is written that makes it such a joy to play through.  The player characters, while having their defining traits, have multiple layers to their personalities that prevent them from being one-note characters, a problem that is alarmingly frequent in most games released these days.\n\nMoving onto the actual gameplay, there's a ton of sidequests to do, involving tasks ranging from slaying monsters that block roads, to finding missing people and stolen items.  Some of these sidequests help flesh characters out and help build the world around the player characters, while some are just for money.  100% Completion can be quite a task, and it'll take more than one playthrough without a guide to achieve it.  As for the combat, discounting the flaws above, is fun and tactical, requiring the player to understand and manipulate enemy positioning and turn order to eke out a victory.\n\nAdding a layer of depth to the system is the Arts system, requiring the player to slot quartz into one of seven slots on their character's Orbment, which can be best described as a device that creates magic from technology.  Now, while this might sound like FFVII's Materia System, it is in fact it's own beast.  The initial placement of quartz provides stat boosts and penalties, but creating a certain combination across the same line gives you increasingly better spells based on the total Elemental Value of the different quartz on the same line.  There's an in game list of spells and EV requirements, so you will not need a guide.  Fortunately, the lines are easier to read than they were in first chapter, with them being more easily marked on your orbment.\n\nNow, the real star of the show (for me at least) is the music, which is leaps and bounds above the already impressive first chapter, with songs like Silver Will and it's arrangements especially standing out, with special mention to the calming world map theme.  The new battle theme is also more fiting than Sophisticated Fight in the first game, and the mid boss theme and boss theme's feeling more fitting and more pleasing to the ears as well.  The soundtrack is actually available on Amazon, and I reccomend picking it up sometime.  I also hope XSEED gets permission to sell it on Steam as well.\n\nIn closing, Trails in the Sky SC is a wonderful experience so far, and I am looking forward to the ending of this beautiful dualogy.  And if you haven't played the first game yet, play that one, then pick this up.","November 11, 2015","true","39.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For those who DID play the first game, this review is to help you decide whether or not to continue the story. It's mostly the same game, same characters, same everything, so if you loved the first game, get this, but if you were lukewarm on it, maybe stay away. I have 3 complaints about this game.\n\n1) Sidequests and party handling is a mess. This game is bad about taking characters, and all their equipment, away from you without warning, possibly making you reload an earlier save just to be able to continue past the next boss. Sidequests are also a mess; finding them requires you to go everywhere, and talk to everyone, after every single thing that happens, which is even more annoying because you've already been everywhere and met all these people, it's not new and exciting anymore. Good luck without a guide or OCD.\n\n2) Physical combat is mostly a joke. There are exceptions, but by and large, it's just way, WAY easier to magic everything to death. It can get repetitive. The game knows this, because there's a whole chapter where they gradually nerf your magic abilities just to inject some level of challenge.\n\n3) The story. This is the big let down. The story is terrible. Your enemy, introduced at the end of the last game, is cartooney. They have more archaeological knowledge than the church, more technology than the most advanced nation, trained monsters, an incredibly tough army, another army of giant robots, their own air force, and a flying aircraft carrier. Oh, and the actual leaders are unbelievably strong, just because. AND, the leader of the bad guys (but not the real leader) has mind control powers. Yup, it's not even questioned or shocking when brought up, it's just a simple fact that this man has mind control powers. People seem more shocked at the martial prowess of the two badass fighters than at the more ridiculous cartoon abilities. The entire game consists of you chasing these guys, and failing to do ANYTHING of value. You don't even slow them down. I actually stopped playing the game near the end because I got sick of it, so I'm guessing something pays off in the last few hours, but for the entire 60 hours I played, not one time did I actually win even a small victory. The entire party could have just spent the game partying and it wouldn't have changed anything substantial. The characters are still great, even the new bad guys, I love them, but the plot is devoid of tension, it makes you feel like you are wasting your time, and it's impossible to take the bad guys seriously because they are so unrealistic. The first game had a brilliant enemy, a small number of elites using intel and hostages to take over a country; now we have a private organization powerful to overthrow nations that somehow virtually no one has ever heard of. I liked most of this game, I could tolerate some of the changes mentioned above, but the plot and premise just become absurd, almost like a parody of JRPGs, and I got sick of accomplishing nothing. The game was telling me I didn't need to be here, because nothing I did mattered. An incredible disappointment, so if you didn't like the combat in the first game and only liked the story, you may seriously want to just skip this so it doesn't ruin it for you. Only play it if you loved the first game entirely and can stomach some downgrades.","April 21","true","62.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

If you love jRPGs from the golden SNES/PS1 era this should be right up your alley. Trails has everything that made Chrono Trigger, Suikoden, FFVII and such awesome minus the chore of grinding, random encounters etc. This makes for an ideal entry point for newcomers, while the fantastic boss battles (a Falcom staple!) should still provide the right challenge for veterans. This is as close to a 10/10 a game can get in my book. Really recommend anyone who has a little love for the genre to play BOTH parts of Trails in The Sky.\n\nImportant!

And from those humble beginnings, my journey with the greatest RPG in a decade began.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky feels more like a novel than a video game. This is somewhat true in a literal sense: there's a lot of text! But where it really shows up is in the intentional design decision to have the story be the central focus. And what a story it is. It starts out small. You play as a teenager cutting her teeth at her newfound vocation, with the stakes to match: a lost cat, a maintenance kit for a lighthouse, unreturned library books. Nothing life-changing. Certainly nothing world-changing. But these seemingly trivial tasks allow the world and the characters to establish themselves and breathe, allowing them to become more than nameless faces. A dizzying amount of random townsfolk NPCs have their own storylines going on, and the game lets you watch these threads unfold. The main plot is slowly building in the background, but the game unapologetically focuses on letting the player slowly absorb the country of Liberl for the first thirty hours or so and watching the slow growth of Estelle. And it's the better for it, because when the plot gets into gear, all that time spent with her starts to really pay off. The game mechanics are decent, but they're obviously secondary: like a novel, the real meat of the game is the characterization and worldbuilding.\n\nThat's what happened in the prequel. Which you have to play before this one, because this one is where that characterization and worldbuilding established in the first one starts to pay incredible dividends.\n\nIn SC, the stakes are increased from the very start, but again, the game lets the central plot take the back seat for a while and focuses on worldbuilding and character development. You go back through the same towns as the first game, with the same NPCs and even the same dungeon layouts. And it's like visiting an old friend. You see how the NPCs handle the ongoing crises, how they've adapted, how they've soldiered on, how they've gone about the business of living their lives. It gives a richness and depth to the setting that is matched by few other games, and almost no other JRPGs. I can't stress this enough: the focus on world-building isn't a seasoning trying to add depth to the main course, it's part of the main course itself. I could spend the entire game running errands and talking to NPCs (and listening to the fantastic soundtrack!), and it'd be worth it. That's how good this element is.\n\nOf course, like in the first game, the main plot is always slowly building up in the background. And like in the first game, it starts to take center stage around 30 hours in. And like in the first game, the hours upon hours spent with following Estelle and her growth add a depth to the narrative that causes it to shine. Trails in the Sky is a story about Liberl, but it's primarily a story about Estelle, and the game does a beautiful job of linking the world-changing events happening to the personal growth of Estelle and her companions. It's a complete masterclass in writing, and if the country of Liberl is the soul of the game, then the journey of Estelle is unquestionably the heart. There are some improvements to the battle system, but again, this game isn't about the battle system. It's the story of a country and the story of a girl, masterfully weaved together into a single must-play experience.\n\nThere's been much written elsewhere about the long, hard, probably cursed journey this game took to Western shores, so I won't repeat the story here. But I would be remiss to not offer my gratitude to Falcom, to Carpe Fulgar, and to Xseed. Blood and tears were given to bring me this game, and my thanks and money seem woefully inadequate a recompense. But it's all I can offer for now, so it will have to do. So thank you to everyone involved in the development and localization of this game, for your fantastic job at giving me one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.","December 5, 2015","true","93.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For those of you who have already played the first chapter and enjoyed the experience, you're in for a treat. Get the second chapter--no discussion. If you're a big fan of story-heavy JRPGS with the classic Japanese battle system playstyle but haven't played the first or the second chapter and want to enjoy one of the best if not THE best JRPG series of the decade, then look no further.\n\nThe story is deep, rich, and full of surprising plot twists that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. The characters are unique and interesting, each with their own quirks and way of speaking. EVERY single individual in this game has a personality to them. Even the seemingly unimportant NPCs like farmers, shop keepers, inn managers, etc. Also, a lot of times the music of some games may seem underwhelming when placed in context of a great story. But this is not the case with Trails in the Sky. Falcom did a great job in composing and implementing masterful pieces of music into the game. Each scene, boss bottle, environment,  and conversation have different feelings. And of course, the battle system is what the player is responsible for in the game. Although the thought of another turn-based JRPG may turn you off, don't be fooled. It's not your typical JRPG. Crafts, arts, random buff generator on the side, teamwork, and strategic placement of your squad is essential to ensuring your success in the battles. Overall, the game is extremely well-done in terms of XSEED bringing Trails in the Sky to the international stage. Little to no bugs, English translations that are not only grammatically correct but have life to them. It's truly a masterpiece.\n\nThe worst part of my experience playing this game was getting to the end and realizing that it will take another several years before the next game is localized for the English-speaking market. Hopefully this game does well on the international market so it encourages XSEED to think about localizing the 3rd game!\n\n\n","November 30, 2015","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A complete call back to the classic JRPGs of the mid-90s, Trails in the Sky easily belongs in the same category as Final Fantasy V, VI, and Chrono Trigger. It's got a well-detailed world, individual NPCs who almost all each have their own name (if they don't all), memorable music, fun characters, and an excellent storyline for the genre. Combat is turn-based with tiles, giving it the tactics sense where you position characters to avoid enemy attacks, and knock enemies around to maximize area attacks. If you think more JRPGs need to be on Steam, then get this game to say so.\n\nAs a side note, I level grinded for maybe 20 minutes total at the end of the game, so that really is 70+ hours of just gameplay, exploration, and side quests.","May 25","true","79.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/everythingissushi/recommended/251290/","everythingissushi","everythingissushi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/everythingissushi/","17 products in account","Small note: I have finished the game offline, and am currently on my second playthrough, hence explaining my relatively low playing hours on Steam.\nWill get around to finishing it again once I'm done playing FC on the PSP.\n\nThis is a review for both games in the franchise.\n\nVideo games are a medium of entertainment like no other; they can tell engaging stories and present them like no other medium can, they can involve interactions with countless characters and can make us view characters in various ways depending on various routes, quests and interactions (novels are much more restricted in these aspects).\nAnd yet, video games often fail at reaching many people, and despite constantly evolving and presenting stories like no other medium can (examples being the likes of Shadow of the Colossus or The Last of Us), due to ignorance and a lack of understanding about the medium as a whole.\n\nAn issue that plagues gamers in general nowadays is how to view graphics as well; on one hand, graphics are better than ever, and can enhance the overall experience (whether it's atmosphere, gameplay or simply the game as a whole looking nice). On the other hand, there are gamers craving the old-school appeal of the likes of Chrono Trigger or The World Ends with you, where the games are more focused on the dialogue, character interactions and world exploration.\nThe game I'm mentioning in this review is an old-school game that emerged in an age where people are leaning to the former rather than the latter, though story-based games aren't without their fair share of fans.\n\nLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a game with a rather strange history. The game is easily among the biggest JRPG franchises in Japan, yet has cult classic status elsewhere; for those unaware, a cult classic is something that has a small following, yet the fans of whatever it is absolutely adore and may go so far as to hold it as one of the best in its genre for whatever reason. Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (from this point onward referred to as just Trails in the Sky) is one such game.\n\nThe game was originally released in 2004, and was eventually translated in 2011. A sequel to the game, referred to as Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC (short for second chapter) was originally released in 2006, and translated in 2015.\n\nThe game follows two characters, Estelle (a tomboy who has an obsession with sneakers) and her adopted brother Joshua (whose past is a complete mystery). They become bracers at the beginning of the story, and face various challenges along the way.\n\nWhile the premise will undeniably turn some people off, the storyline is a lot more than what it seems. The game deals with a wide variety of themes, whether its war and the effect it has on various people, the effect using a particular resource has on people, how much are people willing to sacrifice for peace and much, much more. The story is also epic in scale, and by the end of the first game the player will wonder if there is a resolution to the dozens of subplots going on (small spoiler: yes for the most part, though I still want the third chapter over).\n\nThe characters are among the most lively I've ever seen in any work of fiction of general, with some of the funniest dialogue I've ever read (the game has practically no voice acting) as well as being extremely developed with a great deal of care and subtlety. A lot of effort was put to make the characters follow conventional tropes only on a superficial level and make them very multi-layered and complex, making them come off as (and this isn't easy to do) human.\n\nIn fact, the game's greatest strength is how natural and human everything feels. The character interactions, story events and dialogue never feel forced or unnatural, making it easier for the player to be immersed in everything that happens.\nAnother massive positive that connects with my opening point that games can tell stories no other medium can tell is how lively the world is. There are literally hundreds of NPCs, each with their own personality, motivations and backstories, and interacting with them from the first game to the second game can vary wildly (especially if you maintain save files from the first chapter to the second). This is extremely rare among video games, which almost never give any semblance of a personality to NPCs, much less continuous development or any interesting interactions.\n\nThe gameplay is turn-based, mainly revolving around managing and upgrading orbments, and within battle paying attention to benefits as well as casting arts. The game is relatively easy, but has massive difficulty spikes while fighting bosses, making it challenging yet extremely strategic since there are also various benefits depending on the turn a character is fighting. These benefits can be received by foe and ally alike, and a large portion of the gameplay is dedicated to making sure your allies receive those benefits.\n\nThe graphics are extremely dated by modern standards, but also rather fitting for the game, matching its retro feeling.\nThe soundtrack is easily among the best in any video game period, and manages to never feel out of place or unfitting the scene or battles it plays in. Seriously, look up a few tracks on YouTube and try to tell me its bad music, I dare you.\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough, especially if you are fond of engaging storylines and want something more old-school.\n\n","December 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's the kind of game that will stick with you until you play a game with elements that will make an impact as strong as it does. While the gameplay remains relatively simple especially for JRPGs nowadays, its overall presentation and build-up spanning the length of 2 games is something that is rare in these times.

And Trails SC keeps reminding me of why I loved jRPG the way I did, growing up with it and all.\n\nIt's pure sentimental, because when I finished downloading, I couldn't bring myself to press START despite obviously loving the previous installment. The last game's ending still impacted me even now, and Joshua and Estelle's love story is one of the few that I adore coming from a video game. But I also enjoyed as much, in this one, of Estelle finding Joshua, but more importantly, finding her own. She grew up a lot, I think, and she became one of the best female protag I've seen in a jRPG, period. She's funny, she's witty, she's sarcastic, she's strong yet vulnerable. I've never adored another female protag the way I adore her. The way Estelle grew up throughout the game is incredible.\n\nThe country of Liberl remains just as immersive, and despite exploring the same cities over again, it does not feel old. If anything, I feel a little relief, because the first time playing FC I had felt a little - overwhelmed - at certain towns where it almost feels too real - too many NPCs who are genuine interesting. (Do you remember the shoppe keeper in Rolent in the first game and his mother's quest to find him a girl he could marry? Spoiler alert, she is successful!)\n\nGameplay is a little slow at first, a little "feature" of Legend of Heroes series, as far as I know, and the sidequests can be repetitive at times, but I genuinely enjoy it. I probably wouldn't in any other games, but as I said, Trails SC simply is too rewarding to anyone who goes above and beyond to explore. Excuse me that I really like going from one side of the region to another for a sidequest just to enjoy the few funny scenes between the characters at the end of it.\n\nThe music remains flawless. But has that ever been a question?\n\nIn any case, I certainly recommend this game.","November 9, 2015","true","56.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I found myself being engrossed in the problems the characters faced as I traveled around the kingdom of Liberl. If you are a fan of JRPGs consider going back and buying the first game( this one won't make sense unless you played the first), but if you are not a JRPG fan you might want to go elsewhere to get your feet wet first. Check out the several old Final Fantasy games first, or the recently Steam re-release of Disgaea( I want that at some point)\n\nThat being said both games have a slow first 1/3,  the 2nd 1/3 builds up, and both the first and second game's last 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat.  The first game involves a sister and (adapted...) brother, Estelle and Josha, traveling around the kingdom and doing odd jobs in the various regions, but as you progress it becomes clear a sinster conspiricy is afoot that threatens the kingdom of Librel( this becomes why the final 1/3 had me on the edge of my seat).  The second game picks up after the first and it becomes clearer why the Society mentioned in the game description did what they did in the first game. I can understand the slow first 1/3 to an extent since we get to invest in the characters and meet people around the kingdom giving us a sense of investment when the games' climaxes occur.\n\nIn general making something longer doesn't make it better, and I feel like there just isn't enough art assets to cover both the 1st and 2nd game and keep it fresh throughout.  Even though the designers clearly tried to rearange the buildings in various towns and such I can't shake the nagging feeling that despite it LOOKING different, the envirnments just don't FEEL different.  Could just be me though.  Ah yeah,  dungeons don't give you an overhead map so it makes navigating them frustraiting if they are in a forest or underground cave due to their irregular layout so do not rotate the camera while in those dungeons.  It helps keep your bearings.\n\nCombat I feel misses a few marks. Granted at the same time of playing through Trails in the Sky SC I am also playing XCOM 2 so that may be coloring my expectaitions of a turn based combat system. It is a standard square based grid you move around. You can attack, special attack or do orbal arts( ie magic).  The game makes a big deal about building your magic circuit up with various kinds of gems in order to get the best stat upgrades and by experimenting withlinking the correct gems together to unlock new magic spell.  Unfortunitly the game also makes them somewhat expensive, so I feel like the game isn't giving me the room to experiment.  I found the characters special attacks and basic attacks more effective most of the time since magic requires a turn to charge up.  Granted I was playing the 2nd game on easy so that made the combat a bit dull, mainly becasue normal diffculty on the first game had a difficulty curve that was flat for the first 1/2 then spiked during boss fights, which was just frustraiting.  So in the end I felt combat could have used a once over in the development of the game, and a more consistently rising difficulty curve so I don't instictly pick easy.  One last thing, prioritize upgrading Estelle and Joshua since the other characters come in and out of use depending on the needs of the plot.\n\nWhich leads me to the plot, while engaging, does interfere with the game progression on occasion. Why should I spend resources to upgrade these other characters if they won't be around to help in a fight?  Also the frequent traveling to and around the various hub towns is begging for some kind of fast travel option to warp back to the nearest town to complete a quest. This could probably have cut a lot of unecesary faffing about, and ultimatly removed less interesting game time with minimal cost to the overall experience.\n\nLast but not least the soundtrack of the first game is decent, and the second game is excellent.  Every track works well in the situations they are played and as I'm updating this review I am listening to the 2nd game's OST\n\nSo in the end the 2 Trails in the Sky games are worth your time if you want a somewhat classic JRPG with a solid story  and characters.  The gameplay, while flawed,  never gets near ragequit territory.","March 7","true","36.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Every aspect of this game is incredibly well-executed: the story is one of the most memorable I have come across, the battle system is fine-tuned and engaging, and the music is immaculate, correctly setting the appropriate tone for each situation in the game.\n\nHowever, most JRPGs (and games in general) have the qualities previously stated. What really makes this game stand out from the others is its attention to detail on the more minor aspects of the game. For one, most characters (including non-playable characters) have their own backstory. Even though these may be unrelated to the game’s main plot, it is always interesting, and sometimes shocking, to hear about these and what shaped these characters’ identities in the time setting of the game.\n\nAs this game is a direct sequel from the its predecessor, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, many features and mechanics were carried over into this game with some small adjustments made here and there. Chain Crafts were introduced to provide a new option to players deciding on the best way to take on an engagement. Orbments and Arts have been slightly “rebalanced” in such a way that the player really has to think about whether they want better attributes or new Arts to use in battle. Additionally, there is a decent amount of choice between what equipment to choose for each character. In the first game, newly discovered equipment generally offered better overall attributes. However, this game allows you to choose between improved defense, attributes to make your character better at Arts, or attributes to make your character more agile. Though this detail is rather moderate, it goes a long way to provide the player with more character customization.\n\nAll of this is what makes The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC such a wonderful game to play through as well as a better game than its predecessor. I thank you XSEED for taking their precious time localizing this and cannot wait to play the next localized installment in The Legend of Heroes series which, at the time of writing this review, would be The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel.","November 8, 2015","true","48.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is even an achievement for following the story of an NPC on his quest around Liberl in search of purpose, love, and place within the world.\n\nFor its price the amount of story content and gameplay this game provides, especially combined with the first instalment,  is staggering.

After 50 hours of Trails: FC and 60 hours of Trails: SC, I was left wondering what to do with my life. I wanted to spend more time in Liberl, but...I can't read Japanese. So, what else was there to do, but to relive Estelle's journey all over again?\n\nSince my original purchase of Trails in the Sky: FC back in October I've done nothing but play The Legend of Heroes: Trails games. FC/SC, went out and bought Cold Steel for my Vita and spent another 80 hours on that, and then came back and re-played SC on Nightmare.\n\nSpoiler-free Story Review:\n\nIf you love world building, then you will love this game, and it's cast. However, the games are MASSIVE, and there is a LOT of content that has yet to be translated. Expect to drop at least 200 hours on the current trio of games if you are as into the series as I am.\n\nHowever, there are currently 8 games with a ninth on the way, and only 3 of them are translated. With how long it has taken them to.. (The first game was Translated/released in the uS 2011..), expect to wait quite some time before finishing them all.\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nSimple, yet deep customization makes this game enjoyable by all types. You can autopilot through on an easier difficulty by mashing attack and default arts.. or take the game to the next level with complex orbment setups.  Plus, turn based JRPG? Who said there isn't a market for them anymore..\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nThe difficulty is the games largest shortcoming in my opinion. Playing Trails SC on anything other than Normal during a new game is very...very hard. They'll show you that too, right out the gate with the third boss. You'll spend hours and hours grinding and are still reliant on RNG to win. Since a lot of the games difficulty is RNG, I would go as far as saying that higher difficulty play is really only artifically difficult and luck based.\n\nPlaying the game on Nightmare on NG+ was very enjoyable however. I started over level wise but retained my gear from the previous playthrough, and the difficulty felt right. The challenge was evident, and I felt my choices led me to victory, rather than RNG.\n\nFor your first playthrough, I highly suggest normal difficulty. It is still somewhat challenging but is nowhere near frustrating.\n\n\nDifficulty: 7/10\n\nI absolutely love the music in this series, however I'm the kind of person with an addicting personality. Short tracks on repeat for a long time are a staple for me, especially as someone who grew up playing so many JRPGs. No different here. I do however recognize that some people get annoyed hearing the same thing over and over for hours on end.\n\nMusic: 10/10\n\nI infinitely recommend this game to any and all who have played a JRPG. Also, every purchase gives Xseed more reason to consider translating the rest, so..if for no other reason I'm going to slefishly tell you to buy this game!","January 31","true","156.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a amazing direct continuation of the prior game, together they make a pair.\n\nOthers have already hit on what makes this game so great. If you're looking for a short version, I'm going to  write mine below:\n\n* Everything about the prequel is about twice as good here. Liked the first? You'll love the second. There's twice as much content here (literally, my play time is just about double) and I still missed quite a bit (~10 hours worth). The price tag is worth it -- between the two games you get about ~140 hours of game. This is fully scripted, text rich, game-play. How many games will give you an epic game of this length for $50 USD total? Even at full price, buy this. It's a no brainer.\n\n* The character development is absolutely outstanding and should not be underplayed. Since this is a LONG game, it's not unreasonable to say you become attached to the cast of characters and many of them are on their way back in this game. Of course, there a few noteworthy additions.\n\n* The amount of depth that goes into what you have done in Liberl and how it makes subtle changes is a joy. Sure, we have games like Skyrim where micro-changes in the world state causes all sorts of different behavior. However, Trails takes this one step further and gives each character unique reactions to situations and the ability to further expression their personality during events. For example, during key battle events each character may have their own commentary they provide based on their history or what had happened tens of hours ago.\n\n* This point is debatable -- the battle system is dated but I think it is still a joy to play, just not on normal for RPG veterans. Hard-mode is too top heavy, that is more difficult towards the beginning. For most players, I would suggest hard mode but you have to have patience to get past the first ten or so hours... and that is disappointing. Luckily, this is a sequel so you'd be consider buying this if you fell in love with the first.\n\nThat being said, play Hard or Nightmare, Normal is too simple. However, that ALSO being said, this game can absolutely stand on its own without the battle system... so play on Normal if you just want the cinematic feel, I guess!\n","February 15","true","88.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hands down one of the best JRPG's there are on the market. Heck. Trails in the Sky is one of the best JRPG's ever made.\n\nI am a "veteran" JRPG player, been playing since elementary school. I have played a quite big number of famous titles (Final Fantasy etc.) and also other less famous titles (Wild Arms etc.). Only a few of them had me hooked up, making me have all sorts of emotions while playing. This game being one of them.\nThe story of Trails is one of the most deep and emotion twisting story of all the JRPG's i played. From the start it seems like a simple "cliché" story about a girl trying to climb to be the best [insert job here]. But, the lore of the game and everything happening around the protagonist(s) are overwhelming. I personally think you can write a whole novels series based on this one game alone.\nThe plot of Trails is one of the best in its genre. The battle system is unique and fun. The soundtracks are somewhat nostalgic, I don't know why. The NPC's have their own relations to each and every other character in the game. Yes, EVERY NPC.\n\nEven after beating the game, I am still curious about the rest of the plot around the game, hoping XSEED will quickly release the translated Trails in the Sky TC.\n\nIf you are an avid player of JRPG's, I definitely recommend Trails in the Sky FC and SC.

The world knows you. Responds to some of your small, irrelevant actions. Responds to the world events you're apart of. There are so many unique lines that are often phoned in by other JRPGs. Every vendor, townsman, child, receptionist. The story spans the entire country, and while it starts out mirroring the first in a few ways (just with different motivations), that changes around mid-way, where it goes beyond regional events and you become involved in a much more involved story.\n\nUnfortunately, while the story concludes well enough, it still leaves a significant number of holes for the third chapter to occupy. For better or for worse.\n\nCombat system is still the same relatively simplistic one from the first chapter, though due to being able to reach 90 without much effort, and having much higher levels of orbments, your characters can do so much more.","December 26, 2015","true","48.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every aspect of this game is incredibly well-executed: the story is one of the most memorable I have come across, the battle system is fine-tuned and engaging, and the music is immaculate, correctly setting the appropriate tone for each situation in the game.\n\nHowever, most JRPGs (and games in general) have the qualities previously stated. What really makes this game stand out from the others is its attention to detail on the more minor aspects of the game. For one, most characters (including non-playable characters) have their own backstory. Even though these may be unrelated to the game’s main plot, it is always interesting, and sometimes shocking, to hear about these and what shaped these characters’ identities in the time setting of the game.\n\nAs this game is a direct sequel from the its predecessor, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, many features and mechanics were carried over into this game with some small adjustments made here and there. Chain Crafts were introduced to provide a new option to players deciding on the best way to take on an engagement. Orbments and Arts have been slightly “rebalanced” in such a way that the player really has to think about whether they want better attributes or new Arts to use in battle. Additionally, there is a decent amount of choice between what equipment to choose for each character. In the first game, newly discovered equipment generally offered better overall attributes. However, this game allows you to choose between improved defense, attributes to make your character better at Arts, or attributes to make your character more agile. Though this detail is rather moderate, it goes a long way to provide the player with more character customization.\n\nAll of this is what makes The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC such a wonderful game to play through as well as a better game than its predecessor. I thank you XSEED for taking their precious time localizing this and cannot wait to play the next localized installment in The Legend of Heroes series which, at the time of writing this review, would be The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel.","November 8, 2015","true","48.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hands down one of the best JRPG's there are on the market. Heck. Trails in the Sky is one of the best JRPG's ever made.\n\nI am a "veteran" JRPG player, been playing since elementary school. I have played a quite big number of famous titles (Final Fantasy etc.) and also other less famous titles (Wild Arms etc.). Only a few of them had me hooked up, making me have all sorts of emotions while playing. This game being one of them.\nThe story of Trails is one of the most deep and emotion twisting story of all the JRPG's i played. From the start it seems like a simple "cliché" story about a girl trying to climb to be the best [insert job here]. But, the lore of the game and everything happening around the protagonist(s) are overwhelming. I personally think you can write a whole novels series based on this one game alone.\nThe plot of Trails is one of the best in its genre. The battle system is unique and fun. The soundtracks are somewhat nostalgic, I don't know why. The NPC's have their own relations to each and every other character in the game. Yes, EVERY NPC.\n\nEven after beating the game, I am still curious about the rest of the plot around the game, hoping XSEED will quickly release the translated Trails in the Sky TC.\n\nIf you are an avid player of JRPG's, I definitely recommend Trails in the Sky FC and SC. It won't disappoint.\n\n10/10","February 7","true","75.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it's plot won't break any new ground in term of jRPG, it harkens back to the classic and I dare say surpass most of them.\n\nIf you keep seeing modern jRPG and thinking back how turn based Final Fantasies were so good, and old games were so much better look no further and you will find a story, and diverse caste of characters in my opinion better written than anything pretty much any classic tropy jRPG. Not every game needs to innovate with never before seen idea (most of the plot has been seen in animes and other jRPG but never pulled off with such elegance.)\n\nThere's definitely a lot of text to read and both games (FC and SC) are totally ''slow burn'' type of game but the pay off is amazing in the end.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.","February 8","true","117.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you played the first chapter of the series and liked it, then be assured that this sequel fulfills all expectations you could have and most likely even surpasses them. If you did not play the first chapter, then I strongly recommend you to try it out. Otherwise you might miss one of the greatest JRPGs ever, rivaling the best titles of the Final Fantasy series. And that is a statement I do not make lightly.\n\nStrong Points:\n- captivating story and well-crafted characters\n- effective and highly strategic turn-based combat system\n- beautiful soundtrack\n- good mix between the typical linear progression for JRPGs and a multitude of sidequests at almost every stage in the story\n- flawless localisation that succeeds in preserving a lot of the humour in dialogue and character interaction\n- the 'hard' difficulty is actually hard but not frustrating (though I can very much imagine that the 'nightmare' difficulty might be)\n\nWeak Points:\n- dated graphics (although I think they are used effectively and do not take away from the experience)\n- very formulaic in its execution of the JRPG genre; many things feel like one has seen them before which makes the game sometimes rather predictable (however, there are some quite well-executed plot twists)\n- the world itself is reused in many places from the first chapter; while it is nice to meet places and people again I could understand if this aspect would bore some players\n\nSo all in all, while the Second Chapter of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky does not reinvent the genre and mostly walks along familiar paths, it does so astonishingly well. It is unfortunate that the game is relatively unknown and localisation of the third chapter is still very much up in the air. For any fans of JRPGs this game gets the strongest possible recommendation from me and even if you are new to the genre, this might be one of the best places to start.","November 11, 2015","true","127.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I agree with the other reviews, this is likely one of the better JRPG's on Steam, if not the absolute best right now.\n\nPros:\nThe plot totally delivers.\nThe soundtrack is reminiscent of the first game, but there's enough variety and nostalgia that you'll still feel right at home.\nThe game picks up basically right where the first game left off.\n\nCons:\nUhh...the third one's not out yet?\n\nTips since I just finished the game (no spoilers, I promise)\n1. Play the first game first. (Come on, do I really have to say this?)\n2. Some characters are better at some 'roles' than others. Be sure to check the color of the lines on the orbal screen to get a better idea.\n3.  Be thorough, talk to everyone -twice- if you're looking for a complete experience. XSEED did a heck of a job with all the dialogue, i'm baffled by the amount of text and time put in this game's development.\n4. You will never ever ever have enough Sepith.\n5. Beware of secret quests. Like the first game, these exist too.\n6. Anything you have to spare, will be all you can spare if you're looking for a repeat experience.

Like most JRPG's there are times where you have to use certain characters or have characters removed and your strategies are forced to change, but you can still be very successful.

It is story rich, has definite character development, and a good story. My only complaint is that there is too much dialogue for the NPC's. Not really a big deal, but if you accidentally start a conversation, as on my laptop happens too often, there are at least three popups of dialogue each time. It got really tedious, really fast. So much of the plot relies on talking to EVERYONE, too.  A little less of this would help the pace quite a bit, but it is not so much that it is a major deterent to buying the game.\nIf you enjoy JRPG turn-based combat, you will love the game.

After a long and troubled localization period, XSEED hopes to satisfy fans of the original game who felt dissatisfied with the lack of conclusion, and they sure delivered. The writing is excellent, the gameplay is on point, and the second half pays off in spades. It’s just a shame that the first half drags its heels.

Several times I've had to hold myself back from crying because a lot of these characters and the way they make you see their story through their eyes is really heart-wrenching. This game I recommend to anyone looking for an amazing story and a lot of side content in game (obviously this was before the horrors of DLC). But should you decide to get this game, please PLEASE get FC first and beat it. I think it may be required but I could be wrong. I'll edit this review later if FC is required but for the most part you will be completely lost if you jumped straight into this game. Buy it. Its worth every penny and they did a fantastic job of localizing it. I'm hoping they're working on TC (Third Chapter) and it's localization real soon.","November 17, 2015","true","86.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game, and the first chapter, are among the best story-driven RPGs I've played.

There is no grind in this game to speak of, basically. Even though unused party members may fall behind in lvl, when needed they will catch up really quickly, thanks to exp mechanics.\n-all characters are multi-dimensional and well written, the plot is very intersting\n-very solid soundtrack, battle experience is heavily enhanced by epic music\n-a good amount of humour, which somehow does not interfere with the seriousness of situation the heroes find themselves in\n\ncons:\n-while graphics overall are pleasant enough, in-game character models are laxing in my opinion\n-main protagonist sometimes can be quite obnoxious, though this is mostly offset but the rest of characters\n-only several characters actually died throughout 2 games, which stretches my suspense of desbelief rather heavily, considering the amount of firepower that gets used in both actual fights and cutscenes.\n-Hard difficulty in this game is MUCH harder than Hard difficulty in the first game, not actually a con, but something to be considered.\n-last dungeon requires you to beat !10 Hard bosses! in more or less, a row. Considering the flow of the rest of the game, last chapter can feel too intense.\n\nOverall, a majestic game that I do not regret in the slightest of buying.

At the time of this review I just got finished playing this game and this was one hell of a ride. I played the first game which was spectactular and eagerly awaited the second game, and it did not dissapoint....mostly. But I want to get this out while It's still fresh in my head, and to keep myself from rambleing I will have it divided into sections(Gameplay, Story, Characters,Setting and Music)\n\nGameplay:The gameplay imo is the weakest aspect of the game, but only for the fact that a lot of the battles have a tendency to be dragged out and nothing else, aside from that the combat in this game was VERY engaging and this is coming from someone who perfers Action-Based RPG's over turnbased ones. Make no mistake this game is tough and it will kick your ♥♥♥ if you aren't prepared, even against normal encounters, but boss battles Oooooh man.....(First one that comes to mind is a certain boss at the end of chapter 7) it might not be hard for some people but you will get a decent amount of game overs regardless. Overall while not my perfered combat style for games, it's engaging enough to keep from being boring.\n\nStory: The story picks up directly from the last game, and starts of with main character Estelle going off to train in order to find joshua who went awol at the end of the last game after reclaiming his memories, a lot of which has to do with joshuas prior relationship with the society of oroboros. The story itself is very simple, but has multiple twists and turns and is very well written. You always want to know what happens next, it never leaves you wanting and has plenty of humor to offset some of the more....dark elements that show up in the game(and I mean DARK seriously some of the stuff you find out goes on behind the scenes in this seemingly innocent world is baffleing and almost ALWAYS involves erebonia in some way, I can say with a straight face that by the end of the game I was very satisfied.\n\nCharacters: Oh the characters are all Gems(Except Gilbert, ♥♥♥♥ Gilbert) Oh everyone of the main cast is likeable. From Girly Tomboy Estelle, Prim and Proper Kloe, Hot Headed Agate, Bizzare Oliver, Sultry Schera and of course the Mysterious Joshua. And the antagonists, while yes evil are never obnoxious or spurnful except for the final boss....that guys an jerk. Oh the list just goes on and on, and I could go on for days. But to make a long story short, the cast is incredibly memorable and adds a lot of flavor to the story, and every single one of them develops massively as the game goes on.\n\nSetting: What they did for this game was exceptionally clever. The game takes place in the kingdom of Liberl, a small independent nation with highly advanced technology on the western side of the continent Zumeria.However that is not the important part, what is note worthy is that it is but one of 4 we know so far on the Zumerian continent. There is the Aforementioned Kingdom of Liberl, The Erbonian Empire, The Republic of Calvard and the autonomous state of Crossbell. What they have done is left a world so open that it could be used to make multiple story arks within the same setting which is to say the least impressive, leading to a potentially massive expanding world, that i cant WAIT to explore more of. Hinted by Trails of Zero, Trails of Azure and the Trails of Cold steel Trilogy.\n\nMusic: Music's Good Nuff said. But seriously This games music has many well orchestrated tracks. While some tracks would be considered memorable, most are just used to set the tone and mood, and they do so very well. From happy and chipper to crazy serious, there are few tracks you would put on your MP3 Player, but every track in this game provides excellent ambiance and for a game like this, that's all you really need.\n\nFinal Notes:I'm really glad they decided to port this game over and seem to be planning to bring more of this series over, it's one that has been LONG over due and any lover of well crafted story telling owes it to themselves to play this game. No it's not perfect, nothing is. But it IS a turn-based, tactics style JRPG with a HEAVY Emphasis on Story telling, and it performs it beautifully.\n\nHonestly the only complaints I could possibly have is the somewhat repetitve gameplay, The fact that the game likes to spike up the difficulty to ridiculous levels (Especially if you plan to do the monster hunting quests) and that theres no word on when they will translate Final chapter while they are working on trails of cold steel. But since Final Chapter is more like an Epilouge/Afterstory anyway, there really is no rush.\n\nThere is one character in particular I REALLY want to learn more about since she arguably has a more ♥♥♥♥ed up past than even Joshua, though considering that translating this game alone was basically the equivilent of all 7 harry potter books and the lord of the rings trilogy COMBINED, I'm willing to wait and let them have their rest.\n\nAnd XSEED while you may never read this, I still wish to say. On behalf of all JRPG lovers everywhere, I thank you for translating this Masterpiece of a game, and hope that you will translate more of this series as quickly as you are able, and for everyone else if you haven't played this game yet, do so as soon as you are able. It is well worth the 30$ Price Tag.","December 23, 2015","true","72.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FieryLeon/recommended/251290/","FieryLeon","Fli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FieryLeon/","579 products in account","Simply put; This is one of the best JRPGs I've ever played. Now for everyone who doesn't know me, you're probably not aware of the gravity that statement has... Let's just say that I've played a LOT of great JRPGs in my time, from the popular Final Fantasy series, to the hidden gems like Anachronox, Piers Solar and Septium Core.\n\nI would easily rank The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC in my top five JRPGs of all time.\n\nLet me make a quick summarised review on whether this is your type of game or not;\nTurn based battles\nStory intensive\nDifficulty ranging from low, to intense\nOver 75 hours of gameplayIf you don't have the patience to read the text in this game, then you will be missing out on the thing that really sets it apart from the competition. The story itself could be called JRPG standard fare I suppose, but what really sets this game (and the prequel) apart from the competition is amount of world building that is done. Every NPC has a name, and every NPC has a story. There are weapon shop owners who I actually went to speak to after every single event. I spent time getting to know the people of Liberl and I had a fantastic time doing it. The playable characters all have their goals and motivations, and aren't just there for the ride. They feel almost real, you grow to actually care about them as you play through the game. As a long time JRPG player, this blew my mind quite frankly.\n\nThe battle system is completely turn based and pretty tactical. Some of the bosses in the game can be tough, especially if you're playing on the harder difficulties, making it feel all the more satisfying when you pull off a clutch victory or manage to outwit an opponent. The development system is pretty unique too, borrowing elements similar to Materia and rewarding clever placement of Quartz. The equipment system gives you five slots to work with, meaning you can make all rounded characters or specialised roles depending on your personal preference.\n\nThe visuals are colourful and vibrant, and I enjoyed the isometric view. The big attacks and magicks feel cool to use, and you definitely get a sense of awe with the larger ones, this always gives you a feeling of being powerful when you're fighting enemies. The music is absolutely fantastic, and does a really great job of remixing in the main theme, which gives every song a sense of nostalgia in a way. The sound design in general is really good, and having enemies pop when  they die sounds incredibly satisfying.\n\nOne of the few negative things I can say about this game is the performance wasn't too great for me. I have a machine that should be able to knock this out easily, but I still got occasional stuttering which was a bit disappointing. In battle it ran fine though, even in the most intense scenes, so it could be a driver issue or something on my side. The controls are fine, with complete control over remaps. Using a controller or M&KB really is down to personal preference, and you won't find yourself hampered using either.\n\nAnother negative point that is more down to personal preference rather than something objectively bad is the fact that if you want to get all the books (some of which allow you to get the ultimate weapons) you need to be very careful of going past points of no return. I'd suggest following a book guide and a BP guide, if you're bothered by missables at all. ( Here )\n\nI don't know what else I can say to make you consider this game. It's fantastic and you should definitely play it if you love JRPGs or just like great stories. Please be sure to play the first game though, seeing as this one is a direct sequel, and actually gives you bonuses for carrying over save data.\n\nRight, that's too much writing, I must now collapse.\n\nBlorf","December 11, 2015","true","96.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Must-buy.\n\nThe characterizations, mulitple sub-plots, the theming, and subtlety of the dialogue reach even higher peaks than FC even did. The story of Estelle and Joshua's path, the lives of their party-mates, and even some of the non-unique model NPCs' journeys thru life are written with such craft and thoughtfullness. Motives and personalities are almost never shelved when the writers wrote themselves into the corner or stretching to hit some expected storybeat...\n\n,..except when they did in a few times in Ch.9. Plus much of Ch. 7 could have been exised and the remaining strong story scenes moved to other chapters.\n\nBut these are rather minor; you can tell a well-written game by the times you go "this sounds like every other game for this 5 minute stretch" and that's a good sign it aint every other game but I still found FC (and this is purely personal) more consistant in the tone it was going for overall slightly.\n\nMusic? Typically BEAST MODE Nihon Falcom soundteam_JDK goodness with some of the grandest, most well-written, and passionate tracks ever writ for a video game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqOto9_2G84\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylouY3GIDSw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNWNArktMvY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9PRFHFWiDQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yza78TbyFxs\n\nThis is a must-buy for everyone who claims to love well-written characters, well-written light narratives, well-written JRPGs, and good world building.\n\nCAVEATS: be prepared to read a ton and take your time.\n\nAlso Trails in the Sky: First Chapter is a mandatory prequisite.\n\nThis like its predecessor in that you must not go in expecting bang-bang gogogogo from loading, nor is all the "slow" parts a grind till you get to "the good parts". Everything must be met halfway as everything is used for versimilitude and holistic world-buidling.","November 28, 2015","true","77.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's basically a continuation but you see more of what's going on and you meet some new and interesting characters, Then beat the hell out of them.\n\nThe environment is the same. Some might find this predictable but it makes sense.\n\nThe mechanics are much the same with a few additions. Again, slightly predictable but this matters if you play it on harder difficultiies. Knowing what's what will help. Having said that it's not all good.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIt's so hard it's not funny. Later on in particular you need to arrive at the boss fights in good shape or you may as well not bother. This can be harder than it sounds.\n\nThere's a fair number of maze/wayfinding puzzle type missions. I'm not a fan. You might be. There's enough of them that I found it unimaginative/lazy. One in particular made no sense at all.\n\nThe gear and purchase options are just more of the same. Nothing really stands out or gives you a noticeable edge. The addition of food as a combat item is so you can survive rather than prosper. This is fine if you've got what you need. If you can't find or buy ingredient x it's just another frustration as you've then got to ID the monster and head back to wherever it is. Again, if you're not in good shape for whatever reason this can be a chore.\n\n\nOverall I can't recommend this game. The effort vs. reward just doesn't stack up. Sure it's a decent story but you just don't feel any sense of progression as you work through it. The next wandering monster can maul you just as much if not more than the first. You know for certain that the next boss will have the upper hand and there's nothing you can do to counter it that makes much if any difference. In short, It's a slog and I want more than that from a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 6","false","118.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Trails in the Sky SC has brilliant storyline but in terms of gameplay, it's not different from FC at all. If you play SC straight after finishing FC, it will just feel like you are playing a very long ONE game. I highly recommend using Speed Hack of some sort to adjust your game speed. I loved the story, I hated playing the same game as FC with 0 additions to the gameplay.\n\nI clicked 'no, I don't recommend this game' but there are some things I need to mention. It's a game that you should finish if you have cleared and enjoyed FC. I purely clicked 'Don't recommend' because SC doesn't provide anything new apart from the storyline.\n\nSince the storyline continues, you must have played and finished the Trails in the Sky FC before playing this game in order to understand what is going on.  If you have liked the FC, you will likely to want to play SC. The storyline from FC is great so you will likely to want to know what happens afterwards.\n\nSC storyline is just absorbing as FC (maybe little bit less). The storyline in FC focuses on character development so you begin developing a form of 'relationship' with your characters. And, in SC - you spend time to understand them as their personal history gets unveiled. There were some fuzzy hearty moments, good twists and what not..  The problem begins here, I loved the storyline but I got sick of the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly the same - it's not different from FC at ALL, apart from more Arts you can use. The save file carries on from FC so you still get to have all your abilities (which is pretty cool). But, you don't get new Crafts (character's dinstict skills) in SC - your old crafts just get upgraded to 'true' form which would have been totally fine if they had a different animation. Sure, you get Chain Crafts.. but you still don't get new animations. "TRUE" form that looks exactly like the "Old" form, seems like they focused on the storyline too much.\n\nIn SC, you have to rely on your Arts quite a bit as physical attacks become less effective and monsters are stronger. Considering how I have avoided using Arts in FC, purely because physical attack animations are much shorter - this was a big pain. Aerial is one of the most used Arts in the game, you get to choose a large area where you are going to summon tornade.. and the animation goes for like 10 seconds.. I started playing SC straight after FC so all the battles just felt very 'boring' after already spending 35 hours in the FC. Surely, it wouldn't have been hard at all to put an option to adjust your animation speed. I have played The Legend of Heroes 4, same developers - and that game was from 90s and was a DOS game - even that had animation speed options!\n\nThe game takes a lot longer to finish than FC so you definitely still get your money/time worth. It's still very text heavy which I don't mind at all - but I had to download Speed Gear to adjust my game speed. And, I seriously recommend EVERYONE doing that - even adjusting it to 1.5x made the game experience very pleasurable. Though at the end, I set the speed on 2x.\n\nThey have added some cool anime cut scenes which is good. Some of the sound tracks have been rearranged which is also positive, considering how good the soundtrack is from FC - I didn't mind that they have recycled the same music from FC.\n\nSo there it is - I have finished both FC and SC - and I am exhausted. I have stated in FC review that it felt like reading a novel and SC still provides that experience except that you can't enjoy the storyline at your own enjoyable pace that you'd like because battles take up quite a bit of your gametime unlike FC. I will add TLDR at the top..","January 18","false","64.4"," 10 of 42 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","10","42","0","10"

I spent loads of hours playing around trying to perfect my team.\n\n- Poor story, from the beginning until just before the final few bosses, everything you do is going according to your enemy's plans, your impact on the story is next to negligable, only a couple (literally, like 2) of your actions in the entire game have any impact.\n\n- Every friggin boss just says theyre gonna fool around with u for fun, and consistently leave when they please, time and time again. And it is not your hard work that saves the day, it is always the bad guy going "meh whatever, can't be ♥♥♥♥♥ right now" that saves the day.\n\n- Broken difficulty mechanics! Throughout ALL the game on hard difficulty, physical attacks deal extremely low (very often: 0) damage to enemies, especially bosses. Some enemies are immune to arts forcing you to have to use physical attacks even though there is next to no point to level up a physical attacker.\n\n- Bosses are long and tedious, once you survive the first 10-20 actions, you've pretty much won, but you have to spend a 100 more turns repeating the same moves over and over and over again.\n\n- When starting the game, loading my save file from first chapter REDUCED my level just because I did not overlevel my characters in the first chapter.\n\n- On high difficulties, boss battles were you have to protect npcs are ridiculous. In the final chapter, there is a boss fight where you have 5 enemies attack before you can cast a heal or a shield. If even 1 of the 5 enemies decides to attack the npc, it is game over before you even do anything. So you have to keep pressing retry over and over until all 5 enemies decide not to touch the npc. Random chance is more important than skill.","February 4","false","143.9"," 8 of 42 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","8","42","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldracity/recommended/251290/","aldracity","Vsin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldracity/","79 products in account","Hi, I'm the token negative review, and I'm here to give you reasons why you SHOULDN'T get Trails SC.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a Trails fanboy and Trails FC is probably my favourite JRPG of all time; it might even be my favourite game, period...until I finish SC, anyways...\n\nFirst things first: this game should be treated as an EXPANSION.  Yes, you can technically buy it on its own, but the game picks up right where Trails FC left off and you're gunna be pretty damn lost if you jump into this right away.\n\nThis game is VERY TEXT HEAVY.  VERY.  Try to find the picture of the scripts for the Trails in the Sky trilogy sometime; Trails SC is longer than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (so says Kotaku) in terms of raw text.  This means lots of cutscenes, lots of sidequests with lengthy chats, and NPCs with walls of text unto themselves.  Technically this is a selling point, but for some it's a killer.\n\n2006.  The original release date for this game was in flipping 2006.  At a time when Japan barely cared about PC gaming.  If you can't stand old games, or indies that style themselves after old games, you're gunna have a bad time.  Also, Anime asethetic, but the promo art should've made that clear already.\n\nThe interface is kinda clunky.  It's either arrow keys + ZXCV + Enter, or you can do it entirely with your mouse; you can also use a gamepad, but that produces the same result as arrows + ZXCV (I've played the PSP version on a Vita).  You should probably remember to use ESC for any KBM control set, too.\n\nThe problem with arrows + hotkeys is that, even with the PSP version, navigating the menus you inevitably have to handle requires a ton of keystrokes for simple things, especially equipment and consumable usage (so many flipping consumables).  In larger fights this can sometimes mean cycling through every unit to pick the right target.  If you're a programmer, leme put it this way: your single-action algorithm is O(n^2).\n\nThe problem with using mouse controls is that a lot of things like to move around.  Your cursor frequently warps when you open menus, and the combat camera repeatedly zooms in and out, constantly altering your cursor position and making it hard to play with speed and precision.  The cursor warping can be convenient for some things, like quickly moving through the Save/Load menus, but at other times it'll arbitrarily close menus because you didn't move your mouse at a perfect horizontal.\n\nCombat is actually a pretty significant debate among Trails fans, with most opinions ranging from "rather bad" to "pretty decent."  I haven't personally found anyone who thinks the combat is "actually good/great," and if they exist they're fairly few in number.  All I'm going to say here is this: turn-based, initiative system, tile movement, plain flat boxes for combat arenas.\n\nTL:DR\n\nOld game with clunky controls and walls of text.  If you're looking for the reasons why you SHOULD buy this game, there are a billion other reviews for that.  I'm just here to provide the counterpoints.\n\nEDIT:\n\nYes, this is a heavily unbalanced review.  Thing is, going through the "most useful" reviews, they're ALL heavily unbalanced in FAVOUR of the game, with no consideration given to people who aren't in the target audience for Trails.\n\nTrails is not a perfect game.  Don't try to pretend it is.  I'll suck this game's shlong any day of the week if you want me to, but people need to be informed about the things that they won't enjoy, and the current "front page" as it were completely fails at that.","October 31, 2015","false","5.9"," 101 of 317 people (32%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","32","101","317","22","17"

Man did i make a mistake on that one.  This game just might be the most stupidly annoying game that I have ever had the misfortune to play.  I honestly i can't even be bothered to finish the prologue.  It's really that bad.  It seems to me like after every battle I fight, I have to go back and rest, as the enemys all deal roughly 1/5 of my hp in one attack (on normal difficulty.  Most of the enemies in this game now seem to also have an inordinate amount of defense vs. physical attacks and the only real way to take them out is with arts.  With only a miniscule amount of EP to cast spells with it get very frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion the only game I have ever been more dissapointed is the second episode of Xenosaga.

More party members, new battle actions, spells and S-Crafts (limit breaks), new quests that utilize new item systems, and of course a continuation from the jaw dropping finale of the first game. Containing new content brought over from the PSP version, as well as HD portraits and assets from the Japanese Playstation 3 version, this is arguably the most definitive version of the game next to the PS3 version which never made it out of Japan (PS3 portaits look ugly anyway, but they do get full voice acting whereas this version only has battle voices).\n\nFor those just learning about this series, Trails in the Sky is a Japanese Role Playing game series with a heavy focus on Story, characters and exploration. For this reason, it is HIGHLY advised that FC (short for First Chapter) is played before this one. Sc does not feature a catch up feature that reminds you of the events of the first game, so new players will be fairly lost, in addition to having key parts of the final act of FC spoiled for them.\n\nIf you are looking for a JRPG series with a lot of heart, a LOT of dailogue, great characters and great story, Trails in the Sky is where its at. Also, the battle systems are turn based for those who either like/can't stand that sort of thing.","October 31, 2015","true","135.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I may be a bit biased. This is an updated review of my previous one.\nAnother thing I want to highlight is just how much work went into the localization of this game. I recommend you read this article http://kotaku.com/the-curse-of-kiseki-how-one-of-japans-biggest-rpgs-bar-1740055631 to appreciate why publishers like xseed really deserve your support.\n\nTLDR: If something like Final Fantasy XIII is like a slab of factory manufactured galaxy chocolate, then Trails in the Sky SC is like a homemade chocolate cookie. Only a awesome, homely and delicious cookie. Maybe not the best cookie ever made, but good enough that you made another 10 and ate them all in the weekend whilst the galaxy bar is still in your chocolate stash.\n\nMain Review:\nIf you loved first chapter, then you will probably love this game. Playing FC is recommended, especially if your a completionist however I played FC years ago on a psp and so I went into this without a max BP cleared FC save and the bonuses you miss are really non-consequential (you miss a item drop increase quartz, a heal/haze combine quartz and a rare accessory) and you miss the continuation of certain miniquests).\n\nPros:\nThe new combined attacks and the upgraded quartz system really make both preparing for battles and playing battles more interesting. I always felt that FC felt skimp on the number of artes and abilities. SC doesn't have this problem, as with plenty of new characters and the upgraded quartz slots give you a huge amount of customization.\nI have always loved the music from this series. It is nostalgic but has a touch of sutble change, as it is a new OST compared to FC. Obviously you will recognise versions of silver will etc... but there are also some fantastic new themes as well. Go check out the Super Arranges of many of the theme tunes on youtube, they are superb.\nThis game is absolutely charming. I've played 4 final fantasies, 2 tales of, radiant historia and more (you get the gist), but the game that sticks close to my heart is this series. Why? The script is just overflowing with personality. All the characters in the game mature and develop, even if it takes its bloody time. Even though I hate cliches, somehow I never get annoyed or bored of the cliches or the characters that occur in this game. It has some great and memorable scenes, and doesn't pull plot devices out of its ♥♥♥.\nYou can only have a party of 4, yet every single character has unique dialogue for every single event. It is quite an achievement. Additionally you can really feel the world the developers were trying to create. As events occur, the NPCs in the game react LIKE REAL PEOPLE. Earthquake? All the towns people are concerned about it. Mayor elections? All the NPCs are talking about it, telling you who they support. There are even NPCs advertising the candidates. After almost every single major plot progression you can walk through the whole town and find that the scripts for NPCs has changed in practically all the towns to reflect the change in events. All the NPCs remember your aultristic acts and respond in kind. It is apparent that this game was made with love and a crazy amount of attention to detail.\n\nMixed (i.e. can be a pro or a con depending on what you are like):\nThis game is a completionist nightmare (or haven). Tons of optional sidequests with pretty narrow completion time limits. Tons of choices that if you chose wrong you will not get the full BP. Lots of treasure and secret rewards. Personally I loved it.\nMight be too much story. Its like reading a visual novel, which is a plus to some and a negative to others. To put it into perspective the lord of the rings trilogy has 455,125 words. This one game has 716,401 words. That's over 3 million characters. This is a long game.\nAdditional difficulties and new game+ add an element of replay value, but once you complete it you probably aren't going to play it again (unless you have another 80 hours to spare...)\n\nCons:\nIt is a dated game, which is evident by its graphics. Personally I think the graphics are charming though.\nBattle system can get a bit dry sometimes. This is a problem with all rpgs though, not just specific to SC.\nGame needs a scene skip function, particularly for the early game.\nThe start of the game when you REALLY want to know what happened to Joshua etc is really slow... it actually takes a huge amount of time to get the plot properly rolling and you will go through a huge amount of sideplot.\nA decent amount of backtracking occurs in this game as the events take place in the same areas as FC. So if you have played FC then you might find that annoying.\n\nTips: talk to everyone, sometimes more than once, unequip your side characters before main events (often you are forced to used other characters and then realize all of you good equipment was equiped on a character that has disappeared. For example, before the chapter 3 boss fight because I forgot to unequip all my characters, I went through 3 boss battles with suboptimal gear and quartz. It really made a difference, and I was forced to use a ton of items.\n\nOverall review: if you are a hot headed gamer who just likes to blow things up... this might not be the game for you. If you are patient, do not need instant gratification, appreciate character development, a good plot and needing to think for your fights then this game is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play. For me it is a 9/10.","November 3, 2015","true","64.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story picks up just hours after the cliff-hanger conclusion of the first game, creating a seamless adventure that sometimes feels as much like a wonderful novel as a video game.  The plot is well placed, if a bit meandering at the start.  What really pulls the whole game together is the interactions of the charming and varied cast, as well as the phenomenal localization.  The dialouge never feels stilted or clunky, which is important because this game is verbose. The earlier book comparison is accurate: expect to do a lot of reading.\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the combat is incredibly similar to the first which is both a strong reason to play this game as well as a bit of a knock against it. There was very little innovation in the implementation of battles. Fortunately, the base was already very solid and it is hard to find fault with the system.\nAll in all, I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone in search of an emotional, character-driven, intrigue-filled adventure; however, lacking an understanding of the story from the first game will really inhibt one's ability to follow what is happening in the early portions of this game. It might almost be wiser to consider the two together one long game rather than a prequal and a sequal.\n\nTLDR; An absolute MUST play, provided you've payed the first one.","January 19","true","82.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was obviously a lot darker than the first game with its introduction of new villains working from the shadows and narrowing down most characters` individual pasts and stories. The game felt so intense with each new chapter and was really exciting at times but always introduces time for a little laughter. Even the NPCs were quite lively and had their own tales which intersected between chapters and made them more lively. The overall length was very satisfying and did make ends meet with most characters but still left a few lingering questions and mysteries that are yet to be known.\n\nI`ll admit that some parts of it were definitely very predictable like being saved at the last minute in most scenarios. The game does over-use that trope and breaks the mood but it is nice to see other characters jumping in the spotlight. I personally felt that the choice to freely pick any party member was nice but it also does limit what we get out of having all characters shine. In the first game you had a select party for each chapter and could really get a feel for what makes them unique and also how you can really adapt to their abilities in battle. So in the SC its more like you can choose to experiment with different members while also trying to be aware of what abilites may be effective or not with others. The dialogue scenes can be lengthy but they are also touching at times which complements that along with its lovely soundtrack.\n\nUltimately this has been one of the best JRPGs I`ve played in a while and I would definitely recommend it to others since it is rather unknown but is an amazing game nonetheless.","January 19","true","318.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first chapter is a bit of a slow starter but stick out the first few hours and you get drawn into a huge and very detailed story that will hook you in , Second chapter is a direct sequal and every bit as great in the story department . charector development is very strong and no charector lacks charm and no main charector seems the same as the other , thats a good trait.\n\nNow for the battle system . The battle system is solid . offering up solid complexity without getting crazy complicated .\nCharectors are nicely classed , and advancement in this battle system is smooth and never seems rushed , you will typically be given new features during times when your done learning the old .\n\nanother perk is these games actually offer legitimate challenge , unlike a final fantasy title where you will rarely hit hard battles , these games do offer a solid middle ground . some easy quests . but some boss battles especially on hard or higher can be absolutely brutal in terms of difficulty . so its really as hard as you choose you want it to be .\n\nAnyways to sum it up its a solid game set with a great involving story with memorable chrarectors with its mechanics set to a very solid place . id highly reccomend the purchase even at full price .","January 4","true","59.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I counted.\n-If you're looking for a graphically gorgeous game, this ain't it. It's good, maybe even great, but not gorgeous.\n-For what it's worth, the game doesn't break the JRPG mold very much at all. Though it tells the story so brilliantly, it kinda doesn't need to.\n\nThe ugly:\n-There are a lot of missables in this game, so to 100% it by oneself would be an arduous task without a guide.\n-As of this writing the game still has a bunch of bugs, including one where you won't take any currently-equipped items or quartz into NG+.\n-Wake up slap trope is strong in this one.\n-so is the "ancient extinct civilization" one.

The grid based system allows for much better stratigical planning, as the attacks you can dish out allows for AoE around the area, which makes positioning important. Sometimes you want to be grouped up to get that all important party heal, but that will also leave you open to the enemies AoE attacks etc. There are many buffs and debuffs and many of them are pretty useful. With the way stats work in this game, buffing your party with a 25% str buff will be way more useful than just getting a few extra levels. There is also things like buffing/debuffing speed to affect the turn rate, a guard magic that allows for full immunity for one attack, buffing your movement so you can move more squares at a time and more. You will need to take advantage of them in Hard (and definitely on Nightmare) to properly stand a chance.","January 2","true","148.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main reason is because the story is very good with some great twists, and the games do a very good job of world building and fleshing out and developing the (largely likeable) cast of characters.\n\nHowever, as a result of the world building focus, the game tends to be very slow paced, and both games are fairly long.  It took me around 150 hours between the two games to complete the story, and surely not everyone would want to put that time in.  It can be considered either a bug or a feature, depending on what you are looking for.  I personally think that the generally slow paced and more laid back nature of the game makes a good contrast for when the story kicks things up several notches, as compared to other games which may try to be over-the-top at all times.  There is also a LOT of hidden side stuff and missions that you can choose whether or not to try to find.\n\nThe battle system is similar to Grandia with a lot of interrupts and cancels, and can be fairly deep and enjoyable.  Also, the soundtracks for both games are fantastic and great at setting the tone for what is going on.\n\nIf you are interested in an rpg that does a lot of character and world building, and are okay with a generally slower pace to the story, I can highly recommend Trails in the Sky.  Just be sure to play the first chapter (FC) first.  The second game (SC) won't make as much sense without it.","December 12, 2015","true","88.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be clear, the final scenes were highly disappointing.\n\nBut for the die-hard JRPG fan who (like me) craves recapturing a piece of SNES-style nostalgia, Trails in the Sky SC still proves to be a charming adventure with alluring characters and a twisting plot that leaves you wanting more.\n\nIf there is a Third Chapter, I hope it makes it's way to the PC with far more urgency from Xseed, because despite the relatively cosmetic downfalls, it's a fantastic character set and storyline that I can't help wanting to play more of!","April 18","true","155.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is also twice as long as the first, which we all know that in JRPGs, longer is always better, especially for a game like this.

For instance, (non-main plot related) there are a couple of NPCs in the first game's first town who are in the process of getting together, and as you keep talking to them you see their relationship develop.  In the second game, you find they're engaged, there is a sidequest to retrieve their lost wedding ring, and if you walk into the church past a certain story point, you'll even see their wedding, and your party's reactions!","March 2","true","116.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cry as long as you want.\nAnd I'll... just hold you like this.\n\nFans of the original Trails in the Sky have long awaited this almost ill-fated sequel, not only is the painfully long wait over, but it is exactly what we all wanted to see and more. Trails SC continues the story of the first game and far exceeds expectations in terms of story.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially identical to the first game with the addition of Chain Crafts, which allow multiple characters to attack in the same turn at the expense of some of their CP, and a new Orbment system which balances the magic system a bit and allows for more and better magic. The new Orbment system requires slots to be upgraded after unlocked in order to use more powerful Quartz, some of this better Quartz is either improvements of older ones, combination of two effects or brand new ones. The Orbment menu is now thankfully color-coded to know which line you're putting Quartz in and aids to better visualize the Sephith sums of each line. Other than that the game also adds a fishing minigame and some gambling minigames at the casino in Ruan for your leisure. The Bracer Guild quests are back and the game still follows the same chapter structure but allows you to edit your party as long as the plot dictates that they can be in your party. The battles have improved slightly with shorter attack animations, improved Crafts, new S-Crafts and encounters that force you to devise new strategies.\n\nGraphically the game is exactly the same as its predecessor. HD assets and almost every PSP exclusive feature are available from the beginning. In the sound department we have new songs in combination with older ones that add up to a really expansive soundtrack. The new music exclusive to SC is fantastic and probably far better than its predecessor, with more rocking tunes and even the relaxing new ones have a better feel more suited to the current plotline and a final boss theme that might as well be one of the best in the series.\nUnfortunately, updating a 2006 game to new standards has also included a slew of bugs. While there are workarounds for every bug I’ve managed to get stuck in some places and in the worst case I accidentally did a sequence break and skipped a major boss fight altogether. The translation also feels spotty at times but with the huge amount of text there is I’m willing to let it pass. Treasure chest jokes are unfortunately missing for the most part.\n\nJust like its predecessor, the plot takes the spotlight in this game and I’d even say outright steals the entire show. Right from the beginning stakes are higher as the story continues right after where FC left off, we join Estelle as she looks for Joshua and tries to become a stronger and better Bracer while getting an insight on the mysterious group “Ouroboros”. Even though the pace remains rather slow, in every chapter our heroes face bigger threats compared to those of the first game and a lot of conflicts that were subtly hinted in the first game unfold. Even the sidequests are a step-up since they no longer involve such menial tasks since now the world is in danger and quite a few involve subplots essential to the world-building of the game. Trails SC is a lengthier affair than the first game, clocking at around 40-60 hours in an average play, with a New Game+ available and various difficulty modes if you ever want to replay it.\n\nThere isn’t a lot to say about Trails SC that hasn’t been said in reviews of the previous game other than “it’s bigger and better”. If you enjoyed the first game then SC is a must play, if you didn’t then you probably are missing out on a truly exceptional traditional RPG, one that took a long time to arrive and is worth every second and penny invested into it.","April 7","true","63.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a direct sequel to that game (direct should be taken as literally as possible) and understanding the plot is extremely difficult without the background knowledge from that game.\n\nOtherwise, SC is simply the continuation and end to the primary storyline that surfaced at the end of FC. If you liked FC, there is almost zero chance you won't enjoy SC as well - it's more of everything FC had. A little older, a little wiser, a little sadder, and a great deal more grand in scope.\n\nConversely, if you didn't like FC, know that SC is the real gateway to the larger world of The Legend of Heroes - but the core of the game is identical, so if nothing grabbed you from before, it probably won't here either.\n\nThe execution and attention to detail from FC continues, and despite my various criticisms of the characters and plot threads, I want to emphasize again what incredible work Falcom and XSEED have done here.","December 19, 2015","true","45.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first chapter is a bit of a slow starter but stick out the first few hours and you get drawn into a huge and very detailed story that will hook you in , Second chapter is a direct sequal and every bit as great in the story department . charector development is very strong and no charector lacks charm and no main charector seems the same as the other , thats a good trait.\n\nNow for the battle system . The battle system is solid . offering up solid complexity without getting crazy complicated .\nCharectors are nicely classed , and advancement in this battle system is smooth and never seems rushed , you will typically be given new features during times when your done learning the old .\n\nanother perk is these games actually offer legitimate challenge , unlike a final fantasy title where you will rarely hit hard battles , these games do offer a solid middle ground . some easy quests . but some boss battles especially on hard or higher can be absolutely brutal in terms of difficulty . so its really as hard as you choose you want it to be .\n\nAnyways to sum it up its a solid game set with a great involving story with memorable chrarectors with its mechanics set to a very solid place . id highly reccomend the purchase even at full price .","January 4","true","59.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also get new characters on top of the existing cast, so there are a lot to choose from.\n\nThe music and graphics are nice too.

There are a tiny amount of annoying cliches in there as well, and some backstories to a few characters could have been done better. There is also a feel of backtracking a lot of the time since it's set in exactly the same place as the first game, but that can't really be avoided.\n\nDespite it's cons, I still highly recommend this game since to me the characters/story, music and combat system are what make it so fantastic.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Awesome characters\n- Even better music this time around\n- More arts/orbment options\n- Last chapters have awesome buildup\n- Improved turn related changes in combat (i.e. showing specific effects of AT Delays etc.)\n\nCons:\n- First 4 chapters have very formulaic structure that gets annoying\n- Not too much of a pain for me, but there are definitely a few points where backtracking might annoy a lot of people\n- Some character backstories/motives are pretty silly\n\nOverall Verdict: Great game, highly recommend.","January 22","true","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was obviously a lot darker than the first game with its introduction of new villains working from the shadows and narrowing down most characters` individual pasts and stories. The game felt so intense with each new chapter and was really exciting at times but always introduces time for a little laughter. Even the NPCs were quite lively and had their own tales which intersected between chapters and made them more lively. The overall length was very satisfying and did make ends meet with most characters but still left a few lingering questions and mysteries that are yet to be known.\n\nI`ll admit that some parts of it were definitely very predictable like being saved at the last minute in most scenarios. The game does over-use that trope and breaks the mood but it is nice to see other characters jumping in the spotlight. I personally felt that the choice to freely pick any party member was nice but it also does limit what we get out of having all characters shine. In the first game you had a select party for each chapter and could really get a feel for what makes them unique and also how you can really adapt to their abilities in battle. So in the SC its more like you can choose to experiment with different members while also trying to be aware of what abilites may be effective or not with others. The dialogue scenes can be lengthy but they are also touching at times which complements that along with its lovely soundtrack.\n\nUltimately this has been one of the best JRPGs I`ve played in a while and I would definitely recommend it to others since it is rather unknown but is an amazing game nonetheless.","January 19","true","318.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story picks up just hours after the cliff-hanger conclusion of the first game, creating a seamless adventure that sometimes feels as much like a wonderful novel as a video game.  The plot is well placed, if a bit meandering at the start.  What really pulls the whole game together is the interactions of the charming and varied cast, as well as the phenomenal localization.  The dialouge never feels stilted or clunky, which is important because this game is verbose. The earlier book comparison is accurate: expect to do a lot of reading.\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the combat is incredibly similar to the first which is both a strong reason to play this game as well as a bit of a knock against it. There was very little innovation in the implementation of battles. Fortunately, the base was already very solid and it is hard to find fault with the system.\nAll in all, I would strongly reccomend this game to anyone in search of an emotional, character-driven, intrigue-filled adventure; however, lacking an understanding of the story from the first game will really inhibt one's ability to follow what is happening in the early portions of this game. It might almost be wiser to consider the two together one long game rather than a prequal and a sequal.\n\nTLDR; An absolute MUST play, provided you've payed the first one.","January 19","true","82.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first chapter is a bit of a slow starter but stick out the first few hours and you get drawn into a huge and very detailed story that will hook you in , Second chapter is a direct sequal and every bit as great in the story department . charector development is very strong and no charector lacks charm and no main charector seems the same as the other , thats a good trait.\n\nNow for the battle system . The battle system is solid . offering up solid complexity without getting crazy complicated .\nCharectors are nicely classed , and advancement in this battle system is smooth and never seems rushed , you will typically be given new features during times when your done learning the old .\n\nanother perk is these games actually offer legitimate challenge , unlike a final fantasy title where you will rarely hit hard battles , these games do offer a solid middle ground . some easy quests . but some boss battles especially on hard or higher can be absolutely brutal in terms of difficulty . so its really as hard as you choose you want it to be .\n\nAnyways to sum it up its a solid game set with a great involving story with memorable chrarectors with its mechanics set to a very solid place . id highly reccomend the purchase even at full price .","January 4","true","59.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story kicks off right after the events of FC and you go around regions once again doing quests and pushing along the story. Game plays very much like FC in terms of battle mechanics, with a few new things sprinkled here an there such as chain attacks.\n\nA very nice and welcome change is the option to switch around party members. Certain story events will force you to use 1/2/3 characters, but for the most part, some customization is allowed, so go ahead and pick favourites. You also get new characters on top of the existing cast, so there are a lot to choose from.\n\nThe music and graphics are nice too. The FMVs are slightly lacking at times, but that may be due to the game's age. One problem I encountered was that loading FMVs would crash the game very often, so I had to go into the settings and disable them and watch them later through Youtube.","January 22","true","59.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing the first one is a must since this is a direct sequel. Pretty much continues everything good from the first game with a few improvements.\n\nThe music is definitely a step up from the previous game, while there are also now even more orbment combinations for those people who love tinkering with their arts/stats setups for each of their characters.\n\nStory is still great, however the predictable structure of the first couple chapters got very boring once you realised what was happening each time. There are a tiny amount of annoying cliches in there as well, and some backstories to a few characters could have been done better. There is also a feel of backtracking a lot of the time since it's set in exactly the same place as the first game, but that can't really be avoided.\n\nDespite it's cons, I still highly recommend this game since to me the characters/story, music and combat system are what make it so fantastic.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Awesome characters\n- Even better music this time around\n- More arts/orbment options\n- Last chapters have awesome buildup\n- Improved turn related changes in combat (i.e. showing specific effects of AT Delays etc.)\n\nCons:\n- First 4 chapters have very formulaic structure that gets annoying\n- Not too much of a pain for me, but there are definitely a few points where backtracking might annoy a lot of people\n- Some character backstories/motives are pretty silly\n\nOverall Verdict: Great game, highly recommend.","January 22","true","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be clear, the final scenes were highly disappointing.\n\nBut for the die-hard JRPG fan who (like me) craves recapturing a piece of SNES-style nostalgia, Trails in the Sky SC still proves to be a charming adventure with alluring characters and a twisting plot that leaves you wanting more.\n\nIf there is a Third Chapter, I hope it makes it's way to the PC with far more urgency from Xseed, because despite the relatively cosmetic downfalls, it's a fantastic character set and storyline that I can't help wanting to play more of!","April 18","true","155.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
