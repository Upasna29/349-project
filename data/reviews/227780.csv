"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/227780/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Serious Sam Classics: Revolution then skip to Results and read from there.\n\nAlligator Pit manufactures the original in all new light with dazzling new interface and cleaned up visuals. Serious Sam Classics: Revolution revitalizes the classic games taking on similar ideas as the HD remakes by creating a game with cleaner performance.\n\nSerious Sam: Revolution includes the first and second encounters, which means instead of paying $34.00 for both the First and Second Encounter you can get them both for $9.99 (without being on sale). Although, what you are probably wondering is what else is included in Serious Sam Classics: Reovlution? To name a few better graphical options, steam support, new campaigns, new bosses, improved UI, level editors, and much more.\n\nCampaign:\nThe First Encounter:\nFor those who already own the first encounter you should probably skip this. This campaign includes thirteen main story levels and two secret levels. All of the levels take place in Egypt and are about the story of how Serious Sam began his quest to save humanity from Metals domination. The original campaign offers hours of gameplay as the levels are incredibly large and filled with secrets. The levels are composed of fighting mass hordes of enemies, solving puzzles, and completing objectives. During the campaign you will fight three bosses: Highlander Aludran Reptiloid, Lava Golem, and Ugh-Zan III. The brilliant group fights and epic boss fights keep you on your toes constantly engaged in a changing environment.\n\nThe Second Encounter:\nFor those who already own the second encounter you should probably skip this. This campaign includes twelve levels (no secret levels), but it also includes the entire campaign from Serious Sam The First Encounter. The campaign is divided across three kingdoms: Mayans, Persia, and medieval Poland. Similar to the First Encounter the second encounter is incredibly long, the levels are large and filled with secrets. The Second Encounter creates even more puzzles, crazier secrets, and throws more enemies at you than imaginable. Not only will you be engaged in all the mysteries abound, but the campaign also provides four bosses: Kukulkan, The Wing God, Exotech Larva, Mordekai the Summoner, and The Ram-God. The Ram-God is from Legend of the Beast DLC, which I assume is going to be implemented into Serious Sam Classis: Revolution.\n\nBright Island:\nI have no information on this campaign, as it is not available in the early access beta.\n\nSpace Crusader (Possible Additional Campaign):\nThis campaign will include the following levels: Water Planet, Lava Planet, Green Planet, Ice Planet, Tropic Planet, and Rock Planet. Although none of this is mentioned, there are hints that this is being implemented based on the screenshots. The screenshots show that they may finally implement the scrapped levels and weapons from the Original Serious Sam. One of the weapons in the screenshots is the Ghost Buster (it looks like it shoots electricity) which was never implemented in the original campaign. it looks like this weapon is being used on the Rock Planet, which is one of the many various planets that was never included in the Serious Sam Campaign. The original campaign would have been over double the size if they finished developing most of the levels they had planned, but for various reasons they were cut. This makes me hope that this edition is finally fulfilling the original dream for Serious Sam and bringing the campaign in its full glory.\n\nGraphical Additions:\nThe actual quality of the textures is the same as you would see in the HD remakes, although what Serious Sam Classics: Revolution offers is more than just a HD texture experience. It provides modern day graphical elements including: lens flares, fog, object bending, object translucency, smoother particle animation, haze, high resolution reflections, better portal animations, cleaner lighting, higher shading controls, and more. You can see all of these in action by checking out the Technology Test, which provides you with clean visuals of how these will be seen when implemented into the new campaign.\n\nSteam Functionality:\nFinally Serious Sam will have access to the workshop, and proper steam servers. The game is supposed to offer up to 42-player multiplayer and even support split screen. The game will come with a level editor, so if they don’t come out with space crusader or sky city someone will. Review Update Serious Sam Classics Revolution has been out now for almost two-half weeks, since then there has been a bundle of added content to the workshop. These include remodeling of textures, multiplayer maps, and even a custom campaign. SSCR has a lot of to offer, and if the community support continues in this fashion this will be an amazing addition to the series.\n\nResults:\nAt this current point Serious Sam Classic: Revolution is not complete, but lets be honest Croteam and Devlover Digital completed Serious Sam HD in a timely manner; I am sure that you will not be waiting forever, unlike some Early Access Games. This game has a lot of potential with its new graphics engine, level editor, providing the original campaigns, better menu UI, cleaner animations, steam support, and so much more. I would buy this game at full price, but on sale it’s like you are robbing Croteam.\n\nPros:\n+Great new OpenGL shaders and 64-bit support to create a much cleaner and graphic intensive game.\n+Steam workshop support\n+Steam servers for multiplayer (supports up to 42 players)\n+Includes Serious Sam First and Second Encounter\n+New Survival Mode\n+Already mention of new Bright Island Campaign\n+A level editor, so you can go crazy and make your own Serious Adventures\n+Loads of enemies and bosses\n+Lots of guns to choose from\n+Already downloaded my first custom campaign, thanks Workshop support!\n\nCons:\n-Its early access","April 30, 2014","true","1.3"," 110 of 124 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","110","124","0","16"

This was done for numerous reasons, one of the biggest being how SS1's multiplayer servers were taken down by Gamespy.\n\nSSR features a very large amount of levels, workshop support, 64 bit support and numerous other things. I could go into depth about what made Serious Sam great but fundamentally, you have to play it to see why.\n\nThe strengths of Serious Sam could easily be compared to games like Doom or Quake. In that it is the level design and enemy placement that makes it unique and stand out. Every enemy in Serious Sam by themselves are ♥♥♥♥ easy to kill. However when the level throws hundreds of them at you, you start noticing just how hard the game is. It is a very rewarding game, and truly one of the best examples of a "classic FPS"\n\nOf course if you don't wanna play alone there's 16 player coop, and deathmatch. With the many varied levels of the first and second encounters, and the hundreds more due to arrive on the workshop. Serious Sam Revolution is one of the best ways to spend 10$ on Steam.\n\nOr you could just buy SS Gold, you get it for free there.

This game was released more than 6 months ago but she still has very main problems that were in the beginning. Developers focused on adding new content, application of new ideas, improving technical side (high resolution, controller support) but main gaming base remained unchanged.\n\nI will not write anything about the balance of the game. He is the same as in HD Encounters. I have not noticed any changes. Only kleers and buls are moving a bit differently - they are harder to kill and they are more dangerous than HD.\n\nSerious Sam Classics: Revolution have both Encounters. A few days ago was added new difficulty named "I am Ugh-Zan". The same us "Serious" difficulty but all enemies have 1,5x health and each enemy has two extra kinds of skins: Red and Green. Red skins can burn you, green slow you down. With 1,5x health of enemies you may have problems in rooms where hundreds of frogs or invasion of the bulls. This is not a problem when you have unlimited using F6 (quick save) and F9 (quick load).\n\nProblems and bugs1. Main problem for me - 1 ammo bag at co-op survival for all players. Its mean if first player will take the ammo bag - the second player will have to wait 30 seconds for respawn of new ammo bag. How play without ammo?! Yes game have places for even 42 players but possible to play only when you play solo at co-op. Even play with 1 friend - you can not play, nothing good will come.\n2. Seems for achievement "I am Ugh-Zan" you do not need play all game at this difficulty, run only last level with "I am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, all other levels with tourist is enough. It means that its very easy achievement and anyone can get it without problems. It would be interesting if you need some skills and spend time for training if you are really want this achievement, like "all gold at survivals" TSE HD... Also they changed rules, 2x health were previously. It was much more serious. I am very disappointed, I will not set this achievement for my best.\n3. Records at leaderboards.\n» Firstly, we can`t check Steam profile of players from the game, we can see only their nicknames with results. Also no any filters for campaign results, just general score for full campaign.\n» Secondly, developers did not fair to the players when they deleted many results from leaderboards. Because, now I can see same results which were made with the same scheme. 8+ hours at co-op survival where you can`t pause the game or play with any friends and 1+ hour at "Space ball" map are prove my words. Its obvious for me, why not obvious for developers?!\n» Thirdly, no anti-cheat system at game. Still no one red hacked record at leaderboards. This simply can not be after 6 months.\n4. During co-op survival match, any players can join to the game. They will not get a result but they can help a lot to the host.\n5. Survival mode have 4 maps. "Space ball" have 2x gravity and you do not need to shoot enemies, just walk forward and look at the sky. So only 3 playable maps. I hope that will adds new maps.\n\nLIKED1. At leaderboards you can see how much kills players got. Its important for survivals... But do not forget that some enemies have friendly fire. Blue golem like a boss. He will help to you a lot.\n2. During any kind of co-op games, you can see what damage your teamates and you are gave to enemies... But not restarted after match, cumulative statistics. Need fix.\n3. New weapons... But still no hotkeys for them.\n\nOUTPUTYes this game have not modern graphics, have many bugs and serious problems which have not completed yet after 6 months,\nbut cost very cheap and she is made not from Croteam and I got only positive emotions when I played this game. I'm not sorry that I bought it for my collection of Serious Sams. So lets try it too!\n\nI will not give an assessment now since the game is definitely not completed. I hope that will full reset of leaderboards, will adding new content for Survival mode and adding Steam cards.\n\nGood luck Scratch~!","November 19, 2014","true","190.9"," 70 of 92 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","70","92","2","5"

The combination of two classic first person shooters not only comes bundled with the two originals, but also with tons of extra features to make it have even more lastability. There are more guns, more modes, and even an extra campaign on the way. (This is an early access review so that hasn't been finished yet) There's also a workshop with lots of interesting custom made levels, full missions, custom scenarios, and tons of changed for textures, skins, and other visuals. There's so much content in this version, along with some controller support and other cool features to better suit newer and broader audiences, that it's practically overflowing!\n\nBeyond all the amazing extra features with this new version, the combination of the two classics into one epic adventure is great. It will be many hours of gameplay shooting down tons of interesting enemies with cool guns in big arena styled combat. Maybe a few minor puzzle bits here and there. And of course, some very large environments to view and explore.\n\nYou may not want to get the few changes and additions to the game that are in this version, though. And if not, well this is still an excellent way to get the first two encounters in their original form at the same time! A bit cheaper than the complete pack. You can play them without all the extra stuff added in.\n\nYet you'll still want Revolution for the workshop content, extra modes, extra campaign, new features, and online capability, though I haven't personally played online. I might in the future, but I'm not too into online stuff, so if anything I'll most likely wait for the full release when more people are buying and playing. Perhaps I'll update this once I've tried it to give you my thoughts on that as well.\n\nSo it sure sounds like I'm all for this, but note there are some issues here too. It's early access, so it will be changing still. I'm not sure what will be added, cut, or changed. So it's always risky. Also, the workshop content does seem to be annoying to manage, as you have to delete it from Steam for get rid of it, then boot up the game, have it make the changes, and the reboot it so the changes can be permenent. But it's not too hard to do. There's also the inherent problems with quality control on the workshop, which can compound that pain. Sometimes older items from the original games get put into the workshop but don't work because of the changes in this version, and that can be... frustrating to get in on before others catch it. There's the lack of the new campaign as of now, which... will most likely be coming but isn't really a plus to truly note until it does come. And the biggest thing is... why get this over the HD remakes? Well, it's cheaper, and has different physics... but other than that, it sounds rather comparabile. I don't know much about the HD ones, so I'm unsure if there is a workshop for those or not. This is a fan project that opens up more possibilities than the HD versions do, as far as I can tell. Also, this one actually runs on my computer, so... it's nice for that.\n\nBasically, it comes down to the fact that if you like Serious Sam games, you'll probably love this with all the extended playing you'll get to do. You get this plus the two originals. Three games for the price of ten bucks for one. That's pretty good! And if you already have the originals on Steam... well what the heck are ya waitin' for!? This is FREE for those who already have those! There's no reason to NOT get it then. With all the awesomeness of the originals, the inclusion of them with this purchase, and the incredible amount of extra material even already in the early access version, Serious Sam Classics: Revolution gets an 8/10. Fans of the classic FPS... no need to look in your wallet, you know that 10 bucks is already gone.","January 7, 2015","true","40.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","23","25","3","0"

So, might as well make a review for It finally!\n\n\nSerious Sam Classics: Revolution Is a game pack.  That reminds me an awful lot of Serious Sam for the Xbox. As It even had The First, and Second Encounters merged Into one big fantastic gore fest.\n\nNow I've been playing Serious Sam since The First Encounter way back, and I haven't stopped playing since then . Sadly I've been living a depressing life, and thanks to Sam he has been there for me, to ease the pain. I'll never regret how much how this game puts me in good spirits even if it's for just short bursts.\n\nAnyways, back to this seriously awesome pack of seriousness. Which like I stated at the start of this review. The first two encounters are included, but now something new is invading the this seriously awesome world. Croteam are implementing a third campaign, which Is still not playable yet. Though since the game Is still In Early Access. Hopefully soon It'll be included. Now I have encountered some bugs and problems with It, but hopefully It'll take notice and Croteam It will get fixed real soon.\n\nAnyways, let's talk about the games contents... shall we?\n\n\n==[Serious Sam - The First Encounter] ==\n\n\nSo, the game actually doesn't start with much of a story, If you didn't skip the opening credits that Is. The game takes place In Egypt, 3000 B.C. (As Serious Sam states In Serious Sam 3: BFE, a prequel to SS:TFE).\n\nAt the start of the game, before the bloodbath really sets in. You get to meet your little AI friend "Netrica". (Or her nickname Nettle, In Serious Sam 2) Though In this review, we'll be calling her Nettie for now. Hehe,She's a AI computer planted Into Sam's brain, and she's Sam's friend, and your guide throughout the experience. Nettle will give you useful tips on things such as the history on the area you're In, Information on the aliens you'll be encountering, etc. She's quite useful, and I recommend reading what she says when you click on your right mouse button.\n\nSo, some may say. The point of the game Is just shoot, go to the next arena, and shoot more again. Or kill anything that moves. Nope, It's not only that, but the open areas are beautiful and wide. And there's many secrets to discover In each one If your curious enough to take a treasure hunt. Now for the AI on the monsters, the AI Is just ment to be stupid, really. As the monsters are just pretty mindless, so what's the point of having good AI? Now for the graphics. The graphics were beautiful and fantastic back In 2001. The reflections and many effects the game Is just beautiful. The Serious Engine Is perfectly made, and It was a marvel for It's time."\n\n__________________________\n\n\n==[Serious Sam - The Second Encounter]==\n\n\nAlright! Now to move onto Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.\n\n\nNow, this one Is the cartoons variation of the Serious Sam games. Though that's what I kind of love about the games, the cartoon like vibe and humor! But seriously... Who doesn't?\nSo, at the ending of Serious Sam: The First Encounter. The Croteam Developers make a rather funny appearance In the opening Intro. Flying flying In rollercoaster like snake of crates, and they accidently smash Into the Sirian UFO that Sam Is In. Sam Is a little enraged by this, and the UFO crashes Into the mountains of South America. Sam thought he'd be In Egypt again, but he was wrong.\n\nNow, as you might now know.  the Serious Sam games have always been known for the Egypt setting. Which I'm pretty sure a lot of gamers got sick of. This was a chance for Croteam to do something else other blast away aliens near towering pyramids. This time however you get some new toys to add to Sams collection. A Sniper Rifle, Flamethrower and Chainsaw. Now, you get to mutilate the invasion with even more "class". Such as the Demons, chainsaw wielding pumpkin heads, and many other deranged baddies. Which just makes the game even more Awesome! Plus your little friend Netrica Is back! And ready to give you more Info!\n\n__________________________\n\n\nThe developers of Serious Sam Classics: Revolution are doing a great job on this! They may need to still work on some bugs, but Croteam is doing a great job altogether though!\n\nAnd well, that's the end of this review. I wanna thank Croteam for creating this beautifully articulated and well crafted game. Also for this game helping me through the rough times in my life.\n\n\nI my yellow shades towards you Croteam. For making me the guy I am today . The fact they care even for their work in the past. As this pack makes the originals live long and unformatted. Again, Thank you Croteam, and I hope you'll be making Serious Sam games 'till the day you croak.\n\n\nCredit goes to ZealousFoX for helping me Improve the review more, and being a great friend.","November 28, 2014","true","51.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

It was my childhood. The first video-game I ever played. I beat the classic games multiple times. I've played ALL Serious Sam games on every console, even Serious Sam Advance on GBA.  And now the game is back. Same game, except without GameSpy, as it's been cancelled, Steamworks integration (WORKSHOP, WOO!) and a new Bright Island campaign that's soon to come. Oh, by the way, CROTEAM OWNS. (I rate 12/10. Seriously.)\n\nSerious Sam was (and still is) one of the best first-person shooters around. It needs more recognition, though.\n\nSam "Serious" Stone, the protagonist of this game series, is hilariously punny, agile and fearless. The level designs are seemingly flawless. In every level there's plenty of fun secrets and easter eggs. This is one of those no-nonsense first-person shooters, completely relying on skill, not fancy camos or weapon attachments. That's right. Skill. Hundreds of enemies attacking from everywhere and no taking cover behind sandbags, no-siree. This game is not for you Call of Duty or Battlefield pansies (Both series are still fun though!). If you rage at Call of Duty and say "I slept with ur mom m9 xddddd mountain dew" then this game isn't for you. But I still highly recommend it so then you'll stop your babyish fits of rage. No noticed glitches so far, and absolute positivity for hours upon hours of non-stop action and fun. And if you don't want to fight monsters, fight your friends in an epic multiplayer arena experience.\n\nBurn, explode and pour lead into hordes of oncoming monsters! Hear and see the fun jokes from Sam and the developers. Solve puzzles, explore the world, laugh a little and kill a lot. This is definitely a great game. And even kids can play it! My 7-year-old stepsister enjoys it very much, and there's even a setting to change the blood red, green or "hippie" ;). It's fun for the whole family and even has 4-way split-screen! Where did this game go wrong? NOWHERE. It's perfect for casual gamers and hardcore gamers alike. The only con is the arthritis or carpal tunnel that may occur from you constantly being on-edge with the non-stop action.\n\nBut that's just reviewing the classic games alone. Now for the new Revolution version:\nSerious Sam Classic: Revolution brings back the old and fun version of Serious Sam (Not that the rest weren't fun) with the same graphics for you hipster saps*. Managing to perfectly combine the First and Second encounter, it's flawlessly triple the beauty. It has Steamworks integration, which means it has the Steam workshop, the 27015 port commonly used with Source Engine games and matchmaking without GameSpy (RIP). But it has a new campaign, not yet accessible in the current version. It also has a brand-new** Survival Mode, where you can now sit back and fend off LITERALLY thousands of enemies for as long as you can. It also brings back the beautiful Split-screen so now you and 3 buddies can unleash mayhem upon the mayhem that's already been unleashed. There's also new and fun mutators for multiplayer game sessions, Survival exempt, which adds to the fun that's already there. It also has everyone's favorite mod, Seriously! Warped Deathmatch fully integrated into the game itself, which includes more maps and weapons galore. And a few smaller things, you can pick your HUD theme and there's slightly upgraded shaders. But the game was already perfect enough.\n\nSo, this overall is a great game. I enjoy it very much and it's TOTALLY worth the money. It's worth more than they're asking, so this is practically a smooth steal. And I'll definitely buy it to just give away to friends because it's so flippin' good. I rate this game a solid 12 out of 10.\n\nNow what are you waiting for? BUY THE GAME! Seriously. Just do it.","November 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","25","30","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/227780/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSerious Sam is a series of a games that were developed by Croteam and is a old-school no-nonsense FPS. Just kidding about old-school, it's more of a arcade-ish horde fighting game, more focused on shooting down tons of enemies rather than exploring mazes, all while Quake 1 was struggling to have more than few enemies on a screen. But hey, when there was so many military shooters, you couldn't be picky.\n\nAnyway, The First Encounter was released in 2001, becoming a sleeper hit at the time when other developers were starting to compete at making the most boring realistical games already. You would be playing as Serious Sam, going back into past because unknown alien by name Mental was attacking Earth and even still manages to send his colorful troops into the past as well to stop you. And thus Sam Stone had to get serious, shoot many things, grab many weapons and beat many Egypt levels, filled with huge spaces and handled as one continous arena. And reading excuse text that Netricsa, your mind computer, was sending you. It also had small moments of silence, mystery and spookyness, rarely.\n\nThe Second Encounter was a sort of sequel or stand-alone expansion pack, that came out in 2002. Thanks to Croteam, Sam is still on Earth and now has to travel over 12 more levels, with 5 in Maya era, 4 in Persia or so and 3 in Gothic. Though they felt less interesting, aside from the last three levels of Gothic that are simply awesome. Plus new weapons, like sniper rifle that is used as single-shot super double shotgun rather than for sniping (but it's strong only when aiming down sight. Right mouse click, left mouse click, done!). And new enemies. And new bosses. And music is still awesome.\nIt also came with fan-made mod Warped that gave Serious Sam more multiplayer competive modes like capture the flag.\n\nDidn't take long for Gold edition to come out, that was a simple compilation of the two games, but  Second Encounter now had more exclusive deathmatch levels and a fan-made single-player mappack The Dark Island. It's amateurish and seemed to be comissioned with tight deadlines, so eh. Buggy too.\n\nFew years later these games would be remade in HD, but you know, it's a different story, with some cuttin and rebalancing.\nAnother version to note is Xbox version of Serious Sam, that combined both games while giving it changes in style to make it fit more toward more cartoonish Serious Sam 2. What it means is shiny different weapon models and new humorous cutscenes.\n\nBut then in 2014 a group of fans Alligator Pit got official support from Devolver Digital and Croteam and released a definite version of Serious Sam 1 games. Or more like, remastered, if that word fits. Revolution combines both Serious Sam Encounters into single game and fixes various bugs, like multiplayer being dead due to death of Gamespy or level editor not working for 64-bit systems, also giving widescreen support. Though original Classic versions on Steam would later get multiplayer and editor patched. At least Revolution allows you to download mods from multiplayer server. And yes, it got multiplayer maps from Gold edition. No, Dark Island is not included, search Steam workshop for it. Yep, Steam features implented!\nBut Revolution does much more. It's supposed to include a new campaign called Bright Island (no, not sequel to Dark Island) once it comes out of Early Access. As of now, it has a new Survival mode with few maps already. They even sneaked in new three weapons (not exactly new, right) into Serious Sam campaigns into three new secrets, so you can search those. Otherwise, purist be happy.\n\nAnd a nice thing is that it was given free to owners of both Classic Sam titles. As a upgrade. And you also get Classic titles as a bonus if you buy this now.\n\nMultiplayer works but isn't all that active. But it should boom a bit at least once when final version will come out.\nThough it's mostly to hang out with friends. Competive has two interesting rules: super speed when holding knife and double shotgun shoots as fast as single shotgun. It gives more fun, but still doesn't balance perfectly. Still, shame it didn't make competetive scene, it doesn't weight you down with silly strafejumping while being extremely fast-paced.\nCoop should be fun too. Mhmm, even though few years in Classic Second Encountered whenever I would play on those infinite ammo servers, I felt that my brain shrank to the size of a nut. Because respawn plus infinite ammo equals to just holding left mouse button with no care for the world.\n\nFrom technical side it seemed to be fine, but I noticed that weirdly enough I sometimes miss monsters a bit when turning around or side-stepping or both. It feels like shots sometimes went where my aim was at a half-second ago. Or something to do with timing. I don't remember it happening in the past in originals. But at least it's not big issue, just sometimes.\n\nAnd most importanly is the same awesome gameplay. You may think that because it's a horde shooter then it must be dumb. You are destroying few hundrets monsters per level after all. You may remember one of those other trashy horde games, like where you could just beat game by backpedalling in circle while shooting away at monsters that barely catch up. Is Serious Sam as silly as that?\n\nNo. Actually, it's probably the best horde shooters out there. Because this game has a flow in combat. It makes you care about weapon selection and respect each enemy type. You may be overwhelmed by HOW much of weapons you are given by the end. But while they are generic, each of them has that one specialization where they are the best choice. Even weaker enemies can be prefered over stronger, like you will use Thompson on medium enemy encounters over Minigun if you don't want to waste bullets. Even Single Shotgun is sometimes prefered over Double Shotgun, when dealing with bunch of weak enemies. Though, it doesn't stop weapons from being divided into tiers. Sure think Plasmagun is the way to go. But you know, ammo. Ammo ammo ammo. If you want to converse ammo for big guns for big encounters, try to use weaker weapons on weaker fights. Such stuff. In other words, it makes players switch weapons instead of sticking with few "toys".\n\nAnd as said, enemy diversity. They all have different tactics, all require different ways to avoid their attacks. Sure, it got one type, Gnaar, that is just weak slow melee monster. But then it got stuff like Lava Golem who aims at where you will be with fireballs and you have to either change direction or knock balls off with shots. Or skeleton Kleer, who is weak-medium healthed, but is extremely fast and attacks by leaping, so you have to sidestep this one. And when in horde, you now have to prioritise target, whether you want to shoot down weak yet explosive kamikazes, who go "Aaaaaaaaa!!", first or if you should neutralize huge chicken-like biomechanoid who is going to blow you up with rocket if he gets close and is tough on health.\n\nA bit of planning separates good action from dumb action. Like good platformers. And good graphics for it's time with excellent art style, which is colorful yet not too cartoonish. And excellent music that is both atmospheric and memoriable and blood-bumping.\nAnd fun secrets. Occasionally funny.\n\nThe only flaw is that it can overstay the welcome. Can get repetitive. Or at least I didn't dig some levels, especially in Second Encounter. No, final levels were awesome. It just can get old to beat it in one sitting.\n\nBut grab it, Seriously! It's a good game that I was fan of. Well, because of level editor mostly. And not only it's a good game, but it's the best pure version. As in, not remake, just definition and addition, while you can get same experience. I mean, those old-school low-poly chunks of gibs that slide all over walls have their own charm too, you know.","October 9, 2015","true","97.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

Why?\n\nUnlike Doom, there's no stupid complicated mazes.\n\nUnlike Duke Nukem 3D, there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keycard hunts.\n\nUnlike Quake, there's more colors than brown, black, and gray.\n\nUnlike Unreal, there's no dumb enemy placements.\n\nUnlike Half-Life, there's great music playing all the time.\n\nUnlike System Shock 2, there's no needlessly complex interface.\n\nUnlike Call of Duty, your guns are all unique.\n\nUnlike Battlefield, there's no dumb realism that slows the game down.\n\n\nIf you think those qualities above makes a game great, you're wrong. Check out what Serious Sam has to offer:\n\n-Fast-paced action to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n-Huge, beautiful environments for you to immerse in.\n-Loads and loads of enemies for you to take on at the same time.\n-Simple yet smart level layouts that makes the best of enemies, items, weapons, secrets, and traps.\n-Dynamic and wonderfully-composed music that changes based on the level of action you're facing.\n-Different types of enemies to provide maximum challenge.\n-Fun, unique weapons that has a purpose in any given situation.\n-All you need to know is how to move and shoot to play the game.\n\nCombine all that, and you just got yourself the recipe for the perfect game. Serious Sam Revolution is a compilation of the classic Serious Sam 1 games, The First Encounter and The Second Encounter. TFE contains 15 levels while TSE contains 12, all of them fun, massive, and action-packed.\n\n\n"But isn't there already Serious Sam HD, where it is the same game with nice modern graphics?"\n\nFirst of all, slap yourself for saying that. Now listen to what I have to say.\n\nGraphics doesn't make a game good. It's how you implement it with the other aspects of the game. Fortunately for Serious Sam Revolution, its 2001 and 2002 graphics still hold up well by today's standards. The way they used the bright colors is what makes it different from HD; in some way it even looks better than HD despite being not as detailed. This is because it is specifically designed to be eye-catching instead of just having higher polygons and resolution.\n\nSerious Sam HD also lost other cool aspects of Serious Sam Classics, such as special gravity and enemy combos. These may seem like minor changes, but it's the little things that counts.\n\n\nWith all that said, if you still consider Serious Sam Revolution not worth of purchase, perhaps it's time for you to reflect on yourself and your life so far to find out how you reached the conclusion that you shouldn't play this masterpiece of a game. Then buy the game and play it so that you'll realize the errors of your ways, correct yourself, and become a better person though Serious Sam.","September 27, 2014","true","363.5"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","27","37","3","12"

It is fast-paced, you won't have much time to think, but mostly to shoot at everything and everyone. Probably doesn't sound as anyone's cup of tea so far. I agree. What makes this game special for me, is the environment. Every level has a unique design, and believe me, for 2001, the game looks amazing. You will fight through antic Egypt temples, dunes, dark sewers, pyramids etc.\nYup, the game action takes place in ancient Egypt. Why? Play the game and see, I don't want to spoil anything from storyline.\n\nThe game has also got its fair share of hilarious moments. Remember Duke's viral quotes from 1997? I can't say Sam's ones are the same, but they definitely remain in fans' hearts.\n\nThe second Serious Sam game, The Second Encounter, has got the same gameplay of the 2001 classic. It adds a few new weapons (oh, and SUCH weapons!!), but I love it because... you guessed, the environment. This one and Serious Sam 2 are probably the most exotic games in the series. TSE will guide you through Mayan ruins, jungles, volcanos, many more and all locations are filled with memorable puzzles. They are not hard to accomplish, so they won't spoil the lore-fun in any way. However, the game has MANY secrets, and most will require a dose of quicksaves and loads in order to get..\n\nPros: - memorable action!!\n- tons of weapons. I haven't insisted on describing them on the review. Instead, just try collecting them all and you will see what I mean;\n- tons of levels, massive single campaign with unique locations and enemies;\n- 100% Old-school FPS;\n- Sam.\n\nCons: - not being able to change difficulty in-game; the balancing seems to get heavy every now and then, making the game a lot harder even on decent difficulties;\n- finger muscle soreness due to non-stop clicking...\n\nPersonal rating: 92/100 - Amazing","August 12, 2014","true","16.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","1"

There were some players though who preferred the original– either for the lower requirements, the old-school looks, or because they didn’t like the small level and gameplay changes. So, they disassembled the old engines and completely remade them as a single package, completed with a series of bug fixes and some community levels.\nThe result was Revolution, which turned out to be so good that now it even replaced the original First and Second Encounters in the Steam store.\n\nIf you never met this series, then buckle up, because Serious Sam is a very old-school FPS. There are no covers or health regeneration (unless you play the sissy difficulty), and the enemies won’t stop in the distance to make sure the player has time to kill them at their leisure. Here, you have to gruellingly cut, burn, slice, shoot, and explode your way through courtyards upon courtyards of alien monsters in ancient Egypt, the Maya Empire, Babylon, and medieval Europe.\nThis may suggest some grim and gritty tone, but Serious Sam is also known for its cheesy humour, usually in the form of corny one-liners– mimicking the worst of 80s action movie clichés– or goofy secrets. This combination of hardcore action and nonsensical writing was one of the reasons Serious Sam reached its cult classic status, and the reason anyone who never played it should do so at least once.\n\nYou can also follow the Completing the Backlog Curator page for more reviews!","January 22","true","32.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

The developers really did a good job with this game and managed to retain the core of what the SS games really mean : the classic funcade of arcade shooting where health pickups were known,going behind cover were for sissies, and 100+ enemies could fit in your screen. The classical FPS arcade-style can be compared to other known titles such as Doom 1 & 2, and the Quake series. Fast-paced, non-stop shooting action will keep you coming back for more gore and gibbing.\n\nThe fun just doesn't end with the arcade feel of the game, but also due to the workshop support and not to mention 64-bit COMPATIBILITY ! Even after finishing the levels in the game, there is still hours worth investing on custom-made maps, survival mode, versus mode and not to mention the replayability of this game is really good. The 16 player coop will surely prevent you from boredom.\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention, the level editor is fairly easy to use.

Serious Sam holds a test of time. Not only for being a 14 year game and looking like a game that came out 6 or 7 years ago, but the fluid FPS action is something we just don't see anymore.

The team are doing great things to modernise and optimise the game, but as somebody who just wants to play the thing I can't stand every update breaking my save files. There's a command to circumvent the error, but that just throws up a different error because they've quite obviously updated and improved the code since the previous saves. I suppose it's unavoidable given that it's Early Access, but that also makes it somewhat unplayable.\n\nAs far as I could tell, there was no warning or indication that this may happen to your save file upon starting the game.","May 28","false","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is like, a mixed version of the classic SS 1 and the modern SS HD: Featured lots of new content and changes, and still retained the simple but remarkable graphics instead of the modern graphics, so because of that, it also supported much more gameplay features resembles the first SS, which are exclusive to the classical Serious Engine 1 (so you could call this game engine is: Serious Engine 1.5 lol), the most notable being: Abnormal gravity areas, and much more to make a return once this game is out of the development phase and began to storm the final release process. The things i just said above, will surely keep you occupied in the total mayhem and endless madness of this game for hours and hours. Also forgot to mention that this game now is intergrated with much more Steamworks' features, such as: Workshop support, trading cards (coming soon), blah blah blah etc... So get this game now! if you want to relive the classical experiences that once dominated your (maybe) entire childhood when you are struggling to spent every seconds playing it until you felt great, now with much more things to explore! Peace, guys, and looking forward to play with you, or against you, in this awesome, amazing, and totally BADASS game.","May 1, 2014","true","25.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics stick to being similar if not the same as the classic encounters. The gameplay is the same as the classics with some extra difficulty here and there.

Shoot hordes of enemies and avoid their attacks, it encourages staying mobile and not standing around with your hand in your pants. Should be more games like this, but people don't seem to understand that games are supposed to be fun.  Lots of monsters to shoot, secrets on every level, nobody trying to shove a half ♥♥♥♥♥ narrative down your throat, pretty much what an FPS of this sort should be.\n\n**Please note that "The Second Encounter" is NOT Serious Sam 2. The first and second encounters are basically the same game divided into two, as Croteam was unable to release them together due to financial problems.**\n\n\nIt is an old school FPS somewhat comparable  Quake/Doom, but much more action oriented. You won't spend any time finding keycards or navigating a labryinth, and the only time you might be solving a puzzle is if you want to access secrets. Most of your enemies attacks are dodged by strafing and jumping. Very much a "dumb" FPS, but it is immensely fun and a classic you should try if you are into older FPS games at all.\n\nYou get the first two encounters and an updated version of both. The updated is in early access beta, but is stable and complete for the most part. A couple of very minor things have been changed (the teleport to Moon Mountains is now a pendulum, and the secret gun you get from cutting down the tree in The Second Encounter  seems to have been left out) but is the same game otherwise. The Revolution version also includes multiplayer (I can't seem to get it working, probably my internet), Acheivements, and a Map pack called "Bright Island" (not complete yet). The only problem I have with Revolution is there seems to be no option to turn the original graphics on. You do get the original versions of the encounters, but they do not have Achievements like "Revolution"","November 27, 2015","true","12.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

This is a cheap way to start Serious Sam as it started, with the first games.

And well...that counts to me; somewhat. I mean, the first SS game I played was Next Encounter for the PS2, and it was a crazy good time! But what about the classic games? Despite their large fan community and mod support; something didn't feel quite..."modern" with the games.\n\nEnter Serious Sam Revolution, a fan-made version of the classic Serious Sam titles made by some of the most well-known and diehard SS fans from around the globe. While it's in Early Access at the moment, the full version of Revolution will include a new campaign, new gamemodes and much more. And how did this grab my attention? Well, because it was fuggin free! Well, it is free but you gotta own both classic titles. How does this fare? Well...\n\nThe gameplay of SS Revolution are like any other Serious Sam game: shoot enemies, get new weapons, shoot more enemies, kill a boss, you get the idea. Sometimes you can get a friend or family member to help out with slaughtering mass hordes of enemies with a minigun. Graphics? Same as the classic games. Old, but impressive for the time....and this time with OpenGL.\n\nAs for Revolution itself, the new Steam-based features are pretty cool; with leaderboard support, achievements and Workshop, and more streamlined multiplayer. Of course, seeing how this is a Early Access game, I noticed a rather odd bug where the Workshop items wouldn't load, but it might be because I'm not loading them right or it really is a bug, but eh. <.<\n\nStill, if ya want a dose of nostalgia get this game! I sincerly can't wait for the full release and maybe hear John J. ♥♥♥♥'s secksy voice in the new campaign mode, lol.","April 30, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TCm8/recommended/227780/","TCm8","党 Double Darrell Shotgun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TCm8/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSerious Sam will always hold a special place in my heart as a series that kickstarted my love for...well, games, to be completely honest with you (Timesplitters was the series that kept my interest for the long term.) I highly doubt that I would be enjoying games if Serious Sam and Timesplitters didn't show me just how fun, crazy and satisfying it can be. But I don't necessarily want to be reviewing Serious Sam as a game here, as chances are if you're reading this review you've already played a Serious Sam game. Instead, let's focus on the fan-remake, Classics: Revolution.\n\nThere isn't much to say really. The gameplay is near-identical to how I remember it on the original Xbox, and since the Xbox version I played was pretty different to the First and Second Encounter I was somewhat surprised. If, like me, you've never played the original on PC, the workshop support will allow you to change the enemy models and HUD to something you remember. The workshop support also helps enhance and prolong the replayability, as custom maps are actually still being added and the ones I've played have all been excellent. The engine is smooth and well-optimized, and if any graphical tweaks are needed then you're at full liberty to do so with an expansive options menu (that can be somewhat confusing to navigate) This game may seem a bit pointless considering there are HD editions, but I found that Classics: Revolution has the most resemblance to the Serious Sam I know and love. Plus, the First and Second Encounters are conjoined in this game, whereas the HD versions are split and have different features in both, which is frustrating to say the least.\n\nOnwards to the negative. Yes, this is Early Access. Yes, this is fan-made. As such, there are a number of bugs that are annoying but rarely game-breaking. They are still there, however. Some issues I've ran into are enemies getting stuck behind objects and walls frequently, which makes it a lot easier to shotgun them to pieces, some buttons required for puzzles and secrets actually won't work depending on what gun you're holding, and graphical glitches such as clipping through the wall ever so slightly if you brush against one (this one is perfectly manageable, since it happens on other games frequently, such as Skyrim, and doesn't take up a lot of screen space) I've also experienced crashes, especially every time I tab out.\n\nHowever, these negatives are still minor because this Early Access game is feature complete as hell. I haven't yet had the chance to try out online multiplayer but I've tried local co-op and it works fine. Definitely buy this if you like Serious Sam because I think it is better than the HD versions because it's a lot closer to the original with better looking graphics that match the original's style completely.","April 2","true","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woahhhh/recommended/227780/","woahhhh","Stoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woahhhh/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHaving kept up with this game through the Seriouszone forums, I was quite happy when it finally appeared in my library. And apart from some funny business in the beginning with saving/loading (an issue that has since been fixed) it has done well to meet my expectations.\n\nWhat this game is exactly is simple, it's a combination of the original First and Second Encounters optimized for modern hardware. The developers have been kind enough to go beyond that as well, they've updated the editor, integrated the whole game with Steam, added a Survival mode, and revamped the networking software. And that's all in the Early Access version. The final version promises a new single-player campaign, added gamemodes, weapons, and modding capabilities, trading-cards, and some demonstration maps for the new features.\n\nAside from all that however the game is authentic and almost-unaltered Serious Sam Classic, that means crazy gravity, harpies that don't auto-gib, insane ammo-consuming miniguns, slower grenade launcher firerate, and non-xbox style models.  They did however go for one unified sound with the lasergun across both Encounters, and that is good, makes FE less headache inducing. I also enjoy being able to use the Second Encounter HUD for the game, as it's always been my favorite in the whole series.\n\nI don't know if the current price (9.99) will go up after the final version is released, but for now it remains one of the best deals on the SS Classics you can get, and it's already cheaper than buying both Encounters on GOG. It's updated often to take care of those harmful bugs and the devs seem quite dedicated to their craft.\n\nOverall I'd mainly recommend Revolution to those who want to experience the original Serious Sam games on current hardware, without needing the processing power required for the HD versions. If you're like me and also appreciate the smaller, less signifcant details, then you'll probably enjoy being able to go from The Great Pyramid to Sierra De Chiapes without starting a new game, as well as the general extra polish SS Classic has over the HD versions.","May 2, 2014","true","83.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't see any option in the mutators for this, so I'll suggest some AI bots in the split screen mode, to add to the fun . ( If you're playing one on one, just running around and looking for the other guy to shoot can be a drag, but a few dozen murderous space freeks can really spice up the action .)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/227780/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a perfect re-release of The First and Second Encounter (and expansions) of the Serious Sam franchise (I prefer to forget BFE).  Now, it's got slightly improved textures and widescreen support-- but keep in mind, this project is very new, and needs to get a foothold on bugs and such before they get down to fixing the graphics and all.  It is labeled "Early Access..."\n\nIf you don't know what Serious Sam is...\n1) What the hell were you doing 10 years ago, back when we could actually play console games and not be overly disappointed with bugs?\n2) Know that just by looking at the name on the Steam store page, you should have already purchased this.  Well, if you didn't trust it after BFE, your reluctance is at least understandable...\n\nIt's pretty much, to describe it as blandly as I can, a first person Rambo-style (as in the real Rambo, not that movie-game crap) where you fight aliens and re-animated soldiers like a badass.  It's kind of like Duke Nukem, but less cheap call ladies and more giant one eyed things that need professional facial displacement services.\n\nIf you've ever liked Serious Sam, get this game immediately.  It's the classics, sure, not exactly super-HDX-ultrapower-graphicalness, but it's still good enough nonetheless.  It's got full multiplayer support carried over, and it's a lot more compatible with modern systems.  It does a great job of optimizing itself so that you don't have to, though you're welcome to go through its options whenever you feel like it.\n\nIt has full workshop support with downloads permitted, custom map support, and mutators.  Jack up that enemy count to 600% and start pulling that trigger... you may or may not like its effect on Kamikaze units.\n\nEven in an early access state, this game is awesome.  It's also a great starting point in the series, since it comes with both the First and Second encounter, and maybe the second game entirely.  I'm not sure.\n\nThis puts away the mess we saw with BFE, and I'm ready for another Serious Sam title.  As long as hitscan-wielding enemies are as rare as they are in this game, we'll be set.","June 17, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/227780/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBefore you downvote this review, note that I'm not evaluating the first two encounters themselves.\n\nI'm a Serious Sam fanatic and I've played all the games of the series--but I still think both the First and Second Encounter suffer from some odd design choices such as the puzzles and platforming. SS3 is my favorite old-school FPS.\n\nThat being said, I would not recommend you purchase SS:R anytime soon until there is some major content underway. Unlikely as it may be as this is not a full-time project by CroTeam. You can get this game for free if you own the classic games, but the HD versions are what I would consider the superior remake over SSR.\n\nIf you do want to play TFE & TSE, then buy The Second Encounter HD to get both HD games' content. The Steam version of TSE comes with TFE's content--buying TFE alone is pointless.\n\nThis review is to evaluate what you are getting with the EA product.\n\nRating of Completion/Competence\nHere is a detailed list of my scale:\n\n1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently.\n\n2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)\n\n3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.\n\n4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team.\n\n5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.\n\nSimple/Personal Rating: 2/5. (More personal than objective.)\nTo CroTeam's credit, they do tell people not to buy into SS:R right now unless you want to test out their servers or get early into the game. But I don't understand why they put this through EA to begin with if they had nothing new besides the mutliplayer.\n\nDetailed Rating: 11/20 or 55% (Buy the HD version of The Second Encounter, which comes with The First Episode levels, to play with friends.)\nContent: 3(?)/5\n\nThis is an odd thing to state because the game does and doens't have all its content. In one sense, it does have enough to warrant a purchase if you don't own the first two encounters, all of the First and Second encounter are present. And it does have a revamped multiplayer to satiate old-school players.\n\nThe final expansion is still not going to be released anytime soon, which besides the updated engine and the 64 player cooperative mode, was the only thing I was interested in playing.\n\nQuality: 3/5\n\nThis game plays as good as the classic/HD games.\n\nI marked this down several points not because of the low textures from the classic games which were improved with both HD games. The reason is because they didn't improve the technical faults of the original games.\n\nMost notably, the sound limitations of the original game. Enemies' sound effects do not tell you where their location is, the one major flaw of the classic games when it came to hordes of Kleers and the suicide-bomb runners.\n\nOptimization: 4/5\n\nFor single-player and local multiplayer purposes, the game runs just fine. I've read on the forums that servers can be a pain to get working properly and have issues for some people.\n\nProductivity: 1/5\n\nThis product won't be finished anytime soon. CroTeam made this into a fan-project, which I am happy in one sense for them to support a classic series, yet I fail to see any reason to buy this product anytime soon unless they add in the new campaign.

I played this game for a while now (about 30 hours) and it's still my honest opinion that it has nothing added that is even close to worth playing this game. The single player campaign is identical to the hd version, i don't see any point in playing it with worse graphics one more time.\n\nYes, the graphics are really, really bad. I'm not a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ but in this case, since there is an hd update for this game, i won't take my critics back.\n\nMost of the achievements are like the ones in the hd version, most of the new achievements are just about "waste time doing something stupid" (mess with the gravity for xx hours, kill xxxxx enemies).\n\nThe achievements are quite unlockable because noones playing this game, you hardly find 2 or 3 players on a server which makes you spend more time finding a proper game than actually playing it.\n\nThe worst part is the poor netcode. There's no point in playing a co-op multiplayer game with such a crappy netcode, this makes the game totally unplayable for me. I'm sure you noticed the rubberbanding in deathmatch games too. And i'm sure you noticed that the guy who runs the server ALWAYS wins.\n\nThe new weapons are quite useless, maybe the mine-layer makes sense in capture the flag.\n\nGuys, just get the hd version, it's a proper, good looking and smooth running game.","May 11, 2014","false","39.7"," 6 of 64 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","6","64","0","4"

They are a few other little extra things but nothing in Serious Sam Classics Revolution screams get me, I'm better than the orignals. In fact I ran into a little bug in the first half-hour on the end of the very first level. The doors to the exit opened and I accidently backed for a second then went to walk through... I got crushed? First time I've ever got killed by a door on Serious Sam. I've got all the secrets and taken out dozens apon dozens of enemies, some even with rockets and the all mighty Sam gets taken down by the incredible, fast, sneaky unarmed door. I actually laughed for a second until I realised I didn't save once. Joking aside if you already have Serious Sam 1 & 2, you basicly already have this version of the game. As far as I can tell, there are no serious bugs in this version and I'm keeping it just because I like those X-Box health and armor bar plus now the classic are both one game. As far as recommending this game? Yea, why not? If you don't have the classics yet, this is a nice way of bundling both into one game. And if you do have both those classics already, maybe you too would like those X-Box health/armor bars.","July 22, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you were an FPSer back in the early 2000's, you would know about Serious Sam. Started as a tech demo and soon blew up into it's own series, Serious Sam chronicles the story of Sam "Serious" Stone as he fights the other worldly foe known as "Mental". He goes back in time to fight his way through hordes of Mental's minions to save planet earth's future from total destruction. You pick up an arsenal of sweet and GIANT weapons and fight your way through various periods in earth's history to save plaent from mentals grasp. This version of Serious Sam is titled "Revolution" and packs both encounter's plus workshop support and also promises new episodes and loads of new maps made by players and the revival team.

Revolution is very big improvement of this game\nAlso its way more easier to get custom maps from community than in classic. Its sad that it does not supports mods yet but that doesnt ruins the game. In my opinion it fixes every issue that classic one had.\nWhats sad is that not many people plays it. Perhaps if it's possible i'd somehow would add bots to the game so maybe more people would get interested in Versus gamemode not just cooperative.\n\nIt contains First encounter and Second encounter.\nMore weapons and more lobby customization\nMore and deadlier enemies than in classic.\nMore action and more kamikazes and explosions.\n\nWhat really upsets me about this game is that it's very inconvenient to create dedicated server.\nIf that would be fixed i'd think that more servers would be opened instead of hosted servers by user.

It combines the first two Serious Samanthas into one game. I reccomend this over individually buying the two original games. The gameplay is well designed and thought out and is no different from the originals. The graphics are nice (For the time.) and atmospheric. The enemies are very different from each other. They range from a Domo looking thing and some sort of Scorpion with a gun. Pretty creative I must say. The level design is great! Love it. Almost all old games have great level design, just to keep the player interested. We don't have that today in our First Person Shooters.

A faithful modern update to the classic TFE and TSE entries of SS, it truly does what is says it's going to do. The only problem I have with the game is minor graphical bugs (I.e texture weirdness). 8/10 I loved it","February 17","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines the first two Serious Samanthas into one game. I reccomend this over individually buying the two original games. The gameplay is well designed and thought out and is no different from the originals. The graphics are nice (For the time.) and atmospheric. The enemies are very different from each other. They range from a Domo looking thing and some sort of Scorpion with a gun. Pretty creative I must say. The level design is great! Love it. Almost all old games have great level design, just to keep the player interested. We don't have that today in our First Person Shooters. The comedy, which may not be for all is still pretty funny.\n\nFINAL SCORE\n8/10 To much water.","March 23","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Revolution is very big improvement of this game\nAlso its way more easier to get custom maps from community than in classic. Its sad that it does not supports mods yet but that doesnt ruins the game. In my opinion it fixes every issue that classic one had.\nWhats sad is that not many people plays it. Perhaps if it's possible i'd somehow would add bots to the game so maybe more people would get interested in Versus gamemode not just cooperative.\n\nIt contains First encounter and Second encounter.\nMore weapons and more lobby customization\nMore and deadlier enemies than in classic.\nMore action and more kamikazes and explosions.\n\nWhat really upsets me about this game is that it's very inconvenient to create dedicated server.\nIf that would be fixed i'd think that more servers would be opened instead of hosted servers by user. If they disconnect then its over no more server.\n\nAlso it's a very nostalgic game for me and for other people who played Serious Sam back when it was released","March 22","true","56.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am happy that I got it on steam sale. I would've paid more even if there had been no sale at all. This game is fun and I love this game.
