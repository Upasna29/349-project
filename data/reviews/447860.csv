At first this may look like a children's game but it's difficulty isn't the best possible for a child. 1 hit to the wall and game over. Good game","March 5","true","1.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

In the case of Maria The Witch, it goes over like Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good with a great Hayao Miyazaki-inspired style. However, they are outshined by the soundtrack, which is surprisingly awesome for such a game. The controls are simple, but the gameplay takes a bit to get used to. Translating touch screen controls to a mouse is challenging; while Naps Team didn't do it perfectly, they still did a great job at porting it to PC.\n\nBottom line: this is worth the $1.99 to buy.","March 2","true","0.2"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","17","30","5","1"

It has some addictiviness to it, but terrible level desing (more below). Altough it is clear that the developers like Hayao Miyazaki work and got some inspiration from the Kiki's Delivery Service movie, the game does not have the art style nor the charm of Studio Ghibli. The screen-shots on steam can be a little bit deceiving.\n\nThe game is about not crashing your broom in the numerous obstacles, including the ground and clouds above. The problem is that there are many "doors", that open and close right after check points, which does not add real difficulty but makes the player wait until it opens to restart playing, in a game that like Super Meat Boy, requires the player the master by repetition. Also, check points are either too close or too far from one another (altough, to be fair, the player is the one who manages it since you buy the check points with coins you aquire through the level).\n\nOne of the aspects that I find nice on the gameplay was the incetive to explore to find all letters and coins, but this is also bad executed becouse of the level desing. In a game where the challenge is to move without crashing, this game has too many dead ends, which punishes exploration far from check points.\n\nThe game is a good way to kill time, tough. It is addictive and I didn't see the time pass and got my mind away from everyday problems (even if I was frustrated by the bad level design).\n\nIt sure is worth the money it demands, but is it worth your time? It is up to you to decide.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, but as of now we still can't use the menus with a game pad. Which is not a horrible thing, we can use the mouse, but shows lack of pollishing.","May 13","false","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
