This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.\n\nREVIEWCyIne is a first-person exploration and puzzle game that has no regard for conformity and genre standards.  This “game” is not really a game, but more an exploration of existentialism and what is known as “the existential attitude.”\n\n“The existential attitude” is a philosophical concept that describes an individual’s starting point in their existential journey; it is described as: “a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless and absurd world.”  This concept provides the most accurate description of the feeling CyIne will invoke in the player.\n\nThere is no narrative whatsoever; there is only captivating visuals and emotional music.  Those aesthetics will keep you enthralled as you will move around the surreal gameworld in first-person, solving puzzles and desperately searching for any sense of meaning behind it all.\n\nFitting with the overall concept of the game, there is practically no direction given… only slightly in the form of feedback and cutscenes if you did something particularly wrong or right.  You will need to explore and experiment if there is to be any hope of progress.\n\nThere isn’t really much else about this game that can be detailed.  I would say CyIne shares the most similarity to games like Dear Esther and Only If; but CyIne is drastically more abstract and surreal, and truly sits in a league of its own.\n\nI can see how some people who are more action-oriented and are perhaps less patient may find this game boring and will not enjoy it.  If that sounds like you, you may want to stay clear.  However, if you are someone who enjoys experimental games, and if you are someone who can appreciate the novelty of an exploration of existentialism through the medium of a video game: then you should check out CyIne.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","May 19, 2015","true","14.4"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","81","93","0","0"

It's beautiful, filled with light and sound, and you seem to be solving puzzles of some sort -- or maybe you're just stumbling upon the laws of time and physics in this unfamiliar world.  It seems safe, this world doesn't seem to want to hurt you, so you keep exploring.  Maybe there's a point to what you're doing, or maybe not - does it really matter? Whatever it is, it's strangely fascinating - and at the same time calming.\n\nThe best compliment I can pay this game so far is that it seems to have captured in some sense the sensation of one's first visit to Burning Man - wandering the Playa at night taking in the surreal world around you, trying to make sense of it all.  If you've ever been, you know what I mean.\n\nI love to see indie developers pushing the boundaries of gaming in this way, I think the "visual poem" metaphor very accurate.

It requires from the player an insight into the hidden meaning of places and items. This game symbolises an internal spiritual journey into the deeps of human psyche, alternating between closed dark scary places and wide open shining spaces, such are fears and joys of life.\n\nI truly recommend Cylne for all lovers of marvelous and emotional games.\nI believe such innovative game style should be encouraged, as an exciting alternative to mainstream FPS games, opening the way to deeper and more emotional journey games.\nLet's encourage the author to develop further his game, and give him the recognition he deserves for such a challenge, he's leading the way to a new pathway of video gaming.\n\nTo the author: good luck!\nTo the players: enjoy!","June 6, 2015","true","0.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miIIs/recommended/346550/","miIIs","mills","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miIIs/","594 products in account","This game deserves a positive review. I was skeptical about purchasing this because of the mixed reviews, and while I think it's worth more like $5 instead of $9, it's an interesting little game where you get to walk around, see cool stuff, and solve "puzzles" (none of them are difficult.)\n\nThis game does have that partially incomplete amateurish UDK feel to it. I really liked the beginning of this game, and I felt that it kind of got progressively less interesting (albeit still interesting) as it went on. However, as the game went on, I was starving myself waiting for a pizza, and my hunger was increasing. This may have factored into that.\n\nI notice that one of the top positive reviews states the playtime for completing this game as "3-7 hours." This is simply not true. I completed this game AND the bonus chapter in 107 minutes (1hr 47m.) I have no idea how that reviewer got 3-7 hours out of this game. I was going to add that this game would be really cool if you were on LSD. Maybe that reviewer was on LSD. Or maybe he's just a cuck.\n\nAnyway, I can feel the loss of blood circulation in my hands as I type this sentence. I think it's time for that pizza, before I starve. Play this game if you like ♥♥♥♥ like LSD Dream Emulator. Or go play this[lsddev.itch.io] first, and if you really enjoy it, you'll probably get a kick out of Cylne.\n\nThis is a copyrighted review by Videooven, a professional YouTube e-celebrity star and game reviewer.

Hoping it turns around.\n\nThe complete lack of narrative and logic leaves me floundering for a reason to be interested in this game. I can see the beautiful images and soundscape they've designed, and the bizarre, alien world is sort of intriguing in its way. But for me, without context I just can't maintain interest. The puzzles I've played so far haven't been particularly difficult, and they lack any sense of real logic or physics so it just feels like vaguely wandering around playing with shapes until something happens.\n\nI want to like it, and I usually do like surreal, experimental games like this. They've clearly put some thought into creating something artistic and beautiflul.
