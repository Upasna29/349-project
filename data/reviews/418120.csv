"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/recommended/418120/","ladyoberon","LadyOberon [#GamersRule]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyoberon/","2876 products in account","This is a fun game. It's a combination shooter and platformer with really high energy. The story is minimal, and the soundtrack is rather repetitive, but overall, the game has got some really entertaining qualities. The controls are consistently responsive, but it was a bit awkward for me to get used to using the D-Pad and not be able to use the left joystick for movement. The scavenger hunt for weapons and upgrades is definitely a plus and enough to keep most players entertained.\n\nThere are a lot of levels, but I didn't notice anything spectacular in regard to level design. Most new levels were variations of others, but the introduction of new monsters and weapons meant that this didn't detract from my gameplay.\n\nIt's definitely rough around the edges in some ways, though. I'm the type of gamer who is busting every destructible and searching for every possible hidden area and surprise. In doing this, I found an oddity very early on. Upon entering the first doorway (level) I jumped up to the platform on the upper left and started hopping around to see what was there. In attempting to see if my character could walljump, she "fell" through what should have been a solid barrier all the way through to the previous area. When I walked back through the door, my progress had been reset as if I'd restarted the level. This oddity was easily repeated a number of times, but I could find no real purpose for it, so I was forced to conclude that it's simply a design flaw. I also noticed a placement issue, which was most noticeable to me on the second map. There are a certain amount of destructibles that can yield coins or hearts which grant healing. I found one of these green plant destructibles placed above a doorway to the left of the shop. However, it's impossible to get the heart that was dropping from this destructible. It seems to go either behind or through the doorway, and getting too close to the doorway takes you back a level, where there was no heart waiting.\n\nOverall, this game has a lot to enjoy. It should appeal very easily to casual gamers, as well as fans of shooters, platformers, and arcade games. There's a combination of permadeath with checkpoints, meaning that you only have one life and that while you might have to go back a few levels, you won't have to go all the way back to the beginning of the game. In that respect, it's very much like Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams. The addition of a consumable lightpost also helps to reduce rage and allow even young and new gamers to enjoy it. Though I would encourage the developers to revise the store interface so that it's clear that the lightpost is indeed a consumable. I definitely recommend giving it a try.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that the level design gets more interesting as the game progresses, and the placement issue is consistent throughout. Pretty much everywhere there is a shop, there is a doorway with a destructible over it, and I saw this on some standard levels, too. I also noticed that there are several monsters that you simply can't kill in a good area to ensure the coin drop. Many of my drops have ended up in the water or falling in front of one of these doorways. Easy come, easy go, I guess. ;)\n\n\n*This review is featured on the curator page of Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","February 24","true","6.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterclosets/recommended/418120/","monsterclosets","MonsterClosets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monsterclosets/","280 products in account","I paid: £2.99 (Bundle price, normal price: 4.99)\nI expect: 12 hours of play\nI rate it 83/100\nStory-driven: no (but there is one)\nDemo available: yes\nWorth the price. Review below.\n\n"Overall, I think the game will offer you a solid 10-15 hours of gameplay for a very reasonable price. I certainly enjoyed the experience more than I was expecting."\n\nI picked up Cally’s Caves 3 as part of a bundle on BundleStars.com for £2.99, and I was surprised to find that it was quite competent. Casting my eyes down the list of games that I just purchased and downloaded always fills me with buyer’s remorse.  Games which are presented as ‘indie’ titles have been so over-done that they have moved completely out of vogue, and knowing that a game has been developed by an independent entity is no longer impressive.\nThat being said, I decided to try it out anyway. I will begin with the negative points.\n\nThe game looks nice, the sprites are very crisp and clean, but it lacks that last little bit of aesthetic polish. The ground and terrain is built up using tiles but as far as I can see, there is only one multi-tiled geographical feature and that is the soil corners. What this means is that the environment looks blocky and un-natural when it could be much richer; the best comparison that comes to mind is the mega drive Sonic games – they have floating islands that look none-square despite being made entirely of square tiles. The damage text is clearly just a basic font – arial? – and considering the frequency of its display, one imagines it would have been given a little extra attention. I like the fact that the game has a world map that allows you to freely teleport to checkpoints and shops, but the actual map looks as though it was made in mspaint, which surely could have been improved with a small amount of work.\n\nThe music is very pleasant. If it was to my taste, I would download the sound track quite happily. Unfortunately though, the songs are not in sync with the game itself - instead, they play as though it was a playlist on repeat which I found a little jarring. The controls are generally quite sharp with the exception that rolling is needlessly clunky. For some reason, you have to come to a full stop before you can roll and there are two buttons depending on which way you are facing.\nThese complaints are either minor or aesthetic in nature and have almost no bearing on the gameplay. The game is extremely competent despite these flaws, but it breaks no new ground. Platform games that include shooting components are tried and tested, and this game brings nothing new to the table. If I hadn’t recently decided that I was actually going to play through some of the drudgery on my Steam account I probably would not have even considering installing this game. What I found in place of a boring game that failed to hold my interest was instead a game that draws together the elements that it claims to work with and polishes them to a mirror-like sheen. Nearly everything about the game is tight and it just feels great to play. No falling to your death because your foot nudged the platform corner; no weird Mario-like momentum; no throwing your character into a wall of spikes for no reason; no trying to control a crosshair on screen while also jumping from platform to platform. Everything simply works.\n\nLet not these complaints deter you, however. The positive aspects of this game far outweigh the negatives. The difficulty scaling is essentially perfect, for example: there is enough of a slow canter towards challenge that people unfamiliar with gaming can ease themselves into it but this is not so long as to bore those who are familiar with platforming. The deaths are frequent but fair. I did not feel as though the deaths were undeserved (with one exception) and they were infrequent enough to avoid being annoying. The exception to this is that early on in the game, you rapidly learn that water is actually made of a kind of magma, and stepping into it causes an instant death. There’s no reason that the game can’t just damage you and allow you to jump out, but this is ultimately a minor gripe.\n\nThe game has a sense of progression about it that places it somewhere between a Mario game and a Castlevania game in terms of RPG elements. There are enough McGuffins to collect for completionists to come back and take a second look – one of them unlocks a secret level – and the weapons all have growth and upgrades for those who get a kick out of those sorts of minor rewards. Indeed, just looking at how many weapons there were impressed me when I first opened a shop dialogue. To add to this, there are special blocks that require you to use a specific weapon to interact with them. It was truly a mercy to find out that these weapons were actually useful in their own right. Nothing kills my enthusiasm for a weapon system than a clumsily handled switch because you are forced to use something that sucks.\n\nThe levels are laid out in such a way that you will see secrets before you have the means to obtain them. This is pretty standard, but for an indie developer it is a sign that some extra thought has gone into the design of the game; something that too many indie titles are lacking. In addition, there are extra game modes for once you have finished the main game which is a nice reason to pick the game back up again.\n\nOverall, I think the game will offer you a solid 10-15 hours of gameplay for a very reasonable price. I certainly enjoyed the experience more than I was expecting.","February 25","true","6.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/418120/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Today, for my 200th review, I'm going to be looking at Super Metroid! For over 20 years, this game has been considered one of the all-time best, but in my opinion it... oh... wait... really?! Actually, for my 200th review, I'm going to be looking at Cally's Caves 3. Huh. This is supposed to be a momentous occasion, so I should be critiquing an important & highly-regarded game. I guess it wasn't meant to be.\n\nOh well.\n\nSeriously though, Cally's Caves 3 is actually pretty decent. I haven't played either of the previous games, but I guess that isn't really important. Cally's parents have been kidnapped by a Mad Scientist. In her quest to rescue Mommy & Daddy, she jumps and shoots through dozens of levels, while putting together an arsenal to rival World War 3. There's a simplistic charm to this game that's hard to ignore. It reminds me of the kinds of videogames kids would imagine. Cally has a shotgun so now she's shooting wolves, skeletons, and bandits. Is that a giant hornet? She better blow it away with her rocket launcher. Cally triple-jumps and has a pet bear that knows kung-fu. It's aspects like these that make the tone light-hearted and amusing.\n\nAt first, the game is rather slow. The enemies are placed in locations where you can easily get away, or shoot from an advantageous position. This is mainly to counter-balance the fact that enemies take a bit of punishment before they go down. This becomes a common theme of the game. You can make the process of killing baddies more efficient with different guns, and using the sword to stun them for a brief moment. What you'll be doing more than anything else though is grinding. This is bound to put off more than a couple players, and speaking for myself, constant upgrades can be just as much a detriment as a boon for many games.\n\nThat said, I think Cally's Caves 3 works well with this system. It's similar to the weapons in the Ratchet and Clank series. While they're not as creative, the guns acquired throughout Cally's adventure, recieve substantial upgrades. Aside from shooting more powerful bullets, these guns can adopt new properties, such as a heat-seeking add-on for the rocket launcher, or a piercing effect for the blade gun. It also helps that there's a constant rate of positive reinforcement throughout the game. You're always finding new weapons, acquiring strength boosts, leveling up, or purchasing something useful. I also like that whenever a gun undergoes a major upgrade, the screen showcases the newly-kitted out weapon along with a flurry of explosions.\n\nThis is one of those games that also makes New Game+ interesting. The enemies recieve a substantial health-boost, and their numbers are bolstered due to an influx of fresh-faces. Aside from having a massive arsenal, you've likely also purchased a number of coin multipliers, so you should be able to afford the weapon mods. These mods are elemental, and can as much as double or triple the player's DPS when used with the right weapon against an enemy weak to its effects.\n\nYou probably won't notice due to the steady stream of weapon upgrades and other amusing aspects, but Cally's Caves 3 is a really easy game. There might be a couple stumbling blocks early on in the form of certain boss-fights, but after enough upgrades you'll enter a "How could you ever die?" state. On one hand, I appreciate this, because there are more than enough hardcore, rogue-like, one-hit-equals-death, spike-laden platformers. On the other hand, becoming so overpowered in this game makes it feel menial. When you play Survival mode in this game, you're not worried about your life, you're more worried about having the patience to sit through it for so long. At least the cash rewards are pretty nice, and they're good for farming achievements.\n\nWhile this isn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping to write about for my 200th review, I have to admit that Cally's Caves 3 is well-done. It lacks the challenge found in other contemporary platformers, but it's still thoroughly compelling. It reminds me of something that would have been popular back in the shareware days. A simplistic yet charming shootemup with a nice soundtrack and a lot of content.\n\nIt's worth looking into, I think.","March 22","true","14.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevulpinehero1/recommended/418120/","thevulpinehero1","TheVulpineHero1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevulpinehero1/","161 products in account","To describe Cally's Caves 3 succinctly, I would say "2D Ratchet and Clank"; it's an action platformer with a large array of guns which level up as you use them, hideous amounts of money pickups and multipliers for them, and the requisite extremely expensive weapons mods on which to spend them.\n\nFor what it is, it's a competent little game that's quite moreish thanks in no small part to the weapon upgrade system. Anybody with completionist urges will end up wanting to level the arsenal to the max, and the guns are fairly diverse (although there are issues with the selection; more on that later.) The graphics are quite crisp and appealing.\n\nOn the soundtrack, I feel more or less neutral. While the songs that are on there are pretty decent, and suit the game well, there are no specific 'stage' tracks; for much of the game, the library minus the boss fight songs will just be looping in the background, no matter where you happen to be. Because of that, it feels like there wasn't too much conscious design behind it all from the game's devs. On the plus side, though, this means you can easily turn the music to zero and then play your favourite album or listen to a stream in the background. And again, what's there is pretty decent.\n\nThe weapon arsenal both benefits and suffers from the Ratchet and Clank syndrome the game has going on. At first it feels like all weapons are viable but some weapons are more viable than others depending on the situation. You might dps with your pistol, and use your shotgun to chip away at enemies you can't quite reach without putting yourself in danger, for example. By the end, however, you have the R.Y.N.O element coming into play -- i.e. there is a single gun in your arsenal that will outclass any other given gun in almost any situation, and the only reason to not use it is because you're trying to level up a worse gun. This is actually worse in Cally's Caves than in Ratchet and Clank games, however, because the developers have helpfully furnished you with infinite ammo -- meaning if you don't want to change weapon to use something worse, you never have to. Let's just say that you'll probably be using the Laser a lot, and leave it at that. That said, some of the guns are genuinely quite novel, particularly the spike gun, which has a lot of outside the box applications for the creative.\n\nOne annoyance is that most of the guns fire faster if you spam the button than if you hold it. I don't really get why this is the case (it isn't hard to mash buttons, although it can become a little tiring and unnecessary); I'd love there to be some kind of endgame upgrade that pulls the auto fire all guns come with up to a reasonable human button speed, if only to save the wear and tear on my controller.\n\nI also feel like the expected difficulty of the game is off. I'm not great at action platformers; I play sloppily, I tank damage for convinience, I jump in the lava to skip obnoxious moving block puzzles, the whole shebang. I've 100%ed this game, with the exception of two achievements: one for dying 100 times, and another for dying 250 times. How many times have I actually died, in the course of the game and new game plus and survival mode and the bonus Melvin Zone and Beara's quest segments? 12, and all of those came quite early in the first run. You get so much more powerful than the game can effectively handle, and it just sort've runs out of tricks halfway through new game+. It doesn't feel like a stereotypically 'kid' difficulty game (especially not considering your protagonist has a vast arsenal of firearms, and it ends with  you personally stabbing your best friend's evil dad hard enough to knock him off a cliff and into a pit of lava . Some of the tricks used to hide collectibles are stuff that usually you'd see more often in the Mario romhacking community, like leaving the ceiling open and expecting the player to walk outside the edges of the screen, and enemies in the lategame get pretty bullet spongey. I think you just scale too hard for the game to effectively kill you, regardless of how sloppily you play.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty enjoyable, in a kind of mindless, rompy way. If it goes on sale, you're unlikely to regret reaching for your wallet. Recommended.","May 27","true","16.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/418120/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","It’s somewhat shocking that the first two Cally’s Caves games never made it onto Steam – they’re only available from the iTunes Appstore and were made for mobile play only. Consequently many PC gamers may never have heard of this outstanding franchise by ZDO Games. To bring you up to speed the Cally’s Caves franchise has always represented outstanding platform gameplay with heavy does of elements from adventure and RPG games. It was with much delight when it was announced that they were going to be making the third game available on PC.\n\nThe Cally’s Caves games have always utilized intelligent retro style platformer graphics. The characters – both Cally and the other NPCs both enemies and otherwise – are all very well designed. Although the music is energizing and suits the game it becomes a bit too repetitive. The game could have been improved by having a larger soundtrack.\n\nThe game play is traditional platform style action but features a weapon upgrade similar similar to that found in the Ratchet and Clank games. As you use your weapon you will find that it gradually upgrades itself. At each upgrade level the weapon will increase damage and add effects that make the game easier to play without ever really breaking the game to the point where it feels like cheating. The biggest negative to the actual gameplay is that the enemies are damage on touch. This can be very frustrating early in the game to non-advanced players when they reach the first boss level and accidentally land on the tip of his tail which can very quickly cost the player their life and force a start over. IT makes the game to be a rhythm game at times. The most significant advantage to the gameplay in my opinion is that although there is no tutorial the game design teaches you the mechanics as you traverse through the first levels of the game. This is outstanding game and level design and is a highlight throughout the entire history of the franchise.\n\nAnother highlight for me is that the game has a metric truck load of weapons and upgrades. Finally, and definitely worth mentioning is the amount of content – good content – that makes up the game. In complete honesty not many studios release games in this genre with nearly as much content as what VDO Games put into Cally’s Caves 3. When you think you’ve completed the game it feels as though you’ve really just started. At $6.99 it represents an absolute bargain.\n\nIf you’re interested in metroidvania type platform RPGs then you absolutely should buy Cally’s Caves 3. We can only hope that VDO Games is able to port the first two games onto Steam so that we can have all three parts of the trilogy – to date – on Steam. Although Cally’s Caves 3 certainly improves upon what the first two games accomplished Steam players definitely deserve to have access to all three games on the PC platform.\n\nGo out and buy this one.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 13","true","7.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/418120/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Cally's Caves 3 is a sequel to free Cally's Caves platformers from mobiles made by yet unknown indie studio VDO Games. You play in a role of a young girl Cally, whose parents get abducted by an evil scientist and you, as other girl would do too for sure, take a gun and shoot through hordes of enemies to save your parents.\n\nIt's a platformer with focus on shooting and weapon variety. You'll be able to pick from many weapons, may it be pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, RPG launchers or laser rifles. Every weapon acts a bit differently and every weapon can be leveled up. The game strongly focuses on the fact that using your weapon will make it stronger by the time. As far as the crazy nonsense story goes, you'll also see Pokémon-like evolutions of your weapons. Congrats, your shotgun has evolved into Terminator! (But don't get your hopes high, it's just a better shotgun.)\n\nGraphic style seems to be similar to Cally's Caves 2 with slight improvements, the sounds feels more annoying after some time. What's worth praising, is the game length, as the developer really tried to make a lot of levels to make it worth the 6,99 € price tag. You'll wander through those in metroidvania style, as levels are connected through the tunnels and you can return to any checkpoint anytime.\n\nConclusion:Cally's Caves 3 is not a bad platformer with a lot of content, but on its own it still didn't get rid of the freeware game feel. It may be not appealing to platformer newbies with a little raw and unpolished menu design. It can be an entertaining experience for some time but I don't think it's worth recommending with so many other great platformers in the store. This just keeps being an average game and weapon variety + upgrades (damage boosts) are not enough.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 26","false","5.2"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ingeniousclown/recommended/418120/","ingeniousclown","ingeniousclown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ingeniousclown/","340 products in account","Cally's Caves 3 is a port of a mobile game to PC, but don't let that scare you away.  It's ported relatively well.  It's an action-platformer with some powerups that can be earned throughout the game to give it a sort of metroidvania-like feel.  It's not a metroidvania though, since it lacks the interconnected open world of a metroidvania.  Everything is upgradeable in this game through level ups.  Every gun, your health, your sword.  There's a constant feeling of progress throughout the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lw4bHb4NT8\n\nIt's a pretty solid game.  The amount of weapons and worlds means there is a lot of content in this game.  Add in an alternate adventure or two, new game+, and a survival mode, and you've got a pretty solid investment if you enjoy the gameplay.\n\nFor me, the gameplay wasn't enough.  It felt grindy because of the nature of leveling up and constantly working toward evolving your guns.  I felt more focused on getting the next evolution than I was on completing the level, and that kinda ruined my experience.  However, the gameplay is responsive and works well, just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean it is bad.  If the gameplay and constantly leveling up for favorite guns looks compelling to you, you'll probably really love this game.\n\nI have some more technical gripes.  The soundtrack sometimes feels out of place and feels like it lacks something.  The sound design leaves a LOT to be desired.  The jumping sound annoys me.  The frame rate is capped to 30, which is more obvious in a fast, high-contrast sprite game like this than it would be in some other games.  The movement through menu elements with the D-pad is capped to a certain rate, such that your input when trying to move around the menu WILL be swallowed.  None of these things by themselves are too bad, but all of them turned me off of this game.  The enemy AI is incredibly basic.\n\nIn spite of all that, it's not a bad game, hence my recommendation, but only if all of this sounds fine to you.\n\nKey was provided by VDO Games and Dietrich Online Services.","January 5","true","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The weapons get stronger the more you use them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/recommended/418120/","ogrep","Vino [Olive Garden]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/","985 products in account","A fundamentally broken game. I bought this game because the gameplay video made it look skill-based and action-packed with lots of bullets, dodging, parrying, etc. Unfortunately, the maps and damage sponginess of the enemies completely ruin that design.\n\nMost enemies will stay on their vertical level without moving up or down. Almost every time, you'll be able to approach them, completely risk-free, from a higher or lower level and simply spam them down with your weapon of choice. The sword cause enemies to go into a full second and a half hitstun, so once you hit an enemy once, you just have to keep swinging the sword until they die. Either way you choose to unfairly dispatch the baddies, make sure to pack a lunch; it'll be a while.\n\nEnemies have so much HP that these tactics don't feel "pro" or even "cheap" - it's just tedious. Spam from a distance or stunlock up close; either way you'll be sitting there with no risk for 5-10 seconds per enemy. And there are a lot of enemies, and a lot of stages.\n\nI get that the enemies have so much HP so that when you get bigger, better weapons cutting through them like butter will feel great; but you're asking a lot out of your players, who have much better games sitting on their shelf they could have fun with immediately, without having to grind up weapons.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, the levelling is completely uninteresting. Weapons get more damage as you use them (very incrementally more) and occasionally 'evolve'. This sounds cool, and could be if the evolutions were meaningful or changed how you used the weapon. Alas, they're almost always "fire extra bullet", "bigger bullet", or "more damage". What's the point? Why not just balance the weapons around each other so that you choose weapons based off the level, the enemy, or your personal preference? When you really get down to it, who cares whether your shotgun does 1.00 damage per pellet or 1.05 damage? These are actual numbers from the game, I'm not even exaggerating for effect.\n\nAs for the other RPG mechanic, the money/shops, that's broken too. From the beginning one of the first things you can buy is a drop that lets you get more money; obviously this is the optimal thing to purchase, since you can see that later upgrades cost hundreds of thousands of gold, and enemies drop between 10-100 apiece. Unfortunately, maxing out the gold-dropping multiplier takes hundreds of thousands just by itself, which means that your first few hours of this game will be doing nothing but making it so that later you'll have enough gold. What's the point of cool upgrades if they're all so expensive I can't buy them without spending hours either farming gold for them, or farming gold for the gold-multiplier upgrade?\n\nThe writing, plot, characters, etc are all mediocre but that's to be expected, so no points off there.\n\nAll in all, a game that missed its potential by bad design. A lot of the pieces of a good game are here. Pretty decent art, sound, the controls are tight and feel right. Some of the fights I had, when the level didn't allow for cheesy tactics, were pretty challenging and fun. Just needed better playtesters.","March 19","false","1.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

It doesn't do much to stand out from the other flood of similar indie titles that invade Steam on an hourly basis, and even though the Ratchet and Clank weapon system is fun it gets old rather quick with the otherwise basic gameplay, and becomes pretty boring. Things are far too abrupt: getting hit is abrupt, dying is abrupt, menus are abrupt, the gameplay is just... abrupt. It's not the good kind of screen-shaking-rock-fisted abruptness either, but the kind that jars you out of whatever small experience you were having. Overall, if you want a small platformer then buy this game; the price is worth the content and it's well made with no game breaking glitches that I ran into (although why is the Slime boss called Slime IV in game but the achievement is Slime III?). I think my biggest problem is that it feels like a game made for a final project of a college course, and not one to bring anything new to the platforming scene.","March 21","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But man, everything about it is so incredibly lazy and amateur and just bad, bad, bad. There's minor things which are stupid, if forgiveable, like the fact that weapon damage is placed out to two decimal points for literally no reason (why make a pistol do 1.20 damage? Wouldn't 12 make more sense and be more aesthetically pleasing?), or the way the music sometimes just stops because they were too lazy to make it loop properly, but there's also the fact that combat is ♥♥♥♥ easy and boring, and the levels are boring, and everything is completely stiff and terrible to control. Also they managed to make widescreen mode reduce both horizontal AND vertical viewspace, meaning it's got worse widescreen support than most games in the 90s. terrible game, terrible game.","January 18","false","0.1"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","0"

Missed required gun, press the button 12 times again. You're not only forced to constantly cycle through weapons but also GRIND. You don't only grind for coins, but also grind the damn mobs for achievements that get fatter and fatter with every level. You just found next power upgrade it looked a bit easier on same level, but on the next mobs simply get fatter and now you have to spend same amount of time. Weapon leveled up? Same story. And you don't get power ups every level, so mobs just get fatter. I've sent the developers to hell and from mid game started using speed hack. A bit better but nothing to drool about.\n\nAnd it's EASY, playing at twice the regular speed i didn't have a lot of problems with platforming and mobs/bosses killing me. Even on "New game plus". Some mobs just look a bit different and have slightly different attack, but they are very same mobs from beggining just fatter. Bosses are not challening at all, i've killed 3 bosses just standing still, shooting and deflecting attacks. The rest required some movement but still nothing challenging.\n\nThis could've been positive if there was less grind, mobs were not that fat and it was possible to map weapons on different buttons. In the current state i can't recommend the game even for achievement hunters, especially if you're not fond of using hacks.","February 17","false","19.1"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

I don't like it.\n\nI was hoping for a return to old Duke Nukem 2D days with this title. Something simple and approachable.\n\nThis is a mess.\n\nThe controls are weirdly off-sync. I was playing with a controller, and it felt like it was arbitrary when I used my double-jump as opposed to a regular jump. I could play this off throughout the first level, avoiding the water traps and the tempting currency to be had if a well-timed double-jump was done. The firearms were a nice touch, leveling upon use, giving an incentive to power them up instead of stun-locking everything with a melee shot.\n\nThen I ran into the boss.\n\nWith double-jump as finicky as it was, I found myself having to repeat the boss over and over. Even if the jumps had been dead-on (and they most certainly were not), I found myself running into the exaggerated hit-box and taking damage from the creature's outstretched tail.\n\nAfter several tries, I finally prevailed. It felt more like my patience was being tested as opposed to the fist-pump that I'm sure the devs were hoping to elicit from the player. After a little bit of dialogue, I was brought to the shop...\n\nOnly inside the little screen, I tried to grab a much-needed heart from a branch overhanging the door I came in from, the one that had the boss room behind.\n\nI landed on the door.\n\nThe boss was revived, and I was put back at the start of the fight, still injured, and expected to do the fight all over.\n\nNope.

I know it says only 5, minutes, but that's because I was beat the game while in places without internet, so forget about that.\n\nCC3 is an empowering jump and shoot game~ If you like doing those two things, this is well worth a run! The fundamental controls mentioned work very well throughout the entire game. The pixel art is colorful and the animation is nice and bouncy. The use of sfx is quite characteristics of the era I believe the game was trying to emulate as well. The soundtrack is alway randomly changing, which keeps the feeling of the game a focus of interest. In a technical sense, jumping-and-shooting is buy-in-large what the game is about, and it might sound as if this would get boring over the course of the many worlds in the game, but the game spaces out the new weapons just right so that by the time you've gotten tired of shooting your old gun, you've got a new toy to enjoy all over again! If anything this just goes to show that the "less-is-more" school of thought on game design can work very well!\n\nI do wish to bring up points of the design that I didn't seem to resonate with. Do keep in mind though, I'm in no way asking you to make any changes, but I do believe that it is important to bring up these kinds of things in a review. Since this is the third game, I will leave suggestions, as I am excited to see what you'll do next.\n\n1) The inventory is not very streamline, and accessing it necessarily slows down the gameplay. Since there are only six items, I would suggest simply putting them all in the initial pause menu, so as to make them instantly accessible.\n\n2) The boss battle design is at odds with what I am conditioned to do when fighting normal enemies. Blitz seems to be the best way to fight enemies. However, trying to do this against bosses has gotten me countless defeats. The bosses are instead designed on a predictable, almost turn based, experience that involves them attacking while it is not safe for you to strike back, but are in a fairly good position to parry, and then waiting for that long winded attack to be over such that you can move in and blast with all you have for a brief moment that the enemy is vulnerable. In theory this difference is interesting, but I just wanted to point out, that all of my encounters with normal enemies has trained me to fight a completely different way, and boss battles betray the logic that I have been conditioned to use in combat.\n\n3) The fundamentals are the best option. The game will grant you a bunch of abilities, like charge shots, and rolling, and changing your weapons, but none of them seem to be viable options in the middle of combat. I found myself a more adequate player when I did nothing but focus on jumping and shooting with the occasional sword slash, rather than try to manage and think about all my options.\n\nMy suggestion has to do with both of the 2 mentioned above. I think my main issue with the combat is that I have no control over the enemies. Or rather: I have little to no idea what the enemies are going to do, and when they are going to do that, and this fundamentally makes reaction based play a bad option. Let me give you an example of the opposite, as it appeared twice in the game. There is a point in the game where you have "control" over the Balding Eagle, by being able to determine where he will crash into the ground. There is also a similar "control" that you have over the queen bee. This, to me is exciting, as it make it to where there is a well telegraphed amount of information that I can use for formulate a fun strategy against the enemy. In contrast, I often found the behavior of the Knife Bandit, Smokey, and the Bazooka Hulks to be unpredictable. Sometimes they would pace back-and-forth, sometimes they would turn toward me, and they would attack without warning, sometimes doing so while still moving forward. My suggestion here, would be two things. I think that reaction and strategy can be encouraged if the enemies are designed with attacks that are more telegraphed, a kind of visual cue to let the player know that an attack is coming.\n\nI do have one additional moment of confusion about the enemies. The bazooka hulks shoot green rockets at you and you cannot parry them. When I fought Melvin, and saw him shooting green rockets at me, I must have died 20 times before I figured out that these are different rockets than the Hulks' and instead that this boss battle required the opposite logic of actually parrying the rocket--- This is the kind of thing that I mean when I say that the I am "conditioned" to play in ways that don't work during boss battles.\n\nRolling is not intuitive. (side note, there is a glitch where you can perform a "wave dash" by hitting roll and then mashing the direction forward, this will let you zoom right past all of the enemies and clear the game in a more pacifist manner) but aside from the wave dash, I could not at any point use the actual roll as a dodge, and a lot of this has to do with the above mentioned lack of encouragement for reaction/strategy based play. But it also has to do with how the controls for the roll demand a few too many steps: 1) keep cally perfectly still on the ground, 2) think of the direction you want to roll, 3) make cally face that direction, but remember that you have to keep her still because she cannot roll when running, 4) mentally figure out which button you have to press to roll, because there is one for each direction 5) press that button to roll.\n\nIndeed, I would oft find myself being chased down by skeletons where I only want to roll back to get behind them, but never have enough time to actually input it, usually instead getting me both run down and hit by a projectile.\n\nMy suggestion is this: simplify roll to be a single button, and have it to where you are allowed to roll both forward, and also backwards, while maintaining the direction you are pressing. The controls for this would work like this:\n1) if you have a neutral standing position, then you will roll backwards.\n2) If you are running, you will roll in the direction you are running.\n\nThe result is that it should make rolling a much more reliable option in the middle of combat, and if back-roll maintains the direction you are facing, it could make for some very cool scenarios where in being chased by an enemy, you can just boost behind them while giving them a scattershot to the back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is one additional thing I have to mention that confused me. The story, as presented in the game, leaves a bit too much to the imagination for someone who isn't familiar with the CC franchise. I'm talking about the little things, as in, I don't understand what  Herbert's motive is for kidnapping Cally's Parents, or the significance of some of the bosses, that seem to be something that Cally is familiar with, but I am not. I am told that there is some additional explanation for the story by Robin and Melvin if you go out of your way to do things more than the main game. But clearing the game vinella on my first run, left a lot of questions in the air for me.\n\nBut, being the student of art that I am, I had to try to come up with something to make sense of it all. So here is the theory I came up with.\n\n*Spoilers ahead*\n*Spoilers ahead*\n*Spoilers ahead*\n*Spoilers ahead*\n\nHerbert is interesting in that he seems to have a soft spot for Cally in addition to Rupert.\n\nThe Rupert soft-spot is takes the form of that in the final level, through the level design, it is shown that there are two assets repeating the cave, a self-portrait bust statue of Herbert, and a family photograph. What this says to me is that there are 2 things that Herbert is willing to admit that have meaning to him, himself and Rupert.\n\nAs for his fondness for Cally. The first thing is that he talks at Cally as if she doesn't mean anything to her, or that she is a swor","June 5","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
