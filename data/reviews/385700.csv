If it had more Briggs screaming lines like "Unf****** believable!" (it's actually censored like that in game) whenever you killed an enemy, it'd be in so-bad-it's-good territory.\n\nInstead, gameplay is both mind numbingly monotonous and difficult, and it's impossible to discern what is what with the terrible blurred lighting. Enemies' projectiles will seek you out and are nearly impossible to dodge without cover. You'll die a lot, but thankfully there is no death penalty.\n\nOn the bright side - you'll bust a gut at some of the voice acting and facial animations.\n\nI'll try to push through to the end, but I doubt I'll make it.","July 22, 2015","false","1.6"," 108 of 133 people (81%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","81","108","133","17","0"

From my experience at least.\n\nThat's where it ends I'm afraid. I will sum it up in as few words as possible.\n\nThe game is clunky as hell, there doesn't actually seem to be any form of plot.

Your character ,"Dylan" I guess is his name, decides to enlist to save his friends and family and humanity from the alien threat\n\nThey spend about 5 minutes jerking off about how great General Briggs is and you start out in a military base camp, now I heard some people say this game is hard, but I guess they didn't get all the dumb alien orb things because you can max out your armor instantly by getting those and the game is super easy after that. The first mission is a rail gun mission which is a horrible way to start your game out, pretty much impossible to make those segments excited in even great games. While your doing this General Briggs is your hype man is yelling a bunch of things that are bleeped out for some reason, I don't know if this is some artistic directly or something but its pretty unecessary, especially since all the swearing feels out of place anyway. The gunplay isn't the worst I've played I'll say that, but it's pretty bad still, guns don't really feel like anything all the enemies have homing attacks that are pretty hard to dodge.  All the enviroments are pretty uninspired and generic. Everything feels "small" I guess like it's a lego toyset instead of a Desert or real urban enviroment\n\nThat's pretty much it for the first mission, it's bad, there's a tutorial level after it but its also bad\n\nThere's one mission where this pregnant lady or something asks me to blowup some teleported but it's a bad "stealth" mission\n\nPros I guess are that if you like me love games like this or Manhunter and find them hilarious to play this is a good canidate\n\nThe last one is probably that General Briggs is awesome and amazing and worthy of being followed, he will save us all","December 27, 2015","false","1.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","17","21","6","0"

Seriously, just look them up online. Sadly that's all there's to it as once you're done laughing at how terrible everything is you're still left with an hour long game to play through, if you're so inclined.\n\nGunplay is bad, shotgun trumps everything basically as it can headshot and one shot kill aliens from miles away: on the other hand aliens are extremely weak so the devs decided to give them homing shots that follow the player and can also curve through corners if you dont sidestep fast enough. But don't be worried, if you die you'll restart at the last checkpoint and everything you've killed stays dead so there's basically no challenge whatsoever or penalties for dying. Moving on sounds are bad, voice actors seem to have worked using a potato for a recorder, the skill system does absolutely nothing and the lack of explanation for your objectives makes every mission an uninteresting chore...why am I gathering boxes in a cave? why am I destroying that purple sphere? no one knows.\n\nEven though it can be good for a chuckle if you happen to own it there's no real reason for you to buy this game as there's nothing fun to be found here: even if you can stomach most of the Cons I've listed the game is simply boring and dull.","April 8","false","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

In Battle for the Sun you foster an unrequited love affair with your mentor General Briggs, as you fend off the assault from space gremlins and other Unity assets. With a complex skill tree to follow and levels that are 12 Kilometers in scale, there's so much replay potential. Hopefully the developers release the one (1) multiplayer map they promised. They should probably also release a multiplayer client to play that map on as well. I won't ruin the plot, but the credits indicate that five seperate people contributed to its creation. All in all, amazing work of interactive fiction. "Did you hear about South Dury?" Yes, yes I did General Briggs.

Right down the middle lane of mediocrity. There is some charm in it, as almost everything is some sort of parody of other shooters.\n\nAs far the gameplay goes, it's pretty bland. The GUI seems like it came from the 90s of PC gaming, and the gameplay itself is like a HL1 mod with no real sense of direction.\n\nBut why do I like it just enough? Like I said, there's a bit a charm in the amateurish voice acting. If the devs spent $10 on a pop filter, it would've improved by 100%. The gameplay also has a sort of retro charm, like back when I was a kid and I would literally play any FPS that came my way.\n\nIf you're into that kind of thing, get it. If you want to go crazy on your YT channel and make a fun video, get it. If anything, wait for it to come on sale to grab it.\n\nI give it a solid 6/10.
