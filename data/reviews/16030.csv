I enjoyed this game. I would probably play it again. I will definitely play the two sequels. It's a simple block matching game with a few unique features. You can rotate the board 90 degrees at a time as often as you want in either direction to control how the blocks fall. There are some decent boosters that can clear out an entire row or column. Once you clear the the board, a special block appears and an exit slot appears. You need to clear blocks around the special block to move it toward the exit. It can be a little more challenging than it sounds. As the levels progress, the configuration of the boards make you work around obstacles. It's a fun game. Total play time to completion was around 9 hours.","December 21, 2013","true","9.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's before the games began breaking things up and adding extra challenge in the form of resource management/bonuses for "better time" or the city-building aspects, or variable difficulty, or the assistance of recharging powerups, but with the bonus irritation of "hey, you know how you usually need to drop the key stone off the board? Now make it navigate a maze on some of the strangest-shaped boards in the series."\n\nThe problem with that is that while you might think it's an interesting variant on match-3 gameplay (the board rotates to assist in this), the time limit is INSANELY generous. I don't know if I ever went down further than a third of the meter, and that was while I was passing out and zonking out for a few seconds at a time every so many moves. It's ludicrously liberal on time. So the game is in no way challenging, just sort of annoying. I can see reasons to play earlier 7W games, and the later ones redefine things in their own way, but god, this one's a relic.","April 26, 2015","false","12.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The whole game comes across as a chore, as you attempt to reconstruct famous historical sites. It is a simple match-3 affair, which involves creating a match of every tile on the board. Then, once all tiles have been used, a 7 drops down and must be painfully navigated from one end of the board to another. The 7 will have to traverse narrow channels by way of you matching blocks to remove them from the 7's way, and although this seems to be the "hook" of the game, it is annoying. As you're making matches in vain to hopefully get the blocks you need, you'll soon wish you were playing a game more entertaining.\n\nPass on this one. There are better time wasters out there.","January 24, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Good presentation, graphics and not too annoying music and sound effects.\n\nA nice touch, compared to other match-3 games, is the fact that you can turn the board, which also is necessary when, after you have cleard all the tiles, you need to guide a special block down a path from A to B and through portals.\n\nGreat game for what it is.","September 1, 2012","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've never run out of time, actually i've never passed even halfway before on the timer but it can get quite tricky and fustrating at times ;)\nDefinitely recommened a purchase and play if its going cheap!","July 12, 2012","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have to say though..it's pretty easy and not very challanging for me at all. The basic concept is matching gems and breaking blocks then when the blocks are cleared you have to move a master block into its slot by matching the gems and rotating the screen. With that being said I completed the game fully and just really wrote this review so I could knock it off my list of games I have played through.","June 23, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
