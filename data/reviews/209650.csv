I am going to split this review into two parts, single player and multi player and talk about the pros and cons. Here we go:\n\nThe Single-player campaign - Length: 6-7 hours - Difficulty: Average ( I played about 8 hours of it )\n\nSo we get another typical cod campaign, the story is great, altho not at the same level as Black Ops 2 was, your choices do not impact the ending, in fact the campaign is preety much all linear. Graphics are the best the franchise has ever seen, and so are the audio effects, also gameplay has been refined to be extremely fast paced and enjoyable. Kevin Spacey's performance is incredible, at some points the engine is struggling to keep up with his performance, making you wish Sledgehammer would have used live action cutscenes instead of CGI. The campaign is overall a great experience, if not a bit too short, they could have expanded on it and made it longer, it has some plot holes and rushed moments.\n\nPros:\n+ Cool story\n+ Fast paced gameplay\n+ Great graphics and audio design\n+ Kevin Spacey, Troy Baker give incredible performances\n\nCons:\n- No decisions to take\n- Completely linear\n- Very short, you can finish it in a day or two\n- Lots of plot holes\n\nOverall SP score: 7.5/10\nThe Multi-player: ( I played about 15-20 hours of MP )\n\nThe core multiplayer experience is great, the freshest cod we got in years, the amount of guns is lower than in previous cods but they compensate by adding a lot of customization to your character and weapons, game uses the Pick 13 system from BO2 but improved, you get 13 points that you can use to create the kit that suites your playstyle most, even the killstreaks are customizable. The exosuit completely changes the gameplay, making it extremely fast paced and way more enjoyable than the past cods. At this point, you might ask, what's there to hate about it....and here comes the bad part. They done ♥♥♥♥ed it up again.... Devs promised dedicated servers prior to launch, went completely silent about it after launch, they also keep ignoring all the problems most of the playerbase is having, continuing to push updates that balance a few guns and fix a few prestige issues...really? At this point they seem to have completely forgotten about everyone who bought it, playerbase is dying by the day, already at 5k ppl online/day from the 30k+ on day one and they just don't care about it.\n\nPros:\n+ Exo-suit completely changes the way multiplayer works\n+ Great graphics and audio design\n+ Preety cool future inspired weapons\n+ Lots of customization\n\nCons:\n- Terrible post-launch support from Sledgehammer Games\n- No dedicated servers ( game uses p2p connection resulting in horrible host advantage that ruins the game )\n- Connection issues on a lot of maps, most people can't ever join certain maps cause of sync issues\n- Extremely fast progression, I got to level 50 in less than 10 hours ( not that much of a con, still...)\n- Cutting off features to sell them as DLC later on ( also splitting the community )\n\nOverall MP score: 6.5/10\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10\nGame was run on:\n\nCPU: AMD Phenom II x4 955 3.6Ghz\nGPU: GTX 760 2GB\nRAM: 8GB DDR3 1600Mhz\nSSD: Kingston v3 128GB\n\nSettings: 1920x1080 res, all settings maxed out, FXAA\n\nFPS for SP:\nMinimum: 60\nAverage: 75\nMaximum: 100+\n\nFPS for MP:\nMinimum: 45\nAverage: 65\nMaximum: 91 (capped at 91 -.-")\n\nGame has FOV slider and a lot of options making it run very well regardless of system.\n\nAs you can see it runs way better than Ghosts did, that alone being a huge improvement.\n\nLowest price atm: 24 euros/30 dollars/20 GBP\n\nTL;DR: Game is better than Ghosts but lack of dedicated servers and connection fixes mainly cause of no support from Sledgehammer Games results in a terrible multiplayer experience. Campaign is cool but very short. I'd avoid it until they keep their promises and fix the god damn game.

Advanced warfare introduced some new moves that changed the gameplay a little. However, since the first two weeks its been going downhill.\n\nThe developers had a "smart" plan. Lets make matchmaking skill-based, meaning that you would play with people on your rank, and not just everybody like it used to be. What happend then? You can't find any games.\n\n"No games found" is the only message I get when I try to search for an online lobby. It doesn't matter when I play, which gamemode I pick (not even team deathmatch) , it doesn't find any players.\n\nCall of duty ghost was crap because it was bad optimized, this is bad because you can't find players. It shouldn't be that hard to fix, but the developers have clearly abandoned this game.\n\nThe funny part is that they still keep updating the game with map-packs, skins and everything else in the ridiculously expensive season pass, but they don't give a sh*t about the fact that players can't use it and play online at all.\n\nMaybe they should fix it before adding new stuff and trying to rip-off consumers even more. But no, it's CoD after all..\n\n(EDIT: you can't review the multiplayer so I started the singleplayer up just to be able to post this review, I have 28 hours clocked on the multiplayer)","July 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 452 of 528 people (86%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","86","452","528","37","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/svgsweetjesus/recommended/209650/","svgsweetjesus","|SVG|SweetJesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/svgsweetjesus/","141 products in account","(TL;DR can be found at the end of the review)\n\nCall of the annual Duty - Underdeveloped Lagfare\nI've been a huge fan of the Call of Duty franchise when Modern Warfare hit the stores. For years I've been playing pretty much nothing else and dumped hundreds, if not thousands of hours into it. I also played Modern Warfare 2 & 3 but it wasn't the same for obvious reasons. Since then I wanted to buy another CoD that could bring back the nostalgia. Then Advanced Warfare comes along and actually gets a lot of good reviews and I get curios: Another studio, a longer delevopement time and fast dropping prices.\n\nI bought this game for 20 euros and pity the fool who preordered it for 60 euros and thought that he would get a good game. I lowered my expectations as far as possible and still I got disappointed. I really can't see why so many people like this game and where all the good reviews come from. Okay, better than Call of Duty: Ghosts. But being better than something really bad doesn't make it good. You can polish a piece of ♥♥♥♥ as much as you want, you can gold-plate it and wrap it in present paper but it still stays a piece of ♥♥♥♥. On to the actual review:\n\nSingleplayer:\n\nI enjoyed the campaign far more than I would have thought. The story is alright, yet very predictible, the characters ain't great (except Kevin Spacey for the sake of being Kevin Spacey) and the AI is still far away from being "intelligent". But all the new gagdets they could introduce with the futuristic setting make up for it easily. On top of that they added a ton of vehicles stages. It's the kind of singleplayer you would expect from a CoD game.\nYou won't miss anything if you don't play the campaign as it is very forgettable but it's a fun non-brainer if you want to pass 6-7 hours. Sadly it has absolutely no replay value. Less cutscenes, quicktimes events, press f to do action x, following or waiting for npc's to do one specific action and a certain minimum of freedom could have done the trick there.\n\n\nBut let's be honest. We all want the game for the multiplayer ;) And this is where ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nyou need to connect to the Advanced Warfare services first and appearently it only works when it wants to\nNo dedicated servers. No dedicated servers. NO DEDICATED SERVERS. NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DEDICATED SERVERS!\n(┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻\nP2P connection system: One player hosts the server which pretty much always results into huge lags for the other players. On top of that the host gets a big advantage and the gameplay suffers a lot under it. It always feels like you have to shoot 2,5 magazines into the enemy while you get killed instantly. If you watch the killcam you often realize that most of your shots didn't reach the enemy or never were fired. Heck, the game even introduced a competitive ranked mode. Why would I want to play that with all the connectivity issues?\nPing is displayed as bars, it's like your car's speedometer says very slow, slow, fast and very fast\nno server list, you have to join a matchmaking queue for a specific game mode\nalarming low amount of players, decreasing pretty fast. The game is a month old and could die quite soon unless the die-hard fans stay\nif nobody plays the the gamemode you want to play you are stuck in the lobby, which will be pretty much always the case unless you play TDM or Domination\nno servers = no server costumization: Most gamemodes are way too short. Before you really get into match and feel what certain enemies play like the match is already over. An average TDM is about 5 minutes just to be stuck in the lobby again for at least 1 minute.\nmatchmaking tends to make really unfair teams (upper half from last game against lower half)\nquite a lot of cheaters around, no servers, no VAC-bans\nthe guns all feel boring and soulless, many of them seem to be pretty unbelanced, also there is only a little amount of weapons\neveryone is jumping and spraying with assault rifles or shotguns, SMGs and heavy weaponary are pretty much not viable, snipers and grenades are quite useless unless you play a objective-based game mode because of the insanely high mobility\nthe jumping makes the gameplay way too hectic and needs either some ressource or a cooldown that limits it (as soon you touch the ground you can doublejump and dash easily followed by a groundslide, which every player does as soon he gets hit and can't react by killing the shooter leaving you with two options: Either fall back to reload or chase him and get picked by his teammates or himself.)\nlow amount of maps which aren't very fun. Playing TDM for about 30-40 minutes can give you a full rotation\nthe community is still awful, feels mostly like playing with a bunch of degenerates who think a good KDA is as much as an achievement as curing cancer, AIDS and Ebola while having a bad KDA or using certain equipment makes you the anti-christ himself. Turning off voice chat is obligatory. Turning off chat is sadly not an option.\nWe are in the year 2015 and in my eyes it is shame that such a game could reach the market. Did anyone test the pc version? I think not or they got paid quite a lot for a positive review. It seems to be normal today that the marketing recieves x times more money than the development department.  Publishers need to stop ruining the game experience ultimately for profit and let the studios make fun and technically enjoyable games. Either cancel the CoD series for PC or publish the game for consoles first and one year later release a proper pc port... It's like the game keeps screaming "PLAY ME ON CONSOLE!" or is whispering "Please... Please, kill me".\nTLDR: Singleplayer is alright, but you won't miss anything. Multiplayer feels like a very bad fusion  of the generic CoD gameplay and Quake, Unreal Tournament, Crisis or Titanfall with massive lags making it an unenjoyable gaming experience. I wouldn't pay more than 10 euros for this game, maybe 15 with a season pass.\n\nSome big patches could get the game into the right direction but I highly doubt it as they probably focus on getting the DLCs out.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nUpdate #1 (15/01/12): So here they are. The costumization DLCs. For at least 2€ each you get nothing but a few cosmetic items that add nothing to the gameplay. I wanna play a shooter and don't dress up a doll or paint my weapon. Way to go...\n\nUpdate #2 (04/02/15): Nearly 3 months have passed since release and now a 1,6 gb patch comes around, adressing a few things I mentioned: Several weapons get buffed, while the ones that are really broken stay overpowered, matchmaking and connectivity were improved a bit, a security and anti-cheat programme is added and several maps got improved for different game modes. I'll have a look into it but I don't think this patch will turn me around. Also it is overdue and should have been released a long time ago.\n\nUpdate #3 (24/02/15): Connectivity really has improved but is still far beyond every other shooter using dedicated servers. The lag is horrible. I also met quite a lot of aimbotters on the double xp weekend. Only way to get rid of them is leaving the game and hoping not the be matched again with them. You can report them ingame but I am not sure if this results in a ban for them. I think there is a fun game hidden in this mess but as for now the devs don't seem to be interested in reveiling it and I can't recommend it.\n\nI won't do any further updates on this review unless something drastical comes along. So much potential thrown away and abandonded it just hurts...\n\nMoral of the story? Don't buy any CoD titles for PC!","November 25, 2014","false","14.7"," 1,149 of 1,468 people (78%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","78","149","1","102","41"

This is the breath of fresh air we all so desperately need after the unsatisfying Call of Duty: Ghosts. Playing through Advanced Warfare's campaign was a blast! The singe player is absolutely worth while. The multiplayer, however, is where things go a bit downhill.\n\nFor starters, (as I'm sure many, if not all have heard) there are currently no dedicated servers. I feel like whenever I join a game, it's a gamble on whether or not I'll be playing a nice game of CoD or just sit in frustration as players run in place and teleport around.\n\nSecond, the good weapons are actually given to you in the early ranks. Weapons like the AK12 prove to be great for new players who aren't used to Call of Duty games and are still in the early ranks, because the weapons are overpowered. That deminishes some of the satisfaction and incentive for actually reaching higher ranks.\n\nThird, the Zombies feature is going to be a priced DLC. Personally, I think it should have been a part of the base game like the black ops games or even world at war.\n\nI do plan on playing this game more, because I can look through the problems that it has. However, I do hope that some (if not all) issues will be resolved in future patches. Hopefully I'll be able to recommend this game 100%.","November 5, 2014","false","7.6"," 1,055 of 1,435 people (74%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","74","055","1","23","33"

The game's population has dwindled to the point where the game will struggle to find you a TDM or Dom lobby, and you can completely forget about playing any other game mode. If you leave a match because it contains a blatant aimbotter (which is the case maybe 1/3 of the time) and requeue, you'll be dumped straight back into the same lobby you just left. The weapon balance is terrible, and the devs went out of their way to buff the guns that were already the most overpowered, meaning 80% of the people you will encounter use one of two guns.\n\nThis isn't worth your time or money at £45. It's not even worth your time or money if you can get it for half or less of that price.

Nothing about it is redeeming, not even Kevin Spacey.  There are lines of dialog that don't make sense (to name one, the two "best friends" have a conversation in the first cutscene that only non-friends would have), there are actions that simply don't make sense (One hilarious example: The female chick has a fight with a guy who doesn't have an EXO suit. Even though she punches a dent into a car's hood, she can't overpower the guy), and the set pieces are too... restrictive.\n\nIt seems like whenever a COD game wants to introduce something it can only do it for 5 minutes. Assassin's Creed does this and it is getting really, really annoying when something that is generally fun is only used for 5 minutes.\n\nNow, why do modern shooters feel the need to tell me to "Follow" a character? For 90% of the game, I was able to run ahead of characters, only hitting an invisible wall, while they yapped about stuff that was unimportant.\n\nAnd the last thing I wanna ♥♥♥♥♥ about is this EXO suit. Do not compare it to the suit from Crysis or the jump pack from Titanfall because it certainly is not. Just like other COD games, the EXO suit feels like a knock off idea that never goes anywhere. I never used the suit's powers once during the story mode unless it told me. Unlike Titanfall or Crysis, the suit used really does feel tacted on at the last minute.\n\nMP:\n\nLet's talk about this EXO suit a little more because the faults become a lot more glaring in multiplayer. Pro tip for the devs: Don't say "parkour" then add ledges to a map which you CANNOT grab. Every single map in this game was designed WITHOUT the EXO suit in mind. I can't tell you how many times my EXO suit jump couldn't reach a ledge or tried to grab a ledge that was just decoration.\n\nThe maps are too small. Titanfall had larger levels with the same amount of people, 6 on 6. THe chances of getting shot in the back were lower to almost non-existent due to the distance between respawn locations. This just isn't the case with this COD. I think 70% of my deaths were respawn, wait 2 seconds, get shot in the back.\n\nNothing about the weapons or EXO suit 'abilities' are unique. Again, let's look at Titanfall! There are three abilities: Cloak, Sprint, and Wallhack. Cloak isn't too great on players, but makes you invisible to Titans; Sprint lets you run faster for a bit and regen faster; and wallhack lets you... wallhack for a bit. There are nearly triple abilities in COD:AW, yet none of them are special while some are outright useless. Do you want extra health that doesn't help, or what about an ability that makes you hover slowly for an enemy to kill you? No, of course not.\n\nThere are a lot of weapons and, just like the previous CODs, a lot of them could have been cut from the game. Some are better than others right out of the box, which makes me wonder why bother putting them in.\n\nOh, and I hope you like Team Deathmatch, because that's all people play and there are 0 unique modes which are worth it.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThis is a $20 game. If the asking price is higher, don't bother. If you want a real parkour game with innovation to the COD formula, go get Titanfall.\n\nedit: grammar error that was bothering me.","November 22, 2014","false","6.3"," 960 of 1,344 people (71%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","71","960","1","23","39"

[Source][i.imgur.com]\n\nThe lag is horrendous. I attached several videos showing this below. Sometimes you'll boost upwards and apear to fall, only to magically be warped onto a ledge. Often you'll get hit markers on your screen but on the enemy's killcam they didn't register. Sometimes they won't register when you're blatantly shooting an enemy right in front of you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheckForAPulse_/recommended/209650/","CheckForAPulse_","CheckForAPulse_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheckForAPulse_/","236 products in account","Just to point out. The half an hour is only so i could post the review, though I've played through the single player on PS4 and it wasnt bad, its the first that i've bothered to finish since cod4, but I feel that I have more than enough hours logged in multi between the two consoles to post the review.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and tried so hard not to hate on it after ghosts. I felt that sledgehammer would bring something new to the table and feel they tried as hard as they could to rrevive the series after the failure of ghosts. Personally, I believe that a lot of the really rubbish implementations/design flaws (like the tuning of the lag compensation and fact there is no numeric ping values) would have been imposed on the developers by Activision rather than the developers themselves making such poor decisions.\n\nI honestly tried so hard not to be negative about this game and had an open mind in regards to this title since its their first title in the new 3-year cycle, but after uninstalling around 4-5 days after release due to how rubbish it was, recently reinstalling after the couple of patches and still experiencing most of the same issues and the horrendous lag, this is beyond a joke for a AAA title which nets the kind of profits this series does.\n\nMy MAIN issues with this game and why I personally wouldn't recommend it to anybody are as follows;\nFirstly, the lag compensation is still brutally punishing (similar to he past few titles which it's so brutal you seem to be punished for having a decent wired connection) and this turns any firefight into nothing more than a coin toss for who gets hit registration rather than being based on skill/weapon/positioning. It feels more like the lag compensation is tuned for and catered to consoles connected via wifi with 150-200ms pings rather than a wired connection (on both the playstation and PC versions).\n\nToughness is STILL a must have perk in this game, even though the developers said it wouldnt be. It's absurd at the difference it makes to the flinch when you are hit with/without it. The hand holding needs to be toned right down or just removed, the game would be much more enjoyable if idiotic perks like this weren't in-game at all.\n\nThere is no numerical ping values, which make it nearly impossible to tell whether the weak link is your own personal connection or whether it's just a messed up host. While having the ping bars back is a step up from ghosts (which had them removed in a blatant and extremely foolish attempt to hide the fact it lagged ridiculously bad) the ping bars are still incredibly inaccurate at best and don't indicate any real kind of connection quality whatsoever.\n\nSome lobbies which I've only had 2-3 bars for the whole round generally feel like they have much more consistent hit detection than most of the lobbies which I've had solid 4-bar connections (some of which I've experienced rubber-banding and having people teleport all over the place).\n\nI can NOT understand why any developer would remove or attempt to change a simple, highly functional and (fairly) essential tool in online gaming, especially one which has been pretty much standard for ~20 years. Ping bars are absolute rubbish and dont really indicate anything, especially when there's no mention of what the intervals are set, at so for all we know it could be 100-150ms per bar. I would bet on this being a decision handed down straight from Activision themselves, but it's a rubbish one.\n\nIn addition to my last point, I refuse to believe there are dedicated servers (at least in my country/area anyway) due to the consistently poor connection quality, even a terrible dedicated server wouldn't perform as badly as most of the lobbies i've been connected stuck in. Until there's actual verifiable evidence of their existance outside of the US I refuse to believe they were implemented.\n\nA lot of the weapon classes don't really feel like they have a purpose in-game. They don't feel like they have their own strengths and weaknesses which make them far more effective than the others in the right situations in this game (I've felt this has been a  trend since post mw2 and the MLG scene began to influence heavily). The SMGs outclass pretty much everything in most CoD games post MW2, especially when you factor in the mobility and reload times rather than just damage outputs alone, if it weren't true people wouldn't gravitate to them like they do in every release.\n\nIn addition to my last point, the hipfire spread is far too tight and makes hipfire FAR too viable at range. Hipfire should really only be effective as a last resort and getting lucky hits or at close range.\n\nThe engine still feels extremely dated and regardless of how much they change it and try to dress it up, it was still originally made back in the days of dial up. Perhaps its time to actually re-invest some of those enormous profits into making a new purpose built engine and focusing on gameplay before graphics/gimmicks, or porting to a different engine (like the unreal engine?) which is more current. No matter how hard they try to hide it, the engine is dated and it definitely shows. New graphics and sound components on a dated engine that doesn't play well to begin with doesn't make for an enjoyable experience AT ALL.\n\nPeople still shoot out of their eyeballs, headglitching still exists and no the maps are cluttered with crap to make this a highly effective cheap tactic. The delay between the player camera and their model moving is also still present. They're all flaws with no potential to be rectified while they continue to use this same hacked up iD Tech engine and no amount of rebranding will change this.\n\nAlso while on this note, in the past ~6 years, the engine should have become more refined and less buggy rather than more noticably broken, no?\n\nWhile the exo suit is a good idea in theory, the double jump feels a bit excessive and removes the ability to play tactically. It also changes the flow of the maps, and not for the better IMO. Every time I play, I'm endlessly being shot in the back by people jumping over any obstacle in the maps with ease. It also seems common practice for people to just start mashing the jump button as soon as they see another player, double jumping while spraying and praying, all while the host tosses a coin to decide whos hit detection works until someone finally gets a kill.\n\nThe double jump is also so high theres very few things you cant get onto or over in a single leap, also there's no cooldown (even though there is with other exo abilities e.g exo dash). This whole mechanic could have been implemented FAR better if jumping high objects (buildings etc) took a couple of well placed jumps and a little bit of platforming, or a cooldown on the use of the ability, perhaps both.\n\nThe climbing animation is pretty messed up and generally leads to deaths. When you jump at about waist height it plays a few frames of you falling to the ground and then you're instantly running on top. It's a bit offputting and is really clunky.\nHonestly the CoD series is picking up momentum while it snowballs out of control on a downhill spiral, mostly due to a lot of foolish, counter-productive and player unfriendly design ideas/implementations most likely imposed on the developers by the publisher. It's not even 2 months post-release and it's already been on steam on sale for -50% off, this clearly shows the sales are lacking and they are in serious damage control.\n\nI refuse to believe any developer would/could be happy with the final product in regards to the last few iterations of this series and until the community are genuinely listened to the primary focus is on gameplay rather than graphics/sound/marketing gimmicks this series doesn't deserve money from anyone.","January 3, 2015","false","0.5"," 647 of 920 people (70%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","70","647","920","82","32"

Pretty much everything I have to say about it is very positive, except for the matchmaking which at the moment at least seems like it's peer to peer so is quite unstable with a lot of spiking [I will update if it changes]. Also, Kevin Spacey.\n\nHere are two first impression videos and a quick 2:30 "summary" video, followed by a written review below.\n\nFirst impressions of Single Player: http://youtu.be/dFPYGCwlq44\n\nAnd for Multiplayer:  http://youtu.be/IKKmpHPkeN4\n\nQuick 2 min video: http://youtu.be/0Lso6Zg_l8s\n\nAs a CoD fan, I’ve been a little concerned with some of the previous titles, boycotting Ghosts completely because of the generally terrible quality of the PC port. But to be honest, I found Advanced Warfare to be a pleasant surprise once I got into it.\n\nSo first, multiplayer: The game takes Black Ops 2’s create a class system, but adds Score Streaks into it (so 13 points instead of the 10 from Black Ops 2). Since you can take out Streaks, it’s possible to nab a few extra points for your normal equipment, or if you find yourself with extra points, you could even take a Wildcard and get a 4th Streak. And speaking of Streaks, you can now modify them in a really interesting way. Take UAV for example; normally you need a score of 400 to call it in. What you can do however is modify it so that it costs extra points, but will get a cool secondary effect (for example, for 100 points it lasts longer, 200 it jams the enemy mini-map, 200 shows the direction an enemy is facing, 300 moves into orbit and cannot be shot down, or 300 to make it so any score you get towards it isn’t wiped when you die). All Streaks have these types of upgrades and it’s an amazing addition.\n\nAlso on the topic of multiplayer, the movement feels fast and very, very smooth. Guns handle well, and it really does feel like the maps have been properly designed around everyone being able to double jump and dash, not just they built the maps and then tacked those things on at the end. Finally, those loot bags that drop sometimes in MP are really cool – they let you customise the look of your character, as well as potentially dropping weapons that have unusual stats (For example, -1 damage, +1 fire rate is one I’ve gotten).\n\nI’ve given the new Survival mode, Exo Survival, a few runs (as a solo) and it is pretty fun. It isn’t quite zombies since you are just on the 1 map – there’s no unlocking/moving between rooms or anything, but the objectives aren’t just simply to survive. There are however objectives, for example hold a specific area on the map for a wave, collect items or defuse bombs that give you bonuses. Honestly, I’m not sure whether I like this or zombies more, since there are fairly different.\nI’m about 4 missions (1.5-2 hours) into the campaign at the time of writing this, and thus far, I’m enjoying it.\n\nThere are a ton of gadgets, and unlike some previous games where you may get to use a cool gadget once in a 30 second segment and then forget about it forever, I find the game using them multiple times which is great. To be honest, with all the cool technology available, it really makes it feel like the whole “squad takes out an army” deal CoD has going seem like it could actually be plausible. Also, the game does a little less hand holding – if only a little. You can run ahead and won’t have to wait for teammates, they’ll catch up (it’s only happened to me a few times, but a good example is in the single player video, somewhere in the first 8 mins).\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty good, particularly for a multi-platform release, and the game isn’t incredibly taxing on your system. There are a ton, and I mean a ton of options. Honestly, Sledgehammer deserves to be commended for those video options. (As a side note, if you are struggling to run, you can turn down Screen Space Ambient Occlusion to anything but HBAO+ and Anti-aliasing: Supersampling to a lower number to get an easy performance boost. (This may not be the most efficient way but it certainly worked a lot for me when I was testing out performance).\n\nSo multiplayer has an fps cap, which caps the game out at 91 fps (at least it’s not 60, or god forbid, 30…). Single player on the other hand has no cap, so you can push your computer to the limits if you want to.\n\nThe single major negative I have thus far about the game is how the games are hosted. I had thought they were going with dedicated servers, which they apparently don’t because almost everyone game I’m in people are spiking like crazy for the duration of it. To be honest, with dedicated servers this would be at least the second best CoD in my opinion, perhaps even challenging CoD4 for the title in the future. [NOTE: I will update this part if at some stage the games become more stable, it’s entirely possible that it’s just instability caused by the launch].\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant surprise to be honest. Based on past titles (cough Ghosts cough), I was a little unsure about what would come of this, but aside from those hosting problems, the game is absolutely incredible.\n\nAlso, Kevin Spacey!","November 3, 2014","true","9.2"," 918 of 1,388 people (66%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","66","918","1","18","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krytykal/recommended/209650/","Krytykal","Guilty Complex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krytykal/","409 products in account","Before I start I just want to let people know that this is a review. That is a personal opinion that I have made based on my personal experience with this game. Under no circumstance should this accurately reflect another person's experience let alone your own. I strongly suggest you look at other reviews, gameplay, or to literally play the game yourself before you make a decision about buying this game or any other game for that matter.\n\nAdvanced Warfare tends to be a game that sounds and looks interesting but feels anything but when you really sit down and play it.\n\nStarting with just how the game runs is frustrating. I've managed to get this game running consistent or at least consistent enough to be deemed playable but don't be surprised if you experience massive stuttering, hitching, or just down right low FPS. A lot of this is attributed to the fact that for some reason or another Sledgehammer decided to not cache their shaders and shadow maps by default. My recommendation is to select optimal video and turn on every caching option available. It solved most of my problems.\n\nThe single player campaign features an impressive cast of well skilled actors but all that is lost in the bad writing. I know its silly to nit pick in a game like Call of Duty but if you're going to higher skilled actors such as Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey the least you could do is have them in an as competent story that has some gaping plot holes, contradicting dialog, clichéd themes, and just down right stupid silliness.\n\nOn the multiplayer end get ready for bad netcode as by default the game will search for matched using 800 ping as a basis for "good" match quality. There is a work around for this but even after implementing it the lag compensation is just horrendous. I mean you weren't expecting dedicated servers were you?\n\nAs far as the game itself you will have that honeymoon period of "Oh Wow" just at the fact the exo movement system makes the game feel better at least in terms of movement over the pass Call of Dutys. Soon though you will realize that this essential breaks the whole three lane map system that Call of Duty is known for, and as such you will have people constantly in your ♥♥♥. What I find weird about this is that the maps are clearly based around the three lane formula but its really pointless as you can just go almost anywhere at a moment's notice all while not really taking advantage of the new movement system. This can clearly be seen as there are many spots in most if not all the maps that seem like a very reasonable location to get to but are literally blocked off by invisible walls.\n\nAs weapons are concerned everything feels as if it was nerfed to the ground. I always have loved the shotguns in this series for better or worst but they are just terrible in this game and are ridiculously inconsistent and are by far the worst ones this series has ever seen. The rest of the weapons all feel nerfed to an extent too with the exception for the Assault Rifles, nearly all of them are good no matter the situation. I get the fact that the role of assault rifles are to be decent in most situations but when all the other weapons that specialize in specific purpose feel worthless what's the point to not use the one kind of weapon that doesn't.\n\nScorestreaks feel absolutely pointless in this game, I can't believe I'm saying this but they just feel pointless. I always felt that since Call of Duty 4 that the streaks contribute to the games flow and control just as much as the maps. In this game they barely even do that as they either do not last long enough, don't do enough damage, or just easily negated. You can upgrade the streaks to make them a bit better in the areas that they lack but they increase the cost of doing so to the extent where it could take you 7 kills just to get a UAV.\n\nI feel a lot of people will enjoy this game and as such just take what I said with a grain of salt. Personally I just don't really like the way the game feels, I appreciate what Sledgehammer has done but unless they fix what I feel are blatant issues I really don't see myself playing this game much more.\n\ntl;dr\n\n-Poor optimization and lousy video settings\n-Well acted yet poorly written story\n-No dedicated servers and Terrible netcode\n-Fun yet disrupting movement system\n-Wonky weapon balance\n-Weak if not just pointless scorestreaks\n\nBuy it, you actually might like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TonyRCameron/recommended/209650/","TonyRCameron","TonyRCameron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TonyRCameron/","70 products in account","This review is aimed toward the multiplayer portion.\n\nFinal Opinion:\nThis is by far the worst multiplayer game I have ever paid for. Hands down without a doubt. The gameplay requires absolutely no skill and is just full of people spamming the exo movement while hip firing smgs and shotguns. If a player stands out of the gun fights they still cannot shoot people from a distance because of how fast and inconsistent exo movement is. If there there was a possibility for a refund, I would jump on it asap.\n\nEdit: Gameplay working for the most part now, but due to constant jump spamming and my constant ragequitting, I cannot bring myself to play the multiplayer anymore. The online gameplay is mindless run and gun with no tactics. A huge disappointment.\n\nAnd please don't just take my word for it, I would highly recommend doing more research for players still on the fence about this game. Especially to those buying this game for the multiplayer, because others find the combat prefferable and many people still do enjoy this game.\n\nI was really excited to play this game. It looked like the game that would turn the franchise around. And who knows, maybe later on it will.\n\nIn my opinion,\n\nPositives:\n-Different setting\n-New type of gameplay\n-Interesting Customization\n\nNegatives:\n-Constant lag/stuttering\nWas able to mitigate stuttering by enabling the preload shader option. However this seems to cause certain maps like Defender and Instinct to never load.\n-Cannot get open NAT even when enabling upnp and forwarding ports\n-No cooldown on Exo movement\n-Too much chaos\n-Small/Confined Maps\nCombine the constant lag/stuttering with fast paced movement and its just 1 huge nightmare. I really hope these problems are addressed because the multiplayer is not playable the way I am experiencing it.\nConsistently seeing lobbies where the majority of players have a red bar connection.\n\nEdit:\nJust saw my first aimbotter already and there doesnt seem to be a report function.\n-In the main menu you can view recent players and report from there.\nAs for possible lag fix, in the config file default ping is 800. Set it to something more realistic like 200 for example.\n-I am having much better results lowering it to 150.\n-seta cl_maxPing "150"\nAnother problem I am running into that seems to be seperate from connection lag is stuttering. The game itself stutters beyond belief. Not just in the menus, but in game with a solid 3/4 bar connection the game will freeze momentarily. This happens quite frequently.\n\nFinal edit:\nOf the 4 hours or so spent in multiplayer I have only been able to enjoy maybe 15-30 minutes of actual gameplay. I have tried to make this review as informative as possible and spent way too long trying to get this game to work properly. I am seeing more people are downvoting this review. For those of you who dont agree please add something to help into the comment section.\n\nSpent another couple hours trying to get this to work (I really want to play this game). And for ther first time had a solid non laggy, non stuttery team deathmatch round.\n\nTo achieve this, the changes I believe that made the biggest impact were changing\n(Try at your own risk, make a backup of your config_mp.cfg file and make sure not to delete the game folder on the original drive it was installed on!)\n****************************\n1.\nseta cl_maxPing "800"\nto\nseta cl_maxPing "150"\nIn the config_mp.cfg in the call of duty advanced warfare players2 folder.\n\n2.\nFor the stuttering, I had to move the game over from my high capacity hard disk to a solid state drive.\nTo do this quickly without reinstalling:\n\nAlso stated by another member in the comments - Make a steam library on an SSD and copy/paste the CoDAW folder to it. Uninstall from original location using steam (MAKE A BACKUP FIRST) and install CoDAW while selecting the steam library location on SSD. Steam should validate the folder on SSD and add to steam library.\n* NOTE * Please make sure you also have enough disk space on the SSD, about 50gb for another installation after copy/pasting or steam will say you dont have enough disk space when you try to install/validate the CoDAW folder. This means a total of about 100gb on an SSD. I tried this method but did not have enough disk space available so had to go back to the junction point method.\n\nThe method i had done:\na.I went to where I have CoDAW installed on the HDD. Copy the game folder. For most people this is probably in the steam folder (steam\steamapps\common\call of duty advanced warfare)\n\nb.Next I pasted it to the SSD. This can be anywhere, just make sure you have the space.\n\nc. Move CoDAW from its original location on the HDD to somewhere different on the drive for safe keeping.\n\nd. Lastly, with an elevated command prompt (right click run as admin on cmd.exe) navigate to the original location on the HDD where CoDAW was and make a junction point to the new SSD location.\nex. "cd C:\program files\steam\steamapps\common"\n"mklink /j "Call of Duty Advanced Warfare" "S:\call of duty advanced warfare" where S is the drive letter for the solid state.\n\nThe "juction point" allows Cod to appear in its original install location while actually being stored and ran from the SSD.\n\nA possible work around for using an SSD is to defrag the Hard Disk after installing CoD. The game just seems really demanding on storage performance right now.\n\nI really hope this helps some people. These fixes helped me play the game. If anyone wants to try these fixes but has difficulty understanding these instructions feel free to post a comment on this review and I will respond.\n\nEdited once more:\nMy final viewpoint on the actual multiplayer gameplay is negative. Compared to older games in the franchise CoD3,4MW, 5WaW, MW2, BlackOps etc there used to be more of a demand for tactics to win. Tactical positioning meant something, there was dedicated servers up until MW2, the game I feel required more skill and teamwork to be successful. In Advanced Warfare the movement is just too fast. Flanking used to be a skill worth having. Now people just charge in CqB style shooting like mad and jumping around. No one can deny this. Just look at gameplay footage. Always get shot in the back because its so easy to flank. Or repeatedly miss a target point blank because theyre moving like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix. I really wanted to like this game, spent about 10 hours trying to get it to work. Even if the problems are polished out in the future, the gameplay is a real turn off for me. It's just too chaotic. I thought I was done with CoD years ago but got pulled in by the hype once again.  The quality just isnt there anymore.","November 6, 2014","false","6.2"," 333 of 500 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","333","500","0","18"

Here are my thoughts based on the fully working version of the product.\n\nIts boring. The campaign does nothing to differentiate itself from past campaigns, the exosuit is all but useless outside of scripted moments. I got as far as the bridge level before I had to stop playing out of sheer lack of interest in the gameplay and story. There were one or two alright levels (the one in detroit was the only standout), the rest was tedious, bland and even more scripted/linear than past games.\n\nMutliplayer fares slightly better but there is extremely little substance to the gameplay, the same as with the last several post-black ops CoD titles. The exo-suit double jump brought some joy initially but once you get used to this there is absolutely nothing else to  hold your interest. There is no depth, just running /jet packing around shooting at stuff. It took me about 7 hours to become totally bored of the multiplayer.\n\nTo Sledgehammer's credit the map design is somewhat better than MW3's, but maps are too small to take into account the increased mobility granted by the exo-suits. They have also increased the visual/audio fidelity to a point where the game doesn't look too dated.\n\nI might play this a bit more with friends but overall I would not recommend it, the formula is very stale at this point and Exo-suits dont do enough to revive it.\n\n6/10","November 9, 2014","false","4.8"," 233 of 345 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","233","345","0","11"

I figured I would give this one a try, so here is my quick little review.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare is nothing new, nothing special, and won't blow your mind. Though, I guess this is what we have come to expect from a Call of Duty game. It's the same formula that has been used since the 4th installment, so if that's what you like, then this may be the game for you.\n\n[STORY]\nI'd like to talk a little about the campaign, then I'll get into multiplayer. The single player lasts about 5 to 6 hours. 30 minutes of this consists of loading. The game forces you to watch the whole cutscene, while only loading the game halfway, then loading the rest after. If you decide to change your graphics settings in game, you have to rewatch the cutscene and wait for it to load again. Once you find your optimal settings, this isn't much of an issue, but still irrtating.\n(Edit: There is an option in settings that allows the game to fully load during cutscenes, but apparently makes them choppy)\n\nThe story itself is bland and predictable, there aren't any memorable characters, and it feels like the game is just trying to rush you through the story so you can hurry up and get to the multiplayer. There isn't any switching between players in this one. You play as the same guy throughout the whole story. The aspect of early Call of Duty games where the story follows multiple characters is one I miss tremendously.\n\nOnce again the missions are very short, play out as turkey shoots, and anti-climactic. Don't expect any massive battles or epic sequences in this installment. Just save your money and watch a let's-play on YouTube.\n\nBut we know you aren't in it just for the single-player..\n\n[MULTIPLAYER]\nSame stuff, different maps and weapons. Oh, and boost jumping.\n\nIf you love running in circles, getting shot in the back, and smashing the "F" key repeatedly, then get this game. As I mentioned before, it's the same game. Go grab Titanfall for $10 and play the mode without mechs.\n\nThe new feature for Advanced Warfare is the Exo-suit abilities. Some are kind of neat, some are gimmicky. It does give a bit more variety to how you'd like to play, but I typically find them quite useless. There are also tons of player customization option. Does anyone actually look at that stuff in game?\n\nGuns.. The guns are awful. The sounds of the guns are awful. All the weapons seem impractical and weak. The shotguns are neat, but that's about it. Oh, and again with the sounds. They just don't sound like there is any power to them. I feel like I'm shooting a little bb gun.\n\nThe maps are your typical Call of Duty maps, but some change slightly. Though it might as well just be another map, because the change is pointless. One of the maps is a volcano, and it makes it seem like you need to hurry and get through the blast doors or it's game over. But you just die and spawn on the other half of the map anyway. It's another gimmick. That's what Call of Duty is good at. Gimmicks.\n\nI can't recommend Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, at least not for the price they are asking. There are plenty of other games to play, so please save your money. If I missed anything, or if you have questions, please feel free to ask me.","November 4, 2014","false","6.5"," 883 of 1,380 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","883","1","0","36"

Exo movements were passable for it being a first iteration. But it has been a downhill slope since this game ever hit Steam.\n\nThe EM1 saga left an incurable bruise on this game's PC reputation, taking 5 months to be addressed. By then, the damage had been done. With assistance from absolutely abysmal optimisation, every map stutters, and three maps in particular are lobby killers in that they cause half the lobby to fail to load in. With each patch the problems have not gone away, and instead maps that I used to be able to reach 90 fps on now stutter horribly and are seemingly capped at 50 fps.\n\nFOV resets have been present since launch, and with a recent patch in April, the glitch has been WORSENED. That is unacceptable for a 'AAA' development team. Wallbreaches still exist in great number, and the recon drone glitch still hasn't been fixed either. Instead of opting to devote time to fix these glitches, we are instead given more premium ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to chow down on, to play Barbie's Amazing Dress-up Adventure instead of Call of Duty.\n\nWith 365 hours in the game, those will be all I will put into this tragic story of a game. Never before has a developer made me feel genuine contempt against them for their utter ineptitude and ignorance. At this point in the year, most playlists are totally unpopulated, leaving Domination the only remotely interesting game mode that has a few breaths left in it. It has been conquered by toxic clans which set up meat grinder lobbies where they hold the flags indefinitely, and those that dare try to queue for Domination are thrown into the lobby, with no sane choice but to quit.\n\nIgnoring any technical failures, and there are PLENTY, the game fails from a balance viewpoint. The EM1 went unfixed for five months, becoming such a malignant cancer that some people still don't know it's been rebalanced and have their same kneejerk reaction as always. The idea of giving out game-changing weapon variants on a random system, IN A COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER SHOOTER, was defective from inception and should have been aborted immediately in the boardroom.\n\nScorestreaks are a total joke. Even adjusting the System Hack by 100 points, and further adjusting its time modules by 50 points each, they are still so easy to earn that a co-ordinated party can loop them indefinitely. And due to a major oversight, the default system hack denies streaks, despite the 400 point anti-streak module touting that it denies streaks from being called in as one of its selling points. As such, the aforementioned meat grinder lobbies are impossible to retaliate against, as it is impossible to call in any streak you may earn. The Warbird AI modules are only 50 points, yet amplify its effectiveness by such a large margin that it should cost over 500 points for what it gives you.\n\nInversely, the Missile Strike is so ineffective that the only times they are used are when they appear in care packages. The Goliath is a mockery of past games' Juggernaut suits for being offensively weak and defensively akin to soggy paper.\n\nThis game exemplifies how NOT to create a multiplayer shooter. Players become titans only if they own the best guns. Scorestreaks either too strong and almost impossible to destroy, or too weak and offer the enemy team free points. The appalling player count, lagging behind BO2, MW3, and even WaW at times, is telling of this game's subliminal ♥♥♥♥ you to PC players.","May 26, 2015","false","8.6"," 57 of 70 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","57","70","15","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazysam47/recommended/209650/","crazysam47","Scootaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazysam47/","143 products in account","Ok. I'll start off with a short analysis, and then procede in to the main reasons why I don't recomend this game. CoD is like milk to Activision (No pun intened about how they're milking the franchise). They put it out to the community, and it's fine for a while. But just like milk, it eventually goes off and then the Devs don't want to touch it anymore, so they just start work on getting some new milk while the older ones continue to sit there ignored.\n\nAdvanced Warfare looked like it might be good because it was Sledgehammer Games, some new blood that the franchise desperertly needed. Infinity Ward has gone down the crapper after a bunch of employees left to make Respawn and Robotoki, and Treyarch still suffer some difficulty even if they currently being portratyed as the "heroes of CoD" (We'll see how long that lsts about 3 months in to BO3).\n\nBut anyway, on to the game itself;\nSingle Player was OK, but honestly seemed to rely more on the fact that Kevin Spacey was there than much else. At its core its your generic shoot 'em up gameplay as you blast though a level until you reach the finish line. The "twist" in the story is more or less forced on you, and the game really showcases its lack of grey as it turns your old allies in to Nazis over like, 1 day. And apparently you don't now seem to care you're now killing people you worked with for several months/years. The stealth is pretty much your standard "follow the leader", so there's very little of that. Graphics wise, it's not all that great, you can tell they've ported this straight from the consoles. In fact in one instance I tried to lower the graphics settings because I was getting some FPS lag, it caused a bluescreen and upon rebooting my PC, it had to validate the files were still working. Furthermore, the cutscenes have a tendency to freeze, and since they interlace the cutscenes with loading screens you can't skip them, so it's like watching a broken VCR.\n\nOverall, the story is lack lustre, but doesn't leave you on as big of a cliff hanger as Ghosts did (but still leaves you with a very clear open ending showing this story is going to be continued). Like most of the CoD campigns, it feels like the effort wasn't directed here and it has no feel of replayability. If you're a sort of person that gets games for their story, then this isn't a strong reason to get this game.\n\nAnyway, on to the co-op mode now. Co-op originally started as Exo-Survival, which was pretty much just MW3 survival, but with a few small differences. Despite this, it still felt quite fun. Esspecilly the classes and unique scorestreaks you could use. But it sort of lost some lustre as it was of course, still just survival from MW3. And thin it got worse. Then they added "Exo-Zombies". At first, I was hoping they'd do their own spin on it, and have their own version of it for a different spin of this mode. I was wrong. Exo-Zombies literally only exists to feed off all the people that like Zombies in Treyarch games by making it exactly the same as Zombies, but with the added useage of Exo-suits. Overall, nothing original here. Only worth playing if your MW3 or WaW/BO/BO2 isn't working. Or if you feel like playing surivial/zombies but on one of SHG's maps.\n\nAnd finally, the main seller of any CoD game; the multiplayer. Now this can be a very hard and subjective thing to judge. I mean some people just look at a negative review and just go "You only think it's bad because you are bad". Well in this case, I can say that's not completly the case. I do get a few good games in, and I'm currently pulling a positive K/D to anyone that gives a rats ♥♥♥♥ about K/D. But anyway, to the actual review. Well first we should start with the most obvious issue; Dedicated Servers. We were promised dedicated servers, and they never came. Just another show of how the companies put the consoles before the PC. And don't get me wrong, I don't really buy in to this whole "PC master race" malarcky, but if you're going to make a game for PC, then make it 'for' the PC, don't just port the intended console version over. And then there's the weapon balance, and frankly SHG shot themselves in the foot with the weapon balance, however they must have done it with the Atlas 45 since they didn't even notice they'd ♥♥♥♥ed it up. The main issue with the weapon balance is all the supply variants. And some of those are given such pathetic buff to nerf ratios that even nerfing the base gun does nothing. Per example, the Obsidian Steel gains a 3 shot kill out to a fairly long range, while only gaining a small hipfire increase, a minor recoil increase (mitigated by a grip) and a RoF drop of only 50 RPM. Genrally, the most popular guns in MP are the Bal-27 and ASM1, and genrally, it'll be their +Damage varaints, the Obsidian Steel and Speakeasy. As someone that genrally uses the HBRa3 and IMR, I can say they're not completly bad, but it's still pretty much the same weapons over and over again. And on the topic of consistant weapons, the maps have once again been built with only 1 tactic in mind; rushing. Now I know CoD has always suited a "Run 'n' gun" play style, and that's what makes it so popular. But I loathe that these maps have been built specifically for rushing. When we compare it to MW2 maps, there was variety. There was long range combat on Afghan, there was mid-range combat on Underpass, and there was still some CQC action on Skirow (spelt wrong since that's apparently a naughty word on Steam). AW mpas just feel like they've been built for CQC, with the off mid-range sightline. And of course, if you try to use the sightline with a mid-range weapon, you just called a camper and hacker and everythign under the sun just because you killed a rusher. And of course, add in the exo-suits and you basically have Halo bunny hopping on steroids.\n\nAnd as an added bonus. The community reception. Now, i don't mean Community as in us, I mean how SHG dealt with the community, because frankly your commmunity makes up most of your game, esspecially if you want it to last, or if you want people to buy all your micro-DLCs (which by the way, did I mention the consoles get a micro-DLC to get supply drops but us on PC don't?). Frankly, SHGs community support has been appalling. I mean, any points AW may have still saved for a rating, I'd knock off for their community interaction. Firstly, most of the things they said would happen didn't. You can look though these reviews and look at ones several months old, and see the issues are still relevant. In my once experiance, I had to debate with the support team for 4 months, just to get 1 hour of double XP. And frankly, the only people they seem to care about are the people making revenue of their game on YouTube. So you might see people like Ali-A and Drift0r praising the game, because they're getting paid for it, and SHG know that so it's them they're keeping happy. But then you look at all the people that aren't getting paid for it, and aren't as powerful free advertisement simply being ignored. A good example is all of us leaving negative reviews, since like I said above, our issues ahve yet to be responded to. And then there's the Call of Duty Wiki (~1 million views a week) and CharlieIntel who never get any acknowledgement from SHG despite the fact they're both huge CoD communties (and trust me, we have tried contacting them).\n\nSo in short. The campaign is medocre and predicatable, the co-op mode is nothing more than copy-paste, and the multiplayer is just a bombshell made to panda to those that will actually praise the game instead of listen to criticism. And as far as SHG is concerend, this review means nothing because I don't have millions of subscribers on YouTube.\n\nEdit: Another thing that makes me somewhat sad. Is while many of the reviews are funny, many people leave "Recommended" reviews, with nothing more than silly comments that don't reflect the games issues. This leads to incorrect percentages.","July 16, 2015","false","7.9"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","55","67","9","4"

There are constantly about 3-4 Team Deathmatch games and absolutely nothing else. Lack of dedicated servers grinds like a dentist's drill every time I play. Far too many games fail at connecting to the host and dump me out; after an hour's session I'm forced to conclude that of that I played maybe six five-minute matches and the timer between matches is only 40seconds per. Ping is fine. Number of players is worth mentioning; as said, enough to guarantee Team Deathmatch after a few minutes of waiting but nothing else. Note that this is a week or so after launch day, chances are it may peter off swiftly later.\n\nHARDWARE: So. Much. Hitching. Hitching referring to having a reasonably normal standard of FPS, but then regularly dropping down to 0-5fps for about a second or two. On certain maps this'll only happen every few minutes or never, on many many maps this'll happen every fifteen seconds. Renders the game barely playable and so far from fun it ain't funny. This is NOT a problem with my computer's graphics capacity; seelcting the 'optimal' video settings (which insultingly turns absolutely every setting and resolution down to zero) sends the FPS soaring, but does NOT prevent the hitching; usually it just means that instead of going from 90 to 5fps it goes from 190 to 95, and plenty of times it still ditches down to 5-10fps. For the single-player campaign, my FPS tends to vary a massive amount depending on which mission I'm on. For some the computer is happy to chug through at a decent enough resolution and setting, for other missions (Frisco Battleship!) I'm forced to slam the settings down to nothing to be able to get through, and again- HITCHING. Ten minutes into it and all I can think of is how much more pleasant an experience I'd have watching a campaign walkthrough on Youtube.\n\nSINGLEPLAYER GAMEPLAY: Overally it comes to meh, but try it out. Being able to jump around like crazy is the best part of the entire game. Singleplayer can be stultifying, particularly in the game's attempts to distract me from how much it wants me to move cover-to-cover and how much it wants me to think that having different things happen when I press F is giving me new gameplay elements (move containers! pay respects! Jump! Invisible! Kill!). It's almost impressive how they managed to botch the story. The entire thing is massively predictable, to the point where the game just assumes you know what's coming and it skips key plot developments in big hurdles. Characerization is kinda appalling- on the side of your enemies and your friends, the game only ever develops one boss enemy and a few of your friends; consequently you get massively confused about why an army of faceless minions are fighting for the enemy and what their motivation is. And what characterization there is is superficial. Hours and hours into the Campaign and I've heard maybe three Kevin Spacey monologues of one paragraph each and it's enough to realize that the game isn't trying to tell a story, it's trying to tell a summary of a story; anything more complex than 'gettim!' is dropped in favor of more toys. Not that some of the toys aren't fun, and jetpacking is again the best part. More that going through I'm aware of how juvenile it all is.\n\nMULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY: For the third time, jumping around is the best part. Adds some lovely mobility and freedom to traditionally formulaic and trapped maps. I have issues however, which I'll group firstly under implementation, and secondly under core principles. The implemenation of the multiplayer has some issues. Many many perks are underwhelming or fairly non-descriptive; compare them to the perks in CoD4 and you realize that many of them you just don't want, or feel like filler. The Exo abilities don't last long, don't recharge and generally are but minor factors. Some dislike for how you must go through challenges to unlock red dot sight, etc for each weapon instead of purchasing them as per Blops; I spent six teeth-grinding trying to get 40 headshots with a sniper rifle having a miserable time and constantly doing poorly and letting my team down. My final issues are core to how CoD operates, or essentially how Team Deathmatch operates. Everyone moves around the map so quickly that I'm constantly aware that my survival doesn't depend on reflexes or what route I take, but rather on if i manage to not run straight into where the enemies are spawning. If I get ahead or separated from my team, very quickly I'm going to be shot by one of the three enemies who've spawned at three different angles. With health regenerating very slowly and guns having limited clips, I constantly feel weak on the battlefield and any success (3+ kills before dying) tends to be luck of the spawn-draw than anything else. I have to emphasis the slow health regeneration; after surviving a 1v1 firefight, you need to kiss a wall for a good fifteen to twenty seconds to get back to full health, and with the enhanced mobility in this game that's virtually guaranteeing someone's going to soar overhead and send a bullet down your shirt. The end result is that the game seems to lack depth, to lack room for interesting times to be had. Mindless fun is as ever still fun, it's just that it can feel unsatisfactory and can make you feel weak. I'll finish with the fair few good things about the multiplayer. Great player customization, really like how you get random cosmetics drops. Great emblem customization, playercards are satisfactory. Laser weapons are great, normal guns are fun. Killstreaks are fun, ability to customize them is great. Random weapon variant drops is a little weird, but adds some nice variety.\n\nCONCLUSION: If it wasn't for the massive hardware and network problems, I'd just barely recommend this game. The jetpacking about is fun, the multiplayer is generally enjoyable. But the singleplayer can be boring and the story is poor, the multiplayer is subject to problems with fast spawn times and weak health regeneration. Pick it up if you're confident in your rig or after some massive patches, and then only if you can stomach the lack of dedicated servers and the relatively small number of players.","November 19, 2014","false","14.8"," 158 of 231 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","158","231","2","1"

Lazy developers - 6/10\nIntroduction:\nFirst off - I have played the MP more than 50 hours. The store page will only display the time of the singleplayer, which I haven't played at all yet. Only the multiplayer was of my interest and the reason for my purchase. Therefore I won't include the singleplayer experience in my review, so please take notice of that fact.\n\nI was sick and tired about the yearly money milking machinery called 'Call of Duty' like many other people, but nearly always ended up buying it sooner or later (except CoD 4 and Ghosts) and regretting it in the long run. Yeah, they make fun...until you notice or remember how lazy the devs (performance problems, no real balancing, can't get control over all the hacker, horrible P2P-service, money milking>customer satisfaction) and how awful the community (hacker, camper, noobtuber, glitch abusing, OP-weapon abusing and really immature people (not all of them of course)) can be and how literally nothing has changed compared to the prior title every time.\n\nCoD gained my interest again with AW, after I've successfully skipped Ghosts. It looked like a mix of Titanfall, Unreal Tournament and Call of Duty in prerelease videos and I decided to give CoD another try. Yep, I got what I saw, a great mix, which is a welcome and refreshing change. The capability of dashing, even in midair, opens up new possibilities for gameplay styles and can and will lead to intense and fast action. All in all it's still a Call of Duty, but it's also haunted by similar problems like they were present in previous CoD titles. It's already 1,5 months since release and the major flaws are still existent. An evidence of incapacity of the devs and the CoD series, really. I get the impression, that the devs are either just lazy, or have no clue how to deal with it or just don't care.\n\nPlayable game modes:\nMosh-Pit (contains different game modes)\nTeam-Deathmatch (self-explanatory)\nDomination (3 target locations, conquer and hold locations to score)\nKill Confirmed (kill and collect the dog tags to score, or deny points for the enemy by collecting dog tags of your fallen teammates)\nGround War (bigger teams (12-18 players) with TDM, Domination, Kill Confirmed)\nUplink (pick up the drone and carry it to the the uplink station to score)\nMomentum (conquer all flags to win, killing will increase your momentum and your conquering speed)\nHardpoint (conquer and hold the location to score)\nSearch and Destroy (one team needs to defend the target  and other one has to destroy it, alternating)\nSearch and Rescue (similar to S&D, but by collecting dog tags you're able to allow the respawn of teammates or deny the respawn of enemies)\nCapture The Flag (capture the enemy flag and bring it to your base, while your own flag is still there, to score)\nFree-For-All (It's dog eat dog, simple as that)\nInfected (one player starts infected and he/she needs to infect the whole team by killing them; they will respawn infected and have to do the same...sounds better than it's actually is)\n\nPro:\nit makes fun, can't deny it\nthe exo movement is really refreshing for a CoD\nthanks to the exo movement and very fast gameplay camper aren't a huge problem anymore\nplayer model customization\nweapon customization\nkillstreak customization\nmany game modes\nevery map has something special (a special killstreak or a map special event)\na lot of challenges\ningame crates with weapons and/or clothing and/or ingame boosts will be handed out every 3rd or 4th TDM match for free\ndozens of variations for every gun, which will have slightly changed (but still balanced) stats compared to the default one and a different look\n\nNeutral:\nthe graphics are nothing more than alright\n\nContra:\nhacker (not that many, but you'll meet them)\nno dedicated AND ranked server\nyou'll join a lobby with really noticeable lag every now and then (the game can drag you into lobbies with up to 800 ms ping by default, yay!)\nendless synchronization while joining a game sometimes\nhost-migration fails a lot of times\nsome maps are not really suited for a high usage of exo movement\nhuge perfomance problems in some maps (especially the map 'Defender')\nyou can only barely find a game for some game modes\nimmature community (you don't need to feel addressed, if your conscience is pure)\nunbalanced weapons, which will be highly abused by the lovely community (at first the BAL27, now the EM1)\nno votekick function\nno wall running\nnoobtubing is still possible\nlaying down is much too fast, which leads to an already highly abused advantage in face to face combat (and makes absolutely no sense, it is and looks just ridiculous)\nit looks like the devs don't care that much about the PC players\n\nConclusion:\nWhile I could continue my rant, I have to say that it's still fun despite the problems. It's really a new CoD, not just a rehashed one. It allows new playstyles and tactics and offers fast and intense action. The customization options are really great and there are weapons for the taste of everyone. The big amount of game modes can offer some variation, if you're bored with the classic modes like TDM or domination. Most of the network problems could be easily solved by dedicated and ranked server and hacker could be banned from your favorite servers by active server admins in a couple of seconds, vigilante justice! I have problems with the CoD P2P-network since MW2 and it hasn't improved over the years at all (CoD BO I had ranked server and was just awesome). It should really be buried deep inside the earth, but hey, when was the last time, that the devs have actually listened AND reacted to the community requests? I don't know a single person, who has embraced the P2P-system and said 'Awww yeah', but we still have to struggle with it. The amount of players is already decreasing. So PLEASE, give us back our dedicated server. It will work wonders.\n\nAW could be a really good game with a score of 8/10 or 9/10, if it would be treated right, but it deserves nothing more than a 6/10 in it's current state. What a shame. Limited recommendation for now. This review will be updated as soon as some problems are successfully wiped out.\n\n\n6/10\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

With new & what seems to be improved changes to the Call of Duty franchise with the addition of the exosuit & improvements to the game engine itself, as well as some minor optimization improvements from the last title in the series (Ghosts), the online muliplayer connection struggles still remain along with the inconsistency of the infamous payback spawn system & some flawed map design.\n\nI do recommend the single player campaign this time around, as it really is an extremely huge upgrade for the series visually & with much better storytelling/character development. Bringing in an upgrade system over time of playing as well as unlocking customization to use in multiplayer also.\n\nThe CooP mode (Exo-Survival), is something that you could play & have a ball with friends, but proves to not be a lasting experience. You also unlock a full customization for your MP character, & once you do, theres hardly an incentive to go back.\n\nDownvoting & not recommending strictly for the multiplayer portion in this review, since that is what Call of Duty is truly known for. Overall rating of the game - 6/10 - All 6 stars for the campaign. Until Dedis come along, this is not even worth the time if you dont already own it. Wait for a free to play weekend to attempt the campaign or CooP if you wish, or if the MP improvements will come. It has a lot of fun to be had, but proves to be completely worthless with constant 1 bar connections, not even showing true ping numbers in game.","November 4, 2014","false","9.1"," 614 of 960 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","614","960","0","4"

The service wasn't functional in the past few days, but it is now.\n\nAW is a very fast paced game. The maps are small and the Exo suit lets you maneuver these maps even quicker. There's little downtime and it doesn't take long until you run into an enemy, no matter where you spawn. The Exo abilities are a nice addition, but a lot of them aren't all that useful when it only takes 2-3 body shots to kill someone. The time to kill is very low compared to BO2. Whoever sees the other player first usually wins, so it's more about navigating the map and not getting shot in the back. It's still possible to respawn and die 2 seconds later. Some of the starter weapons are a bit overpowered and they are very popular because of that. Sniper rifles feel a bit out of place, since the maps aren't large enough.\n\nThere are no dedicated servers (yet) and the matchmaking is a hit or miss. There's often huge lag at the beginning of a match. Sometimes it's throughout the entire match, which renders the game unplayable. Leaving these matches counts as a loss. Because of the lag it can look like you got killed by a single bullet. It happens way too often that you move around a corner and then die. It's also possible to kill someone and then get killed by that player's bullet. It's rare to have matches with balanced teams. There are a lot of quitters early in a match and there's a lot of backfilling. It's not unusual to join a match and then realize you were backfilled into the losing team which is almost empty.\n\nOverall I'm not enjoying it and therefore I can't recommend it. Dedicated servers would solve some of these problems.","November 7, 2014","false","6.7"," 267 of 407 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","267","407","0","2"

Singleplayer is meh, multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy, but needs patches. So you may wanna hold off till they fix a few bugs.\n\n\nWell, it's a damn fine piece of work for Sledgehammer's debut title, and I'd say this may save CoD from its inevitable decline initiated by the god-awful Ghosts.\n\nUnfortunately, the singleplayer campaign is a huge wasted opportunity. CoD campaigns are my guilty pleasure - Modern Warfare trilogy had many many memorable moments, BO1 is flat-out crazy and BO2 remains the best CoD campaign so far (you can alter the endings!). AW's story, while it had a great elevator pitch, ended up a ham-fisted one-crazy-man-against-the-world kind of thing. Troy Baker and his pretty face is no more than a cameo appearance since he as the silent protagonist who only talks during cutscenes. Kevin Spacey's charismatic portray Jonathan Irons spent most of its time "acting cool". And Ilona, one of the three important companions of the player, while she's mysterious and badass (and I would love to show her a good time in bedroom), her voice-acting is...plain, and her combat-chatters are facepalmingly bad....\n\nMultiplayer, however, is the best part. Here's why I knew Sledgehammer is gonna deliver a great game - their promo videos, if you watch them carefully, basically shows 90% of what the final game looks like. That reflects of confidence, and they have good reasons. Imagine Black Ops 2 gameplay mashed up with Super Smash Bros. You're loaded with an exo-suit, thus by default you're capable of double-jumping (to great height), along with a dashing AFTER your double-jumping AND a buttslam. Yes, you can jump, then double-jump, and then air-dash to pretty much all directions, covering a great distance in the process, and finally end it with a buttslam as precision landing. Oh, and your sprint is unlimited, too. The amount of mobility in AW is rivaled only by old-school shooters like Quake or Painkillers, and I say AW's putting up a good fight.\n\nThere are a few things note-worthy. Your tactical grenades are combined with your lethal nades, and instead you have exo-abilities which are very well covered in their promo video. In order to use both lethal and tactical nades (or just two lethal options), you'll need a wild-card that takes a pick-13 point. Same goes with picking two exo-abilities. The mobility perks seems to matter far less than previous titles since you're crazy mobile by default. The rest of the game is pretty close to Black Ops 2.\n\nHOWEVER, the MP suffers from a few serious issues, one of which is connectivity. 2 out of 5 times the game simply would not connect after loading, and I'm forced back to the menu after freezing for 2 minutes of waiting. Also, the game runs p2p so many times pings are very unstable, thus the gameplay experience is quite inconsistent.\n\nOverall, it's a new and refreshing experience for the most part. The MP gameplay is a crazy dance of jumping, dashing, stomping and shooting - IF YOU CAN GET INTO A GAME, that is. You may wanna wait till they patch the game and then considedr a purchase. As for now, game is unstable.","November 5, 2014","false","7.0"," 272 of 419 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","272","419","0","0"

There is lag all over the place and unannounced maintenance sure doesn't help either.\n\nIf you are smart you will wait for this game to get dedicated server which will probably never happen.

For half a decade, the series has delivered a game every November with clock-like efficiency, each one aiming to be the biggest selling game of its year. After such a relentless schedule, it's clear that the series' foundation has been crumbling with age, but due to its consistent success, it's difficult to reinvigorate the games without the risk of altering what fans have come to love about them.\n\nTreyarch has been most earnest in its efforts to shake up the system, marrying a clever plot-led campaign to futuristic technology, and providing some of the most interesting multiplayer perks the series has seen. Even so, the Black Ops games still can't stray too far from Duty's zealously obeyed formula, a formula that Call of Duty: Ghosts fully retreated to with unambitious loyalty. Where once the series felt bold, where once it codified a lot of modern multiplayer game ideas, now it seems afraid. Afraid to be the same old CoD, and afraid to be anything else.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a perfect encapsulation of that fear. It attempts to be an evolution of the series, but it's not so much a step forward as it is a halfhearted dragging of the feet. Its touted focus on science fiction is window dressing - a few laser beams and jetpacks bolted awkwardly onto the usual framework of assault rifles and shotguns, the equivalent of a "re-imagining" of Romeo & Juliet in which the only change is that the actors are all wearing silver jumpsuits. Aesthetic changes rather than fundamental ones, and not even significant aesthetic changes.\n\nThe campaign is not as awfully dreary as Ghosts' was, but it's so monotonous that it's difficult to get through. While promotional material would have you believe it's all about flying through the air and crawling up walls like Spider-Man, the reality is that AW's single-player is the same NPC-led, corridor-laden shooter you've come to expect. Yes, you can climb walls, but only in heavily scripted sequences, once or twice in the campaign, when the game tells you to. You get an EXO Suit, designed to give you tech-enhanced superpowers, but what that boils down to is mostly bullet-time slowdown effects and double jumps, and the game chooses what "powers" you get in each mission.\n\nIt doesn't help that everything this so called "advanced" combat does has been done better in other games, many of them several years old. Double-jumps, bullet-time, cloaking devices, it's all embarrassingly old-fashioned by today's standards, and comes off like a half-baked emulation of Halo and Crysis - all in linear environments where one can barely take advantage of the cheap, off-brand toys.\n\nThe actual meat of the action is decent enough, but it's about as advanced as chainmail. You march down corridors and, when you're allowed, you shoot factory-standard mooks with the usual cavalcade of guns. Every now and then you stumble upon something unique, like a cool laser beam, and there's even an instance where you get to wear a mech suit, but once again these are things we've seen and done in dozens of other games. One particular cool toy is the variable grenade - grenades can be switched while held to provide EMP blasts or even highlight all enemies in the surrounding area.

One particular cool toy is the variable grenade - grenades can be switched while held to provide EMP blasts or even highlight all enemies in the surrounding area.\n\nDespite a handful of extra playthings, this is the CoD campaign you've come to know and tolerate. The attempts to provide dramatic sequences have gotten more desperate, and the coddling of the player is harder to ignore, but if you just want to shoot some dudes, Advanced Warfare can at least do that, wrapped up in a story that wants to try and make a statement about something, but can't decide what. Is it pro-military? Anti-military? Is CEO Kevin Spacey an evil extremist, or does he have a point? Are governments inefficient? Can corporations do good? These are all questions Advanced Warfare could have addressed. It doesn't though.\n\nMultiplayer at least "gets it" more in terms of utilizing its new tricks, with open maps designed to make the most of a player's tools. Here, there are plenty of rooftops and open windows for players to double-jump onto and through, and while it's still not the fast-paced carnival of boosting and spider-climbing that advertisements may trick you into thinking it is, it's at least far better about giving players versatility and freedom than the campaign is.\n\nOne thing I enjoy is the character customization. As well as gender, one can mix and match armor types, adding helmets, gloves, leg-guards, and EXO designs. New costume pieces are provided by Supply Drops, which are awarded to players as they go through the multiplayer. Drops provide random outfit pieces of assorted rarity, and it's kept me more invested than the usual ranking and weapon/perk system has.\n\nI'm trying to cut down on the amount of lazy descriptive words everybody else uses, but it's really difficult to not describe this all as "solid." It's nothing to write home about, but it's not exactly terrible. It's simply another Call of Duty for another year, tiding over bullet lovers until next November. It's all put together nicely. It works. When you do well you feel pretty good. My heart's just not in it, though. Really, that's Advanced Warfare all over. A crawl toward something different when it needs a leap. It's not even making any strides in the presentation department, with all its Hollywood bombast looking both technically and artistically dated. It's familiar CoD visuals, except it occasionally rips off The Matrix.\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare upholds the status quo and aims no higher than that. Its sci-fi trappings are but shallow appeals to progress, and while the multiplayer is still able to provide some entertainment, the CoD formula feels anything but "advanced" these days.","October 27, 2015","true","274.4"," 93 of 132 people (70%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","70","93","132","10","2"

Gets boring fast. Lag is horrible. Seems intentional. Big disappointment.\n\nFirst, my credentials: I'm a Call of Duty veteran who has played FPS since before the first Call of Duty with over 2 thousand hours in MW2 and over 2.5 thousand hours MW3 and countless unrecorded hours of previous installments since before joining Steam.\n\nI was absolutely consumed with the series because it was the best mix of game and realism when it comes to simulating REAL GUN FIGHTING. So many elements of gun fighting were implemented inside a video game format that even when the fun dried up because the game got old, you could still get that competitive high when going against other human beings in what felt like a fair, calibrated and superbly fleshed out system which rewarded the player that can best balance offensive AND defensive tactics. When a player is all run-n'-gun and you are carefully creeping around corners to counter his arrogance and negligence, you will get the kill most of the time. When all you do is camp in a corner, the offensive player will always get the drop on you (if he knows how to check corners and slice the pie.) There was balance, it was beautiful.\n\nIncreasingly, however, with every new installment, the formula for the system kept changing the balance further and further to reward only offensive and irrational gun fighting gameplay. If you can squeeze every last drop of adrenaline your brain can processes every single game, great, you're going to do well with the new exo movements. But those that want to move cautiously and methodically, carefully, tactfully, masterfully, you're out of luck because the game, coupled with what I personally believe is INTENTIONALLY implemented systematic delay, (lag),  you will lose. You will lose constantly. Even when you have your sights perfectly aligned with where the enemy will appear. Even if you see him on one end of the wall, running around the back side to pop out of the other end where you know exactly where he's going to be, as you're already sending the message from your brain to your finger to click right when he's about to pop out of the event horizon (disregard the astronimic reference) he will still take you down.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause, take it from someone with an unhealthy amount of time devoted to this series, these games are now designed for children to who get a rush out of taking another player down no matter the reason. Activision doesn't see why it's so important to have narrative, rhyme and reason, behind every take down. All they care about is to get as many kids to buy their game and weed out experienced methodical players. Why? Because crazy, ADHD, dopamine junkies do not want to try and commit to strategy and tactics and skill development which takes time and dedication. Activion wants to make these kids feel like gods with the first round they play so they keep buying the games and buy the expansion packs. (which, by the way, further divide the player base, leading to no one being able to play together, diluting the amount of games people can play together, leading to poor connections and lack of games at all. Nice job shooting yourself in the foot Activision.) Experienced, seasoned, methodical, tactful players will win in a fair gun fight, every, single, time.\n\nThis isn't good for business, so it makes sense from a business point of view. You don't want newcomers to be turned away because they suck. WHICH THEY SHOULD. THEY JUST STARTED. So this leads me away from my rant and back to informing you with what's going on.\n\nDo you want to play a game where you're just jumping around, rushing and spraying everything that moves? Get this game, you'll have fun. Do you want to be systematic and outsmart your opponents by punishing them every time for rushing irrationally and risking their lives so non chalantly? Nope. Not for you. You can't. You will get 4 hitmarkers in before hitting the ground the majority of the time.\n\nThis is only slightly better than Ghosts.\n\nOh, which reminds me. Ghosts was a beta for this. You'll see it when you look at the gun models. ESPECIALLY with how the AK reloads. It's identical. Ghosts was an extract to get one more game out to fill the gap while AW was still developing for those 3 long years I, like other serious CoD players, have been waiting for another substantial, quality  installment.\n\nTL;DR It's all rush and no tactics. Gets boring fast. Lag is horrible. Seems intentional. Big disappointment.\n\n---APPENDAGE---\n\nBy reading some of these replies, it seems I have to remind some readers, about my point of simulating real gun fighting, that it was THE MIX of both the game and gun fighting simulation that was excellent. Of course this game's not as realistic as Battlefield, but Battlefield isn't as much of an arcade. However, I should still point out that I do believe Call of Duty, namely, Modern Warfare 1, 2 and 3, does have decent adaptation in simulation gun fighting.\n\nHere's one big example:\n\nIn the real world, if you're ADSing down a path and I pop out of a corner running, you get a huge advantage since all you need to do is adjust your aim and pull the trigger whereas I have to stop and then pull up my weapon to aim. By then I'm dead.\n\nModern Warfare and even Black Ops, was able to handle that just fine. Lag made it a bit harder but you could still overcome it if you're experienced enough with the mechanics of the game.\n\nGhosts and Advanced Warfare are disgracefully poor in replicating this scenario. The rusher has way more advantage. Most of which is to blame on the lag. The encounters in both of these games feel very flimsy by comparison. Previous titles had much more control. More in Black Ops, and even more in Modern Warfare. I think people have previously spoken to this topic with the idea of the 'speed' of the game.\n\nIn Ghosts and Advanced Warfare, ♥♥♥♥'s happening all over the place, you can't hear anything, there's no situational awareness except UAV and gunfire. At least in Modern Warfare 3, you could hear the enemy.\n\nAnother good way to describe what I'm trying to say is, the older the title, the more capability there was when it came to counter attacks. When an enemy is rushing and attacking, but you're able to know it before having to actually see them, you can counter their action by placing your coming action (like aiming your rifle or running another direction to dodge) before their expected action.\n\nCounter attacks are just far too difficult to be made practical in Ghosts and Advanced Warfare. Again, these games feel very flimsy and cheap. Modern Warfare feels more full, substantial and fleshed out.","November 6, 2014","false","9.4"," 230 of 356 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","230","356","0","9"

What starts out fun becomes aggravating and that aggravation begins right when you hit multiplayer. As of the moment of typing this there are tons of players having issues with AMD and reporting all kinds of technical issues on the forums. However, I haven't experienced any of those issues so much as I have with terrible server ping because there are no dedicated servers (I'm told that's not a surprise to the veteran CoD players).\n\nThe game likes to boast about its exo-suit mechanics which let you boost and jet around like you've got a fire in your pants. In reality a large portion of most maps have out-of-bounds areas that disable you from traversing naturally. Because of this mechanic the game feels intensely fast paced but don't count on getting too many kill streaks as you're going to die, a lot.\n\nKill streaks alone aren't that impressive but you instead have to option to deck them out with additions. Can have your UAV be un-killable while lasting longer or have your turret actually control itself (which it really should just do itself). But as you put additions onto them they become harder to reach as they require more points to use which means you really have to avoid death so really: you're going to end up camping.\n\nThe weapons aren't too fascinating and seem to fall flat. You could use the laser beam, or you could just use the superior firearms that use bullets as it seems technology can't improve what's already the best at killing. Your armory feels pretty slim-pickings, but that's where random supply drops come in. Lets just call them what they really are: loot crates. You'll randomly get loot after playing some time and get rewarded unique variations of weapons. Perhaps the gun will spew more bullets or have twice as much ammo, whatever.\n\nThere are plenty of game modes this time around but they seem to suffer from the fast paced gameplay. On average rounds last 5 to 6 minutes, maybe you'll switch sides depending on the mode and go for another 5. I suppose what disappoints me here is that there isn't a feeling of being besieged by enemy players so much as you just jump and waltz around until you find someone to kill or be killed by.\n\nCustomization of your character was interesting, until you realize that really there isn't anything worth customizing in the first place. Yep, pick your face: 16 male faces or 4-5 female faces then slap on this bulky gear and a helmet and forget you ever looked human. Or go the way these games seem to go: Get the tackiest looking gear you can get and go look like a tool.\n\nI'm by no means a loyal call of duty player as I've played Modern Warfare, Black ops II and now this one which I intensely regret not doing enough research into before buying.

Its obvious they did nothing but take elements from better games and tried to encorporate them around cod mechanics. Simply put, its a quick cash in with minimal effort given.\n\nIt ripped off HAWX story, almost completely. Here are 4 bullet points to demonstrate the entire story of both games.\n\n1. Player is discharged from the military and signs on with a PMC group\n2. PMC group rises in power to the point that militaries around the world hire them, instead of funding their own military\n3. PMC tries to take over America (first) and then the rest of the world\n4. Player has a patriotic spirit and is recomissioned to fight against the PMC.\n\nOn top of this, all other technology has been used in games as early as 2003. In 2003 chaser had almost the EXACT same exosuit mechanics to this game. Battlefield 2142 featured similar technology, including the hover tank, the battle linked hud... which to everyones credit is being developed by the military... Drones, like this, were done in frontline fuels of war, LONG before this game. Deux Ex human revolution had a very similar level up system to augment certain abilities. And everything not mentioned here, was done in Ghost Recon Future Soldier, including drones done WELL!\n\nAll of which brought something new and innovative to the gaming world. CoD advanced warfare does not bring anything new, it brings nothing but the same cod with a new look. Titanfall was even better than this, it at least brought some of the similar technology and included some new and innovative, things.\n\nThe game is not worth 60 and is sub par. I would say its worth 20. Unless you are a die hard cod fan, then wait it out.","November 7, 2014","false","15.4"," 254 of 396 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","254","396","0","9"

Graphically this game is better then the others. The campaign is highly predictable, was for me atleast. But that does not mean that it was not fun and enjoyable to play through. The game felt different at first but I slowly found myself feeling repetitive at times. Towards the end of the game it got a bit dull to the point where it was as satisfying. The A.I. teamates sometimes hold you hand along half the game. For example It once said to take out the enimies on my mark, so I shoot and miss purposely. Then the A.I team mates insta killed every target. Like I am not sure what that's about. I rarely found glitches in the campaign or experienced bad issues besides the annoying fact if you edit setting while in single player it will reset your mission and you have to watch an annoying video for quite some time whenever you choose to change any settings, no skip button..seriously? So overall I reccomend the campaign over the multiplayer and I will get into that.\n\n+Multiplayer:\n\nAhh the multiplayer now. I can say alot about this but  lets keep it short. It's not very good, most of the time it is laggy and the game goes based of host migration. Sometimes you will find yourself playing with people from across the world or someone whose ping is over 400 and this is a bit rediculous. The so called "dedicated servers" that were said to be coming don't appear to be arriving anytime soon. Now if they did have them the games MP would honestly be worth the money. I never was a fan of the past cods besides like BO. MW, and MW2 but if this wasn't so laggy then this MP would be amazing. It'd might just make the best call of duty if it did but sadly this whole host factor really brings the games petential down and down,...until you get sick of it. The ranking system in this is to easy, if you played enough you could prestige twice in about 3 days. You rank up way to quickly and it was not thought out very well. Another issue is the maps, two of the maps are very laggy and horribly optimized. The map known as "Defender" is the worst map in the entire game. It is so horribly done that it lags and your frames hit rock bottom no matter what card really. The maps themselves dont really fit the gameplay style, you will still find campers and what not in this. Basically the MP has a lot of issues but I do not feel like exposing the rest. I am not a reviewer just a basic gamer just like you and the average consumer. I have played the MP extensively and thought now was the best time to give my full honest opinion.\n\n+Conclusion:\n-MP would be great just needs dedicated servers (unlikely)\n-Guns are not entirely set up fairly\n-Ranking up is to easy\n-Occasional Hackers (But almost all games have these)\n-One Unstable Map (Loads up horribly "DEFENDER")\n-Needs team balancing\n-Not to many PC players, which leaves many game types with the result "NO GAMES FOUND"\n-Those who play with large groups / friends may struggle to find a game.\n\nI can't reccommend this game, due to these facts. Mainyl cause of it's MP, but if you're not in it for the mp then buy it i guess or wait for it to go on sale like it is now. Play for free this weekend and you will see the issues for yourself. Thanks for those who read this, hopefully this can help make your final decision.\n\nPS.Contact me if you have further questions.","December 11, 2014","false","15.9"," 122 of 182 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","122","182","2","16"

I might even change the recommendation if they somehow manage to fix most of the existing problems*\nLast edited: Nov 10, 2014\n\nDo. Not. Buy.\n\nThis is the next-gen Call of Duty: Ghosts with Exo-skeleton. Nothing more.\n\nFor 90% of time in Multiplayer everyone in the lobby has 1 bar of ping. Sledgehammer says they are using both dedicated servers and listen servers, but that's just total BS. They said AW was going to use dedicated servers months before release, but once again they broke their promise, and now they are using the same lame excuse again (last year Infinity Ward said before release that dedicated servers are coming to PC but it was quickly revealed as a lie because of Host migration, then they said they were "rolling out" these servers but nothing actually changed). It's funny how they don't even give out public beta trials and test connectivity issues in their game before releasing it half-finished.\n\nTalking about weapon balance, akimbo SMGs are back! As if akimbo FMG-9 isn't nooby and gamebreaking enough in Modern Warfare 3, now you can, once again, dual wield SMGs and on top of that put attachments on them. With laser sight the hipfire accuracy is as high as a SMG with Steady Aim in Prone stance in MW3 (even when you are running). Seriously, Sledgehammer? I thought they would listen to the community this time. But nope...\n\nSingleplayer, on the other hand, is creative and very fun to play. Having Troy Baker as the voice actor of the protagonist Mitchell is really a smart move by Sledgehammer since Baker ranks among the top 5 of my favorite voice actors of all time (and I believe it's the case for many gamers). The story-line is a little bit predictable, but it's not without it's own thrilling twists and turns. The introduction of Exo-suit upgrade brings a little RPG element into the rather linear gameplay, which isn't a big deal but works without problem.\n\nOptimization is great, compared to Ghosts. My PC can run singleplayer at 80~100 FPS on 1080p Max Settings with i7 CPU and GTX 780 graphics card, not to mention the graphics are substantially improved, with much more detailed texture and higher image resolution. Dynamic lighting with motion blur made Advanced Warfare the most realistic Call of Duty to date, graphics-wise. The sound engine is extraordinarily better as well. There is one level that the player needs to move through a deserted school in Detroit at night in stealth. When you crouch and move over bricks and broken glass you can literally hear the sound of these bits crunching beneath your feet. Even turning makes a slight sound. Call of Duty‘s stealth missions has never been so creepy before.\n\nStill, a shiny Singleplayer in MP-centric games like COD can't make up for the poor Multiplayer.\n\nHave fun wasting another 60 bucks for a game that worths less than a quarter of it's price.","November 9, 2014","false","10.3"," 112 of 167 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","112","167","0","5"

Don't make the same mistake I did; this game is about 2 generations of a step backward.\n\nMultiplayer isn't anything new, or great. It's watered down and just lazy development.\n\nThe only thing that's good about this game is the amazing cut-scene quality; everything else is just bad, like rotten eggs and fish in your car for 2 weeks in a Texas summer bad.\n\nNeed me to back it up? I just told you how...\n\nGo check out a video of Multiplayer in (this) Advanced Warfare; then go watch one from either Modern Warfare. There's your answer.\n\nWe can start with the basics in the Co-op - There's no difficulty setting, at all, and there's only two maps for it; and it also doesn't allow you to 'rank up' at all, in any sense. Even if it was completely apart from Multiplayer Rankings, it's still something missing.\n\nSingle Player - The game SHIPS with all Audio in Cut-Scenes COMPLETELY OUT OF SYNC. The only way to get them in Sync is alt-tab out of the game and tab back into the game. Every. Single. Cut-Scene.\n\nBindings - All the default bindings to the game are completely random. They even had a binding UNBOUND that is 100% needed during a climatic point in the single-player; resulting in you FAILING it because the game literally says - "Press UNBOUND to slide"\n\nGrenades - There's two versions now; one binds to G and the other to Q and if you want to switch between the various types of the two grenades you have to be holding down Q or G and then press "F" to switch the type. I'd love to see YOU, Roark, press and hold G/Q and tap F while maintaining movement and shooting. You can't. You're forced to stop. It's fail.\n\nTime to Kill (TTK) - It's the shortest I've ever seen in the series. You can drop someone, at level 1, in about 1-2 seconds (a burst). It becomes a game of "Who got behind who first" which is completely lame. It's no longer about skill, but who can camp or watch the most screen coverage on the map and then point and click.\n\nThere's no new features in this game that set it 'better' than the previous games. They changed the setting, copied stories from other sources, and then stamped it Call of Duty","November 5, 2014","false","7.6"," 141 of 217 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","141","217","0","8"

Review my pros and cons and you can make up your mind if you can live with the cons.\n\nPros\nMovement mechanics with dashing and jump boosts allows you to play at a faster pace than any call of duty to date, giving you mobility you've never had before.\nThe maps are nicely laid out and feel well designed**(excluding the ones that take a good 1-2 minutes to load) with each having their own theme. It does feel that the maps were designed in a way to encourage people to not camp as it seems every little spot has multiple visible paths.\nthe guns for the most part are fun to use and don't provide to much of a problem gaining mastery over.\nI absolutely love getting loot crates and collecting different sets of cosmetic gear.\nI'm one who likes making my weapons gold and diamond and they've added more perks which allows you to get even cooler looking cosmetic gear when you max out all challenges with all weapons in each tier.\n\nCONs:\nBefore I go into my main details of what is ruining this game for me let me cover some basics.\nLASERS? Over powered no skill weapon. its a laser pointer that does TONS of damage at really long range.  No need to aim down sites just point, click, and kill it literally turns anyone who is really bad at aiming normal weapons in CoD into having a fairly decent KD if not putting them at the top of the lobby leader board.\n\nMelee is a complete joke ruining all the love I've had for running around with only a knife.  It seems its different for everyone because for me I have to be directly on top of my enemy to get the melee to actually work and then even then sometimes I get hit markers with something that is supposed to be one hit one kill.  However enemies have been seem doing melee attacks an entire body length away or further and still getting the kill.\n\nInventory for cosmetic gear - I see absolutely no reason to limit the inventory space on the comsetic gear you obtain as someone who likes to collect full sets of gear I'd like to keep all sets I collect instead of having to delete / trade some for EXP just to clear space for new stuff.\n\nOkay now to the meat of the problems as if the above wasn't bad enough.\nThough this game is better than Ghosts in many ways, this game has probably the absolute worst lag compensation of all Call of Duty games to date on PC...  Where are the dedicated servers and why did the dev's think setting your ping limiter to 800 was a good idea? You could go into the file and change this but it does no good because the lag compensation given to people within the lobby can be seen watching kill cams.  On your screen you'll start firing at someones back all the while getting hit markers as they turn around and instantly kill you. Or better yet you start firing the second you see a glimps of a hand / leg / elbow of your enemy running around a corner, you get 3-4+ or more hit markers yet you die.  The kill cam of your enemy shows something entirely different displaying that they started shooting at you before you even started firing.  It is so noticeable in some lobbies as there is always one clear benefactor of the lag comp with a K/D 3 to 4 times higher than anyone else in the lobby.   The more and more I play the game the more and more I start to hate it.   It seems like with every knew CoD game being produced that isn't developed by Treyarch just keep getting worse and worse.\n\nWorst of all the amount of flat out hackers in the game is increasing daily, they jump around the map  instantly killing anyone and everyone that is visible for a split milisecond in front of them only dieing to a random person who some how got behind them.  Or they blatantly stand up on a building without moving and kill everyone with each mouse click.  Wall hacks are clearly seen being used as their crosshairs follow you around corners through walls.\nReporting doesn't seem to do anything because the same people who were known hackers and have been banned before are now back doing it again in this CoD.

Maybe (read on).\n\nCampaign:\n\nI found the campaign to be great fun.  I played the whole thing with friends watching via Steam's beta broadcasting feature.  The storyline was your typical Call of Duty fare—that is to say, it's the kind of action movie plot you'd feel comfortable seeing as a half-price matinee at the theatre.  In other words, don't take the inclusion of Kevin Spacey as an actor in the game to mean that the storyline is anything but what you've come to expect from Call of Duty.  Knowing that this was likely the case before I jumped in, I enjoyed the campaign as it was.\n\nThe gameplay of the campaign was simply great fun.  There's a lot of stuff to nitpick—like the fact that some of the quicktime events feel a bit "off" in their timing; and that some key functions of the game need to be remapped (or even mapped!)—but that's really all they are: nitpicks.  Overall, the campaign was a fun jaunt and the combat felt tactical with plenty of opportunities to use your equipment and myriad new abilities.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nI haven't played much of multiplayer, but already my feelings about it are mixed.  What I have played has been "okay."  Just as in the campaign, the exosuit makes the gameplay incredibly fun.  Unfortunately, matchmaking seems slow for any mode except Team Deathmatch, which means that's probably what you'll end up playing if you just want to play, and team balance is a serious issue.  I've been placed on an outnumbered team more than once, and just in my previous play session I was on a team of 2 versus a team of 5.  (Side note: We lost, but only barely.  Score was really close!)\n\nThe maps feel cramped.  I haven't played a map yet that seemed like a good fit for a sniper rifle.  I've read other reviews here that say the game is mostly played with Assault Rifles and SMGs, and, currently, I can't disagree.  Fortunately for me, the run-and-gun nature of this is acceptable—that's my preferred playstyle.  However, I am experienced with many other playstyles thanks to Planetside 2 and other games, and I'm somewhat concerned with how viable switching up classes and roles will be as I gain ranks.\n\nIt's easy to see why afficionados of past Call of Duty games could feel so slighted by this installment.  Though, I feel at this point I should reiterate that I *am* still having a lot of fun in the multiplayer, despite these rather significant flaws.  The gameplay is tight and very responsive (when lag isn't an issue, and thus far, for me, lag hasn't been a big problem).  And though the maps I've played feel cramped, they do quite well in facilitating fast-paced gameplay.\n\nI'd love to see dedicated servers for this game.  I still want to play some more with matchmaking as it currently stands, but I really feel like dedicated servers would extend the longevity of the multiplayer experience.  I do think monitored, dedicated servers would reduce the complaints about lag and hackers.\n\nI don't think I've run into any hackers yet, by the way.  Maybe that will change as I play more, but thus far, it hasn't been an issue.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, I feel I can recommend this game based on the enjoyable campaign and the solid gameplay both in singleplayer and in multiplayer.  However, for all the reasons mentioned above, I'd suggest any potential buyer (if you're reading this, that's probably you) weigh the game's drawbacks on his or her own personal scale to determine whether the game is worth the investment.  For me, the game's flaws aren't game-breaking and I very much enjoy playing, and get excited at the prospect of playing.  For this simple reason—that I find the game fun—I'll give the game a thumbs up.","December 12, 2014","true","7.6"," 170 of 269 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","170","269","2","0"

(i dont mind the download) but after a few days, the game starts freezing again, which drives you nuts. and if you want, you can repeat the process :D\n\n- The game is crashing, yeah, for a lot, and for a lot of weird reasons.\n\n1. not enough memory crash, i have 12GB of ram, and the game is crashing because i dont have enough memory, even if you have 64GB of RAM it will still crash and give you not enough memory message, Fix is, you need to enable PAGE FILE (i know, doesnt make any sense) set at least 2GB of virtual memory and the game will stop crashing with that error message.\n2. the gpu crash, when the game crashes, the screen goes black, and you need to restart your pc, (enabling page file fixes this) i dont understand that one also.\n3. the random crash, i have no idea, regular windows error closed this program... they happen from time to time, especially if you chat on steam (using the steam overlay) a lot when you play\n\n- The game is lagging, i mean, when you play a faced paced game like this, everyone needs to have a good connection in order for a game to be ok, but that is not the issue\n1. i can understand that after 1 year passes the game loses its players\n2. there are no dedicated servers, so most of the time you are connected to some guy (who is the server)\n3. half of the players have a bad connection to the server, 2 or 3 bars out of 4 (bars show how good the ping is)\n4. most of the time i have 4 bars(max), and other people are like skipping frames, i see him here, then i see him there\n5. in a fast paced game like this it is really hard to play like this\n\n- DLC dont work right, i have purchased the extra slots for the armory, and it loaded only after a month (i tried to reinstall the game, switch it on off, restart stuff, it didnt help)\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\ndont buy this game just because of the multiplayer","February 17","false","0.3"," 53 of 75 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","53","75","7","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/recommended/209650/","cheesenium","Cynical Cheese Cake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesenium/","466 products in account","In my honest opinion, this is probably the best CoD in years, probably since MW1 as it was refreshing to play a CoD that tries to be different. There are some interesting weapons, such as EM-1 laser beam cannon that is inspired from Unreal Tournament's Link Gun which is a lot of fun to use while they also introduced double jumps, dodge moves, mid air dodge that does make this CoD a lot faster than its predecessors. The maps are generally well designed with some has gimmicks, like there is a map that is set under the Golden Gate Bridge where there will be a tsunami flooding the map half way which does make the pacing to be a bit different. Also, the maps also offers plenty opportunities to jump and vault around as they do offer more vertical than previous games which is a very welcome change.\n\nHowever, I still would not recommend this game because of the peer to peer multiplayer systems it uses. The netcode seemed to be poorly implemented with a lot of inconsistency in ping and stability. At this time and age, I do think that games should be shipping with dedicated servers, not laggy inconsistent peer to peer. Due to the poor netcode, most multiplayer matches has been quite a frustrating experience. I could get a smooth game in one match, then, the next match becomes a laggy fest with a lot of minor teleporting and shots that isnt registered by the game.\n\nThe campaign is alright, as it is the same run of the mill CoD campaign you expected: Linear, explosive and occasionally surprises you with some smart gadgets. Dont expect much innovations or interesting changes in this one. Kevin Spacey's performance in the game is pretty good though.\n\nAt the bottom line, I do not recommend this game. As a game that is predominantly a multiplayer experience, one should not pay a fortune for a laggy and subpar experience.","November 24, 2014","false","6.7"," 121 of 192 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","121","192","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jellisunc/recommended/209650/","jellisunc","jellisunc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jellisunc/","115 products in account","Multiplayer Review\n\nThe Good\nYes, this is way better than Ghosts and offers a lot of updated/new features different from previous Call of Duties. The Exo suit changes gun fights in that the person who shoots first will not always win. Essentially it adds a new layer of skill and helps make the game even faster. Maps are pretty diverse and offer a lot of vertical play room, but does not rely on a "King of the Hill" style. Customization has also gone up a few steps. You can change gloves, helmets, knee pads, exo suits, boots, shirts, and pants. The guns are pretty different from previous games of the series. We now have lasers, guns whose accuracies get better the longer you shoot, and an akimbo LMG. Also the new player cards are quit unique and definitely add some art to the game. Spawns are a lot better than before most of the time, so less of people spawning in front or behind of you. You now get supply drops periodically that give you a chance of double xp, clothes, or special weapons. You can also sell the items for XP if you so wish.\n\nThe Bad\nOne of the laser guns (EMR) is quite over powered and you will rage constantly when dying because of it. A lot of emblems have been taken away from the emblem creator, which is kind of disappointing if you are an "artist". The time limited loot items are awarded when doing well in a previous game. This is annoying when you consistently get a 5 kill streak every game but the items expire after 30 minutes. We should be able to keep these items if we achieve stated challenge.\n\nThe Ugly\nFirst of all if you have an AMD card, good luck running this game on your usual settings. I suffer from horrendous lag with a 7950 with 3gb vRAM, 8gb RAM, and an FX 6300. Pretty annoying when you spend over $300 on a dedicated graphics card and get poor results even on lower settings. The first 10 or so seconds of every game I get about 5 fps, then roughly 25 for the next 20 seconds. Eventually it figures itself out and I get up to 91 fps, but as soon as I look outside on maps like: Greenband, Defender, Horizon, Recovery, and Retreat I get drops in the 30-40 fps range.  There have been some fixes out there, but I have yet to get solid performance like I do with other titles. This game suffers seriously from connection lag. Its pretty annoying when a game developer promises dedicated servers then continues to release the game with P2P hosting. I can unload a clip into someone before they run away then when they come back around a corner and shoot me a few times I die. Basically the game suffers from usual Call of Duty occurrences that have been around forever.\n\nVerdict\nThe game is very fun, when it wants to cooperate. Most maps are playable, but the few that aren't suffer. If you have an NVIDIA card with decent specs go ahead, but you won't forget that the connection lag is still there. This has been the most innovative game in the series for years, but the developers need to listen to their players if they want them to have an enjoyable time, but that probably won’t happen. If the devs decide to listen to their fan base, this will turn into a great game no doubt that offers hours of play time.\n\nUPDATE 11/12/14\nIt seems the update released a few days ago has gotten rid of some game and connection lag. Still no dedicated servers though, but camos are now a lot easier to unlock! Pretty terrible how a developer can lie about selling you something that they promise to deliver. I am having fun playing, but still suffer from lag on certain maps, but not nearly as bad as earlier this week. Go ahead and buy the game now if you want to have fun, just don't be shocked when there are no dedicated servers in the near future. I still can't recommend something when a developer lies, but its definitely not a bad game and certainly a lot better than previous games in the series.","November 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 92 of 143 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","92","143","0","1"

It reminded me a lot of that - in fact, a little bit too much.\n\nCall of Duty needs to give everyone a little victory. This means that, even if you take the time to become good at the game, you'll only do marginally better than somebody else. The maps are too small to incorporate any real strategy (other than keeping mental notes of spawn points). Anyone running around with a shotgun or an SMG has a good chance of being able to kill you. Because everyone dies so quickly, if an enemy sees your back, you're dead. There's more maneuverability, but it's largely overrated. The maps are slightly more vertical but they still fall victim to CoD map tropes. They all feel like the exact same map, except they differ in how unfun they are. Also, the killstreaks just feel so neutered. They're useless!\n\nSpeaking of useless, the devs didn't spend any time balancing weapons. I'll save you time; the strongest gun this time around is the BAL-27. It's an assault rifle, unsurprisingly. If you use anything else, you're automatically at a disadvantage. Although the callsigns encourage you to do novel things, that's the only real reward, and it's usually just arbitrarily done. For instance, there's one callsign for getting 200 kills with primary weapons with 2 attachments, and another callsign for getting 200 kills with secondary weapons with 2 attachments. The first one is monumentally easier, because there's a more varied selection of primary weapons, some of them are really effective, and you generally have a choice of attachments that will satisfy the 2-attachment rule. Secondaries, however...none of the secondaries are good. They deal virtually no damage, have very little range, and are just a pain to use. Moreover, some attachments cancel other ones out. For some reason, you can't use akimbo pistols with laser sights (even though you can do that with primaries). It'd make the most sense, as akimbo is hip-fire only, and laser sights increase hip-fire accuracy. No, instead the only valid two attachment setup is akimbo and silencer. Akimbo ruins your accuracy, and silencer drastically reduces your damage and range. It's literally the worst combo for a weak secondary. Nobody took this into account at any point.\n\nIn a nutshell, that's the game's balance. There are plenty more things like that that prove very little testing was done in the three year development cycle that they had.\n\nOh, and the exosuit - the big claim of this entry? It's OK. It gives you some more options in how you play, and it does as if you have more freedom of movement, but it literally doesn't matter when you gracefully navigate the claustrophobic maps only to die from three BAL shots.\n\nAlso, Sledgehammer (that's the dev this time IIRC, they're all the same anyway) doesn't care about improving their netcode. It's terrible. It's not getting any better.\n\nI wish I could get my money back.","December 5, 2014","false","0.1"," 92 of 143 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","92","143","0","0"

A breakthrough the series really needed. However, the game itself is something really worth a try, if its on PC, then its a no go.\n\nLike always, it was really a port from console..which usually means issues, but this time, it is insane.\n\nSingle player: Well for starters missions take WAAAY to long to load for some reason, and after getting into the  game, the options menus doesn't have many options for single player usage. Lets start with subtitles, that isn't there. The FOV meter seems to have gone missing, yet in multiplayer, you get the option for it even before joining the game. Graphical issues like FPS are pretty obvious. Mainly AMD users seem to have issues, I am among them. Issues include freezes, crashes, stutters, and audio desync. Sometimes a guys mouth isn't lined up with what he is actually saying. Think of the movement of yourself saying "Hi", then think of another word with mouth movement that differs, now imagine the word "Hi" being played over that...Its pretty bad.\n\nMultiplayer: No server support...but its promised to come along..till then COD:AW is best kept on console\nNo way of banning people? Can't seem to get the pesky cheaters out..\nUnreliable service...."Service is unavaible" is a curse haunting the COD:AW Multiplayer.

And we still see the use of P2P connections. Even older COD's like COD4 and COD:WAW may not have dedicated servers provided by the company, but the community was able to get dedicated servers, which is probably why those two games are extremly active.\n\nOn the bright side...with the MP I played on PS4, its definitly something to look into, BUT ONLY ON CONSOLE...If you want this for PC, then dear god please wait for an update or patch, we cannot afford to have more complaints and issues!\n\nOverall: I can't recommend this game on PC until these issues are resolved- -1/10\nHowever, if played on CONSOLE's like PS4 and XBOXONE...You'll more then likely enjoy it- 8/10\n\n","November 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 108 of 172 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","108","172","0","0"

Ever since the release of "Black ops II", it seems that the CoD series developers (Treyarch, Infinity Ward, Raven and Sledgehammer) are getting desperate.\n\nThis was particularlly visible in Ghosts, with Infinity Ward releasing all kinds of random, useless content, including character packs for the main characters of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series (Captain Price, Makarov, Soap, etc.), multiplayer voice packs (Drill Instructor and Snoop Dogg(Seriously?!?!)), weapon skins (They started selling those in Black Ops II), and adding modified versions of the Maniac Juggernaut in the form of some the most famous fictional movie characters of all time (Michael Myers, Predator, etc.) to ONE map in each of the DLC map packs! They knew that they had screwed up, but they didn't try to fix it, and instead, attempted to cover up their failure with the content listed above, which they failed to achieve as well.\n\nNow in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Sledgehammer has done much better. They appear to be following in the footsteps of the original Infinity Ward staff in an attempt to add a new series of games to the Call of Duty franchise, where instead of World War II, the Vietnam/Cold War, "Modern Warfare", and whatever future Black Ops II was supposed to, its set in a "realistic" future. While they have suceeded in many ways, they still failed in some ways in the form of content.\n\nThe big reason for this failure... Its content is EXTEREMELY similar to "Titanfall", a game released earlier in 2014, developed by Respawn Entertainment, a company formed by a majority of the former Infinity Ward staff, including Vince Zampella, one of the co-creators of the Call of Duty franchise & co-founder of Infinity Ward (the other co-creator & co-founder, Jason West, left Respawn shortly after the lawsuit between EA & Activision was settled)!\n\nHere's the list of gameplay/story elements that I've found in CoD:AW that are similar or the same in Titanfall:\n(This list is a work in progress. I will add to it if I find anything else.)\n\n\nTitanfall = The first playable Titan Chassis you get to play as in-game is called an "Atlas."\n\nCoD:AW = The company headed by Jonathan Irons (Portrayed & voiced by Kevin Spacey) in the campaign is called "ATLAS Corporation."\n\n\nTitanfall = There are Titans that you can use in battle that Respawn described as "The ultimate evolution of a battletank."\n\nCoD:AW = In an early mission in the campaign, you have to fight a battletank called a "Titan".\n\n\nTitanfall = The ship that you have to destroy or protect (depending on which side you are on) in the 5th mission of the campaign is called "The Sentinal."\n\nCoD:AW = The US Faction in the campaign is called "Sentinal."\n\n\nTitanfall = Any Pilot can double jump with their "Jump Kit".\n\nCoD: AW = The "Exo Suit" in multiplayer gives you the ability to double jump.\n\n\nTitanfall = There are drop pods that bring in spectres or grunts throughout multiplayer matches.\n\nCoD:AW = In the 1st campaign mission, you drop into battle using a drop pod (whose exterior looks almost identical to the Titanfall drop pods)\n\n\nTitanfall = One of the three tactical abilities a pilot can use is Active Radar Pulse, which shows the location of enemies (Pilots, Titans, Spectres, Grunts) every half a second or so.\n\nCoD:AW = The tactical grenade can be set to "Threat" before throwing to highlight enemy movement in real-time.\n\n\n(This next similarity contains SPOILERS for BOTH Titanfall and CoD:AW)\n\nTitanfall = Upon completing the eighth mission in the campaign, the IMC Commander, Vice Admiral Marcus Graves (Portrayed & voiced by Nathan Constance) (I believe he is British) leaves the IMC to become the commander of the Milita after being denied by his second in command, Spyglass, the chance to rescue IMC pilots from certain death.\n\nCoD:AW = While siding with Atlas throughout the first half of the campaign, Gideon (Portrayed & voiced by Gideon Emery) (I believe he is British), one of the most respected and well known soldiers in the Atlas PMC, joins Sentinal after learning the truth about Jonathan Irons and his plan to take down the US.\n\n\nThere are probably other ways they are similar, but they are either irrelevent, I haven't seen them yet, or I've forgotten them. I will update this list if I find any other elements similar to Titanfall.\n\nI have now started a list of elements that CoD:AW has that are similar to other games. Thank you "Ɗᴙλɠøὴ /¾/" for the first similarity!\n\n\nHalo series = Some weapons (Assault Rifle, Battle Rifle, DMR, etc.) display the clip amount on the weapon itself.\n\nCoD:AW = All weapons display the clip amount, ammo count, tactical grenade count, and lethal grenade count on a holographic display projected above the weapon.\n-Ɗᴙλɠøὴ\n\n\nIf anyone finds a similarity to Titanfall or any other game that I haven't mentioned that you believe to be note worthy, post the name of the game or game series along with the similarity in the comment section, and I will add it to this review. Your steam username will be credited underneath your simiarity.\n\nIn any case, from what I've seen so far, CoD:AW is Call of Duty's attempt to start fresh and for the most part, suceeding. But at its core, it's just putting on Titanfall's clothes and forgetting to zip it's jacket closed to hide the shirt underneath that says "Call of Duty" on it.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I have done my research, and from what I have found, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was not in development before Titanfall. That being said, any comments regarding Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare beginning development and having these ideas before Titanfall WILL be deleted unless concrete proof is included in your comment!\n\nPLEASE ALSO NOTE: Any comments about similarities CoD:AW has to another game will be researched to be verified. Any similarities that turn up fake will not be added to the list, and your comment will be deleted.\n\nPLEASE ALSO ALSO NOTE: In the event someone does show me concrete proof that CoD:AW was in development AND had these Ideas before Titanfall, I will either change or remove this review.\n\nIn short:\n\nIt's DEFINITELY better than "Call of Duty: Ghosts" (I admit that it does make my top 5 CoD games at the moment)!\n\nBUT...\n\nIt's DEFINITELY a "Titanfall" wannabe!\n\nIt's an great game overall, but TItanfall is better (And was born first)!","November 9, 2014","false","50.9"," 55 of 82 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","55","82","0","2"

Way too many Quick Time Events.  Forgettable characters.  Flakey keyboard/mouse controls.\n\nGiven what I've encountered playing for 4 hours thus far, if I'd known all this ahead of time I would have given this a pass.  The single-player campaign just doesn't hold water, and reads/plays like a bad B-Movie.  And before anyone asks no - not interested in the Multiplayer at all.  If a game can't stand on it's own in single-player then it's not doing it's job.\n\nThe upgrade system feels very much like it's not providing any real benefit. It's more akin to someone feeling like they had to check off a box on the list that says 'RPG elements'.\n\nWithout spoilers, the plot is utterly bland and predictable.  The big reveal when it comes about is just so hum-drum that one just wants to get past it.\n\nCombat is a slog-fest.  Typical hide-behind-cover mechanics and ye'olde 'regenerating health' nonsense.\n\nFrankly, if they'd focused less on the vehicle sections... less on the innumerable QuickTime events... and gave the plot something different and interesting, then they might have had something here.  Instead it's just a mess.\n\nGive this game a skip.\n\nNow if you'll pardon me, I'm going to go back to playing some more PayDay 2.\n","November 17, 2014","false","5.4"," 84 of 134 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","84","134","0","2"

It could use some fix releases. My GTX 680 should be able to run this just fine, but I was having horrendous framerate issues in open environments. Hopefully others can avoid this problem.The opening video was a little annoying each time I had to restart after lowering my settings again and again. The gunplay was fine, and the AI wasnt too bad. Anywho, this honestly seems like a fancier cookiecut of previous installments, which is what most of us expect from the franchise. The exosuits seem like a nice touch, for the 10 minutes I was able to run around indoors. As i've said, i'm not into the COD multiplayer, just the SP. Good luck to others who try, though.

I bought this iteration in a fit of amnesia and regret it wholeheartedly. Reasons:\n\nStill no server control. You'll wait for players, you'll have "intermission", you'll have de-syncs, and your game wont load after you finally find enough players for a match. I'm not saying all the time, just enough that I'd call it common. I'm writing this after spending almost ten minutes looking for a game, then it only loading halfway. I have a stable net connection, and an 8-core rig running a 780 (it's not me).\n\nEven if everything works wonderfully, you get to sit around for 60 seconds doing nothing while the next match is queued (intermission). All the while there isn't even a chat box to talk to your fellow players. Why not? Probably because Xboxes dont have keyboards. Meanwhile, a few players from your last match will get bored and leave the lobby, so you get to sit waiting for more players to join your game, then do the 60 second countdown all over again.\n\nWant to play "groundwar", the large-group game setting that rotates between a few match modes? Well tough, not enough other people are playing that right now so you cant find a game. I tried to log in last night around midnight PST and was greeted with "online services not available". Was that a patch? Was that maintenence? God knows.\n\nI will say the single player campaign is visually stunning, even if it suffers from "mash this button a lot because this is a console port and we think console players find this a fun mechanic". Kevin Spacey does a great job, but no one buys CoD for the single player.\n\nYes this game works sometimes, yes when it does the multiplayer is kind of fun, but unless youre looking for a $6/hr single player experience, or you're a moderate-to-huge CoD fanboy, you're probably going to regret buying it on the PC (just glance at other posts on literally any board).","November 19, 2014","false","6.4"," 44 of 65 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","44","65","0","1"

It's pretty standard as the Single player is on every CoD: it's linear, fast pace, short and vary dramatic. I would say it's slightly better than MW2.\n+ Sounds, animations and cinematics are great\n+ Gun Firing range is awesome\n\n~ If Ghosts and Black Ops 2 had a baby it would be this game...Unfortunately for it, as far as the pc goes, it took a bit too much from the Ghosts side.\n\n- PC specific issues EVERYWHERE.\n- Mouse Accelleration (there's bandaids for this but no fix)\n- Random Framerate Drops\n- Voice desync (single player)\n- Unbalanced Hardcore mode\n- Not enough lobbies to play all the modes (mainly classic modes)\n- Controls can be frustratingly inaccurate when boosting\n- Random Mouse Accelleration specificly after shooting and before/after boosting\n- Kill times for both hardcore and normal seem too fast.\n- Leveling is too fast\n- Kill streaks do not equal the trouble it takes to get them\n- Annoying gun mechanics that break running or boosting\n- Annoying menus\n- Ghosts like maps though they are slightly better\n- Unable to see pings and lobbies with laggy people\n- No ability to select max ping\n- This is an Area Shooter. Strategy rarely comes into play without a direct objective like S&D or Dom\n- For as polished as the rest of the game is, it really does feel like PC gamers are getting the shaft in this game\n- The coding is in Klingon (no joke).  So instead of polishing the game for pc users they decided to waste their time on other stuff\n- Spawns suck almost as bad as Ghosts\n- Destiny like dress up system\n- Random drops for gear make it so that everyone can look cool, no work required.\n- SLI is not supported yet\n- Player models are taken too much from ghosts. In my opinion they are way too skinny and awkward looking\n- Gun models are too big\n- FOV doesn't seem to be the number the setting says it is.\n- Black Ops 2 still feels like a superior game although Advanced Warefare does match/exceed it in graphics.","November 9, 2014","false","6.8"," 67 of 107 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","67","107","0","2"

Cool weapons.   Awesome UT style movment (people say it's like titanfall, which obviously ripped off unreal tournament/epic).  But.. this game is loaded with hackers.  I'm not a noob.  I have 10k hours in FPS, and I can tell when someone is ... either elite or assisted in their aim/prefire/wall.  I cannot believe such a high percentage of my opponents, especially those with <2 years on steam, especially those with <300 hours of FPS gameplay on steam... can be so awesome.  So yeah.. prefire me, out aim me, ignore recoil in killcams, and generally pwn everyone (including me) in game.. I think you're hacking.  I wish it was rare, but it's not.  From what folks tell me, it's like MW2 all over again.  And I've been told that was possibly the most hacked game in the history of FPS.  It sucks not being able to find a game without inhuman aim and prefire.  I may be getting older and drunker.. but this game is amazingly full of BS.   Even people that didn't hack earlier COD (from what I can tell playing with them) are jumping on the 'code solution' in this game.  I really wish I had not bought the 'all DLC included' version of the game and saved myself $40.  I really thought a new developer (ie, sledgehammer games) would be better than Treyarch and their ilk.  Imagine my displeasure at whishing Treyarch had 'done this game'.  Hacking aside, annoyances like no fix for SAC3suppressed sound bug, movement bug when sprinting too often, the ridiculous imbalance among various weapon types, and the constant 'play online.. no service found' type issues .. well, it's sad I paid for this game.  If I had known what I know now, this would not be the game to bring me back to PC after 2 year hiatus.  It would be the game that made me embrace the controller on the xbox360/xboxone.  I wish I had bought this (and other) games on that platform.. which stings being a 10k+ hour veteran of PC FPS gaming.","January 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 66 of 108 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","66","108","12","1"

The characters and acting where on point but the story felt rushed and because of that I didnt get pulled into the game the way I had hoped. Control scheme is copy paste from the genre a few interesting aspects involving the 'Elysium' style battle hardware weren't enough to save the absolute lack of immersion. I recall a moments from Battle Field 4, which I haven't played in along time, that put this game to shame.  One big aspect is the lack of environmental influences. I was a soldier and experienced combat first hand....everything around you matters. In COD if I throw a grenade at an enemy behind lets say a vehicle for instance...the vehicle recieves no damage....the windows dont blow out..the tires dont deflate...the thing doesn't even suffer from ballistic shift. This ruined the game for me. Also NPC's dont display true physical atrophy from damage. Its 2014 guys...if I shoot something in the leg I expect it to fall down or hop to cover. If I hit someone point blank with a grenade launcher arms and legs should go flying. This is another example of a AAA hype title and I recommend you stay away from it untill it drops in price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srswizard/recommended/209650/","srswizard","srswizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srswizard/","287 products in account","I'll divide this into two separate short "reviews", for SP and MP.\n\nSINGLE PLAYER:\n\nI'll start by saying that it was mostly enjoyable, much like a big budget action film, but it has multiple technical issues and design flaws.\nFirst of all the game can't deal with mouse polling rates of higher than 125Hz without it messing with your aim, by randomly giving you high mouse acceleration, so it's adviced to turn your mouse polling down to 125Hz, if it's possible for you to do so.\n\nThe game has FPS stuttering issues too, at times, and the prerendered cutscenes are running at 30FPS (for "cinematic feel", I assume), but they too keep stuttering, and on top of that they're unskippable. There's a loading bar for the next mission, but I suspect it's complete bogus, as it never finishes until the cutscene is already over.\n\nThe game is full of  these predetermined events where you're supposed to do exactly as told, or you're punished by instant death, no matter what your difficulty is set to.\nYou could be playing on the easiest, and sponge all kinds of damage, but if you fail to do what you're supposed to in the events, you're punished with instant death.\n\nHere's a couple of examples of the above.\n\nThe white pickup truck with a turret in the alley, during the mission where you save the prime minister of [????].\nYou could take it out with ease, if it wasn't for the fact that the car plays a role in the mission a little bit later, so they made it kill you instantly.\n\nThen during the mission where you have to escape from Atlas with Ilona, and you're running through the streets, being chased by Atlas soldiers.\nI had reached a checkpoint near the docks, and I had to backtrack for intel, but it was made impossible with some kind of an invisible line, where if you crossed it, you'd get OHK'd by a random bullet every time.\n\nThe truth is, the intel collectables do not fit this cinematic style of gameplay.\nThe checkpoint feature causes you to get stuck in places, where it's impossible to backtrack for the intel you missed.\nSometimes when it should be possible, you're met with an invisible border, that when crossed, causes you to "fail the objective" and the last checkpoint is loaded.\nIn fact, sometimes these invisible borders are so strict, that you'll cross them just by straying a tiny bit from the intended path.\nYou see that alley there? Could there be a hidden intel there? Nope, just another invisible line.\n\nExploding helicopters were cool. Kevin Spacey too.\n\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\n+The exo movement is a welcome feature, and it adds nice fresh variety to the stale COD MP.\n+The map designs aren't half bad.\n+Graphics are pleasant.\n\nNow let me tell you why you absolutely SHOULDN'T bother with COD:AW MP, if you are looking for a quality MP shooter experience.\n\n-P2P, complete with the good old host advantage, and associated goodies.\n-Killcams never match what actually happened on your screen, and we can thank P2P, netcode and lag for this, I guess.\n-Simply awful spawns, this becomes especially apparent in FFA mode.\n-Loot weapons with varying damage stats is an awful design, and ruins any chance a game had with the competitive crowd.\n-Certain maps are so awfully optimized, that I suspect they were never playtested on PC AT ALL, these maps will cause stupid amounts of FPS stuttering, which makes them unplayable.\n-Time-to-kill in general is stupidly low, and often you'll have no chance to react to being fired at, because you get notification of the opponent's first bullet, by the time he's fired 4-5 bullets in you on his screen.\n\n\nThat said, I'll probably continue playing the multiplayer a little longer, because I'm a masochist.\nI'll update the list of pros and cons if I'll think of something to add.","November 13, 2014","false","18.0"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostmonkeycat/recommended/209650/","ghostmonkeycat","Ghostmonkeycatthing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostmonkeycat/","159 products in account","Greetings, I hereby provide the following reasons.\n\nPerformance issues:-\n\nNot everyone owns a super computer. I study abroad, my laptop only runs on an 860M. Outdated in today's technological standards. However, capable in performing extra on games such as DAI, Revelations 2, Battlefield 4, Hardline. You'd think that since you're able to play all these graphic intense games, Advanced warfare should probably be a walk in a park. Well, think again. 60 FPS is almost non-exsistent, we're in 2015 for ♥♥♥♥s sake.\n\nBecause advanced warfare isn't the most optimised games out there for the PC, running the game for long extensive hours could possibly wear out your hardware at an exponential rate. Updating your drivers could help, but I can hardly call that a fix.\n\nGaming content:-\n\nThe idea of the new supply drop system is by far, the most unique thing about Advanced Warfare. Though some may consider it a just system, i'd like to think otherwise. Most elite weapons that I have used, and by now, I have almost all, have been unbalanced, overpowered, and unfair to the other players who do not own the elite variant. For starters, weapon variants like MOST other games out there should only boost your tactical advantage by a small percentage instead of a huge margin. Players on the battlefield without the elites will feel short and at a total disadvantage during a standard one on one gunfight.\n\nBased on statistics, that a supply drop will only be granted upon first kill/death after every 45 minutes of ingame time. You're looking at a 15% chance on getting an Elite weapon OR cosmetic from each box, let alone random boosters and reinforcements. Because of this, Sledgehammer games have recently pushed out an additional way in obtaining these wonderful Elites from something called the "Advanced Supply Drops". Priced at $1.99 (1), $5.99 (3), $9.99 (5), $19.99 (10). But don't wonder like a blind fly into their twisted web of deception, in doing so, you'd only fall short as a victim of modern day internet microtransactions. The game as it is, already priced at $59.99, and an additional $56.95 for the season pass, and yet you get additional virtual items such as these as if it was never enough to begin with. This has to be the most expensive "Call of Duty" ever in the history of the franchise.\n\nDownloadable content for this game is restricted to only a few game modes. Ridiculous, considering the amount you spend. New weapons that were once unavailable, now premium for season pass and DLC holders. They show absolutely no balancing whatsover. Insignificant amount of cons overweighed by advantages that come with the DLC weapons. So long as you spend $15, you'd almost guarantee yourself plenty of extra kills on the battlefield.\n\nI already have the season pass but jesus, they still advertise it all over my app and steam every single day. How many ♥♥♥♥in times do you want one to purchase your DLC? :|\n\nLack of players:-\n\nFrom an outstanding number of 35K players when it first released in November 2014, to a pitiful 8K peak based off statistics gathered in the past 30 days. Never in the history of online shooters, have I experienced that many people going inactive in the course of 6 months. I have clocked in 800++ hours and have had 15 days of in-map time, and sadly, I have seen friends come and go in the snap of a finger. Unfortunately, games on most modes stop after 0:00 (UTC), making it a ghost game. You're in luck if you manage to join 1 or 2 full 6v6 games but usually on common modes such as Mosh pit, Team deathmatch, and Search and Destroy. You can kiss goodbye to the rest of the other modes. They are redundant at this point.\n\nThe quality of players are despicable. Commonly 12-25 yr olds thinking that the world owes them something. I've never seen a chatbox this amusing before in any shooter, let alone mmorpgs or anything that's online based and interactive with others. Call of Duty, in my conclusion, is mainly targeted for casual players. The moment you whip out dodgy skills and rack up the scoreboard, you've entitled yourself to the achievement of being the worlds most infamous video-game hacker in the history of mankind. That's just how the mindset has developed itself overtime.\n\n2015 = No dedicated servers.\n\nVERDICT: Did this call of duty manage to bring the franchise to it's former glory? To the days of Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2? Sorry, but not quite there yet.\n\nThough god forbid, feel free to utilize your fueling credits for your own personal guilty pleasures. Here, i'm just sharing my personal opinions and have justified as best as I could for the statements I have made. For those who are offended, my sincerest apologies, but quit your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWarmest Regards,\nUnhappy victim of consumerism.","April 9, 2015","false","5.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DietBrownie/recommended/209650/","DietBrownie","Diet Brownie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DietBrownie/","88 products in account","SinglePlayer/Exo Zombies\n\nThe first half of the campaign was by far one of the best COD campaigns that have came out, but then it goes to complete crap during the second half. The story itself was acutually good and has pretty good hidden messages regarding the dangers of PMCs and the diplomacy of the U.S, but these are locked away in Intel which 90 percent of players don't get to see. The second half of the campaign was absolute dogshit in terms of the story. It just gets bad real fast. If you gonna get the game just for the campaign, wait until it's under 20 bucks.\n\nEXO Zombies is by far better than Black Ops 2 zombies but it doesn't even come close Black Ops 1 and World at War zombie modes. There has only been one map that has came out so I can't criticize it that much.\n\nMulti-Player- It has a lot of potential on PC but at it's current state, it's not good. This is mainly because this game is dead and has a small playerbase now. Finding matches for other game modes such as Search and Destroy is nearly impossible. PC gets updates weeks later and even then it can take 1 step forward and two steps back. This game is badly ported for multiplayer, there is constant stuttering in some maps and still hasn't been fixed. None of these issues exist in the console versions of the game.\n\nSadly, like I stated before, this multiplayer has loads of potential on PC, since it feels like a completly different game from the previous titles and even the console versions of this game. This game is extremly fast paced and players with good aim are the ones who dominate. For once, there is a skill gap in a Call of Duty game on PC. The game has lots of customization so it keeps you busy, without it being a complete grind-fest. As well killstreaks aren't that powerful and it requires lots of kills for it to unlock, which I like since the acutual combat remains to be gun to gun.\n\nI'll go for to say that this is the best COD multiplayer since Modern Warfare 2/COD4, but not on PC. If you want to get this game for the multiplayer, get it on consoles. The dead playerbase and the bad port makes the console versions the better option.","April 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","4"

It does somethings very well, they added game mechanics bring some new life to an otherwise stagnate franchise. Though everything that they added into the game also breaks the game. The new exo-suit works great to add more mobility to the game. This also causes the Call of Duty 3 lane map system to go out the door. You can reach any part of the map with ease now. You will constantly find yourself being shot from behind and unknown places. I almost feel as if its added to much mobility. To the point where the game feels rushed to to fast paced for my taste. You need to have 360 degree awareness at all time of you will be killed from behind every time.  Also the killstreaks for once seem under-powered and take more work to earn them. So when you kill 7 people for a UAV it doesn't seem very useful.\n\nNow I'm not saying this a bad game by any means, because its not. I see CoD AW as a better game then the last few  in the Call of Duty series.  Its diffrent and thats what makes it better, but the improvement just isnt enough. It seems like the new stuff AW added just seems sloppy and there are other games that do it better.\n\nPros:\nNew Content\nNew Game Mechanics\nFast Pace\n\nCons:\nNo dedicated servers\nBad Netcode\nPoor optimization\nUnbalanced Guns\nWeak Scorestreaks\nFast Pace\nSame copy and paste storyline\n","November 9, 2014","false","0.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

Not unlike any cod or other games this is seriously definitely the most crashing game that I ever owned. Crashes happen randomly while ingame: after a few seconds, minutes or hours. Secondly: most of the times you wont find a match in multiplayer lobby. You will lose 1h of your life staring at unmatched lobbies and the game will never start. And finally if you find a match you are going to play, it's going to be with unplayable ping, rendering the game mostly ridiculous. Said this it surely blackens the name of all the other call of duty titles.\nMy conf: i7 4820k, ddr3 32gb, asus geforce gtx 770.\nWhat i tried: everything. Nvidia experience default settings, and after that all possible graphics settings, reinstalling the game from 2 ssd in raid on a sata drive, checking the windows event viewer, searching the forums.\n\nSummary: unfortunately this game is unplayable, and in my opinion it shouldnt even be released in europe due to its malfunctioning. I strongly unrecommend this game to everybody.","April 27","false","12.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

I swore last year that after ghosts It was going to be my last call of duty.\nBut with it being a 3 year development surely it must be good? Well yes and no.\nThe ideas seems very fun, even though i prefer titanfalls controls speed/jumping compared to AW. I like the perks and even the level designs.\nI like pretty much everything about the design.\nSingle player is stunning and I couldn't argue that its one of the nicest looking games on PC.\n\nSo here lies the problem, which has been the major problem with cod for a few years now!\nIs there a perk for bendy bullets/see you coming before I did/drop in one shot yet takes 5 to kill them? NO!\nOr I haven't found it yet.\nYes its lag, Its P2P and its bad, like really really bad.\nMy ping bar (as they don't seem to show proper ping rates) is erratic, like all over the place, the full lobby is also. 1-4 all over the place. I'd say like a roller coaster whilst listening to venga boys "up & down".\nYou shoot someone first and they spin round and kill you, it takes 5 bullets to drop them and seems to be one shot to get yourself killed. Replays show something different.\nIts like people have a massive advantages and that they are well ahead on time than me, just feel likes theres a permenant UAV on.\nOK i'm not an amazing player, but i hold myself very well on FPS, never been negative K/D on any FPS only this.\nBefore anybody may state my broadband speed I'm uk virgin media with 100 download and 10 upload fibre optics.\n\nWhy can they make so much money and just ignore the fact that PC should have and needs dedicated servers? Well simple fact is cost. So i honestly can't give this game a postive reivew just for the fact of multiplayer being so bad with connections. Its a shame as it could have been A really good game.\nWe all pretty much pay a premiuim for cod prices and to be honest I expect better, We mainly all buy for multiplayer and its broken.","November 5, 2014","false","7.2"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","4"

(I have 64 hours in multiplayer)\n\nThe new movement system is awesome, it is similar to unreal tournament (gameplay is far from it obv, but you know what I mean). The whole idea is great, but the execution sucks once again. No dedicated servers, and I am not able to join many games since my NAT type is closed (my ISP locked my router and will not change it), I am left barely finding any lobbies and cant even play with my friends.\n\nAlso, cheaters. I have rarely ran into any hackers in the past few CODs, but this one is different. I run into a cheater about every 3-4 games.\n\nA few good things is that there are no claymores in this series (THANK YOU).\n\nThere are lots of bugs in multiplayer and (EDIT) after 2 months are STILL not fixed. Such as everyone on the map hearing the silenced vector shots as if they were shooting it. Also the movement has a great idea but its clunky, its hard to explain it but when you tap opposite directions, you shouldnt "accidently" dodge in one. Also the akimbo vectors take literally no skill, pretty much like akimbo FMGs in MW3 or G18s in MW2 equivalent.\n\nThe singleplayer was pretty good, not great, but pretty good. It is better than ghosts (well anything is), but my fav single player moments are still in CoD4 and MW2. Spoilers aside, nothing too special, just some action here and there and a ok-good storyline. I do have to add that the cutscenes do look pretty sexy.\n\nIn conclusion: This game is not a "breakthrough", it is just another call of duty. If you want to run around and shoot, it might be worth 20 bucks, but I rarely see any COD titles go on sale more than 25% since Activision is so stingy. If you want to play singleplayer, just torrent it.","November 6, 2014","false","6.3"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CallMekILLLA/recommended/209650/","CallMekILLLA","kILLLA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CallMekILLLA/","21 products in account","I will review all 3 aspects of the game in 1 review, the TL;DR version is simple... Worst COD I've ever played.\n\nCampaign (4/10, interesting storyline, everything else poor)\nThe first 5 missions featured nothing massively interesting or unique, it was relatively boring and didn't make a good first impression. Thankfully it sped up and more unique and engaging missions were available but still, not on the same level as previous COD's. I found the storyline to be above average, the concept of biological weapons and a central power house is a lot closer to reality than people believe... Sledgehammer's take on this was nice to see. UNFORTUNATELY, the characters audio and lips were so out of sync and on my second play through the audio had vanished completely (many people have experienced this). Beyond this the way cut scenes worked was nothing short of a joke, they were long and you had no way of skipping them (even if you had already seen them previously). Finally, a problem with every recent COD, it was FAR too easy... I played through on Veteran and died 3-4 times.\n\nExo-survival (3/10, easy and excruciatingly long)\nI disliked everything from the aesthetics, to the functionality and length. Why does it do round count in X^2? O.o Anyways, aesthetics are a minor flaw, the real problem is how painfully easy it is. On my first map, bio-lab, I reached round 144 (where my friend had to leave) and I thought we were great... I quickly realised we're not and the reason we reached that round number was because it is insanely easy. There are 12-15 maps to complete and you have to clear a certain amount of waves per map to unlock the following maps (around 25). It claims that each set of maps become more difficult but this is a clear lie, the only thing that was more difficult about them was maintaining concentration after the hours of boredom. The last wave had zombies and a cute twist but it's not worth all the time spent, it was used soley to boost DLC purchases... disgusting.\n\nMultiplayer (2/10, worst gaming experience ever)\n\nI don't know where to start so I've broken it down into what my main issues are with this game:\n- General issues\n- Movement > Accuracy\n- Classes\n- Ranked play\n- Developer support, you buffed the laser?\n\nMy general issues are somewhat trivial and personal, but here they are. There's no public combat record, the combat record to me was a mark of who you were as a player and how good you were. In previous COD's you could see someone's stats in the pre-game lobby and if he had 100+ nuclears with 400 unstoppables and a 2KD you'd recognise that he is good... you also knew if his Win/loss ratio was only 0.5 that he was a camper. This is absent in AW and for no good reason, there is a private combat record so why hide it? And why hide the number of players ingame? With a lack of players on PC it's imperative for me to know how many people are in each playlist so that I know I'm not wasting my time searching for a SND game at 1am. I also believe this feature, or lack thereof, has resulted in less people playing gametypes that are not called TDM or Domination. Thankfully, FOV slider was implemented from day 1 :D but it resets every time you go into 3rd person... which SND forces -.-\n\nMovement in this game sounded like a great idea but it has been pushed too far; you can jump too high and boost-dash too fast. It has increased the pace of an already fast FPS to a disgusting speed where no control can be maintained playing solo, any player can be anywhere on the map at any given time and you have no way to stop them... map control is now a myth. When a player dashes they move too quickly to be tracked, you have to alter your thought process to shoot at the area their dash will finish (unless you have a controller, controller players are a joke on AW). Due to this fundamental change the game is no longer about who can aim more, it is about who can button bash the most... we might as well rename it to Tekken warfare. In SND you will most likely enoucnter an enemy within the first 4-5 seconds, in the following 4-5 seconds it is entirely possible that the other team is already in your full flank. In CTF / Uplink you can run the ball / flag across map in little over 5 seconds... yet the respawn delay is set to 5 seconds? This would be fine if it was balanced, but it isn't... there is no negative aspect to the speed (except appearing on the mini-map, which can be easily countered and is not an issue in respawn gametypes due to the speed). In previous COD titles in order to be on the 3rd story of a building you had to sacrafice time and positioning for it, you could see limited areas of the map and in order to get down you had to fall or use a ladder / stairs which all come with disadvantages. In AW you can free flow between ground / 2nd / 3rd floors in seconds without any consequence.\n\nPerks / equipment and streaks are perhaps the area they destroyed the most, since we already had a system that worked just fine. For someone who enjoys streaking, the perks are a mess, 4 of the neccessary streaking perks are in the 3rd slot with almost nothing useful in the 1st and 2nd slot. They've also removed deadsilence which means in SND the soundwhoring is a joke, it's not a big deal in respawn however. My primary problem with this is they removed it on the basis that they don't want perks that are 'essential'... YET THEY KEPT IN TOUGHNESS!?!?! I remember painkiller being annoying, it was disgusting, then we moved on and I was happy to leave deathstreaks in the past :) But AW went 'maybe we should bring back painkiller?, yeah maybe we should bring it back and make it readily available whenever you want with no sacrafice required'. Exo-Stim is a joke... INVISIBILITY is a joke. Yes if they're moving it's easy to see them but if they corner camp inside hills where nades and players are flying everywhere it's impossible to find them. The exo-abilities are reason enough to rage, nevermind anything else... but there's much more. Due to double jumping all forms of explosives are now completely overpowered, you can double jump and fire down a rocket launcher destroying everything (flak jacket doesn't save you), previously campers had to go to standard elevated camp spots to fire their noob toobs, now they have free reign to do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want and it's simply out of control. Stun grenades... stun grenades... please give me strength. Stun grenades are EBOLA. They stun you (this is fine), FLASH YOU, AND BUST YOUR AIM. They have 3 effects which no 1 perk can counter, meaning if you want to truly counter them you are forced to run 2 perks (which means sacraficing blast surpressor because toughness is essential) - this has hindered competitive drastically in my opinion. Finally, the streaks are completely useless unless they have 3 modifications which makes them slightly better, a fully upgraded Paladin requires 1800 score approximately and will get you 5ish kills... useless.\n\nRanked play is what I expected to be the only saving grace, however pre-patch it included momentum, non-competitive maps, 0 restrictions on class set ups and the availablity of on-going sessions to searching players. The amount of times I joined games into a losing situation because previously people had rage quitted... AND LOST POINTS because of it. I will not get into too much detail because they patched it and fixed many things, LASER STILL ISN'T BANNED THOUGH IS IT.\n\nI am next to the character count so I have to be quick, THE DEVELOPERS ARE ♥♥♥♥♥. No dedicated servers, patch release took over 1 month, no anti-cheat... waste of time and money. On console (due to no aim assist when hipfiring) the laser was not OP so they buffed it, however PC aim is the same ADS or not, this shows how little COD developers care about PC players.\n\nI hate this game.","January 2, 2015","false","17.9"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","25","41","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhoms/recommended/209650/","rhoms","rhoms","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rhoms/","233 products in account","Call of Duty has become sort of a joke in the gaming community. Its linearity and oh-so-serious stories have faltered since the first Modern Warfare, its multiplayer devolved into a world where everyone has apparently gone all the way with your mother at only age ten. While many criticisms about Call of Duty still apply, Advanced Warfare somehow has recaptured my interest in the franchise; but it's not without many flaws.\n\nCampaign- 7/10\n\n(Contains minor spoilers)\n\nBefore I get too deep into this, Call of Duty's formula for campaigns is well known. If you don't enjoy action movie plots and scripted action sequences, look elsewhere. For those who are familiar or not bothered by this fact, here is what I thought of the campaign.\n\nAdvanced Warfare starts out strong, with a gorgeous opening cutscene and a fun first level; sadly, this quality doesn't continue through the rest of it, save for the cinematics. Kevin Spacey does an excellent job as Jonathon Irons, the leader of ATLAS, a private military corporation quickly gaining fame and respect. However, his character is limited and there's not too much to say about Irons. He's a man with strong ideals, but these ideals don't amount to much when his entire character arc becomes a very dull experience to watch. Irons could be an interesting character, but (trying not to spoil anything), his story could definitely have been more fleshed out. Instead, you get a direct and forgettable character saved by an extremely good performance. The thing that hurts about Irons is that he could've been so much more.\n\nOutside of that, the Call of Duty campaign rules remain in place; for the most part. Minor upgrades to your exo suit replace Black Ops 2's loadout system before each mission, and first person cutscenes are gone. These are replaced with extremely gorgeous cinematics played during the loading screens; I greaty enjoyed those, but if you're looking for that final knife throw... it's gone.\n\nThe linearity of the campaign is questionable. If you like exciting, scripted action sequences then this will be a joyride for you. Enemies pop out of cover, you shoot them, and then something blows up and it's apparently important. Car chases that have you hopping from one car to another kept me at the edge of my seat, and beautiful areas kept it feeling fresh. However, a common theme in Advanced Warfare's campaign once again arises; it could've been so much more. There's a mission where you can freely grapple onto enemy helicopters, bridges, and the likes. That was ridiculous fun, and it actually would improve the rest of the game if it imitated that admittedly sparing freedom.\n\nAdvanced Warfare does a good job of creating yet another Call of Duty campaign, but it only shows fleeting signs of true greatness through out. One can only hope that the next game can embrace the idea of player freedom, with less linearity. A solid start to what will inevitably be a sub-franchise.\n\n\nMultiplayer-\n\n7.5/10\n\nOnce again, I must start this section of the review with a disclaimer. Almost all of the common complaints towards Call of Duty's multiplayer remain unchanged. If you did not like the past multiplayer, chances are you won't like this either. Regardless, this is an extremely fun and addicting experience that just can't be for everyone.\n\nEvery FPS seems to have a niche to fill. Big open battles? Go play some Battlefield 4, or even hit up Planetside 2 if you want truly massive ones. Want a great story and fast paced multiplayer with team coordination? Halo's your game. Want cooperative fun? Borderlands is there for that. (I may be ridiculously biased towards that one though.) Call of Duty fills the adrenaline-pumping niche. Nothing gets me more excited in a game than running around with a KF5, blasting away at enemies and rabbit punching them sky high. The thing is, I don't really have any stories from the multiplayer. In Battlefield 4, I can tell about when a buddy and I hid out in a crumbling building as tanks roared outside, directly into my C4 trap. In Far Cry 4, I can blabber on about the time my friend and I got attacked by honey badgers and I got my elephant killed doing so. In Call of Duty, all my stories are the same; I punched some guy and then I killed another enemy. Lots of badges popped up, and that's when I realize there's nothing else to it.\n\nA good change to the multiplayer is obviously the exo suits. Sliding, boosting, and punching my way through multiplayer matches was fast and glorious. You also kill and die a little bit slower, allowing for much longer firefights. This opens up the matches, and makes them far more fun.\n\nHowever, getting into a good match is rare. Without a server browser/dedicated servers, you can generally only find games of Mosh Pit or Team Deathmach. This is a huge problem with the multiplayer, and needs to be fixed as soon as possible. Otherwise, I'm not sure how long it will hold up.\n\nFinal Verdict-\n\nAll in all, Call of Duty remains Call of Duty. It's fast, it's fun, and it's fleeting. Its characters are shallow and the campaigns explosive. Its multiplayer is ridiculous fun and intense. It's still Call of Duty, but there's something to be said about this year's entry; it's different. The exo suits are a great addition, and a great way to improve gameplay. It may be more of the same, but when the same is so good and happens to be some of the best in a long while... is that so bad?\n\nMy final verdict for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is a solid 8/10.\n\n","January 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","27","45","5","2"

Problem is the game is just ok. There are tons of different game types  but, with no -one really playing anything but, TDM and if your lucky a few in DOM you don't get to experiance the game and all it's options. Activisions peer to peer match making is still the biggest joke since it was introduced in MW2. PC versions of any fps multi-player needs dedicated servers. Players want a sense of security against hackers. Automated anti-cheat systems standing alone coupled with no ability to choose with whom and where you play is frustrating. It's like buying a car that your never allowed to drive.  I would recommend waiting to see if the Dedicated servers that are "in the works" become a reality.  If they don't put in dedicated servers don't waste your money. Just let COD finally die.\n\nSo, some  time has past and Call of Halo: Bunnyhopping lagfare is still not supporting dedicated servers. Well they have dedicated servers......according to an artical I read this means that Activision has servers dedicated to  only running this game with their unpresadented peer to peer match making system.....Ahem !!...

On the brighter side, some of the guns that were super bad are now actually usable and skill based matchmaking, which was hideously broken, was removed.\nOne step forward, six back. This game is dead to me.\n\nNo dedicated servers meaning CONSTANT connection issues, "Skill"-based matchmaking (aka. if you had a KDR above 2 in the previous lobby, you WILL get matched up with prestige master tryhards, even if you just had one single lucky game), an "OK" campaign (boring storyline and characters, but atleast the shooting is fun), Sledgehammer Games is very secretive and silent about this game and upcoming patches.\n\nAll this being said, i would love this game to death if they only added dedicated servers and removed the "skill"-based matchmaking. The gunplay is fun, twitchy, fast, as CoD should be, but the added mobility just adds a whole different level of fun to the game. You can actually jump away from gunfire if you are being shot at, which just blew my mind, compaired to old CoD's where the first person who shot won the gunfight 110% of the time.\n\nI'll leave this review with a "Would not Recommend" for now, since there are other FPS games out there that you could be playing instead of this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfzM/recommended/209650/","rfzM","rfzm ↑","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rfzM/","626 products in account","If you're looking at the steam store page for this, you'll see that most review are either "ITS ♥♥♥♥ IT SUCKS"  or "IT IS AWESOME" ... So lets hope this review is  a bit more informing.\n\nIts another COD. If you've enjoyed the previous ones, you'll probably enjoy this. Has a new aspect to it with the exo-suit, allowing you to jump, dodge etc, overall an interesting feature that i enjoy.\n\nAs with previous CoD/Activision releases, this has a fully deranged DLC-scheme going on. However, with AW its even worse, they went 100%  :goblin:  with this one.  I can't remember when i last saw a more disgusting, money-grabbing DLC scam in a "f2p" title even. Basically, AW has this operator system were you can customize your characters armor, helmet, boots, gloves and so on. Its pretty neat and i always welcome stuff like this - but it turns out you have to pay for pretty much every possible skin there is. Some times you can recieve these items in crates after winning a round, but then they have a timer, after which they will expire. If you want to keep them for longer, you'll need to pay. Yeah, sounds like something out of an obscure f2p-p2w title, nothing that should ever be in a AAA - release. Same thing goes with weapons, multiple guns are DLC-only (I can't tell yet if these are op making this fully ptw) and you can recieve these guns in loot crates, but upon clicking it a link opens to dlc store in steam overlay (really? :goblin:)\n\nAnd, following the line of every other cod game ever, it has very few maps included, you are instead supposed to buy DLC map packs (big surprise) but from what my friend who owns the map pack says,  dlc's have completely divided the community, making it impossible to ever find a game on anything other than original non-dlc maps.\n\nSpeaking of finding games, it seems this is pretty much impossible to do on anything other than TDM. The game offers different game modes, but its only TDM that is playable - everything else will result in "NO GAMES FOUND". As of writing this review, the game is several months old, but it is still the latest cod to have been released, and it does have a lot of players. From what i've learned, this 'no games found' thing is a bug since the last patch which was 1½ month ago. This is pretty annoying, since you are most likely only buying this for the MP.\n\nLike with most COD titles, it does not have any dedicated servers, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for any pc game. It also means you can end up in a laggy game if its host with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ connectinon, although that hasn't been too much of a problem for me.\n\nI haven't really played this that much, although i did play on a friends account prior to buying so i have a bit more experience than my hours listed here.\n\nIt doesn't have that many weapons or maps. The weapons that exist have variating models and sights, for the most part they are okay. The small amount of maps has always been a problem with every cod and it is this time as well. It is obvious that Activison are forcing people to purchase map packs, but its just backfiring on them, when it turns out that these DLC packs are worthless when you cannot play them..  Sure, Battlefield games doesn't have many maps either, but in those cases the maps are larger, plus they're destructible, making them much more re-playable. In the case of AW, i found most maps to be pretty boring looking and not that fun, with a few exceptions.  Activision (and not only them)  need to get through their tiny heads that map packs is not a good type of dlc, not even for them. All it does is divide the playerbase and causes people to stop playing.\n\nSpeaking of DLC,  did i mention how much of it there is? The price of this game is 59-69€/$(!) depending on your region. Then there is DLC on steam for a total of 186,08€ (!!!). So yeah, this game is essentially a huge scam.  I bought this for 20€ on a sale, and for that i guess it could be worth, but i wouldn't recommend anyone to pay a single cent more than that.\n\nTalking graphics, there isn't really much to say. Looks like other cods. It is quite demanding though, so its obviously not properly optimized.\n\nRounds are by default very short. Timers are on 10 min but often they end before that because the kill/score count is very low. I 'd rather see much longer games.\n\nLeveling system is similar to the rest of the series, i.e you level up and then there is prestige. I personally never liked that system.\n\nGame has FOV option up to 90. FPS seems to be locked at 91, something to keep in mind if you're on 120/144hz. Don't know of any fix to this.\n\nI haven't touched the sp yet, as i get these for the mp only. I'm guessing its another scriptfest with semi-cringe story, but i'll get to it eventually.\n\nI do have some positive things to say; first, this game has a offline vs bots mode, which is something very positive. Not only can you practice in there or whatever, but more importantly, that means this game will still be playable in the future. Surely not nearly as enjoyable as real mp, but the deal with cod is that they're pretty much seasonal games like fifa etc, once the next game is out this one will become obsolete.\nAnother positive aspect is the exo-suit mechanics that open up for fastpaced parkour-ish gameplay. Some might not enjoy it though, but i thought it was alright.\nThe character customisation would have been a thing on this list, but since its too much based on DLC its not as great as it could've been.\n\nThats also the overall feeling you get when you try this out - it could have been so much better, but quality isnt as important as quick and easy profit.\n\n\nTL;DR-  Don't pay more and 20€   And also do not buy after BO III is released, since this will be dead by then.","August 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","13"

Almost all weapons in this game do low damage with a high rate of fire.....they all feel like SMGs and a big thing for me is the sound, they dont sound threatening or have any beef to them, ive bought toy guns for my little cousins that sound more bad @$$, the machine guns also all sound the same or atleast close enough as to where you cant tell them apart...if you want to know what they sound like just put your lips together and blow out air, kind of like a machine gun sound you would make as a kid....thats what they sound like\n\nnow i could go on but im going to cut it off here, it feels like any of the last call of dutys and starts out making you feel the same to, you will enjoy it at the start and think that all the bad reviews are wrong but id say around level 30 you will become bored of it and wish you hadnt dropped the money on it like i have, they really need to put some time into their next game, which we know they wont, they probably already have a new game in the making that is the same as the rest, which is sad because there hasnt been a great call of duty in a long time\nand well....thats the review","December 3, 2014","false","8.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

So it could pick up people from Canada and California and throw them onto servers in Florida if it theoretically ran out of "closer" dedicated servers?  Also, the option to change the minimum latency via a config file from "800" to "200" (apparently they believe 800ms latency is just fine) makes the game run quite a bit smoother.\n\nAs I do not know when I am in a dedicated or peer to peer game, I can't really attest to the quality of their dedicated servers; however, they seem pretty bad.  Having played Counter-Strike since the early 2000s on everything from dial-up to my current internet 300ms can be quite consistent and latency to servers around the U.S. is usually great.  Currently, I get about 50-100ms latency from Arkansas to Dallas, 100-150 to East or West Coast; assuming I set the minimum limit to 200, that's still a fair margin for it to run pretty well.  Also, I have not experienced the lack of ability to log on at all in a while, but I have experienced quite a few other "network" (or otherwise) issues.  The "minimum latency" limit should probably be 200ms (unless you live in a rural area with 3mbps DSL or something) or at most 400ms (their lag correction isn't entirely awful...... sometimes......), but with the fix it is certainly more playable.  Given the current network problems however, I would still not recommend it as quite often it just doesn't work (and it keeps crashing on my friend's laptop / entirely crashing my friend's laptop).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:  As of now, getting the following error any time I try to connect to Multiplayer:\n"The Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare service is not available at this time. Please try again later."\nGiven that this breaks the main functionality of the game, I cannot recommend it.  Otherwise, given my review below, I would be able to recommend it, if only to a small extent.\n\nEdit 2:  This only happens intermittently, but is a pretty big problem, and many of its occurences have seemingly been overlooked by support staff (from what I found online in reviews and forum posts).  Many seem to have gotten the response that the servers are full, which makes little sense considering this is part of the largest FPS franchise currently out.  Unless occurences of this are permanently fixed, I will still not recommend this game.\n\n\nOriginal Review\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nMain point:  I recommend this game for how different a small addition of movement can make a "generic CoD game" feel not so generic.  If any of the issues below scare you off, buying it probably would not be a good idea; however, I have found parts of it somewhat enjoyable, if only because it is new, and other parts as frustrating as I would expect.\n\n\nAfter playing through the entire campaign, I'm a little disappointed: they give you tons of "new toys" (at least mostly new to the Call of Duty franchise) but don't give you many, if any in most cases, options to choose how you go about a mission.  At least the Black Ops 2 story line had "multiple outcomes"; regardless, it is a CoD game and not much to expect anyway.  What you can expect from this game is a multiplayer variant with a lot of people:  Whether the multiplayer is good or bad, there will probably be a lot of players.  The biggest problem I've seen with multiplayer is a lack of dedicated servers, and I actually like everything they've done with the game, except for the lack of dedicated servers.\n\nMost games I join my latency skips between "4 bars" and "1 bar."  Given that I'm playing on an AMD FX 8320, and seeing that this was designed for the AMD 8-core APUs in consoles, my computer should function as a host perfectly.  On the other hand, my wife's computer, running a Core i3-3240, can run some maps at the max 91fps but runs other maps well into the 40s.  The problem I would see is that it may be possible for some "minimum required specification" computers to get host when their computer may not be able to functionally handle the game by itself at 60fps+, which would then cause other players to lag miserably (I doubt this actually happens often, but throwing it out there as a possibility).  On the other hand, I'm running on a 150mbit download / 20mbit upload internet connection; I used to play Modern Warfare 2 - Black Ops 2 on a 3mbit down / 768kbit up DSL connection, and sometimes I would get host - people would lag badly.  While some people on a 3mbit DSL connection may get host, I doubt that happens very often, but is also a possibility.  Instead, I would expect that the player base of this game on PC is small enough that I'm playing with people from Canada half the time (actually, I know that has happened quite a few times).  I live in Arkansas, far enough away from Canada to be a bit of an issue in terms of latency, especially seeing as most CoD games accept 150-200ms latency as being "good" or "4 bar."  In that respect, most of the multiplayer games I play are excessively laggy and sometimes unplayable.\n\nThe other issue I have with this game is simply the cost of the Season Pass:  Why is it so high?  Maybe they will release six maps in each DLC?  If I decide that my latency issues even out a bit, I may purchase it to continue playing with a "larger player base" than otherwise; however, it may be better to stick with an older CoD game with dedicated servers: The exo suits don't provide an entirely game changing environment, and most successful people are successful dependent upon their geographical location, the geographical location of their opponents, and accuracy, sometimes completely disregarding attempts at exo movement.\n\nWith all of that said, this game is where CoD should be going (with the exception of a significant lack of dedicated servers): New stuff and different ideas based on the same generic shooter layout.\n\n\nSome other issues with this game include:\nFull download is around 40-50GB, which took very little time for me but would take a day on my mom's connection.\nHigh RAM requirement, and actually uses it (at least 8GB, although 16GB will help)\nHigh VRAM requirement ("Normal"/"Medium" textures run my gtx 780 3GB to max, "Extra" probably needs 6GB to function smoothly)\nLack of a FPS cap in Campaign (odd complaint, but Vsync typically introduces extra latency while a generic FPS cap would prevent my graphics card from getting excessively hot for no reason at all)\nLong loading times on a 7200rpm HDD (smooths out after a few matches, but seems very excessive)\nLoading issues on a 5400rpm HDD (generic laptop HDDs don't like this game)\n\nNice things to say:\nRelatively low computer requirement to play the game, with the exception of at least a quad core for larger maps (an AMD Athlon 740 would suffice, it plays well on my friend's a10-5750m; i3-3xxx series are not quite sufficient at least for 1080p)\nExo survival is okay\nCampaign is okay (not long enough)\nMultiplayer is much better than what I've come to expect from CoD games (but needs dedicated servers)\nIt runs very well on PC in regards to fps (COUGHGhosts?COUGH)","November 5, 2014","false","7.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Multiplayer could be great. I wouldnt know.\n\n\nNo this game is not worth $60 (How much its selling at the time of the review) Yes it's worth $20 (What I bought it for).\n\nThe campaign is traditional CoD with some cool gadets tacked on. Its a bland predictable storyline of a bunch of burly white dudes in the army that must do something brave and even defile their own allegences to join or become a super elite soldier.\n\nIts fun gunplay and actually has a couple decent stealth missions with cool new guns, but other than that its meh.

It's like fabreeze. You're blindfolded, put into your room but it smells freaking different.\n\nThe Exosuits gave a new feeling to the game making the already fast pace style into a super fast pace style. The guns are a bit more innovative along with the new attatchment.\n\nStoryline and gadgets during the playthrough were actually pretty fun thought it felt short. (loved the sniper turret)\n\nThe only problem I had was that the maps were all mid to short ranged (AND LIMITED). more sniper maps!\n\nThe new mode uplink is like a mixture of basketball and quidditch but it would be more fun to only be able to score if you throw it.\n\nfor a $59.99 game I personally wouldn't buy it if I only knew it would feel this incomplete but hey I guess thats what they do now a days right? spend another 60 on the expansions >.>","November 9, 2014","false","12.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But definitely missing key aspects of earlier COD, such as balance, survivability, slaying, and functional scorestreaks. That aside, there are many bugs for PC users, and noticable lag in kill cams.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the worst COD I have played, and I have played all since COD4.\n\nThat being said. This game's main feature is exo movements, but it is argueable whether or not the movements contribute to fun gameplay. The increased mobility adds a new element and quicker game pace, but I often find there is seldom tactical use of dashing and much more dash and jump spamming. Even if you do use the dash as a way to dodge bullets, it is rare that it will work due to the heavy amount of lag comp in the game. Dashing quickly behind a corner as you are being shot it will often result in you dying anyway. Then as you watch the kill cam, everything will be a second behind what you saw on your screen. This is a major problem in this game and often ruins any fun I am having.\n\nGuns and perks have little balance, and this COD has less balance than any other COD I have played. Even earlier games with stopping power had worse balance than this COD. Blast suppressor removes the exo movement ping on the mini map, This makes Blast suppressor necessary, which essentially removes any stretegic gameplay aspect. You will die from behind countless times wondering how the enemy even flanked you without any warning. On top of this, footsteps are nearly silent. Enemy callouts were supposed to make up for this but they do little. On top of this they made it so you can have a stealth perk in every tier. Low profile is overused making UAV essentially worthless.\n\nAll of these things combined with map design make choke points non existent. One of the major advertising points for AW was that they had 3 lane maps, but with the exo movements, terrible spawns, and abundance of stealth perks, the choke points have been almost eliminated. Spawn trapping has been almost removed from the game, except in a few levels where you can basically kill them as soon as they spawn. Spawn trapping has been a viable and effective method in many CODs and always added a way to control their spawn point and yours meaning you would not have enemies sneaking up behind you ruining your streak. Without that in this game, getting streaks is very difficult.\n\nSpeaking of streaks, they essentially nerfed streaks hard. They decreased how easy it is to gain streaks, and decreased how effective streaks are. In domination (known for having sturdy spawn points in previous cods), you only get 50 points towards a streak per kill, 150 per point capture, and 125 for each defense kill (kill enemy capturing point) and attack kill (kill while you capture point). This means playing the slayer role is worthless.\n\nDon't believe the hype in this game. I think it is even worse than ghosts was aside from increased mobility. The time to kill is brutal and feels horrible when you add the lag comp. I see this game as being a favorite of kids, but if you like any amount of stretegic, planed game play, then don't play this. It is at best a mosh pit of chaos with little order.","November 25, 2014","false","3.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

New game mechanics, new weapons types, interesting level design, You can change FOV, it has dozens of graphical options to tweak to get the best mix of performance and looks you want, and a campaign which has some novel new concepts (Sonic bombs to dampen all of the sound around you).\n\nUnfortunately though the developers don't seem to truly get the PC market. P2P connections for multiplayer is not acceptable. It works for 1v1 games like Starcraft 2, but not for twitch based shooter games. For one player (The host) he has up to a second advantage on all of his oppontents. For other players we are instead treated to a slide show of characters popping around the screen, bullets coming out of thin air before a model appears in its place seconds later. You'll be jumping over a building only to suddenly be standing where you had jumped from. Clear a deadly gap and move forward, only to be suddenly falling to your death as you now didn't make the jump.\n\nI played this game with a group. 4 On the east coast US, and one of us in England. You get one guess who the host was chosen to be. There is no separation of players what so ever. Players in California will be pitted against those in Russia. Pings are listed in bars like we were still in console. 5 bars (Full strong connection) Is equivalent to a 140 ping or less. That's right. 10 ping or 140 are both "Strong connections" according to Treyarch. Though you will rarely get a game full of 5 bars, generally one or two 5s and the rest 1 or 2 bars as it connects you to a game in Austrailia.\n\nThis could be a good game with dedicated servers and a server browser, but instead the COD series continues its downward spirals with nonsensicle completely unthought through bad decisions and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porting choices. Why go to such great lengths to give us graphical controls and not dedicated servers? Figure that out and you'll discover why Call of Duty continues to sink lower into the abyss of mediocre gaming.","February 13, 2015","false","7.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you consistently enjoy Call of Duty games, You'll enjoy this one too. But if you want something genuinely new from the franchise, you'll have to keep waiting. This game plays and feels very similar to previous games of the series.\n\nSingleplayer Campaign:\nThe visuals are much improved over Ghosts, with some beautifully rendered cutscenes. The voice acting is very good, with a great performance by Kevin Spacey. The writing however leaves a lot to be desired. There is some added RPG elements with the ability to collect experience and upgrade your character's skills as you progress through the story. The amount of customization that can be done is very little however and should have come to COD a lot sooner.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe only thing new here is the movement abilities. The maps are still small. The amount of players in a game is small. They did add "Ground War" to this game with slightly more players on a map, but it's a joke compared to Battlefield's 32v32. The wait times for certain game modes are very long (Most everyone plays Deathmatch or team deathmatch). The available weapon pool seemed to get smaller, unfortunately. I do have to say the Multiplayer as a whole is a little better and a little more fun than recent installments of the series. But not by much.\n\nBottom line: Not much new here. It is Call of Duty done decently with a slight futuristic spin.\n\n7/10","November 23, 2014","false","16.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

(SP only review)\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare (CODAW) is the first COD game I would consider great COD game in 5 years. Instead of the recent “just get through the game, get the achievements and never touch it again”, I found myself saying “just one more level …”. There is CODMW1, CODMW2, and CODAW. Everything in between can be ignored.\n\nThe plot is refreshing, focusing on contractors and companies involvement in the modern day war and the effects of it. Combined with an imaginative array of plausible (“I can totally see that device being a thing in 5-10 years”) equipment and titanfall-like gameplay, the game kept me engaged and excited throughout the game. Opposed to recent COD games, the technology used varies widely and instills a great sense of wonderment and “wow”.\n\nGameplay and controls are what you’d expect from a COD shooter - clean, crisp and just enough to do what you want without being overly complicated. I will state, however, that during the airplane and hoverbike level parts it is much easier to use a controller than a keyboard. The controller provides fine control when maneuvering while the keyboard is an all-or-nothing turn -- making it very difficult with just a keyboard. There are certain parts of the game where your controls reverse, confusing you, but I found it more immersive given the events of the game and the confused state of the character in the game.\n\nAudio quality in this game is fantastic. The fidelity is far above and beyond any game I have played recently. For example, when something explodes, you don’t just hear the explosion, but the individual pieces and dirt chunks falling as well. It’s incredible and something you really need to experience. Voice acting in this game is top notch, and Kevin Spacey kills his role as “Irons” in the game -- it really felt like an interactive movie with a top-notch cast.\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful. Sledgehammer really took advantage of the PC for this game, and went over the top with the renders. The game is photo-realistic when playing at ultra settings, easy hitting high FPS on a 690GTX. It’s good to see a COD series address texture and resolution / graphics issues that have plagued the PC versions of these games for so many years.\n\nThere are a few technical problems with the game:\n\nFor some reason, shadow maps are not properly supported -- under shadow options, there are two optional choices:\nCache Sun Shadow Maps\nCache Spot Shadow MapsEven on my 690GTX, with these options enabled, all of the textures were blurry and the framerate was easily in the 5’s. Disabling these options removed the low quality textures and restored a high (60FPS) framerate.\n\nLoad times are insane. Even on my samsung 840pro 512GB, it was easily 2-3 minute load times -- so long that I actually thought I crashed a few times before I got used to it. I attributed this to the huge size and detail of the levels -- which are on the scale of Battlefield 3 and 4 maps. There are some remedies in game (such as loading during cutscenes) but be prepared for a long wait, especially if you are using platters.\n\nI feel like this is a new side of COD that I haven’t seen in a long time, and Sledgehammer really nailed it here. Anyone who loved playing Modern Warfare 1 and 2, will love to play this game.\n\n*** I've moved to the 10 point rating system, as I now belong to the Unbiased Reviews group. I'm moving all future reviews to be inline with that groups standards.","November 4, 2014","true","14.7"," 199 of 382 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","199","382","0","1"

There was ALOT of lag when i first started to play but i simply changed the settings and there was little to no lag. But after the second patch came out, MOST OF THE LAG WAS GONE. I can finally set my graphics and shaders to max and experience little to no lag at all.But besides the lag, the overall multiplayer is fun and fast-paced.\n\nCustomization - The customization in this game is insane, This is the most customization ever put into a CoD game ever and i love it. Before, you could only customize your weapon and emblems n such. But now you can fully customize your character, and im not talking just about the camos, or little things like that. Im talking about THE ENTIRE CHARACTER. Glasses,Helmets,Chestplates,Shirts,Pants,Kneepads,boots, and even your exo itself. You can get insane types of gear by completing challenges or by getting supply drops.\n\nIf you're wanting a fast paced and high-customization type of game, CoD: AW is the game for you.\n","December 26, 2014","true","8.6"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","17","30","4","0"

But once you actually start looking at the details of the surroundings when the game starts the ingame graphics are actually of poor design. You are being played.\n\nThere is a lot of variation in gameplay, however Sledgehammer/Activision still thinks each gamer is mentally damaged or delayed in its development so the screen is filled with messages where to go and which button to push. And they are right, because as long gamers keep buying and accepting these kind of games and also accept the insane amount of money one has to spend for each dlc in order to play some multiplayer we will not see a lot of good games soon in this area.\n\nAnother hype not being able to fulfill my expectations.\n\nThe worst part is that this game has some really bad designed levels a for gameplay.\nLike shooting the engine of a rocket before its launches.\nPeople actually had to post on Youtube video's explaining how maybe it should be done so you could pass this level as apparently many people seem to have problems with this level my best guess is someone did not do his job correctly.\nAnd of course a chase with some button bashing which is nice for kiddies but I am over 40 so please !!! and especially when it works like c.r.a.p.\n\nNice for 15 EUR but not worth above.","May 1, 2015","false","22.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have a pretty good gaming laptop so please don't say that it's my PC. I ran a test on rar labs or whatever it is called and it passed.\n\nMy advice is to play the game on free weekends and/or get it at a good sale price. Don't buy for the full price unless you want to enjoy lagging for the price of 60 dollars.  I never played the campaign because I don't care for it, but I have played around 17 hours of multiplayer, which I think is a good reasonable time to write a review. Check my profile for proof, it's public visible.\n\nThe only GOOD part that I LOVE about this game is the zombies. Althought optimization is still poor, I love zombies and have been playing them since 2012 on bo1.\n\nHopefully this game gets better so I can make a thumbs up.

There are no dedicated servers, fps is locked at 91, and some of the maps are unoptimized. To top that all off there aren't too many people playing Advanced Warfare so finding a game can take a while.

I love this game. I spent more than 1000 hours playing it. However I would "NOT" recommend this game for gamers in my country or my region, i.e. SEA. I am playing this game from Bangkok, Thailand. From my observing, I am now playing mostly on dedicated servers which supposing to be good. However 99% of my matches, I have been assigned to distant servers like GameServer Choopa.net Japan, some servers in China and Korea, and that make my "best" ping is 120 ms with 3-bar. This is ridiculous. How fast of domestic network of these countries. As a result, relatively laggy every game. I can feel when I press left mouse, my first bullet delays and I alway shoot enemy's shadow in killcam. Only gun I can use now is S12, try to get close and wish lucky 1 shot kill. Even playing with friends, majority of use like 10 mixed of players from India and Thailand (me), 2 players from Japan, most of our games were hosted on Japan servers still.\n\nComparing to CS source and, not so like, Battle Field 4, my pings are around 50 ms. Yeah domestic players still rule these games but that I'm still in competitiveness. WTF of this COD AW latency >+120 ms. It is too much.\n\nSledgehamme, you are selling expensive game with cheap architecture. You said you have low tolerate for cheating and unfair play. But what about unfairness game design you made for not-major-market countries. We, Thai fallows and players in the region, bought this same price with players in first class countries, so please treat us fair.\n\nPS. Sorry for my English. I'm ESL. And if you want to investigate about your game connectivities, please use windows' "Resource Monitor" -> "Network" tab -> select "s1_m64_ship.exe".\n\nExamples of lag is here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Naoisan/recommended/209650/\n\n** minor corrections ***\n\nก่อนอื่น อย่าเพิ่งเข้าใจผิด ผมเล่นเกมนี้มากว่า 1000 ชั่วโมง ผมชอบเกมนี้มาก แต่สำหรับคนไทย หรือเล่นเกมจากประเทศในโซน SEA บางประเทศ ผมไม่แนะนำให้เล่นเกมนี้ ผมเล่นเกมนี้จากกรุงเทพฯ ผู้เล่นเกม COD ส่วนใหญ่เรียกร้องให้มี game server หรือ dedicate server ซึ่งผมสังเกตุว่า หลังๆ นี้ ผมเล่นบน servers ไม่ใช่ใครซักคนในเกมเป็น host ซึ่งก็น่าจะเป็นเรื่องดี แต่ ... 99% ของเกมที่ผมเล่น กลับต้องไปเล่นบน servers ในญี่ปุ่น ใน จีน หรือในเกาหลี (เราเลือกไม่ได้) ทำให้ ping ต่ำสุด (ดีที่สุด) ที่เคยเห็นคือ 120 ms. มันมี Servers ใน Singapore กับ Hong Kong ซึ่ง pings จะอยู่ที่ 60ms แต่ ไม่ถึง 1% ที่มีโอกาสเล่นบน servers นี้\n\nค่านี้มีผลยังไง มันทำให้เราเล่นช้ากว่าคนที่อยู่ในประเทศของ servers หรือใกล้เคียง เวลายิง จะรุ้สึกได้ว่ามันจะหน่วงนิดนึง ก่อนกระสุนนัดแรกจะยิงออกไป จะยิงใครสักคนเป็นเรื่องยากมาก ยิงจนหมดแม็กยังไม่ตาย แต่โดนสวนไม่กี่นัด ตาย ใน killcam จะเห็นว่าเรายิงตามหลังศัตรูเสมอ\n\nผมเคยเล่น CS source กับ Battle Field 4 ค่า ping ที่เล่นประมาณ 50 ms. ซึ่งก็ยังเสียเปรียบผู้เล่นที่มีค่า ping ต่ำกว่า แต่ก็ยังไม่เลวร้ายเท่ากับเกมนี้ เมื่อเราจ่ายเงินซื้อเกมราคาเท่าๆ กับคนในประเทศอื่น ก็ควรได้บริการที่เท่าเทียมกัน เมื่อเกมไม่ได้ออกแบบมาให้เล่นจากไทย ผมจึงไม่แนะนำเกมนี้","July 15, 2015","false","21.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have an i7 laptop with ati m265 graphics and 16gb ddr3 and i can't play this game. In order to play this game with smooth framerates, you have to enable "Shader preload" in settings. Only problem is, once you do that, it then takes about 5 minutes at the loading screen, then several multiplayer maps wont even load. If you disable the "shader preload", then every map seems to load okay but the first 2-3 minutes of every game are full of freezes and stutters. if you can deal with it for the first few minutes then you may be able to enjoy the second half of the game. Terrible, poorly optimized for pc. Although, your system may run this game flawlessly. Do you really want to take that gamble? Im sure all they need to do is patch but when will they? I do not recommend this game until it is fixed. Just play the console version until then.

I have an i7 laptop with ati m265 graphics and 16gb ddr3 and i can't play this game. In order to play this game with smooth framerates, you have to enable "Shader preload" in settings. Only problem is, once you do that, it then takes about 5 minutes at the loading screen, then several multiplayer maps wont even load. If you disable the "shader preload", then every map seems to load okay but the first 2-3 minutes of every game are full of freezes and stutters. if you can deal with it for the first few minutes then you may be able to enjoy the second half of the game. Terrible, poorly optimized for pc. Although, your system may run this game flawlessly. Do you really want to take that gamble? Im sure all they need to do is patch but when will they? I do not recommend this game until it is fixed. Just play the console version until then. Also, people already cheat online on this game, so be prepared to deal with that.\n\nBTW: Single player seems to work fine (with shader preload enabled) if you don't care about the 5-8 minute loading time.","February 20, 2015","false","25.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Before, you were on a rail, but mostly in charge of what you did.  Not here.  Sure you get to pull the trigger in lots of places, but when it comes to cut scenes you lose control.  The game takes control and you're simply watching.\n\nFurther, when you do have something like the grapple hook, it works on some roof edges, but not others.  Some rails, but not others, some enemies, but not others.  In other words, it's scripted when you can use that too.\n\nControlling the airplane says "invert the controls in the options"...but in fact there's no mention of inverting plane controls in the options.  I gritted my teeth and got through the mission anyway, but it was *no* fun.  The /mouse/ should have controlled the direction of the pointing of the plane, and w/s the throttle.  What a thorough waste of a scene!\n\nOh, and then there's the game instruction "Press and hold UNBOUND to slide when sprinting".  Really? What the hell are they doing introducing a new move in the last scene of the whole game?\nThe only way to get through that scene is to actually slide when sprinting.  But you don't know what action is desired here as the action isn't bound to a key.  I figured out it's 'Crouch'. Okay, fine.  Assign 'V' to it...no good.  Somehow the W and V got mixed up, so that I wasn't actually sprinting.  It was only when I assigned Tab to crouch as well that I was able to do it.  I was hugely angry by the end of that scene.\n\nAfter the open-world exploits of the Assassin's creed series, or Elder Scrolls, and Shadows of Mordor this simply cannot compare.  Each of those games I've had 100's of hours of gameplay.  Elder Scrolls I've had over 500!?!  This game is a quick dose of adrenaline, and then you're done.\n\nThings I could say in support of this game: the graphics are good overall.  The facial animations are some of the best I've seen. The light sub-surface scattering really made faces look like faces instead of polygons.  Well done!  Also it was cool to see Kevin Spacey in this game.  The facial animations manage to bring his character to life in this game.\n\nBut that brings me to a final graphic glitch: most of the cutscenes with the fantastic animations have sound that played up to 1/2 a second out of sync.  When it worked, it was really very good.  When it didn't work, the illusion was completely shattered.  Think a very badly overdubbed foreign movie.  Yuck.\n\nSince I don't much care for Multi-player shenanigans, that's me done for full price for 10 hours of game play and equal parts of frustration and fun.\n\nOn sum I did enjoy the game, but it's not enough of the kind of game that I like to play.  This is *way* overpriced.","November 6, 2014","false","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You will find yourself randomly doing crappy because of lag, and then occasionally doing extremely well because the host was actually decent or close to you and far away from others.\n\nDo not buy this game if you have an 2 GPU AMD graphics card setup. The COD developers not only do not program their games for dual GPU setups (either separate cards or on 1 card), but the games actually run even worse.\n\nIf you contact support or look online for help, the solution? Disable SLI / crossfire.\n\nI was a fan of COD until they F*ed it up and made the game run like crap on my 2GPU setup... all because I'm a minority when it comes to their customers.\n\nThere are also certain maps that run like crap for lots of players, so they are never voted on to play, because everybody gets slideshow type of framerates.\n\nLastly, I have a SSD and 16GB of ram, so I have my pagefile set to only 1024MB. When you do this, COD is so stupid, it actually pops up with "out of memory" errors because the developers did no custom coding from the console port in order to handle an actual 16GB of ram, instead they are trying to use the pagefile without exception.\n\nI may have a decent amount of hours playing the game, but that's only because I keep trying to get the game to work properly and keep hoping a misc. patch will fix my issues. Unfortunantly they never fix the slow down with my nice system.\n\nDispite Activisions claim to have 3 different developers working on the COD franchise, they have only gotten worse, and continue to release COD games that feel unfinished.\n\nPut your money into something like CS:GO where the community is supported, you have dedicated servers, a lot better choice of servers you can connect close to you, and the support isn't just ditched after a year because the next one in the series is churned out to make the devs. and publisher money.\n\nStay away from Call of Duty, Ghosts and AW. (other versions of the CoD series never had this problem.)\n\nStrongly do not recommend a purchase.","December 26, 2014","false","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

(this can be positive / negative depends on your taste).\n- FOV (field of view) locked at 65 (so some people can get motion sickness from this).\n- Linear story line (no branching decision / outcome).\n- Story is really predictable and unintuitive (5 to 6 hours length).\n\nMulti Player:\n+/- Fun and feel quite new with the boost / jet pack (this can be negative for some people, small maps + faster movement speed = getting killed from behind is really often).\n+ FOV can be change (max 90).\n+ Good range of options / settings for a CoD game.\n- Not many people playing it on PC at the moment, so it is quite hard to find other game type (in Aus here, I only can find people playing TDM or Domination).\n--- LAGFEST: yeah.... this is the biggest downfall for me, the lag is just so unbearable for me (getting killed while on my screen I was already behind the cover.... "normal").\n- P2P, no dedicated server.\n- Color bar for a connection status (why it is so hard to just put the ms number).\n\nIn conclusion I really can not recommend CoD AW at this moment, the lag is just too much for me to enjoy the multiplayer game and the single player is just not worth the price tag.","November 7, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The singleplayer has a more unique story compared to all the other COD (although it's quite similar to MW2) and the multiplayer's exo suits have made the game even better. There is a good options menu with a lot of detailed settings but the reason I don't recommend it is because of the intensive lag you get. I've got a high end rig (R9 290, I5 3570k) and the game lags where and when it shouldn't. I get above 60 FPS mostly and the FPS periodically drops to 50-60 fps which would be fine normally but it only goes down because it stutters. What's worse is the singleplayer. The SP itself is good but the lag you get on that is borderline unbearable. I've heard that this game suffers from 'memory leaks' or something so the more you play it, the more it lags (this might just be the singleplayer as it's the only thing I've experianced it on. I wasn't even on max settings (like I should have been able to run), I was on high, and it would lag (after a while like I said). The game is a much better PC port than some of the recent CODs *cough*  Ghosts  *cough* but the optisation or something is just causing it to lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥ (a lot of YouTubers with better graphics cards like JackFrags, who has a 780ti, also experiance these problems).

Но сейчас не об этом.\nВ первые дни после релиза игра мне понравилась, теперь когда я в неё играю, она до сих пор нравится. Разработчики создали хороший геймплей, интересную систему выпадения предметов (совсем не TF2), хорошие испытания и стимул выполнять их.\nБолее того, несмотря на тенденцию завышать системные требования, разработчики хорошо оптимизировали игру, мой ноутбук нормально тянул её почти без фризов, и не на самых минимальных настройках. Про стационарный комп и говорить нечего.\nНо в чём проблема? В эту игру играет мало игроков. И поиграть можно только на Командном бое (и лишь изредка на Доминировании). Но из за кого такая проблема? Из за самих игроков. Решение очевидно. Игра есть у многих в библиотеке Steam, но играют в неё почему то не многие. Вы сможете сделать сами эту игру пригодной для игр на всех режимах.\nНадеюсь этот обзор был убедительным и вы будете уделять хоть какое-то время на отличную игру. Сделайте пожалуйста репост, чтобы все его увидели.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI could not play this game long time because of unknown error (12), I "just" reinstaled game and solved it. But now i talk about something else.\nWhen I played AW first time, I liked it. Now I still like it. Developers make good gameplay, good items drop system (not like TF2), good challenges and incentive to complete them.\nMoreever, unlike other developers, which increase required power of PC, this game can be played on laptop, almost without freezes.\nBut what is the main problem? So little people play this game. It is possible to play only TDM and sometimes Domination. But this problem appeared because of players. Solution is obvious. Many people have AW in Steam library, but not many people play it. You can make yourself this game able to play any gamemode.\nI hope this review was convincing and you will spend some time for exelent game.

While I'm impressed with the graphics this game was released with (Caps at 1080 unfortunately). I am disappointed with the amount of bugs and Video graphic errors. So far if you go on the Advanced warfare forums, there are hundreds complaining of a video stutter. I just dropped $1900.00 on a new custom built gaming PC. Therefore I should NOT be getting these stutters.. But sadly I am. Not to mention that compared to Console, PC gamers were stiffed on certain features. Xbox one seemed to get Dedicated severs off the bat, however on PC (PC master race) we were not given the same privileges but were sold at the same price.\n\nIn conclusion, if there were a way I could get my money back, I would do it in a heartbeat. Day three of owning this game, It sucks.\n\nRating: 6/10","November 5, 2014","false","0.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

And storyline is litlle odd in some parts but if u put that aside It is a very fun SP game. avg. playtime ~7 hour.\n+ Drop system\n+ Clans are really nice\n+ Emblems/customization overall is great\n+ Graphics are pretty damn good (which I don't give a damn but some do )\n+ Gameplay is dynamic,fast and easy to learn.\n\nCONS\n------\n- MP: Call of Bunnyhopping Advanced Lagfare.\n- No dedicated servers.\n- Weapon balance is terrible. Assault Rifles are overpowered, Submachine guns are terrible. Heavy shield noobs everywhere!\n- There is a Laser Rifle called EM1, OP.\n- Hacks.Lots of, lots of hacks. If Activision wants to sell CoD on PC, they need to make it hack-free and take some strong precautions.\n- Delay, lags, ping issues. Some maps are laggy as hell. I sometimes shoot people and they kill me, when I watch my death cam I see my shots are missed. But I'm pretty damn sure that I hit those. It happens a lot and is frustrating.\n- Needs more weapon differentiation. Some weapons look/feel exactly the same and most Assault Rifles feel like SMG's.\n","December 17, 2014","true","8.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I loved all the new toys we get to play with and experience, but in the end it's still all the same.\n\nThe campaign is just as long as most CoD games with roughly 6 to 7 hours of gameplay in a single run.  Kevin Spacey stars in Advanced Warfare and is the head of an anti-terrorist / terrorist group entitled:  ATLAS.  ATLAS has all the advanced weapons, robotic suits, drones and chemical agents that you'll be using and/or fighting against throughout your play through.\n\nThe campaign will consist of you running and gunning through urban areas, going stealth, air missions, water missions and the sort.  All standard scenarios you're used to in CoD games.  Only this time with cooler weapsons and invisible technology.  If you like Call of Duty single player campaigns you'll like this one.  If not, then stay away.  It's more or less the same as always.\n\nI enjoy the single player Call of Duty's for what they are and I did have fun with this.  Recommended.

About the only game mode you can find a game in is team deathmatch, everything else will take hour to find a match.  I don't get it, maybe the servers suck, but it's as if there is no multiplayer.  Which sucks, because that's where the heart of call of duty games is.\n\nI like all the updates and new jump-packs and what not, but what good is a call of duty game if you can't play online, or have to wait hours to find a single game?","March 2, 2015","false","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This is easily the best COD in years! I've played maybe 2 hours of the single player but who cares about that right?  I have almost 80 hours in the multi-player and I am hooked...full stop hooked!\n\nThe class system is even more in depth than any other plus there is a supply drop system which drops rare weapons and armor mods which are purely cosmetic.  Imagine falling in love with a gun then getting a rare one that hits harder but maybe aims down the sights a little slower. Or a sub machine gun with better range but slower fire rate.  The possibilities in armor, weapons etc are almost literally endless.\n\nAnd now my number one favorite part of the game. The weapons, my god the weapons.  In Ghosts I struggled to find one I barely felt comfortable with, in this game I wish I had 20 create-a-classes.  The guns are just plain fun and they feel right.\n\nOn top of ALL that the gameplay is fantastic. The mobility is an absolute blast, a double tap of any directional keep will boost you about 8 feet in that direction.  This can be used to turn a corner must faster to put the drop on someone or even in mid air to dodge that sniper you just noticed.\n\nIf you've ever enjoyed a COD game online, buy this...now.","December 12, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This problem is the fact that you will hardly ever find anyone to play a match with, and if you do... you are on lucky son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, Oh wait, what's that? is that people asking me why nobody plays multiplayer?\nWell my friends, this is because of the terriable start up of the multiplayer!\nThe thing is that we were promised that we would have official servers even before the creation of this game... guess what still isn't here! You guessed right, the official servers!\n\nAnd now another thing that some people might say that I still agree with, is that the graphic's are soooooo much better!\nAnd also that the game is soooooo much more fun to play, even though it is just like all the other cods, but then again, it isn't, this is because in Single player you get so much more attached to the characters! unlike cod 4 mw, cod mw 2 and cod mw 3 where soap; yes the one that you use in the shower; nearly died in all ♥♥♥♥ing three of them!\nIn the first one your like "OMG is soap gonna die?????", and in the second one your like "HOLY ♥♥♥♥! jow does this guy cheat death so often!?" and in the third one... if you even felt the slightest bit sad or depressed when he died... I suggest that you go for some therapy! Cause there when he died I bet you about everyone that played the game was like this "YES!!!! YES!!!!! HE'S FINALLY DEAD!!!!!!! I FEEL NO REMORSE FOR THAT LITTLE DEATH CHEATING SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥!"\nBut in cod AW when Anox or Corvax dies... You become sad, this is because you became ever so attached to them!\n\nBut let's move on from there, I'm sure that you don't wanna hear all of my character insults.\nBut, I may aswell stop there before I write a book on how bad all the other cods were compaired to this one.\nAnd if you read up to this point, Congratualtions!!!!! I'm pretty sure that you have just wasted half an hour trying to figure out why nobody plays this game because YOU were too stupied to figure it out yourself! ;)\nBut for realz, if you are gonna buy this game...

It's visually stunning with some fun missions but nothing exactly challenging.\n\nThe multiplayer has had a lot of work put into it - realising this is their main moneymaker the developers have really made an effort to include as much DLC as possible both in and out of the season pass in order to make you spend more.\nThe multiplayer has NO dedicated servers, plenty of lag, and a lot of hackers. This makes the game a fun to play - yet highly irritating experience. Added to that, the PC version has a very low multiplayer fan base due to the ongoing issues including memory issues caused by updates and the ongoing wave of hackers. The ONLY playlist which is regularly populated is the mosh pit. However even on a moderate NAT setting you will often find you can only connect to one lobby if there are even enough people available to play.\n\nThe DLC is effectively rendered mute as a lot of players have already left the game leaving Season Pass holders like myself spending out ahead for the multiplayer maps but never getting into a lobby so being unable to play them.\n\nThe zombies addition is the only reason to buy the DLC. They really have put a new take on Zombies and is the primary reason to get this game. It isn't too difficult to find a match (albeit due to now being included in the base version of Call of Duty it is now full of idiots - thanks for getting me to pay out for something you then gave away for free!). There are plenty of hidden secrets and this instalment of Zombies will easily provide hours of game time.\n\n200+ hours spent playing multiplayer and 20+ on Zombies - it is definitely getting harder to find games as time goes on so hopefully this game will be able to turn itself around. However until that time I wouldn't recommend paying for this. (I got it free from buying a monitor and the season pass was dirt cheap from eBay)","April 27, 2015","false","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To my delight, there were still a good amount of people playing COD 4 online , and with that said,  I feel as though I never need to play the multiplayer of AW again, which makes me very happy.\n\nAlright, so I'm just going to review the multiplayer here, as I am sure the single player is good, but just more of the same COD style, but one of the main components of playing COD is multiplayer, so that's what I am going to focus on.  I really found it insufferable.  The game play seemed just about the same as it did in COD 4 and the other MW's with some obvious changes such as the guns and exo suits which really just made the game worse.\n\nI found all of the exo suits dumb and just not fun.  Multiplayer was easy, I had never played before and was close to if not top fragging, but it just got boring very quickly.  The maps weren't very fun, and the exo suits were more annoying than anything.  When trying to strafe left or right, if you double click you are propelled in that direction, people are flying all around the map because of how much you can jump with the exo suit, it just got to be too much.  Now if you like that stuff, then you might like this game, but with all of that, I'd rather just go play Halo.  They also added laser guns which made the game play terrible.\n\nIt seemed as though someone could just hold the laser down and it was pretty much a one shot kill in hardcore if they touched you with it.  So with players just holding it down, it just got to be annoying.  Truly, advanced warfare just seemed like more of the same COD with worse changes.  It's an expensive game that I felt wasn't worth the money.  I'd much rather get any of the other COD's or even get 3 copies of COD 4 and give the others as gifts.  It's not a bad game, just not nearly as fun as any of the other COD's and definitely not worth the money. The changes in the gameplay are not significant enough or fun enough to make this game worth getting.  The franchise has become a cash cow and it is becoming evident in the games which are being put out.  At least they attempted to try something different with AW but it just falls flat on its face.\n\nSimply put, this game is not worth the money.\n\nAlso, its 55 Gigs of space I will be very happy to get back.  Hell, I’d rather use every kb of that space storing Randy Newman songs where he describe sthe sounds of Honey Boo Boo’s stomach growling.  That would be a better use of the space than keeping AW installed…\n","March 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","0"

When I first saw AW I was really excited for it. The exosuits with the new movements really caught my attention so i bought the game and played it for a few weeks and saw that it was really fun and had a good amount of players so i bought the Season Pass. Then it all went downhill from there. With every patch(When we got them which is hardly ever) the game became worse and worse. Gun balance got thrown off,Graphics optimization fell,Server connectivity got worse and worse and with that the player base fell hard. Sledgehammer games literally gave 0 ♥♥♥♥s about the PC verison basically copy pasting the patch notes from the consoles and ripping out content (Advanced supply drops arrived but we couldnt and still cant buy them) So to Sledgehammer. Great concept horrible execution. Hopefully BO3 will be the game to bring CoD back up to decent.","June 17, 2015","false","13.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpcreaper/recommended/209650/","xpcreaper","XPC Reaper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpcreaper/","1293 products in account","One problem the Call of Duty titles have had over the years is the fact that everything is just so... Well, horizontal. The maps have two floors, you can jump three feet and the closest to skill kills you see is when someone spins three times in mid jump throws a throwing knife and just proves to you that they have yet to even hear the world "clitoris," let alone see one. The high pitched whines of people who don't understand the concept of audio feedback matched only by the high pitched whines of the people who seem to speak feedback fluently.\n\nIn this iteration, the tables seem to have turned. Barely anyone uses voice chat and for the first time in the series; verticality is a thing. Now you can react when someone fires a round into your back by jumping into the air and dashing behind them to turn the tables and deliver an oh-so-sweet revenge kill. You don't feel like just a bag of flesh anymore, you feel like a soldier and more often than not, a damn fine one. Gone are the days when you had to be a god to achieve the highest scorestreaks and getting a killstreak to kill ten people was the only way to get the next streak. You can (and I have) work your way up to an orbital gunship by simply marking out enemies with your recon drones and UAVs. No longer are you restricted to using the old fashioned Harrier, AC-130, Nuclear Strike if you want to achieve MVP status. In fact, killstreaks pale in comparison to objective play for score.\n\nThe weapons admittedly require a little bit of balancing. If you go head to head with some of the most used weapons, odds are you'll feel as if you were playing conkers and your opponent was using a crane and a Volkswagen Golf while you were stuck with the seed of a Horse Chestnut tree. But that's where the beauty of the games' multiplayer comes in. You aren't limited to only three doorways and a window to get where you need to go. If you take one round to the toe, you aren't dead for sure anymore. Your exosuit offers you the ability to counteract the failings of all your previous incarnations in the series. You can dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge to counter your foes; all while the world around you follows suit. There is new joy to be found in jumping into the air, plummeting two stories into the rear of an enemy team and unleashing a furious storm of explosion-propelled brass. You are both an object of death and a subject of it now; with your awareness, skill and reflex being the main thing to decide which you become.\n\nThe maps vary magnificently from an abandoned prison, broken for the most part but still with a functioning inmate tracking system (which you can use for your team if you are lucky enough to acquire it in a care package) to a multi-tiered holiday resort complete with swimming pool and the ability to fall off the edge to your death. But the glorious thing about each map is that you can always attack from the bottom, middle or top. If you go to the bottom level, you can almost always find a way to boost jump up to the middle and the top from there. This opens the game up to a new angle of attack. You have to be aware of what is below you, not just above you if you want to dominate the maps. Some maps are currently subject to some intense lag on some systems (particularly the maps Defender and Instinct); but the remainder work flawlessly.\n\nScorestreaks are fewer in this game but are easier to acquire and more variable as well. The addition of Scorestreak "Modules" has changed the way they are built, as you can decide just how your scorestreak will behave. If you want to have an orbiting gunship with a rocket turret which a second player on your team can control, it is doable. Your remote sentry guns can become self-targeting rocket or laser turrets which can engage targets in a 360 degree circle and your UAVs can paint your enemies on your HUD as a red silhouette visible through walls. You can even decide if you want certain killstreaks to retain the score you've earned towards them after death; all while you keep others as they were. The ability to persisently earn score towards a high value care package, while you still have your airstrikes, gunships and missile strikes earned per life is quite handy. You may notice I said four different kinds of streaks, which you can now have. There is a wildcard to have four scorestreaks on your class at once; which can make your progress towards the highest significantly easier if you can effectively combine your efforts.\n\nYou have thirteen points to allocate to your class and everything costs a point, so knowing what you do and don't use is very important now. If you never use your exo abilities such as a temporary riot shield, cloaking or faster movement; that point can be better invested in a second (or third) attachment for your primary weapon; or perhaps a missile launcher to counter those pesky UAVS and gunships. Your class is not far less limited with the thirteen points but without knowing what you work best with, it is useless to just spend them on anything. Your weapons can even have different variants; which change the stats or add a free weapon attachment at the cost of it being permanently attached. You can find these weapons in supply drops or awarded at 300 kills with the weapon the variant is for. If you found that a gun needs a boost in the rate of fire and doesn't need so much range; there is probably a variant you can acquire which will suit you.\n\nSupply drops are special awards given for completing daily challenges or play time; which can give you a remarkably powerful weapon, bonus experience for a set time or even a nice little outfit for your character. Every kind of unlock is divided into permanent loot (self explanatory) or one of three rarity values, which can be traded in for a a set amount of experience. The rarity is not dependent on your level or what you have unlocked; as you can unlock a rare weapon variant for a weapon unlocked at rank 50, even if your kill/death ratio is negative and your rank is nowhere near what you need to use the weapon.\n\nWhen you take all of these features and add them together; you get one of the most interesting and enjoyable Call of Duty titles in the series. It is exciting, different enough to be incredibly fun but still familiar enough to make it instantly playable and it's the best time I've had with a Call of Duty title since I used to play it with good friends. Even now, as a cripplingly lonely cynic, this game awakens the happy little mass-murdering psychopath that resides within us all.","December 31, 2014","true","13.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No.\nWill we show Activision that they shouldn't be afraid of changes being made? Yes, well, maybe.\n\nActivision won't see innovation as successful unless they make more profit than they did with the last title, currently, this is Ghosts, which is why this game will hopefully be such a tide-turner for the series, if the game turns a decent profit, we might just see some high quality, more fleshed out CoD titles in the future.\n\nActivision leads, most other publishers will follow in their wake, do we want more risky moves, like the gaming industry did in the past?\n\nRemember: We're the ones who can choose, using our wallets.","November 9, 2014","true","1.9"," 57 of 110 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","57","110","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/recommended/209650/","Kythrol","Kythrol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kythrol/","601 products in account","A true movie experience in the form of a video game.\n\nContinues what Black Ops II started in terms of the futuristic setting, though goes further. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is set between 2054 and 2061, so the game's subtitle definitely isn't misleading - you'll truly feel advanced, using pretty much sci-fi level technology and weapons with a rather high amount of focus on the Exo suit, allowing you to jump around, dodge enemies or even go invisible in a way which is surely going to sparkle some minor Crysis flashbacks in your head.\n\nYou cannot specifically choose what perks is your Exo suit going to offer in a mission since the game has them all picked in advance for you; though you can interact with how the suit works to a certain degree using upgrade points, which you collect by finishing challenges throughout the campaign - such as headshots or grenade kills. Those upgrades allow you to get less recoil or aim down the sights quicker, for example, though the perks themselves are just set in stone which was indeed kind of disappointing.\n\nOn the other hand, what didn't disappoint me was the story itself. You might think that the Call of Duty games are cinematic enough as they are, but Advanced Warfare manages to take that to a whole different level. It's possible to feel the emphasis on a moviesque feeling pretty much every step of the way, and Kevin Spacey is exceptionally brilliant. If it were on me, I would have liked slightly less quick time events because when they get forced down your throat as soon as you start the game in situations where they don't feel necessary, it does get quite a bit too repetitive having played all the Call of Duty titles before. But I assume that it's something you should expect in a game like this.\n\nWhile the campaign gets you through a fair share of twists and turns, getting you all excited for the ending, to me it did turn out a little bit underwhelming. I would have thrown at least a bunch of words in here about the last mission but don't want to spoil anything, therefore I'll be quiet in that regard. Overall, the story is solid, does have some memorable moments to offer and while I don't think it's the best Call of Duty campaign ever, the focus on a movie-like experience turned out to be interesting to say the least.\n\nDo not get this game for the multiplayer. It takes at least 15 minutes to find a match (of course, Team Deathmatch mode only) which just isn't worth it. I can't talk much about this part of the game other than saying it's pretty much dead, because I was one of the unlucky ones who didn't get the game at launch and therefore didn't get to experience playing with actual people without waiting for ages at a time. From the matches I've played with bots I can tell that the game itself does feel like loads of fun, with maps based on verticality and the gunplay giving me Unreal Tournament vibes, though I assume there must have been some major issues with it making it next to abandoned as of now. Whether those issues were based on the game's design, performance or anything else, I sadly don't know.\n\nOne of the other two game modes which Advanced Warfare has to offer is 'Exo Survival.' It is very similar to the Survival mode from Modern Warfare 3, and it's about surviving (yes, really) against waves of enemies, while also allowing you to upgrade your weapons, the Exo suit, or even scorestreaks for points you gain by finishing off the waves of enemies. Sometimes, you also get an objective round, which involves not only killing the bad guys but also fulfilling a set goal, like defending a certain position or gathering items. I really liked the mode in Modern Warfare 3 so I'm glad it's back, since something about it just makes it rather enjoyable.\n\n'Exo Zombies,' on the other hand, could be compared to the Treyarch's signature game mode carrying the same name, only with a twist in the form of - yes, you have guessed correctly again - the usage of Exo suits. I don't like Zombies, but I know people do so that's cool, I suppose.\n\nTo sum it up, I would obviously advise against buying Advanced Warfare if it's not on sale. But once the price is right and you don't care about the multiplayer mode being in an unplayable state, go for it. Even if only for Kevin Spacey.","February 13","true","7.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

But this one is a strong exception. I can believe that, they wanted something new. It is allright, but a new stuff can be ♥♥♥♥ too. At least they have learnt from this mistake, because the Black Ops 3 is nice!\nThe problem with this game: Strange graphic: i can see the improvements, but the objects, nature looks like cheap plastic. The colours of the nature, the objects give me a bad feeling. Their mood just feels bad, don't rlly like it. It would be fine, if the gaming experience would replace this disadvantage. But no. sad.\nGameplay problems (in multiplayer mode): Annoying movement, and animation. The worst is the exo jump. It's just like teleporting with lag, and it looks bad too. It is still annoying, if i do the exojump.\nWhen i played multiplayer, i felt like, the role of the shooting weapons is low. I always get killed by something crap drone, jet, or whatever. But almost never by shot. And that is really bad. This is a shooting game, not a drone simulator. The main thing is the WEAPONS. And when You get killed by an almost immortal fighter helicopter like 8 times in a row, that is a good reason to close to game, and don't have the whilling to play with it again. And this was just one of the many problems. Other ppl also noticed these problems, because that is ridiculous if i go to play with this game 1 year after it's been launched and there are 650 people playing with it online(whole world). I could not join any lobby. Waited 20 minutes, nothing.\n\nSo the main things: bad mood graphic\nAnnoying exo stuffs, contains all the features from the invisibility to the jumping bs.\nAnd one of the worse: U don't require shooting skills. You camp somewhere, get like 4-5 kills somehow, and from that, You can own the servers with magic helicopters, tanks, drones and other craps.\n\nSorry for my english, it's not my native language, but somehow i need to write this down.\n\nGG","November 14, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I went back to play the game a second time the very next day and the movie for the level im on begins but right after that the game crashes. Ive looked up solutions to the problem but there is no definitive answer. Sometimes the crash error has no information so you cant even search for a solution.\n\nThey have released updates which is what made me decide to get this game as I figured this must resolve the problems everyone was talking about but I was wrong. The errors that occur appear to have been not only in the last COD (Ghosts) but go as far back as MW3. That means that COD:MW3, COD:BO, COD:BO2, COD,Ghosts and now COD :AW ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH NO SOLUTION! Its clear they will not fix this problem anytime soon as they have obviously had YEARS to create a solution and yet no where on the internet is there a clear fix.\n\nSimply put they rushed the game to get it out into the market with the idea of patching it up later but there really is so much wrong with the coding of this game that errors are almost a certaintly regardless of how new or good your rig is.

It really isn't that hard, load all current games, organise by ping, find the server I wish to play in, and go in. P2P and Hosting or NOT, between 2AM and 8AM in Australia this game is unplayable.

The story is rather interesting but does have a lot of moments of why this and why that....there is even a point in the game where I wish it branched off and allowed you to make this simple choice of following a special someone or not to allow more story info and even points of view on why the story is built on these paths.\n\nThere is some audio issues during loading which seem to be fixed now, but there is a slight issue with the loading screen as it does provide a video giving some background story but it finishes rather fast before the loading is done meaning your stuck looking at a black screen.....why they couldn't of made the video longer (like Modern Warfare 2 allowing you to watch a long video and skip once loading was completed) to cover the long loading is rather strange as there is a lot of background information they could of filled in to keep the player in check with the story.\n\nThe guns are pretty awesome as well as the ability to upgrade and improve your exo suit which comes pretty handy allowing you to slide and double jump...however each mission does restrict some abilities for example one mission may allow you to double jump then the next mission takes that away and gives you a climbing ability.\n\nThere are a few memorable missions, one being a bike ride, another a tank mission and of course the all out war stuff.\n\nHowever the biggest issues are:\n\n1. Call of duty still feels linear, instead of trying to attempt a more wider approach and more non scripted events. For example there is one mission where it's all out war and you see choppers flying low dropping off troops. This mission and only this mission you are able to climb up there at your own chosing and gun the crew down, you can even avoid that approach and take a rocket to it or steal a enemy tank to shoot it down. This whole approach felt awesome and more in the player control.\n\n2. Feels short. I tried the story on medium and then veteran and felt the game rather short and not really challenging, namely Black ops series I found myself getting a beating in veteran as mass waves of enemies charge my location and throw the unlimited amount of grenades behind my cover but Advanced Warfare never gave me that challenge and most times I felt extremely overpowered which isn't a bad thing since I'm wearing this exo suit but I ended flying through the game rather fast.\n\n\nTo me it's a good start and finally something a bit different then the rest but still doesn't feel right....like it's missing something. However Kevin Spacey does help the story abit....I think they put all the graphics on his face though because he looks really detailed compared to my other teammates.....\n\nI would recommend you wait for a sale if your aiming for the singleplayer elements. For the online I can't really say much only that the customization is nicely done and the whole usage of Exosuits for online battles are awesome...but there isn't much change, there is still TD, capture , Control and still the same amount of player limit as before.. They did have a survival mode but it gets boring pretty fast.","December 30, 2014","true","13.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However , like Agent Smith used to say "What good is a phone call if you're unable to speak?"\n\nThat's what CoD:AW is all about - console lobbies hosted by fine gentlemen with wooden internet. No dedicated servers whatsoever. Basically another slap in the face to the PC crowd.  As a basic game design and engineering rule: when you have a fast moving game with lots of easy direction changes you need the lowest ping possible. And to get that, dedicated servers are the norm.

The maps are also very open so that it's essentially a shooting galley, I would've liked maps where there were less places to get shot from.\n-There are like 30 weapons in the game which is nothing to BF4 which has about 80 weapons, most of the weapons are completely useless (snipers take too long to aim and there aren't many spots for them, might be worthwhile with iron sights, the first shotgun is okay and the second one is fully automatically and 100% useless (far too short range and far too little damage)\n-The game has weapon balancing issues so you'll be killed by the same weapons over and over again\n-the Exo suits while a good idea are not great, I've tried the one with a shield but you're dead before it's deployed and the jumping one is fun but you'll be killed pretty quick)\n-Aiming, virtually no recoil so on PC weapons are unbalanced. If you are running and then you aim down sights then you will probably be killed before you can take a shot because it takes so long to switch and it takes about 3 bullets to kill you in hardcore and only a few more in regular mode, because of this you'll probably find that you have to walk around every corner or you'll be instakilled.\n-performance, the game runs fine once I'm in a game and the loading time isn't too long but at the start I have quite bad FPS lag  and severe stuttering for maybe 20 seconds at the start with decent PC specs (of a 5-10 minutes long match). On singleplayer if you adjust the settings then it reloads the entire map along with the cutscene at the start of the level (which was clearly designed to mask the long singleplayer loading times) and it takes about as long as bf4 so go make some tea\n-Graphics, can't fault them, the game looks pretty nice. I do have a glitch where the textures are ultra low res on singleplayer (e.g. you can count the pixels) I'm not sure if this is because I got it from my friends steam back up (he has faster internet so downloaded it in 2 hours and it would take me 50 hours) or whether this is a genuine bug, I don't like it either way and it takes away emersion.\n-Controls, for the game they are fine, but for the menus it is clear it is a port, you are expected to be soley using your arrow keys, enter and esc to go through these menus. You can click on stuff to highlight it with your mouse but then you have to press enter to properly select it which results in you wishing you had a third hand, £40 or a decent game.\n\nOverall my complaints are;not enough weapons, balancing issues, no dedicated servers and no server browser, most of the maps are terrible (in my humble opinion), you get loot (like helmets for your person) from "care packages" which runs out (so essentially it's useless), aiming takes far too long (the majority of the time I'm dead before I can aim down the sights (if I'm running about)), menu controls.\n--The things I like about the game are that you can customise your character,  I'd add something else here but I can't think of anything.","November 6, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

But I can honestly say this game is the last CoD game I'll be buying.\n\nThe single player is the same cliche "underdog hero" that's in every past iteration of their games with the same either run and gun or hide in a corner until the enemies stop coming playstyle depending on your difficulty. Yes they have some fancy new tricks and gadgets to play around with but they don't add much into the game other than to break up the monotonous gunfights. Cutscenes look great on ultra graphics but the audio has been off and it just looks like spaghetti mouthed puppets.\n\nThe multiplayer is the most horrendous. Imagine Black Ops 2, the last CoD game I played. Now multiply the speed by 2, add in dodging and boosting and more cluttered maps. Like every CoD game in the past sniping is absolutely impossible unless you're some freak quickscoping/twitch aimer. But with the boosting and the dodging you've got a lack of actual aiming in the game. It's really just "double jump onto a roof, jump smash down onto the ground dodge around a corner and hold down the mouse button". Didn't kill anyone? Just boost dodge/crouch/jump until you're finished reloading and try again.\n\nThe available weapons are all basically the same. Full auto or burst. The only single shot rifle that isn't a sniper is the last unlocked weapon in the assault rifle section. With about 5 weapons per class it's probably the least gun populated CoD I've played other than CoD: 2. Their spawning system is even worse than any of their other games. I can't count how many times I've spawned just to be killed by the same person who killed me previously within .5 seconds of the screen even loading in.\n\nThe lack of dedicated servers usually means you'll died in a single bullet while in the kill cam you'll see your enemy empty half a clip into you. Or you'll dodge around a corner and still die due to lag. Half the time I try to log on I get an error about the servers not being functional.\n\nTo finish it all off, I have a problem with getting points added to your camo unlocks (triple kills, headshots, long shots) which now there is a 500 kill cap to getthe camos (500 longshot, 500 headshots...not worth ever).\n\nI'd give this game a 4/10. The cutscenes look great even though the audio is out of sync half the time. The gameplay is tedious and boring. Multiplayer is just a bunch of idiots jumping around like monkeys.","November 7, 2014","false","6.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It is yet another call of duty game without any substantial steps forward within the actual gameplay. I am only reviewing the multiplayer (Who buys a Cod game for Singleplayer?).\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Big Hit box which does not follow the shape of player (People blame rubberbanding, but It isn't always this. I have played plenty of strong connection servers, the hit box is massive, you can hit a player standing still by shooting off target haha it's terrible)\n* No Leaning\n* Sprinting has no aim penalty (Because your wearing an exo suit I hear you say)\n* No 3D scope perspective (e.g. Cod Ghosts had it, RO2 players know what I am talking about) Instead you get a big black crappy edge.\n* Weapon recoil is minimal meaning no downside to constant automatic fire\n* Weapon cone of fire is incredibly tight, this allows easy firing from the hip without needing laser sight, ect..\n* Maps are incredibly small, this makes for incredibly frustrating gameplay. You often spawn right next to enemies. Sniper rifles are a pointless weapon unless you have iron sites or acog as a long shot in this game must be considered 50 yards..\n* Weapon atatchments make very little sense (e.g. Sniper rifle, take off a big scope, use an acog and you lose some weapon handling. (A lower powered scope, smaller sized optic, would allow faster target aquisition and less weight yet it takes -2 from wep handling) really strange..\n\nThe good:\n\n* Incredibly fast paced action (If you like it)\n* The exo suit adds a few more capabilities in the way of movement/dodging.\n\nOn the whole, I do not like the game. I enjoyed it for the first few hours but it is now just a very frustrating game. It has far too many negatives. It was 'not' a step forward in anyway.

Anyhow, here is the game review:\nThe game perform like ♥♥♥♥, and thus become a terrible experience despite how much more solid the game performs compared to Ghosts. It still cannot get close compared to Black Ops 2 however, being the most recent, best performing Call of Duty game to this date (Excluding the games that are so old, computers surpass them hardcore).\nOverall, if this game actually got taken care of, it could become "something", but the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem with call of duty is the matter of fact that a new, worse game gets released every year, leaving much to be desired when we ALL know that it would be infinitely better for 1 title to rather get updated, patched and balanced rather than being a terribly half-arsed, low performing game.\n\nThis is all coming from a guy that got 5000 hours recorded in FPS games and COD alone (Excluding the 2400 hours i have recently gotten in CS:GO, making the total about 7500Hours), and the evidence is that the hours are actually viewable on my steam game list.\n\nAnyhow, this game got little to do on the PC if the frame rate cannot be set to reach an average of 200! Competitive PC gaming require a game that run like CS:GO, if not better... So Activision can re-think their cash cow or call it a day on the PC! CS:GO is taking over the world, and rightfully so.","January 16, 2015","false","2.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

There is no dedicated servers for multiplayer (instead there is terrible peer to peer connections that cause many network errors in multiplayer) eminently breaking the multiplayer experience.  There is barely any optimization.  If you join a multiplayer game late, it microstutters like crazy.  And on singleplayer/campaign you get insane microstutters when ever there's a character animations.  Despite all these issues, the game has a decent story mode (putting aside all the technical issues) but if you want good multiplayer I suggest you don't buy this game.  Oh great now they're adding all this DLC that doesn't even come with the Season Pass.  So basically they want you to pay the $60 game price + the $50 season pass + an additional $30 for all the customization packs to basically have the full game.

The debut of the Exo suit makes the games much more vertical.  There are plenty of guns and attachments to keep you switching loadouts for months.  The score streaks are actually fun to use, unlike Treyarch's iterations.  As for the story, it is actually one of the more captivating and interesting Call of Duty campaigns I have ever played.  Sure it's still linear as hell, but the addition of Kevin Spacey made his character memorable and the story was well told and easy to follow.\n\nThe games performance on PC is surprisingly good, high resolution textures, and the game feels much more optimized than Ghosts, god Ghosts was bad.\n\nWhere Advanced Warfare falls apart is in it's infrastructure.  It's 2014 and we have a game that is one of the best selling franchises of all time and it rely's on P2P servers.  COD4, COD WaW, and BO1, all had Dedicated Servers.  Thats where this game goes wrong.  I can deal with the game not having mod tools because of the money hungry market that is DLC, but not having dedicated servers???  I know Activision is just trying to cut costs, but P2P servers on PC do not work.  When I try to connect to some jackass who is torrenting ♥♥♥♥ in the background of his PC and just so happens to get the host.\n\nIf this game had dedicated servers it would have gotten a higher score by me and other reviewers.\n\n\n3 out of 5.\n\nGood- Advancing the COD world with the fast paced Exo movements and abilities.  Kevin Spacey was a hit and a good decision to create a more legitimate feeling to the campaign.  PC options are good and game runs fine.\n\nBad-  Peer servers which lead to a lower population making games hard to find and sometimes laggy.\n\n\nWould've given a 4 out of 5 if it had dedicated servers.  Perhaps even 5 out of 5.  Definitely a 5 out of 5 with dedicated servers and mod tools.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game because it is still a fun game to play when you can find a game, and probably the most fun you'll have playing COD on PC since COD4","December 25, 2014","true","9.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Game really surprised me how it tells a story and what you can do in it. Some stuff it has actually makes you wonder if todays technology has such thing. Only bad thing I can say about this game is there is no gore in the gameplay and it's alittle on the short side. You also need a beefy PC to run this game on max settings. I recommend you either turn off supersampling or have it on X2 depending on your card. I never bothered with the MP but I heard it's dead anyway.

What i mean by this is that players can literally take any path to cross the map and this can take less than 20 seconds, so im finding that im being shot in the back alot. Additionally with the new movement, there's a serious lack of defensive play. I've mainly noticed this in domination when we have two flags everyone pushes the one the enemies have and flags are switching much more frequently than in previous COD's. The game has become even more fast paced than before and i can't keep up. Trying to solo cap a point that hasn't got a roof over it is extremelly frustrating because it is impossible to accuratelly predict where an enemy will come from because they will just jump over any of the walls and ♥♥♥♥ you in mid air. Despite all the faults, i still enjoy playing when none of the annoying ♥♥♥♥ happens.\n\nThis is just my personal insight into the game for which i have only played 4 hours and it is more than likely that all the hate is due to me being bad/ not adapted but its still frustrating to play most of the time for me.","November 6, 2014","false","13.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

I was tricked by the IGN review into giving this game a shot, and I'm sad that I did.  If I could get my money back(or even half my money back) and give this awful wretched game back, I would.  I wish I had a physical copy, so I could drive over to the HQ of the people who mad this slop and STOMP IT INTO PIECES RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.  That's how bad it is.\n\nThe gameplay is typical CoD. . . which is to say that it is laggy, glitchy, with cramped maps and enemies spawning right on top of you.  Balance?  LOL!  The game is filled with people running around with auto shotguns and quick-scopers and you'll rarely get into a satisfying gunfight.  The maps are very vertical and circular in nature, and you'll just as often be shot in the back by someone who just spawned as from the front.  The new exo-suit perks are completely pointless, because they all take a second or two to activate.  By the time you realize you NEED a shield(or a cloaking device, or speed), you're already dead or the moment has already passed.\n\nThe controls on PC are absolutely AWFUL because they've been ported from console with no consideration as to the unique qualities of the PC platform.  As an example: if you double tap any of your main movement keys(WASD), your character will "dash/dodge" in that direction.  Now, the absurdity of this becomes immediately obvious if you've ever PLAYED with a keyboard before. . . you rarely HOLD the A or D keys for any length of time, instead you usually tap them to inch your character around a corner or other obstacle.  However, the "dodge" mechanic means that if you EVER press one of those keys in quick succession, your character will dash in that direction.  This means that in nearly every gunfight(when you press the keys quickly to dodge around), your character will mis-interpret a desire for "strafe right" into "dodge right" at least once, sending your character on an uncontrollable dash that throws off your aim(but isn't fast enough to actually dodge incoming fire).  This makes every gunfight feel like you're riding a bull that will randomly dart off in one direction or another, and you just have to hold on for dear life and hope that it all turns out alright.\n\nAlso, if you have a modern mouse that polls at 1000hz, you're screwed, because the game will randomly accelerate and decelerate your mouse inputs.  Imagine someone randomly turning your mouse DPI from 400 up to 6000 as you play the game. . . it's impossible to deal with.  There IS a solution however. . . you just have to turn your mouse's polling rate down to 125hz, which is fine if we're playing in 1999, but hilariously bad for 2014.  All that money you spent on a nice mouse?  wasted.  Also: you're going to have to go into your mouse settings and turn it back up to 1000hz any time you leave CoD to play ANYTHING ELSE. . . which is another stupid annoyance to deal with.  Best solution for that?  Simply don't play CoD. . . problem solved.\n\nI beg you, IMPLORE you, my fellow gamers, don't make my mistake.  Take your hard earned dollars and spend them on literally ANY other game than this one.  You'd be better off throwing money at random kickstarter games that MIGHT turn out to be good than this TERRIBAD GAME.\n\nLEARN FROM MY MISTAKES!  HEED MY WARNING!\n\nTL:DR:\n\n>>> Don't buy this game, it's awful.","November 6, 2014","false","0.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiohazardCrow/recommended/209650/","BiohazardCrow","Biohazard Crow™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BiohazardCrow/","97 products in account","Admittedly, i had reservations, Between Ghosts which in my short time playing bored me to tears and Titanfall that kept me entertained for hours on end i didnt know where to land on this game, My main fear was that it was going to feel like a cheap immitation of Titanfall, I couldnt have been more wrong. This, at its core is Call Of Duty, in a good way, in my opinion Sledgehammer achieved with Advanced Warfare what Treyarch Failed with Black Ops II.\n\nSingle Player Camaign:\nVery fun single player mode, The campaign offers many twists and unexpected moments, alongside the jaw dropping slow-mo breach and clear moments we have all come to love.\nThe Campaign didnt leave me bored, running a generic objective, it was intuative and offered a choice of approaches to all situations depending on the way youre upgrading your Exo, which really allows you to take a personal run at it, The campaign only stands at about 5 - 6 hours long, which as immersive as it is, passes awfully quickly. I personally was sad to see it end, i found it to be the most immersive and gripped COD Campaign to date, the beautifully done CGI cutscenes are a real nice touch, really makes you want to sit and watch what unfolds.\n\nMultiplayer mode\nIm going to start by saying it isnt without its problems, I personally experienced little to none, but know my share of people who spent the first few days furious at it, The problems seem to land on latency due to a lack of dedicated servers, That aside the Multiplayer in my opinion is one of the franchises best, especially lately. Its fun and entertaining, the futuristic weaponry adds a new element to the game that you cant wait to explore as you go about unlocking things, the game boasts 35 weapons, but with unlockable weapon variations the count is in the hundreds, and those variations arent just cosmetic enhancements, they come in the shape of stat boosts and nerfs along with, in some cases, massive appearance alterations, essentially making it an all new weapon in my book.\nThe maps dont feel re-rolled and like you have run them before, like i experienced time and time again in previous titles, they feel fresh and up to date, i personally found the maps a nice balance of long/short range, tight corners and routes theres no one way from 1 side to the other, especially when your equipped with that jump pack, my only issue movement wise is the high amount of inaccesible rooftops and high points, but its easily forgotten once you get into the swing of things, running, leaping or sliding your way into combat.\n\n10/10. Definitly.\n\nBut of course, thats just one mans opinion. Theres only really one way to find out whether it for you.\nSee you on the field.\n","November 7, 2014","true","9.5"," 43 of 83 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","43","83","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lynches/recommended/209650/","lynches","SmartAlec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lynches/","133 products in account","The Game had potential to be the best Call of Duty ever. The Movement, Graphics, Sound effects, Particle systems; aesthetically this game was impressive.\n\nThe Game iteself is killed by the plague that is Call of duty. The 20 seconds of fun system every CoD uses except maybe CoD4. Where the devs intentionally make ♥♥♥♥ tier spawns for you to be killed or kill people at and power creep the hell out of all the gear, esp. explosives.\n\nI came in expecting that, but what really killed the ENTIRE game for me was the fact the maps do not compensate the new mobility almost at all, and the maps themselves were unimaginative garbage. I see clearly the devs had no strategical value when designing these maps.\n\nCampaign is very fun and feels cinematic at times, DECENT at best story+plot+narrative. The promise, and let down of dedicated servers was a shame, matchmaking can be near impossible at times and often freeze at synchronizing game settings. When you do happen to get into a game youll experience heavy hangs/lag for a couple seconds as base. If the host is on economy internet, you will lag every couple seconds. Yet again, Host ALWAYS wins.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nCampaign-9/10\nMultiplayer-6-10, I could have done a better job balancing this myself.\n\nIts astonishing how a AAA studio can never get it right. It's also our fault for being bated into their Extrinsic trance, and buying the same product year after year always "Hoping" it will be better.","November 6, 2014","false","9.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

The gameplay and overrall controls remains the same essentially (which for me, as a veteran Call of Duty player, it's an okay thing) except of course for the addition of the "Titanfall-esque" movement, which does lead to some really cool action bits and sometimes to some really frustrating ones.\n\nKudos for making the multiplayer a little more interesting again and giving the player full customization of how he's to create the class. Definitely better than Ghosts, which felt like a drawback; this Advanced one though does live up to it's name.

The expansion pack also has a new Exo Zombies mode, which is a co-op mode where four employees from Atlas Corporation will fight against a new kind of zombies. The four main characters will be portrayed by popular celebrities, namely Bill Paxton, John Malkovich, Rose McGowann, as well as John Bernthal.\n\nThis will not be the last expansion that will be released for the latest "Call of Duty" installment. The game developers are planning three other expansion packs for the franchise, including Ascendance, Supremacy, and Reckoning. However, the developers and game publisher Activision are still mum about the release dates of the upcoming expansion packs.\n\nPlayers can purchase the "Havoc" DLC for $15, or they can opt to buy the entire expansion pass for only $50.\n\nMeanwhile, some of those who purchased the season pass on Xbox 360 that attempted to transfer it to Xbox One are having problems when installing the "Havoc DLC." Microsoft is already aware of the problem, and they are currently addressing the issue.\n\nIn the Xbox Live page, Microsoft stated:\n\n"Are you receiving an error message when attempting to play Exo Zombies in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on Xbox 360. Are you having difficulty installing the Havoc DLC after transferring a Season Pass from Xbox 360 to Xbox One? Hang in there, Xbox members.

The story is bland, but does a decent job of keeping your attention. One mission I really liked used actual stealth mechanics, rather than the old guided ones where your partner pointed at people and said shoot. I would've liked to have seen more of that. However, not as bad as Ghosts, by any means.\nThe Multiplayer is really where this game shines. The new exo suit offers a fresh twist that was much needed by the series, with the exo ability acting as a physical perk without one being significantly overpowered than the others. Jumping across rooftops and clearing the entire map in seconds is a blast, along with the awesome combat senarios you find yourself in as you and the enemy dash around each other. They added random loot crate (think tf2) drops which provide another thing to work for allowing you to get new gun varients and new customization options for your soldier. The only bad thing I've really seen so far is the initial lag when you join/start a match. Dedicated servers have been around for years, and the fact that they don't is kind of insulting.\nOther than that, I would recommend this game to anyone who's been a long time fan of the series> ITs a lot of fun to stomp around with friends, and fly from rooftops. Overall I give it a solid 8 out of 10","December 14, 2014","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I sync out WAY too much. The connection handler of this game is IMMENSELY buggy and I spend nearly half my time just trying to get into games. Its a real problem since it happens frequently. Then there's also the fact it takes several attempts just to connect online in the first place.\n\nThen there's the fact that I can't ever get into a hardpoint, momentum, uplink or search and rescue mission. Everyone plays TDM and a few play DOM. Dom is ok, but gets old, and TDM is BOOORRINNG. There needs to be more incentive to play the more interesting game modes.\n\nThe spawning is just rediculous too. Constant and random locations just makes it impossible to do anything tactical and death is meaningless.\n\nI'm quickly finding myself tiring of this game and I was hoping to get alot more hours out of it.\n\nOverall, its a solid mechanic, but for TDM and DOM only? Not worth $60 and I would not recommend this to my friends even though I'd love for them to play with me. These things need to get fixed.\n\nOriginal Review: {Overall a really fun game (talking about the MP, the single player is meh). Its fast paced and has an interesting assortment of abilities and weapons, its a really solid MOBA that feels like a cross between counter-strike and unreal tournament. Nothing is particularly ground breaking and maybe it's not worth the full $60, but its fun nonetheless.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that there are alot of people playing this game that have obviously been playing CoD forever and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. If you're more of a casual player like me, you're going to get destroyed in a match with them, which can be less than fun. It would be nice to have some tiered matchmaking to help compensate for this to make it that you're more likely to play with people around your skill level.}","November 13, 2014","false","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter how boring the MP component is, SP was always well written and provides hours of fun. However, this isn't the case with COD:AW.\n\nThe story is very blant and uninteresting, and the gameplay is just a mess. Unlike the previous COD games, which has a strong plot as a backbone that builds up the climax gradually, everything happens too fast in AW's SP. The plot is also extremely predictable and does not have any emotional factors in it, unlike the previous games. Gameplay in both SP and MP is just a load of cluster♥♥♥♥, and feels like a poor Titanfall ripoff.\n\nDefinitely would not recommend.","March 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The expansion pack also has a new Exo Zombies mode, which is a co-op mode where four employees from Atlas Corporation will fight against a new kind of zombies.

The game developers are planning three other expansion packs for the franchise, including Ascendance, Supremacy, and Reckoning. However, the developers and game publisher Activision are still mum about the release dates of the upcoming expansion packs.\n\nPlayers can purchase the "Havoc" DLC for $15, or they can opt to buy the entire expansion pass for only $50.\n\nMeanwhile, some of those who purchased the season pass on Xbox 360 that attempted to transfer it to Xbox One are having problems when installing the "Havoc DLC." Microsoft is already aware of the problem, and they are currently addressing the issue.\n\nIn the Xbox Live page, Microsoft stated:\n\n"Are you receiving an error message when attempting to play Exo Zombies in Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare on Xbox 360. Are you having difficulty installing the Havoc DLC after transferring a Season Pass from Xbox 360 to Xbox One? Hang in there, Xbox members. We're moving toward a fix, and we're grateful for your patience during this process."\n\nPlayers should expect to get an updated version of the "Havoc" DLC anytime soon.\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.christiantoday.com/article/havoc.dlc.for.call.of.duty.advance.warfare.released/47012.htm#ixzz3Qgk5qj6M","February 3, 2015","true","30.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today I think I spent more time waiting to get into MP matches than actually plaing it. Frequently had to sit through several cycles of having the game act like it was connecting to a match (Synchronizing..., etc.) only to get stuck until it finally times out (maybe 2 minutes or so?). I've had to repeat this two or three times before I can get a single match. It's not just today though. I've had these issues since I bought the game a couple of weeks ago (mid Jan. 2015). Can hardly chalk it up to 'well it's brand new and has a few bugs.'\n\nOnce in, it was a complete lagfest until I did that maxPing config change folks are talking about on the internet. It seems the default maxPing for server connection is 800ms! Seriously!? That's probably the REAL reason they show us 'bars' instead of actual ping numbers.\n\nAnd no, don't try to tell me how my hardware or my hard-wired, 120 Mbps, open NAT internet connection where I can regularly play on BF4 servers with 20ms ping are at fault. I used to LOVE the CoD franchise and I've owned all of the PC titles since the original MW. I thought Black Ops II was one of the most fun MP titlles I had played in quite some time. After the steaming pile of crap that was CoD: Ghosts, I reluctantly joined some friends playing BF4 and I must say I found it quite enjoyable. Not the same fast pace I had come to expect in CoD, but when playing with friends, very enjoyable. A friend of mine talked me into trying AW a couple of weeks ago. Well . . .\n\nIf you like multiplayer, SAVE YOUR MONEY!","February 1, 2015","false","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter how boring the MP component is, SP was always well written and provides hours of fun. However, this isn't the case with COD:AW.\n\nThe story is very blant and uninteresting, and the gameplay is just a mess. Unlike the previous COD games, which has a strong plot as a backbone that builds up the climax gradually, everything happens too fast in AW's SP. The plot is also extremely predictable and does not have any emotional factors in it, unlike the previous games. Gameplay in both SP and MP is just a load of cluster♥♥♥♥, and feels like a poor Titanfall ripoff.\n\nDefinitely would not recommend.","March 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If that was the intent it should have been advertised as such, don't you realise that there are a significant amount of online players that only play the hard core mode games. I won't get in to the issue with the delay and the new maps not working, we all know that crap happens and the double XP was nice thanks, unfortunately the new maps have been out for over a week now and there are still problems with some of them loading.  There should be a public apology made and the issue of the lack of support for the hard core game mode resolved.  If not there should be refunds for those who purchased either the season pass like myself, or the individual Havoc map pack under the pretense that there would be hard core games, this is a major oversight in my opinion, there should be equal game options for both modes of play.  I hope Sledgehammer Games steps up and takes responsibility for this issue and resolves the problem by either enabling hard core for the identical modes of game play available in standard, or offering refunds to those that purchased the DLC under false pretense.  There are still issues with some of the original maps downloading that have yet to be fixed as well, this could be a great game if only there was some real support available.\n","March 14, 2015","false","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know there has been a lot of horrible reviews about this game for the PC version (Hacking, Latency, Glitches). So I waited to buy the game for 3 months. Even with all the bad reviews it will still getting I decided to fork out the money for the game and I love it! Yes I have encountered some people hacking and its actually kind of funny how obvious it is the hackers will actually talk to each other about which hack they are using. The regular players usually team up and talk ♥♥♥♥ and report them and they are usually gone on the very next map! So someone is taking care of buisness! As for the Latency issues I have none! The game is very fast paced with a lot of fun people playing! Don't let a few bad reviews stop you from buying this wonderful game! Add me if you like!","January 23, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Runs super smooth if your pc specs fit their optimization. Little to no lag (2 out of 30 games has had moments with lag) instant multiplayer games even at 5am in the morning and the game is actually pretty fun gameplay wise.\n\nThere is a bug that blocks your access to multiplayer if you click anything too fast after the multiplayer client is launched. You get an error ("service not available blabla..") if you wait 2-4sec it works just fine.\n\nI was really unsure about buying this game because of people leaving bad reviews based on their pc having trouble running the game normally or because of issues noted above that they was unable to figure out how to bypass, but im glad i ignored it. People complain about dlc/skin prices etc, but i see no point in buying it as it gives almost nothing.\n\nThe singleplayer was ok, story was decent and i liked that they got kevin spacey for it. Being unable to skip cutscenes was a bit annoying since you have to watch it again from where you saved and quit.\n\n\nWhen all is said and done i personally feel a game like this is all about the multiplayer and should be judged mostly based on that. Feels very much like this game was built around quick fun for when you got time to spare. Short matches, small maps, much adrenaline.\n\n6.5/10\n\nMuch action in a small package.","March 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The exo survival is great and a fun way to pass time. Exo Zombies is a great expansion for the game and adds a new challenge to playing zombies which is very fun. All in all the game has some downfalls that shouldn't be there but overall is a great game that provides much.","February 26, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
