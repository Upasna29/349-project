MUST OOOOWWWNNN !!! The first time I saw this game was on a PC in a Tandy Electronics store in early 1997. lol, boy I tell you, I played it as much as I could. Which was only 15 mins. But when I had to leave, I knew I had to get away from games like Doom, Quake, Heretic, Descent, Blakestone 3D, Wolfenstein 3D, Duke Nukem 3D ... etc. These 3D platform shooters were the next big thing!\n\nThe graphics amazed me back then. Now that I play it, I gotta admit it isn't as great as I had remembered, but the gameplay is incredibly fun that you'll pay no attention to the graphics. There’s this really cool slanting to the camera angle when you run left or right. I also find the parachute mechanism as integral and addictive to the gameplay as bullet time is in the Max Payne series.\n\nMDK is about 6 hours long. For the amount of content to make things interestingly non-repetitive, I'd say this was well laid out by the developers. Some people might think the game is short. And maybe it is by today's standards. But if I remember back to those days as a kid, if a game was fun, you'd replay it again. It was that simple. And I would gladly load MDK up every now and then just to blast around and have fun today. That's the way it should be!\n\nI can't even understand some of the pure genius of ideas in this game. Like I remember shooting this alien or whatever in the head and his eye popped! I shoot him in the nose and that got mashed. I mean like I shoot Ellis or Coach in the eyes in L4D2 and they don't pop ... you know what I mean? lol. Incredible detail and very imaginative game. Too much to explain. You have to play it to see it.\n\nThe control scheme is a bit wonky. You have to remember this was at a time where using the mouse to look around on PC wasn't that common. But I personally don't find it a bother. There are some people that have created modern mouse configurations for this game. But I recommend to use the keyboard old-school with the mouse only for sniping. Having said that, this game would be very user-friendly with a controller.\n\nThe music is pure awesomeness! It gives such great atmosphere. The sound effects like the gun shooting doesn’t get tiring.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why the Steam version of this game lacks the ending escape sequence movie clip followed by this French music video. You'll need to obtain MDKEND.FLC and MDKBZK.MVE and place them in the MDK/MISC/FLIC directory to view the ending like normal. Thank god for the Internet and Google search, this problem is easily remedied.\n\nThe Steam overlay also doesn't work. So you'll need a program like Zeckensack's Glide Wrapper or nGlide. Apparently these programs also fixes wrongly displayed textures and "windowboxing" which the game defaults to.\n\nOverall despite nearing 2 decades old, MDK makes it into my top favourite games of all time. It is so refreshing that it makes me wonder why a lot of triple A titles of today that use laser technology to scan actors into the computer as 3D models, combined with motion capture, life like level designs and Hollywood-like plots fail to draw me in! I would give MDK a personal score of 93/100.","December 12, 2013","true","6.7"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","85","91","2","4"

For that, you're equipped with an infinite-ammo chain gun and a sniper rifle, combined with a lot of items (nuclear bombs, did I mentioned that?!) that can be obtained along the game (I mean NUCLEAR BOMBS!).\n\nThe campaign is linear, with six worlds to complete. It's a classic, tremendously funny. I still can enjoy it like I did in 1999.\nIf you're not familiar with classic games, give it a try on a sale. Otherwise you probably already have it on your library. ;-)\n\nNOTE: The Steam version comes up with some bugs on newer systems (such as slowdowns and missing textures).

Unfortunately its age always prevented me from trying to play it on modern systems, because I was sure it would give too many troubles because of old 3dfx compatibilities issues. I WAS SO WRONG. But not because there are no issues. Of course this is the classic "old-game-released-forgotten-and-unsupported" so as soon as I launched the game all I could see was the character and the skybox... No walls or enemies or items or other models... LUCKILY there's always the steam community ready to help, so you can found a Fan patch in the steam forums that will grant you a solid chance to play it with no more issues.\nSo what about the game? This is a 3rd person Action-shooter with lots of innovative game mechanics and situations totally unseen before at the time. So you can move in 3rd person view, jump around platforms and stuff but you can also glide with a retractile parachute. You can go in 1st person view to use a sniper mode, where you can aim for headshots with classic bullets or, if you find them, you can use mortars or rockets, or auto-aiming bullets. Around the maps there are many tools and weapons you can grab, from the classic decoy to the smallest nuke in the world or the most interesting bomb (a bomb that dazes and attracts enemies before exploding). And this is a very small list.\nAnother top mention goes for the innovative and often CRAZY level design which I can't describe at all except for the picasso room (even though maybe picasso isn't exactly the most suited artist for that room), and that still nowadays can't be found anywhere.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. This game can look like just a 3rd person action-shooter, but it adds often so many unique situations that make this game and incredibly original gem. Unique situations like the very beginning of each level, where you Literally dive from the sky down to the map avoiding the enemy radar to prevent them from shooting you, or the tunnel slipping sectons, the skating sections, Sniping positions and obviously the end of each level where you travel through a wormhole or whatever it is...\nMUSIC. It might look (or sound) underrated but I DAMN LOVE this soundtrack, it changes every "room" with small loops but they're great, they can sound epic, ominous, crazy or action-paced. And I know someone could expect a cheap quality music or composition, but not here. Not this time.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY. This release has compatibility issues on modern systems and since this game is really old it obviously isn't supported in any way. Luckily there's a fan patch in the steam community that can help a lot making the game playable to most systems with compatibility issues.\nDURABILITY. It's short, VERY short. Unfortunately it doesn't take much to be completed, just look at my play time. At least it's a little compensated by the absence of saving game except at the end of each level... As long as you don't apply the patch, because it adds the possibility to save anytime with F2... XD\nSAVE GAME. As I've just mentioned there's no chance to save the game except after you've completed the level. Luckily with the fan patch you can save with F2 anytime you want... XD\nGRAPHICS. I know, it's old and honestly I dont' care much. Actually I really like it because at the times it had lots of incredible effects, and was visually appealing. Actually I like a lot today as well and I personally believe it aged better than other games of the same era but I chose tu put it in the CONs because I'm a nostalgic player that lived this game's innovation, so another random guy might not love its look as I do because he never knew the game or is a new generation player.","February 16","true","3.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/recommended/38450/","glitchedjoygirl","Soultaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchedjoygirl/","413 products in account","The Steam release of MDK is a bit of a letdown. It inspired me to make a fan patch for the game since, not only does it not include any glide wrappers to make the game compatible with modern systems, it also missed a LOT of original content from the game such as cutscenes, artwork etc.\n\nUsing my patch though you should be able to experience the game as it was meant to be.\n\nIn my opinion MDK is a pretty awesome shooter. It's insanely easy to play (especially with a modern WASD+mouse control setup), easy to grasp and while the game is a bit short, it has an insane amount of variety in level designs and graphics, especially for its time when most shooters looked like brown and grey corridors (*cough*Quake*cough*) and the game also features more open arena-like spaces a lot.\n\nA DEFINING feature of the game is the sniper rifle which attaches to your head like a helmet. Back in the 90's, this must've been the FIRST shooter I remember that had a sniper weapon that felt as good and simple to use as this. And it zooms in without any kind of pixelation as well.\n\nThe music is also stellar and composed by Tommy Tallarico who obviously took a lot of influence from Danny Elfman in his score for the game, using a lot of synthesizers mixed with rich orchestral sounds and themes. The soundtrack is as varied and whimsical at times as the game is and fits perfectly.\n\nGraphically the game ranges from being really colorful to having almost gothic HR Giger'esque designs, especially with the main protagonist. The low polygon count gives the game a very unique look though it uses a lot of very impressive graphical tricks for its time such as a world consisting entirely of mirrored surfaces that still looks awesome today.\n\nAll in all, MDK, or Murder Death Kill as it's originally called, in my opinion is an underrated must-play title for all shooter fans.","May 28","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Given how old this game is, I expect the graphics to take an ugly step back and man I wish I was wrong on that note. I was surprised Steam even had this game given it's age, problem was it was a bad port for some of us. Problem with me was I was getting Kurt and the basic background background and nothing else with the game. Fortunately under Steam's tech support there is a patch that fixes that problem. If you play this game, the controls are going to be crude from what you are used to. When your mouse isn't in free look mode, that's quite an adjustment when you've done years in first person shooters. Even so I think this game is worth a look back and I can already tell It has the same loopy humor MDK 2 has. Maybe not with voice acting anymore but the name's of the weapons you pick up says it all. I've just gotten this game to run properly and can tell I'm going to have fun with it, even though I'm still arkward with the controls. Is this game even worth a look see? Most of you would say no given it's age and most of us whom played this as kids are fathers now so no I don't expect this generation of kid like it, much less show interest. But that's not surprising... this game is really old and didn't hold up well at all. Can I really recommend this game honestly? No... sad to say unless you already had an interest in this game. This game is well past it's prime but it's still worth a glance back in my option.","July 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
