The game's mechanisms are consistent, which is good because some indie games don't work the same every time *cough* Bad Rats *cough*.\n\nSome of the puzzles are really well designed, some give you way more pieces than you actually need, and that is frustrating. What makes this game rage-inducing though is dying at the end of a very long level. You are forced to restart from the beginning.\n\nOverall, this game is dark, cute, frustrating, and fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowspaz/recommended/318430/","Shadowspaz","Shadowspaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadowspaz/","499 products in account","To put it simply: This game has no idea what it wants to be.\nThe premise is a very unique and interesting- It's a puzzle platformer where the goal is to kill yourself. You play as a pig whose parents were sent to a slaughterhouse, so to reunite with them in animal heaven, you must use up all of your lives. Very bizarre, and the puzzles are decent at first, but halfway through the first level, they throw trick solutions at you that you have absolutely no way of knowing about.\n\nBeyond that, though, this doesn't even stay a puzzle game. There are sections where the goal is to not die, and instead, you have to chase down a key through Super Meat Boy-esque areas. The key gets you farther along, eventually to a boss, which you must kill and, again, not die to. The bosses certainly don't factor in to the story, and they certainly don't fit the parameters the game already set up (Namely, the goal of dying).\n\nSo we're looking at a casual puzzle / intense precision platformer game- Two genres that are really at odds with each other. Unfortunately for the precision platformer moments, the movement is binary- You're either moving, or you're not. This leads to some punishing situations, if you lightly tap one direction or the other, and it is something that Super Meat Boy did a fantastic job of mitigating. In addition to that, the edge detection on blocks is unreliable, at best- There are numerous times where I've fallen before reaching the edge of a block, and other times where I've been able to jump a bit after I should have fallen. This makes any precision jumping an absolute nightmare.\n\nAnd then there are the gimmicks. Now, this isn't a bad term. All games use gimmicks. Portal's gimmick was, well, portals, and it worked astoundingly well. But Squishy here just uses too many of them. Halfway through the first chapter, you'll discover that the only solution to a puzzle is by wrapping around the screen; a function that is rarely used since then. Towards the end, there will be a level where you can fly- No preamble, no use afterwards, you can just fly for that one level. For one of the boss fights, you can suddenly throw fireballs (Which is explained by a textbox right before, saying "You can temporarily use the power of fire!"), turning the game into very much an action platformer- Not a puzzle one, not a precision one.\n\nOn top of all of these, there are still teleporters, boost blocks, portals (As in, from Portal), forced darkness (Which obscures the ui, as well), and various other block types, most of which are only used in a couple of levels. Some of which are only used in one level.\n\nBeyond that, I can't tell if the game takes itself seriously or not, with signs that mock the player, calling them a 'noob,' and stating that 'the following level will make them ragequit.' With regards to the former, hard for the sake of hard does not make a good game. Puzzles with trick solutions do not feel rewarding at all. Both of these points are valid at many, many points.\n\nAnd then there are the bugs... So many bugs... I've gotten graphical glitches, inputs sticking, and other people have gotten game-breaking bugs, trapping them in an area known as the "secret hat shop." In addition to that, they apparently left in some debug function where you can right-click anywhere to teleport there. An incredible oversight, and I seriously wonder if anyone playtested this before sending it off to Steam.\n\nAll in all, this does not, in any aspect, feel like a professional game. I respect what the developers have done, and the fact that they have gotten their vision out on the market, but they have a looong way to go (Both in game design, and programming) before making a real gem. I hope they keep at it, because this game started with a really interesting premise. I wish they kept to that.","March 4, 2015","false","4.4"," 57 of 90 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","57","90","4","14"

And the experiences I had with it are unbeatable for that price!\nIt's a funny puzzle platformer from the creators of Hero Siege. You are a pink piglet with an yellow sweater, that made a deal with the devil - The devil is bored and wants Squishy to die 31 times for his entertainment and if Squishy achieves that, the devil will kick him out of hell into heaven to his parents. Soo, I said to myself, how hard can it be to die in this game? Turns out - hard :)\nThe levels are designed with love and thought and I found myself thinking hard right after the first 4 or 5. The music is decent, unintrusive and in tone with the cheerful graphics of the game.\nThe controls are tight and responsive and my universal cheap gamepad is working. I'm not exactly a fan of the momentum in jumping for those kind of games, but this one uses it wisely and reasonably.\nI would love to be able to view the hilarious intro again, but I haven't found a way to do it.\nBeside the story mode, there is a speedrun one (you need to beat the game to unlock it), an extra game where you try to survive as long as u can (my record is 46sec) and like 5 different hats to get by completing actually kinda hard objectives - beat the game, gather all secrets, gather all apples and so on...\nAs you progress in the game, your object will change and you will have to try to survive, speedrun trough levels to shoot down a bird and what not!\nI would say this game is definitely worth the price and with the current discount is actually a bargain - speedruns, achievements, trade cards ... can recommend wholeheartedly!\n\nTL:DR or you want to see me in action - check my first impressions video as I play the levels 1-1 to 1-10 - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330999946","October 24, 2014","true","2.3"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","24","32","0","0"

The puzzles can be hard as hell sometimes, and damn does the puzzle designer try to fool you. Nothing is ever unfair or anything, but definitely misleading. You got like two extra boxes of nitro? You put it in your head that you need to work with them, but in the end you slap yourself in the face for realizing the real solution never required them. It really makes you have to run through and think about every little part of a level and decide what is and isn't necessary.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is a platformer with a simple objective: kill yourself. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is it hard to kill yourself in this game. There are levels where you gotta live to continue on through the world, which is something you gotta get used to.

I'll let you figure that out for yourself, if you aren't a noob (according to the game's writer). Yeah, don't let those wooden signs talking you down keep you down! Go fall into those spikes and win!\n\nGraphics\nBeautiful pixelation man. Just delicious and consisten throughout.\n\nMusic\nPretty awful and repetitive from world to world. It's all the same melody with minor alterations. I don't think the key ever changes :P\n\nANYWAY, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. Pick this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. It's only 3.29CAD full price, man.

You can to do a level over and over again to get to the next part, you could play the start of a level 100 times. You can have a 10% chance of getting to the end part of a level where takes you 3 minutes and then die because you now need to play that part a few times. The story of the game, back to the start and see how for you get this time. Each level is a series of events where you have a chance of dying and where there is a time period between these events. So go back to the start and try again and see how far you get this time. You might as well roll a dice and if you get a 3, restart, wait 1 min before rolling again and if you get it 10 times without dying go to the next level, but don't forget the first few times you get that far you have almost no way of progressing.\n\nThe levels where you are meant to die are better, but as for the boss battles, they are completely random, you might as well roll a dice 10 times and if you get evens all 10 times you win.\n\nYou have to wonder why this game was 9p, my theory is that a few people or a person got game maker and played around with it, by putting a few assets into game logic and an engine that was already there and adding a few bits and pieces. And since Steam takes 20% and Game Maker probably takes 30% and not forgetting the tax man, they just discounted the game to 9p.\n\nThat being said, it is still a game, it has some fun and was 9p.

He remembers his parents telling him that after death you get sent to heaven, and he stupidly commits suicide. He then finds himself in Hell and needs to kill himself 31 times or something to go to heaven. It's understandable that as a 2D platformer aimed at a kiddish-like audience with the appeal to humour, the story would be less than decent. However, it completely mistakens the point of many platformer games, where the goal is to "survive", not to "die". There is no motivation created in completing the game, and you can't unlock the other mode without completing the adventure mode. Clunky story, unappealing to complete.\n\nWith a less than decent story, you'd expect the controls to actually be somewhat better and smooth, considering it's a 2D platformer with surprisingly crisp graphics. However, I was left spamming my keyboard, trying to find a button which would let me click on buttons to click "yes" and play the game. What's considerably worse, is you can't even use your mouse to nagivate in the menu screen, you press <Esc> to go to the pause menu, <Enter> for "okay" in the Pause menu and <Spacebar> in the Main Menu. It seems that both <Enter> and <Spacebar> were dedicated to their respective menus. Heck even <Y> didn't work for restarting the game.\n\nThe somewhat confusing design of the level is a mess to start with. You get an easy tutorial level, and after that a heap of level designs that aim to push your brain to the max. At level 1-4, jumping on the boxes were near impossible as:\n\n1. They dissappeared over a short period of time after being stepped on\n2. Pressing the up+left/right arrow keys caused Squishy to jump, land, then run forward without any input from the player\n3. After jumping and falling down, you're forced to restart as you can't even jump up to the platform.\n\nThis is then repeated over the course of the level, where 1 minor mistake and glitch on the computer's part will cause you to inevitably lose any chances of killing yourself and progressing within the level. After this experience, I became very good and fast at restarting the game i.e. press <Esc>, then press <Enter>.\n\nClunky system, sloppy controls, glitched and buggy - it's almost at an unbearable state, where there you don't get any motivation in playing. The game does offer a humourous (and incredibly stupid story), crisp graphics and "3" cards (excuse the pun), all at a generous price of just $0.14usd.\n\nNot too bad, considering the price, but there are definitely better developed 2D platformers out there for free. Unless of course, you'd be willing to pay a few cents just so you could end up like Squishy.","March 5, 2015","false","1.2"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","23","40","0","0"

Never. No matter what your circumstances are, you must persevere. You must go on. Things will get easier with time, and you will survive. Not even if you were accidentally born with a cow for a head. Not a cow's head, but a whole cow. That'd be really uncomfortable. But is that worth taking your life over? Think of all the milk you could make. Or if you really have to sneeze and it just won't come out? This too shall pass. Though you may be in insufferable agony, a soul tempered within the flames of Hell shines brighter. Cleansed of sin in hellfire, you are stronger, purer, and have a will stronger than clamshell packaging.\n\n\nBut this game gives the wrong idea.\n\n\nSquishy The Suicidal Pig just makes it that easy, huh? Just kill yourself, and everything will be okay again? Huh? That's not a good life lesson, Squish. You're teaching these kids terrible things. Squish might not have it easy, selling his cheap little puzzle platformer for 99 cents on Steam and on the Google Play Store just to make ends meet. And his parents died, and he's in literal Hell for killing himself. But does he really have to kill himself again?\n\n\nLike the game clearly says in the title, you are a squishy pig. And your goal in each level is to die. There will be many puzzles impeding your progress, but you need to figure out how to manipulate the objects in order to kill yourself. I'll admit, it's an interesting gameplay mechanic. It's not something that's seen too often. Although it has been done before. Better, even.\n\n\nRight off the bat, it's easy to tell that Squish is not quite a high budget title. It looks like something you'd play for free on your school computer instead of working on your PowerPoint presentation on wolves or chlamydia or whatever you're researching.\n\n\nAs if the dollar price tag hid the fact that this is a cheaply-made game. At the very least it's not ugly, the spritework is nice and there's some decent animation. Like how Squish is just sweating nonstop as he idles, which seems very fitting for a suicidal pig in a sweater. The soundtrack can be a little grating, but it's mostly tolerable.\n\n\nBut Squish's so-called claim to fame is his excellent gameplay. Clever puzzles and platforming. This is what Squish is staking it all on. They clearly know that they're low-budget, they wouldn't be charging pocket change for the game if they thought they created a piece of art. They're hoping to skate by on quality mechanics and charm.\n\n\nMuch like everything else in Squish's life though, this is all a lie. Squishy is definitely charming, I'll give him that. But his game is muddled by sloppy physics and garbage puzzle design. Not to mention a clear lack of identity.\n\n\nSquish will jump from puzzle platformer that requires you to die, to a Super Meat Boy-esque platformer hell that asks you to survive every few levels. Which would be perfectly fine if the controls were built for platforming. But no, Squish's movements are so imprecise. Not to mention buggy. I've had to restart puzzles multiple times because it wouldn't register that I was walking off a cliff, and I was just levitating in space as I walked off. Or my jump button suddenly losing functionality when I really needed to jump. The controls are responsive most of the time, but that's not good enough in a game that requires tight controls and twitch jumping.\n\n\nI'd be more forgiving on the controls if the game at least copied everything that made Super Meat Boy great, instead of just saying "Oh, this game is hard. Let's make ours hard too" and thinking it'd automatically make their game good. The levels can be unnecessarily tedious, involving lots of time-consuming arranging of parts and movement. Squishy's stubby pig legs don't quite move fast enough, which makes progressing through certain portions an awkward crawl.\n\n\nAnd this is made even more unbearable by the game's absurd use of checkpoints. They're there, I've seen a few of them. But they're rarely ever used, especially where they should be used. Should you mess up on a puzzle, you're restarting back from the beginning. Should you die on an annoying platformer hell level? Back to the start. Unless you're playing one of the rare levels where they thought "maybe this one could use a checkpoint" and just so happened to place one.\n\n\nI want to like Squish. I really do. He could use the moral support, you know? He could use a friend. But he's such a worthless piece of garbage. He's late to the party. He's the early 2000's flash game, complete with the early 2000's sense of humor. But here he is, released in late 2014, trying to make jokes about n00bs and cutesy farm animals being graphically slaughtered.\n\n\nI tried to give it a chance, but the puzzles aren't even well executed. It frequently relies on tricking the player, leaving red herring objects in many courses purely to confuse the player. Or using a "joke level" where the answer was to ignore the puzzle altogether because the answer was something so unbelievably "obvious" to begin with.\n\n\nNot to mention the fact that it rips many of its puzzles directly from a better version of it, a 2008 Flash game called "Karoshi: Suicide Salaryman". Which is a whole dollar cheaper, at the reasonable price of free. It might not be as pretty, but the puzzles are a lot better put together and a lot more satisfying. It's like Squish just decided to rip the concept of Karoshi and paste it to the concept of Super Meat Boy for an ultimately frustrating platformer.\n\n\nI'm disappointed in Squish. It's a decent platformer, I was able to play through levels and enjoy them for what they were, but it's weighed down by so much baggage. It's like they really wanted to nail the "suicidal" vibe of the game by giving it so much baggage that it's just unpleasant to be around. You might still want to stick around, just to help Squish stay strong. But really, I think it's time to just let go.\n\n\nBe free, Squish. Go on. This is clearly the way you were meant to go. This is your self-righteous suicide. You were too good for this world, Squish. This world is a ball of toxic hate and evil.\n\n\nAscend to the heavens, Squish. You're in a place as pure and perfect as you are now.\n\n\nYou are truly blessed.","February 9","false","3.5"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","18","31","6","3"

(Psst.  Yeah, you.  Just play along.  I'm going somewhere with this)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWhy did you read this line!?  You fail!  Go back to the start and try again! (No, really, just bear with me)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nOh, too bad!  Another failure line.  Are you stupid or something?  You gotta stop reading these.  Back to the top, bro.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLooking for the review?  Guess what.  Uh-huh.  You: the top.  Try again.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAnd with apologies, the review:\n\nSo what was that all about, you ask?  I just disrespected a small chunk of your time and insulted your intelligence for my arbitrary punishments.  And that's just horrible.  As you might expect, this is a metaphor for Squishy the Suicidal Pig's gameplay.  Let's look:\n\nOkay, so a puzzle platformer about a pig who has made a bet with the devil that's left him with a bunch of extra lives and the challenge is to burn them all up to earn a "Get Out of Hell Free" card.  That's a premise that's got a ton of charm and potential.  I'm guessing it's that premise that's drawn you in for a closer look.  I expected some free-form puzzling that poked fun at the platforming genre where deaths are easy and so often cheap.\n\nUnfortunately, no.  It's not that.  It's just another "ragequit"-pandering frustration platformer, schizophrenically mixed with some janky pseudo physics and guess-what-the-designer-is-thinking puzzles.  But make no mistake.  Squishy isn't bad for not being the game I would have liked.  If you've got the platforms and the fireballs, I'll dodge 'em.  And you desperately need a better HVAC guy.  Point is: like the contents of several shot glasses, hard can be fun.  Although in both cases, if I end up falling into a pit, it had better be because of my own miscalculations in what I can handle.\n\nThis is not the case with Squishy.  Arbitrary is really the watchword for this game.  To tie it to the platforming: on the levels where it switches for no particular reason to a "not die" level, sometimes there are checkpoints.  The checkpoints only work once and then you restart the whole level.  Why?  Arbitrary punishment! To prove that you're willing to put in the man hours and really prove that you've nailed the level up until the brand new mechanic that will definitely kill you a half dozen times before you can possibly suss out a feel for it.  Or perhaps the developer just thought you'd be really pleased with seeing your indistinct hit box in action as you die from a deadly pendulum coming somewhat near your sprite.  Time for a side-scrolling shooter level!  Wait.  What?\n\nI'm sure I could easily point out a dozen more examples of peculiar and unfair design, but ultimately Squishy breaks the two rules anybody out to make a precision platformer needs to put in big black text on a stark white background and set as their desktop wallpaper until the end of time:\n\n1.  You must hold your game to the same standard of precision you demand from the player.\n\nYou want super responsive jumping that isn't competing with other animations. A sense of weight and speed is also welcome if you're going to ask the player to pass within a hair's breadth of hazards. The hit boxes must not extend outside the visible sprite.  And even then that's the minimum.  One pixel of toe touching a hazard should probably be forgiven.   Look at how bullet-hell shooters do it by only making the player's center mass vulnerable.  (Now look at what you've done, Squishy: you've got me calling bullet-hell shooters sensible)\n\n2.  The player is going to fail a lot.  Respect their time and get them back in the action quickly.\n\nPut a checkpoint after a lengthy segment and don't make it a limited use thing.  Really, we're supposed to be making fun of the idea of a limited resource representing your number of tries, right Squishy?  If the player dies after something like that, the only thing you're challenging is their patience.  To its credit, Squishy does have a dedicated "reload the level" button that helps with this, but any good will gained from that is instantly lost with every boss that has to waste around 10 seconds of my time with its unskippable intro dialogue every single time I restart.  Don't do that.  Especially don't do that if your boss is hard enough you might be dead in less than that amount of time.  And double-extra don't do that if it's a throwaway line that does nothing to characterize the boss outside of a generic bad-guy line.  Thanks, I think I got that much from them being the level boss and/or the devil.\n\nBetter yet, forget the wallpaper thing.  Tattoo these on yourself in mirror-writing Memento style so you never lose sight of your redemption.\n\nSo now that my mighty tirade against Squishy's platforming has thundered across the primeval plains devouring lesser megafauna, let's ask: could Squishy be saved from a negative review by clever puzzling, a strong visual aesthetic, or its narrative elements?  Nope.\n\nBack to the word arbitrary that I seem to be hung up on; Squishy's puzzles are that.  Most of the puzzles are variants on get-box-in-air-and-get-crushed-by-it, but almost all the others are one-off tricks where you have to discover some completely unsignposted rule.  There's one level where you jump and don't fall, another where you have to try and wrap around the level, and one where you have to seemingly glitch your way through a fan that blows you upwards, just to name a few.  Oh, and there's blue and orange portals in some levels.  Because of course there are.\n\nCan we please stop paying homage to Portal in our puzzle games?  I know every game would like to strive for the same level of wit, character, and solid design, but if you had those things in spades, then the ref would only hold you back.\n\nOn that note, the whole Squishy the Pig, deal with the pig devil, etc narrative that drew you in really doesn't go beyond just that much as a framing device at the beginning and end.  Don't expect to see Squishy or any of the antagonists portrayed beyond one or two sentences a pop.  Of course, I've been platforming since the dawn of the 90s so I can accept a back-of-the-box type story.  Still, strong character can save an otherwise mediocre game, especially if it proves a draw in the first place.\n\nThe art style's a bit of a mixed bag.  The game is pleasantly colorful and some of the sprites are appealing.  Squishy's idle animation does make him look nervous and sweaty, for instance.  But then you've got a slew of boxes and platforms and buttons that look very MS Painty.  The art's not going to carry this one, but it's not offensive overall.\n\nWhat is a bit offensive is how buggy the game is.  During my first run through - before the latest patch - I found the exterminator's bonanza, but even during a quick refresher run of a couple levels before this review I got stuck in a wall, missing assets stopped me from beating a level, and the final boss looped forever outside of my reach.  Now, the dev is passionate enough about the game to keep patching it, but then again, should it be on sale on Steam if it still needs that much work?\n\nOf course, if you're just getting this game because it goes on sale for less money than you'll get for selling the digital trading cards then Squishy will live up to all your desires! And why did you read this review anyway?  10/10, etc\n\nBut yeah, it is cheap this one.  I guess as one last point in its favor before the damning post: it's not like it will cost you much to try.  Mostly your time.  And that's the big reason why I can't thumb this one up:  it's just too damn smug about wasting my time when it can't see fit to fix its own issues.  That's what all that fooling with you up top was about.\n\nAgain, sorry about that.  I actually think you are discerning and very smart for reading my review.","May 17, 2015","false","8.0"," 64 of 120 people (53%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","53","64","120","37","4"

Movement is sluggish and in longer levels, it's downright frustrating to have to spend minutes retracing your steps over and over to react to every dirty trick that comes out of nowhere. Bosses are buggy and very RNG dependent. The boss of the second level finally caused the game to cross the line from the good kind of frustrating to the bad kind. I'd fought it so many times that I've seen all sorts of bugs...nitro starting out as an immovable explosive before being icon swapped, immovables getting stuck in midair and stacking in front of the boss' face, and of course explosions with a radius nearly twice the size of the graphics. The physics are buggy and unpredictable, due to the arbitrary sudden loss of momentum with the immovable explosives in that battle.\n\nFix the game breaking bugs and I'll consider retrying and re-reviewing this game.","April 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The problem with the game is simple at its core: The gameplay's lack of precise control in what is essence a ‚Äúrage‚Äù platformer doesn't help to complement the unique take on gameplay. Levels should be designed to be quick and they are not, leading to unnecessary repetition and frustration all around, and it's not frustration of the good kind. It's got a cheap price, but I find that there's better games to spend your money on, even if you're looking for a rage platformer. Not worth your time.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nIt's a unique concept, I'll give it that. It had potential.\nCheap price.\n-:\nControls didn't do the game justice. I never felt in true control.\nLevel design should have been quick to play, not long drawn out levels that the game gave. It led to frustration for one miss: and let to repetition that just led to bad frustration.\nIt's aesthetic...it didn't work for me.

Sounds good, but it only manages to keep that promise for just a few first levels. The game will then ask you NOT to die, but instead to survive. And that pretty much goes for a majority of the levels after that, breaking the cool premise game had at the beggining.\n\nNext thing, HITBOXES! Everything has a terrible hitbox around them. Even your character will sometimes fall out of the platform while standing around edges, even though you could clearly see yourself standing right on it. Same thing goes for bosses. During the first boss level, an infinite amount of crates will be falling at you from the skyes, giving you only seconds to react to them. Due to poor hitboxes, you never know if you are in a safe distance from them or not. This results in a complete frustration, when you got killed from a falling crate while standing two metres from it.\n\nAs I said, the game just doesn't know what it wants to be. To me, I think it wants to be another Super Meat Boy clone. And while the game has checkpoint system, you are not allowed to die even once per level (at least not it the first level, when the checkpoint system is introduced). The game was designed to beat in a one go, but with all the flaws game has, it's completely impossible. You die, you have to start from the begginning (replaying can take you 15-20 minutes to get to your previous position).\n\nSummary:\n+ good idea for a puzzle platformer\n+ nice artstyle and backgrounds\n\n- jumping and platforming\n- later levels require you to survive, breaking the main game mechanic\n- pushing blocks around could have been improved a little\n- hitboxes\n- mediocre and repetitive soundtrack\n\n6/10\n","August 9, 2015","false","2.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The concept is interesting but the execution falls flat.\n\nNothing about this game is especially well done.  The artwork does not stand out, I thought it looked sloppy myself but I suppose it is meant to have a unique charm?  Look at the screenshots for yourself.\n\nThe sound as well is best turned off and is of low quality.\n\nAll that could be forgiven in a platform game if there was good control.  Sadly, this is the biggest failing of the game.  A game like this needs great controls to be anything other than average.  The controls are poor.  This is made worse by the lack of checkpoints, so failure due to the poor controls means you are starting over from scratch.  Add to this the occasional bug which will freeze all of your input, and this average game falls to unplayably frustrating.\n\nAt the time of this writing the game is only $1.  That is still overpriced.  Messy, frustrating game when there are so many good, cheap platformers on Steam.\n\n2/10","February 3","false","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Fullscreen option is available so it isn't stuck as a tiny pixel screen, you get a much bigger pixel screen!\n\nThe story is really macabre and original, and the levels themselves are so rage-inducing I had to shut my computer and just lay down for a bit. Yep. I think we all raged at the f*cking bird level in the beginning trying to collect all the apples at the same time. You know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of this game is not being able to change my control settings, I want to be able to move with WASD and space to jump. I'm a very simple gamer with simple needs, and that is what I want for all my games. I don't want to have to learn a new control language because it messes me up with timed jumps, which probably contributed to 90% of my rage level.\n\nOverall though, this game is cheap and I knew what I was getting. I enjoy it for what it is, and hope some bug issues will be fixed and hope maybe the creators will update the game with control settings.","March 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaptainCalcon/recommended/318430/","FaptainCalcon","Mermaid Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaptainCalcon/","73 products in account","No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Squishy the Suicidal Pig. I've spent countless hours chipping away at blocks, gathering the necessary materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only occupy my mind's eye. I've also spent just as many hours exploring, spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado. My character ‚Äì my entire Squishy the Suicidal Pig world ‚Äì constantly evolves into whatever I want it to be. I tell my own stories, I write my own destiny and I bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time.\n\nHowever, Squishy the Suicidal Pig is yet another Mario Kart clone, as it presents cartoonish racing competition headlined by colorful mascot characters; here, the personified Red, Green, Yellow, Orange and Blue chocolate candies most recognized from their series of television commercials from the past several years. The moderate star power of the candy characters is the most impressive thing to be found in this package, which is a sad reality that sets you up well to be disappointed in every other area of the game.\n\nAt the very least, it provides blistering firefights and brilliantly crafted worlds to have them in. In fact, the exceptional caliber of its moment-to-moment gameplay is what partially excuses the fact that it never quite realizes its grand design. For as fun as it is, Squishy the Suicidal Pig just doesn't fully commit to all of its disparate parts, making it simultaneously many different things, and none of them at all.\n\nOf course, it wouldn‚Äôt be a Squishy the Suicidal Pig game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Squishy delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation‚Äôs space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.\n\nAfter the letdown of Madden 25 last year, Squishy the Suicidal Pig feels like a mostly fresh start for the series. The increased emphasis on defensive play, a great new play-calling system, and the return of long-time favorites makes this year‚Äôs Squishy one of the best in recent memory, even if it could still use work in regards to its stale commentary and longstanding bugs. As a lifelong Squishy and football fan, I‚Äôm impressed. This year‚Äôs game is both exciting and reassuring that EA Sports isn‚Äôt wasting opportunities to improve the series.\n\nPros\n+Smart waggling\n+Great with friends\n\nCons\n‚Äì Some bad games\n‚Äì Boring with AI\n\n2/10","June 18, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ubo/recommended/318430/","ubo","Rik | Ubo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ubo/","42 products in account","Long story short: Squishy: The Suicidal pig is a brilliant puzzle-platformer with brain-crunching puzzles during it's best moments, but a horribly frustrating mess with bad controls during it's worst.\n\nThis game promises to be a 2D puzzle-platformer with an exciting twist: instead of trying to stay alive, like you do in most games, you must help the depressed pig Squishy to commit suicide. That sounds a lot easier than it actually is. There are multiple ways of taking your own life, varying from jumping into spikes all the way to building complex traps in order to drop wooden crates on yourself. What's consistent throughout the game, however, is that you have to solve increasingly difficult puzzles in order to be able to commit suicide. And some of those puzzles are really well made.\n\nEspecially during the earlier parts of the game you'll be playing levels that initially look impossible, but slowly unravel themselves as having very simple (but not so obvious) solutions. I really enjoy the solving the problems that are presented to Squishy. All elements in these levels have a function and those stages are some of the best parts of Squishy: The Suicidal pigs. Somehwat more common than those well-thought out levels, however, are levels that are purely made to frustrate, with many elements that don't seem to have a function and solutions that are so far-fetched that they take much of the fun out of the game. They're still kind of nice to play, but they feel unsatisfactory if you know how beautifully this game shines during it's better parts.\n\nMuch, much worse are the platforming levels (luckily there aren't many of them). Instead of trying to kill yourself like you do in the 'regular' levels, here you have to find a key in order to pass through a gate. Most of these levels are very difficult, not because of the well thought-out puzzles but because of the careful timing that's required. That wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for Squishy: The Suicidal Pig's sloppy controls. During the puzzle levels, you hardly notice the significant delay between your input and Squishy's reaction, but it becomes terribly frustrating during the platforming parts. To make things even worse, you sometimes have to finish these already difficult level in a (very) limited amount of time.\n\nWhat's also kind of disappointing is the unpolished nature of this game. While the graphics are pixelated, I think they're quite charming and I don't really have much to say about it. However, the soundtrack of this game is just plain bad. It sounds like a MIDI-file and I turned it off after the first level. What really disappointed me is how lazily the devs have ported this game. The game constantly refers to console buttons that you can't use on your keyboard and you can't use your mouse. Well, actually you can use your mouse, but not in a way that's intended; you can teleport to about everywhere by right-clicking. I think it's a debugging feature that they forgot to remove and it isn't much of an issue if you have to discipline to resist abusing it, but it's still disappoingting that the devs were too lazy to remove it.\n\nLuckily, Squishy: The Suicidal Pig is a really decent game when you look past the platforming levels and it's unpolished nature. The game offers some nice gimmicks besides the main campaign as well. These are a gamemode called "Battle" (Two players fight with each other using different parts of the same keyboard. It can be funny at times, but gets old really quick.), a gamemode called "Impossible Level" (It isn't impossible, just insanely hard. Too hard to be fun, actually.) and my personal favourite, "Survival". Here you must avoid crates that drop from the sky for as long as possible while you are dodging a spiky ball that rolls through the stage. The time you survived is saved and because there are leaderboards (both personal and global), improving your time can be really fun.\n\nI paid only ‚Ç¨0,14 for it and at that price it's a really fun game. I even dare to say that the game is worth it's full price as well. Just don't expect to buy a masterpiece when you click on the "Add to Cart"-button.","March 6, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Some levels are pretty easy but some, uh...it depends on how fast your hands can achieve, and how agile yourself can be...OR, rage quit (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª\n\nIncidentally, in retrospect it seems that the bosses at insane level are really impossible, because of bug you can't win it.

C'mon don't do this if you buy it, just enjoy the game, but not played by the game.\n\nEnjoy the black humor, and rare bugs(stuck in stage 3 after buying secret hats, while left click on screen when Jesse Coyote speaking) and yourself as a pig.","March 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a series of free flash puzzle platformers where the goal is to jump into spikes or drop a box on your head, since the objective of the game is actually to kill yourself! It's a neat little game, with several bite-size levels to keep you satisfied the way Warioware does. The graphics aren't great and feel like they're fresh out of those way-too-edgy late 90s flash videos, but they're serviceable and do their job. I have fond memories of those games, so when I saw this game was on sale for just over a freakin' quarter and was mechanically similar, I figured why not.\n\nGraphics and soundtrack are the only things this game does better than the Karoshi Suicide Salaryman series. Credit where credit is due, it's a pretty good-looking game. It isn't pandering to the retro aesthetic that so many pixelated modern games do, and I appreciate that. There's also a fair amount of effort put into this game, and a substantial amount of levels for the price. There's even a speedrun mode, which is nice to have even if I'd never use it.\n\nUnfortunately, that doesn't change the fact that playing this game is a chore. The controls are archaic - you press up to jump instead of having a dedicated jump button separate from your movement buttons. It's a little thing but you get thrown off every once in a while. It's difficult, and not in the way a game like Dark Souls or Castlevania is difficult. Think I Wanna Be The Guy or something that's unfairly hard in an attempt to artificially extend the playtime.\n\nThe gameplay feels similarly dated, as there are no checkpoints. If the levels were shorter, this wouldn't be a problem, but far too often you'll accidentally screw up later in the level, so you'll hit the R button (which you have to find out on your own) only to find yourself back at the beginning, and have to slog through a puzzle you already know how to do but don't move quick enough to do so without getting frustrated.\n\nThe price doesn't save a game from not being fun. I know it might seem unfair to keep comparing this to a different game, but I cannot emphasize enough how much better the Karoshi series is at nearly everything Squishy the Suicidal Pig attempts. From the treatment of an inherently messed up subject matter to having to temporarily avoid killing yourself, every single thing in Squishy the Suicidal Pig feels like it's been done better before, and for free.\n\nThe one comfort is I've already sold the cards I got from wasting my time on this and gotten my money back.","May 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

NEVER buy this game. The only reason i have it is because it was 14 cents. And I still don't think it's worth it. This game is just a simple puzzle game, and if it was free, it wouldn't be that bad. But because you are required to pay for it, that just makes me angry, when there are games almost exatly like this (if not better) that are FREE, and you have to pay 2 dollars (at the moment 14 cents) for this, makes it bad. So, i'll say it again. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.\n\nok, i think i'll actually review it now. So, this game, like I said, is a puzzle-platformer were the goal is to kill yourself each time. while the goal is unique, the gameplay isn't, basicly you push blocks around and blow up other boxes, whle activating fans to get through the level. only problem is, the game isn't direct, and, if you're like me, your gonna screw up a lot, which is very fustrating. i didn't have fun playing it, and like with most puzzle platformers (FREE ONES) i got bored, but i PAID for this, so i feel very let down. I'm sure that it gets somewhat better as you go along, but don't even bother, just go to armorgames and pick a game from there and save your money. So, there you have it, dont buy this game for full price, and if you REALLY want it, pick it up now and sell the trading cards that you get so you get your money back. But, i still think thats a bad idea. Just keep your money, and play a free game, instead of one that should be free.","March 8, 2015","false","0.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","11","20","3","0"

It's great, if your up for challenging levels (especially if you want all the apples) you'll love this game. Here's the catch though, in this game you don't get to a flag pole or a finish line of any means, your goal is commit suicide. I feel like it's a very interesting idea for game, and that's why I love it. Conclusion: If you ever have an extra dollar in your steam wallet BUY this game, I promise you'll have a great and challenging experience.","October 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an unpolished gem with an original concept, a funny story, a unique game mechanic, and a pleasing art style. You can tell the creator actually cared about what they were making. With a few bits of polishing this game could easily be sold for 5 to 10 bucks on steam. In the mean time Squishy is still worth buying, if only to assure people that not every indie developer is a talentless hack.","October 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not something I personally would've bought otherwise but there's nothing I would really complain about after the fix besides the overall difficulty of the game.\n\nWorth trying out if you like a good challenge and got some spare money but probably not worth full price to everyone.","May 22","true","16.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are many different ways to kill yourself, such as jumping out of the screen, jumping into spikes, jumping into axes, getting blown up by TNT or nitro blocks, having a block drop on your head, and even getting hit by a spikey ball.  These kind of levels are usually the puzzle kind of levels.  There are also some levels where you have to not die and dodge every obstacle that comes your way.  These kinds of levels are the platformer kind of levels.  I haven't seen a game like this since Mr. Karoshi, a game that came out on the IOS many years ago.  This is a great game that is very unique and fun to play.  There are four worlds with about 10 levels in each world, so you almost never get bored!  There are also minigames, such as battle, which is multiplayer, and survival, where you try to dodge obstacles and survive as long as you can.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beriberii/recommended/318430/","beriberii","Captain Space","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beriberii/","26 products in account","This is one of the worst games I‚Äôve ever played\n\nSquishy the Suicidal pig looked like a fun ride on paper. It‚Äôs a retroesque puzzle platformer with a unique spin on the conventional view of lives. It looked like something really special.\n\nand then I played it.\n\n\n\nThe first part of the game is composed of cutscenes that explain the plot. Both the cutscenes and the story itself are awkwardly written. They don‚Äôt really make logical sense. But, hey, this is a platformer so I was cool with it.\n\nThe tutorial was nice too, except for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt tell you any of the controls. This is a problem because unless you know going in the spacebar is the action button, it‚Äôs impossible to close out of the signs, effectively making signs death points until you give up and google the controls. I spent 10 minutes trying to beat the level by avoiding every single sign before I realized that it was actually impossible. That‚Äôs 10 minutes of my life that are gone. Forever.\n\nThe biggest problem with Squishy, which becomes glaringly apparent as soon as you leave the tutorial, is that you can‚Äôt pull blocks. Or take back mistakes in any way short of full-on restarting the level.\n\nThe puzzles in the game aren‚Äôt inherently bad. They‚Äôre actually some of the nicer puzzles I‚Äôve seen. The problem is that you have to solve them with the precision required for open heart surgery.\nIf you push a block against a wall, you lose. You can‚Äôt complete the puzzle, and you have to restart.\nIf you push two blocks so close together that you can‚Äôt get in between them, you lose.\nIf you position a block slightly to the right of where it should be when you blow up a bomb, you lose.\nIf you do anything even one step out of order or try to solve it in a way even remotely different than the way it was intended, you lose.\n\nIt‚Äôs the gameplay equivalent of being hit over the head repeatedly with a hammer. It‚Äôs a memory game, not asking of you your wits but your ability to use trial and error. It asks you of your time, of your willingness to sit there for 20 minutes doing the same puzzle over and over and over again until finally, for reasons beyond your comprehension, you accidentally made the crates line up in the way the dev wanted you to.\nAnd it doesn‚Äôt help that there‚Äôs a grindingly upbeat 10-second loop of music that plays forever, screaming into your soul and reminding you that you, your goals, and your quest are but puffs of smoke in a cold void that doesn‚Äôt care. That nothing you do will ever matter, and that in the end the song will still be there. Still playing. Forever.\n\nThere‚Äôs a kind of strange poetry in the way the music and gameplay for this game are compliments to each other. A poetry that you can‚Äôt even think long enough to appreciate while trying to play Squishy the Suicidal Pig.\n\nWhat irks me the most is how lazy the whole game seems. It‚Äôs like the guy who made this thought up a mildly interesting concept, then thought it was so great that the rest of the game didn‚Äôt even have to be good. The music, the graphics, the character design, everything about this game seems so half-done when you have to sit there staring at it for 5 eternities while you push around crates.\n\nGame developers throughout history have found spectacular ways to engage players and create difficulty in games, be it the puzzles in Portal, the enemy design in Chrono Trigger, or the complex combat situations in Fallout 3. This is the difficulty in Squishy the Suicidal Pig:\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/r9pm5k/8\n\nIn hindsight this game is an entirely accurate simulation of the hell it takes place in.\nIf the developer was trying to simulate the infinite pain and suffering of the burning eternity, I would have given this game 5 stars. Except it‚Äôs blatantly obvious that it wasn‚Äôt intentionally made that way, so it‚Äôs bad.","October 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

The collision detection is buggy and the platforming is nothing special.

It is a fantastic game with no bugs, so far, and nice and simple. However that is only if you have a controller. If you love gaming with a keyboard and mouse, like myself, this game will be extremely frustrating and next to impossible. The "programmers" have not yet implemented a feature where you can press two keys at the same time, and they both regestering. For example you have to be stationary to jump, making the game nearly impossible. Level 1-8 is where I gave up. You could not avoid a rock falling on your head while playing with the arrow keys. The developers really need to get this fixed so people who do not have a controller can still have a great gameplay experience.\n\nUPDATE: This game is no longer on sale and is now ¬£2. I was dissapointed when I got it at 69p so I highly advise you to look into this game before you spend ¬£2 on it.","July 30, 2015","false","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're basically a pig, and the goal of each level is to kill yourself by using various traps.\n\nI have only gotten a little into the game, but here are my thought, as of now.\n\nPros:\nLevel Design is unique.\nControl is good.\nCharming 8-Bit adventure.\nMusic is upbeat and catchy.\nMany fun levels.\nBoss Fights!\nMany modes, that probaly will make you come back to this game.\nOMFG SECRET HATZZZ STORE!!!\n\nCons:\nRestarting a level because of an accidental crate placement is annoying.\nNot telling you about different mechanics (Edges of screens are connected.)\nMusic gets repetative. Fast.\nOverall game idea is not that unique.\nNo button replacement, the arrow keys are your only opition.\nNot that many opitions for sound or, anything, really.\n\nOverall, I think this game is good, but not perfect. If you got a few bucks to spend, you like platforming-games or just wanna support Indie Developers, I would recommend this. The game just came out, so maybe some updates will fix the problem with the lack of options. Also, you can't 360 noscope in this game.

Watch as your character waddles at 0.5 miles an hour, as he slowly moves across the level in a literal attempt to kill yourself. The gameplay is essentially your character slowly moving across the level, moving boxes, activating levers and triggering explosions. With the main objective being your own death, you'd expect at least some funny and satisfying death animations. But no, it's just another splatter of blood from a falling crate or stabbing from spikes, with the word 'DEAD' flashing on your screen for about fifteen seconds before the game slowly transitions to the level selestion screen. An absolute waste of time and money, with extreme boredom as the main gameplay. Want to spend money still? Don't buy this game, and spend the cash on a hat on Team Fortress 2.

I remeber playing Karoshi Suicidal Salaryman and that was a *fantastic* flash game. I loved it and hoped to have a similar game to play with new graphics and storyline. I was horribly disappointed, however, because within the 0.2 hours I accumulated in front of this game, I sped through the first 10-15 levels. The game also features what seems to be the weakest storyline I have seen so far; I thought there was going to be some promise of storyline, seeing as there is a whole game dedicated to the achievement of the main character's soul desire to be with his parents. As I was playing with the controls, I also discovered that right clicking allows you to teleport the character to your mouse location, which I find truly unnecessary, where even if it was, there should at least be some sort of safety preventing people from randomly finding this so that it can be used in cases where there is a legitimate layering problem and the player is stuck. Considering I got the game for ~$0.10, I feel bad for expecting *anything* out of this purchase.

I remeber playing Karoshi Suicidal Salaryman and that was a *fantastic* flash game. I loved it and hoped to have a similar game to play with new graphics and storyline. I was horribly disappointed, however, because within the 0.2 hours I accumulated in front of this game, I sped through the first 10-15 levels. The game also features what seems to be the weakest storyline I have seen so far; I thought there was going to be some promise of storyline, seeing as there is a whole game dedicated to the achievement of the main character's soul desire to be with his parents. As I was playing with the controls, I also discovered that right clicking allows you to teleport the character to your mouse location, which I find truly unnecessary, where even if it was, there should at least be some sort of safety preventing people from randomly finding this so that it can be used in cases where there is a legitimate layering problem and the player is stuck. Considering I got the game for ~$0.10, I feel bad for expecting *anything* out of this purchase. You have failed me, customer reviews.","March 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Watch as your character waddles at 0.5 miles an hour, as he slowly moves across the level in a literal attempt to kill yourself. The gameplay is essentially your character slowly moving across the level, moving boxes, activating levers and triggering explosions. With the main objective being your own death, you'd expect at least some funny and satisfying death animations. But no, it's just another splatter of blood from a falling crate or stabbing from spikes, with the word 'DEAD' flashing on your screen for about fifteen seconds before the game slowly transitions to the level selestion screen. An absolute waste of time and money, with extreme boredom as the main gameplay. Want to spend money still? Don't buy this game, and spend the cash on a hat on Team Fortress 2. At least then you would've bought something you'd enjoy.","March 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then Adventures of Lolo 2 happened and random mechanics were introduced that were insane and not intuitive; also not explained to the player. THIS BREAKS PUZZLE GAMES AND DEVELOPERS SHOULD NEVER DO IT. EVER!\n\nAnd on top of that, the music licks needed to be longer. They aren't bad, just repeat *way* too often.","December 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 16, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","June 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","4","10","3","0"

First bit of the game welcomes the player with interesting puzzle mechanics but the latter part is really pathetically boring and repetitive. I don't know, maybe there has been too many great puzzle games.\n\nThe game is also very glitchy and needs lots of improvements. Clicking the main screen crashes the game, I mean, wat.\n\nTo be honest, I think the game would've been fine as Free to Play. Nothing in the game makes it as worthy as a buck. If you're going to buy this, keep in mind that it's nothing more of an online flash game.","June 7, 2015","false","7.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I like how the game makes you feel lost, happy about how good you did on a level and how it can make you rage over the next one. You pretty much have all the types of objectives: Kill yourself (not as  easy as it may seems sometimes), stay alive, 2-player battle mode, survival mode...\n\nOnly complain I got is how the controls can be very bad sometimes. The game often requires you to be precise with jump or to be rapid with jumping, but the controls are bad enough to make you rage sometimes (wait until you get to the angry bird first stay alive level). As some people have mentionned, the first levels will make you feel like you're beating the game, but once you complete about 7 levels or so, madness will ensue.\n\nTL;DR: fun, many levels, many modes but controls can easily make you die.","December 19, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing it for about 20 minutes I fell in love with this simple yet fun 2d platformer. It was challenging figuring out how I could kill myself in each level, and those damn key levels and boss fights were pretty tough. Its a fun game to spend a couple of hours on and move on (However I think I've spent like 15 hours on it), and is a nice lighthearted game. Its texture are basics and the game mechanics are sometimes buggy, but I reckon you should pick it up, especially if it is on sale.","April 13, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are well made and sometimes require you to think outside the box. The platforming is not as great, well suited for maneuvering around the map but less so when trying to do more precise movements. The game is really fun and enjoyable when the puzzles rely solely on thinking and problem solving. However, when the game asks you to jump over a pit, dodge an enemy or jump off a moving platform or something of that nature, the imprecise physics and jump controls can be a bother. While the majority of the levels are not like this, some of the marathon levels and nearly all the boss levels require you to stay alive. This makes these sequences the most "rage enducing" not because of the difficulty but because of the randomness of the AI and the wonky controls. These levels are in the minority, and if you can manage to get past them, this game is worth the playthrough. The level design, the art and the sense of humor are great. Besides, the game is dirt cheap. You certainly get your money's worth.","May 22, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then it throws these, don't die, survive levels at you. They ruin what was a good game. I can't get past level 3-4 due to the game being glitchy.

A neat little puzzle platformer based around a fairly unique idea. Had some interesting puzzle design that complimented the core mechanic; killing yourself. Then the game decided it needed levels were you don't kill yourself and instead play a basic platformer with nothing really that interesting in it. In fact it just makes you realise the games flaws, it's pretty damn buggy. Nothing game breaking but can mean having to restart the stage or at best walk back to a certain point to press a button that didn't work because of a bug. The game's level design on the stay alive platform levels is also really bad. Nothing of challenge, just mild inconvinences like pushing a box one pixel the wrong way and having to restart the stage and do it all again because you can't reach the other side. The platforming levels contain very weak puzzle elements that anyone can figure out in a second. It's at this point the game becomes a lot more frustrating than it is fun. Then the game introduces boss battles and they are some of the worse boss mechanics I have ever seen. I only reached the first before deciding it was not worth seeing what else the game could offer but I still feel that the first boss should be a standard setter and it's so very poor. I know this game's super cheap but that doesn't excuse the frustrating and broken gameplay. If the game becomes no fun and simply a rage quit test then it's really worth nothing at all.","April 18, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes solving the puzzles in how to kill him rather fun, and the fun of playing a platformer that tasks you with failing is a wonderfully interesting concept that's executed fairly well. There is something inherintly satisfying in seeing the tearful porcine protagonist turn into giblets after piecing together the path to his death, and in those first few levels in particular, I was right on board.\n\nOf course, this being a 2D platformer, Squishy couldn't stick to his guns, and began throwing "rage" levels at you where you're supposed to live and make it to the end, often times capped off with a boss at the end. No big deal in concept as it does change things up, but treading the fine line of fun difficulty with "why am I subjecting myself to this" difficulty is not something SSP does well. At all.\n\nYou see, this problem could be resolved with a simple fix. Each of these classic platforming sections do have checkpoints, and initially they represent relief. Sadly, they are one use only, and if you screw up again, you'll be sent back to the beginning and have to start all over again. The levels are never very long once you learn the ins and outs, but the lengths you have to go to see the last few challenges in the stages can be a bit repulsive when you're constantly battling Squishy's agonizingly slow movement speed, spotty hitbox detection, and equally painful jumps. Not a big deal when you're trying to find death, but when you want to escape it, you're in for a world of hurt.\n\nThis isn't helped by the fact that there are bosses that would be worlds easier if your fat little pig moved a little faster. Jesse "Boom" Coyote, the game's second boss, is the reason my hour count is as high as it is. His patterns were very basic, and the way to beat him was equally so, but the amount of cheap deaths and bugs that kept getting in the way made it impossible to the point where after many hours of near-victories followed by crushing defeat (the final hit on even normal difficulty is insanely hard to land), I discovered that there was a sort of glitch through the forums that helped get me to the last bit faster, and even then it took a good few tries. My brimming confidence even after such a cheap victory was halted by a combination of enragingly convoluted "puzzles" that were both straight forward and cruel in what they required of you. After the umpteenth box puzzle and messed up timing-restart, I was done.\n\nAll in all, Squishy definitely has promise, but the charm is quickly lost by the end of the first world. For having such a variety of ways to die, having all your creativity fleshed out within the first few minutes and then relying on frustration and boxes to keep the player interested is not good in the long run. I spent about 14 cents on it, and I only barely managed to get my money's worth. This is by no means a bad game, and it's clear that the makers had a passion here, but I can't in good faith recommend it. It does have cute sprites though.\n","April 22, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Less than an hour in it gives up on its premise and forces you to play a level where dying makes you fail, which is annoying and frustrating. Many levels rely on you figuring out game mechanics that are never explained. The game is buggy. Stages often make you redo time consuming and finicky puzzles because you didn't do a later puzzle right on the first try. Luckily, the cards from this game made me ¬£0.12 and I only paid ¬£0.09,  so I consider it well worth negative three pence.\n\nAlso they left in a testing function so you can teleport anywhere in any level with right click, so that makes things pretty easy.","March 6, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You may see this and think it's similar to a flash game known as Karoshi. I sure did, and went in expecting something like that, except with a bacon twist. But the problem is, this game can't decide whether it wants to be that, or if it wants to be Just Another Hard Platformer, as evidenced by the boss and stay-alive levels. Those really detract from the gameplay, breaking up the flow and generally being an annoyance. It's fun when it's not being like that, despite some of the levels being long, but it's overall more of a hassle than it's worth putting up with.","May 9, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy Operation Vanguard Case.\n\nIn all seriousness, I actually received this game thanks to a kind friend of mine, The Australian Assassin. Oh my god it has never been harder to die!! This will literally wreck your mind. I LOVE IT!! The feeling of finally dieing is a mixture of "YES! I FINALLY DIED!'" and "How the f**k did I not think of that...".  It involves getting cut up by saws, getting cut up by spikes and getting squashed by boxes. REMEMBER YOU CAN GET SQUASHED BY BOXES OR YOU WILL RAGE. This game makes me so angry. Get. Before 9 March.
