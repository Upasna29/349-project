Yet after I finished it for a while, I found myself thinking back to it. A lot of people say the story is too simple, but given time to think, the very simplicity and openness of the story to be what makes it so great. There are a lot of good stories but conciseness is a virtue. The choices in this story may just say something meaningful about life.\n\nThe first time I read it, I also thought the story was too simple and all too familiar myself. A lot of Chinese student videos and soap operas like to visit the theme of the street vending dreamer. The "bad endings" are not fleshed out. The "good ending" might not make sense at first.\n\nBut alas. I am quite the fan of these art student type stories. I like to ponder them. First, I found it amusing that the artist inserted himself into the story. Then I felt the same struggles that he must feel being an artist trying to make an impact in this world. We dream a dream so different from life. And yet life is like a dream.\n\nI had a dream about this story. This story is like life: the life of the artist, the lives of us, choices we make, our endings in our own stories, the stories of our dreams and of our lives.\n\n\n*****Spoilers below*****\n\nThe choices. Yes you either make the right choice, or you are forced to go back and then make the right choice. But these choices are they not the choices we face every day? These choices in our lives that sometimes we don't feel like we want to choose what society tells us to pick. Sure I sleep in one day, or I can not help someone out one day, but what is the path that we chart in our lives that will lead to our dreams? To be able to make the right choice when it matters, is it not best to make the right choice whether it matters or not?\n\nThe "good ending" is random. Maybe. Is life not random? Do our dreams really make so much sense? To bring together a dream and daily life, something magic has to happen. It's randomness of life that allow for dreams. The randomness of dreams that let us live. That is the ending that I found.\n\nA story worth revisiting when I wake up again.","January 22, 2015","true","1.7"," 122 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","122","139","15","7"

It is short and it will take only 20 minutes of your time and it arguably has cute graphics/music.\n\nEvery choice you make can result in either a continuation of the story or in a bad ending; however the "right" decisions are pretty obvious.\n\nThe story isn't very interesting and even more so, some elements are fitted in to advertise the developer company. And the ending is very abrupt. As usual with this kind of games, there are some grammar mistakes here and there or some awkward translations.\n\nAlso, don't expect any nudity :)\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","February 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 66 of 70 people (94%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","94","66","70","16","3"

I do not know the exact number.\nSecondly i stand on a neutral ground for this visual novel. Meaning yes i do recommend it but to a certain extent. (Go to the bottom for reason of standing on a neutral ground)\nThirdly this is a FREE visual novel, hence being very short is not a issue here because it will take you around 5 - 15 minutes to read finish.\n\nThe storyFollow Vinty's life of chasing her dreams of being a famous in the world of calligraphy meanwhile dealing with pressure as things have not go in the direction she intended it to be.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual Elements - The chibi art style used is really cute and the backround art feels average but it is alright.\nAudio elements - The music is alright very lighthearted and cute, it really goes well with the chibi art.\n\nReason for standing on a neutral ground is because the choices you make in this visual novel is being taken at face value and the events that take place happens to quickly. It is very realistic which is a good thing but there is no "build up" to the events.\nThen again it is a free visual novel and the developer have to fork out their own money to make this visual novel and it is created by a very small team, so we should appreciate the work the developer have put into.\n\nTo sum upI would recommend this visual novel to people who want something sweet and short.","September 27, 2015","true","0.1"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","48","57","2","0"

Vinty dreams that one day, she will be famous and everyone would admire her. However, snapping back to reality, she is just a normal person who's self-confidence is pretty much shattered.\n\nThroughout the novel, you will also have to make decisions when you encounter an event. There is a right or wrong answer so you might want to save your game before you make a decision (just to make life easier). Without Within is good for a nice read and it also shows that not everyone is exactly kind to anyone's passion. There will be nice people and there will be mean people.\n\nIn the end, the story was rather short, which was a bit of a disappointment, but it is still a good read that might take you less than 20 minutes.\n\nI heard the developer will "expand" on Without Within so I have my hopes high for this visual novel.","March 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","35","38","4","2"

The protagonist is an aspiring, struggling calligrapher who has to make ends meet working a crappy job so she can pay for her crappy apartment so she can try to find success as a calligrapher. However, she realizes that she had been so focused on success that she lost sight of her passion for her art. Calligraphy, and the story itself, is obviously a metaphor for what this game developer has gone through, but I thought it was well written with nice artwork and an appropriate sense of self deprecation. Plus, I laughed out loud at the ending. It was truly hilarious in the context of the story.\n\nVery well done, free to play title, and one I definitely recommend trying out.

I'll be honest by saying that I only tried this VN on a whim.\n\nThe story is about a young woman named Vinty who is trying to establish herself as a proclaimed calligrapher.\n\nPros:\n\n-Story: As you read through, you personally will be able to relate to her sorrow, her anger, general misfortunes, and happiness if you've been in the same shoes as her. You can really feel the emotion and soul that the writer put into creating this story; I'll safely say that Vinty is a representation of the writer themself. Due to risk of spoilers I won't tread futher.\n-Visuals: The visuals are colorful and cheerful throughout the VN, putting a light mood even on moments that would normally not be happy. Good for the story that this VN is.\n\nCons:\n\n-Choices: Well, it can be, or it can be a Pro depending on how you view it. In the VN, you have to make choices and the choices are either correct or game over. Getting game over screens were an interuption on the immersion experience (to me), but as a general rule of thumb you just gotta be the well-natured person that Vinty is and you'll do fine.\n-Abrupt Ending: The other being that when I was approaching the ending, I was laughing with abandon at what was going on in the story, and then it ended. Just like that. But I hear a sequel is in the making so that more than makes up for it.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe feels I have for this VN are the same that Vinty had for her video game (P.S. it was a good feeling). If you read this VN you'll know what I mean, and you will likely have the same feels. And yeah, this review took longer to write than it took to read this VN, but for 10 minutes of your time, why not peel your eyes away from those trashy celebrity shows and give this free gem a go?","March 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","13","19","3","7"

The art, story, music, and atmosphere fall just a smidge above what you could call "average." The ending comes out from seemingly nowhere and leaves you with an abrupt "Oh. That's it?" sort of feeling; once that moment passes, you'll move on to continue whatever it was you were doing before. Out of sight, out of mind.

Yeeaaahhh... world's greatest calligrapher...\n\nOK. Sure. Why not?\n\nYou'll follow her and her innermost thoughts over a couple of days as she tries to sell her works, hold down an unfulfilling job and deal with her crotchety, old landlady to boot. Oh, and depending on the choice you make, also prevent a small boy from being bummed to death. I like the way the game gives you choices at a handful of points throughout, making the right one will eventually deliver you to the final, good ending, while making the wrong choice will result in something bad happening and end the game. It adds a little something extra to what could easily be a very linear experience, being a visual novel. Or at least that's what I've found with what's admittedly so far been a very brief flirtation with the genre. Though games like this make me want to try more.\n\nThe art style is kinda minimal but still pleasing, and the character design beyond adorable (I especially love her eyes which appear to be two thick lines made of brush strokes. A really nice touch to the character). Vinty could probably have come across as a little entitled or maybe even a tad petulant were she not so lovable, thanks in no small part to the clever and astute writing. I guess these games largely live or die based on the quality of the writing (at least if it's not relying on drawings of boobs and weird squealing audio, as this one isn't), and this game most definitely blossoms from it. It's self-aware and referential without beating the player/reader over the head with it, and is funny and interesting enough to keep them engaged 'til the end, which will only be about 15 or 20 minutes, even seeing all the endings.\n\nSo if you have some time to spare and want to have a brief, pleasant read of something cute and whimsical, then it's well worth giving this freebie a shot. Even though it's only the story of a small time chaligrapher, you brush off this stroke of inkredible genius at your own peril.","December 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

But then I remembered all the doujin novels I read over the past few months and decided to give this game a chance.\n\nI got the best ending on my first try. Even after getting all the bad endings, the game took me only twenty minutes to beat. Unlike all the other doujin visual novels I've played, nothing was unlocked after I beat it, which was quite disheartening.\n\nStill, I like the art, and the music is okay. But the best part about this game was the message. It's a message that I feel applies to the whole concept of doujin novels as a whole: It's never about the presentation or story length, it's about having the passion and heart to get a message across. And that is why I recommend this novel, because I did not like doujin novels for their production values or story length. I liked them because they had a charm to them that most triple-A titles lack.\n\nWay to go, InvertMouse.","February 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game draws easy parallels between pursuing caligraphy and pursuing creating visual novels (or art in general), with small self-depreciating observations that feel unneeded in a game that rewards being optimistic.\n\nSomewhat reminiscent of Sakevisual's "Ripples" but only in its inevitable path to the positive. In the end it comes across more like a semi-random string of quick events tied together by an obvious message. It feels like the few chances it has to state the message are dilluted by hints of jealousy or perhaps awkward phrasing.","January 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Visual Novels and RPGs usually require commitment and the lack of achievements usually leads to a lack of incentive on my end.  Of course, after hearing it's short, I decided to boot it up.  This ended up being a repeat of the Port of Call experience to prove me wrong.  HOORAY!!!!  :D\n\nThis is a short game with multiple endings.  Choose the right path and the story continues, choose the wrong path and the story ends immediately and hillariously (well, all save for 1 or 2).  The comedy's rich and the protagonist is enjoyable and relatable.  To be honest, I kinda' see myself in her.  She kinda' makes me want to get back into drawing and writing again...did Vinty teach me a valuable lesson?  Hmm....\n\nIf time is a concern, the main story is about 15-20 minutes long (about half of a 30 minute cartoon).  If you're a slow reader, it may take you up to 30 minutes.\n\nThe musical score is fitting and pleasant to listen to, the artwork is like a breath of fresh air, and the story is a welcome sight.  I smiled and had a warm feeling inside after reading this short story.  My hat's off to you, Invertmouse.  Bravo!!!\n\n\nFrom a critical standpoint, I'm thinking of where some flaws lie....I'm tempted to find some sort of flaws or room for improvement.  Where are the flaws?  WHERE ARE THE FLAWS?!  Maybe a lack of a gallery...or maybe achievements?  Wait...it's fine without achievements!!!   ....Arrrrrgh!  I want to 9/10.   Nnnngh.... Oh forget it!!!

It's a retelling of a classic: the story of the underdog. I personally really appreciated the lengths to which the novel went to explore the idea of redisovering one's passion, as I for one grew to not only relate to the character, but begin to feel as if she were living a part of my life I hadn't fully reflected on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clrskies/recommended/345650/","clrskies","ClrSkies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clrskies/","58 products in account","Steam's formatting is pretty awful..\n....\nWithout Within is a short but charming novel brought to us by InvertMouse, a name I had previously not heard but that I will not soon forget. It features soft, well-drawn artwork, a great soundtrack, and a lovable main character that leaves you wanting more. Despite the minimal playtime, I found Without Without thoroughly enjoyable and encourage any visual novel lover to give it a chance.\n....\nThe story follows Vinty, a down-on-her-luck girl trying to become a calligraphy artist. During her journey she’s met nothing but adversity and the story is just a segment of her life as she attempts to conquer her own feelings of hopelessness.\n.....\nThe main menu was the first bit of brilliance that I ran into. The artwork is adorable, the opening theme is soothing, and the interface is very simple and easy to use.  Within only a few seconds of loading the game the novel had grabbed my attention and positioned itself as “not your average indie VN” in my head. The only issue I found with the menu and interface was the stark contrast of the button click soundbyte and calm background music. It was too sharp and loud; a softer sound effect would have fit much better.\n....\nAs I loaded into the game the soundtrack grabbed my attention for a second time, leading me nicely into some simple, yet cute, artwork and starting off the story in a rather amusing fashion. Throughout the entire novel, the soundtrack never disappoints and always fits the mood of each scene perfectly.\n....\nThe soundtrack wasn’t the only thing that made the atmosphere of Without Within, however. The art style was soft, simple, and cute and really lent itself to the story in a way that most generic visual novels don’t often do. When you combine art with music, the result is a wonderful atmosphere that does a great job amplifying the simplicity of the story.\n.....\nSpeaking of the story, the only word I can really use to describe this one is charming. It has a few funny moments, a sad moment here and there, and some great bits that really dig their way into your brain and just make you feel good. I found myself involuntarily smiling many times throughout my first playthrough, connecting with the main character and her melancholy life on a personal level.\n.....\nInvertMouse really outdid themselves on Without Within, and despite my negative predisposition going into the story, I couldn’t help but love every bit of it. The simple artwork, fitting soundtrack, and heartwarming plot all came together to create a beautiful work of art. I highly encourage anyone who enjoys Visual Novels to give Without Within a chance, because it’s not your average indie novel.\n.....\nYou can view more of my reviews on my blog at rowancross.wordpress.com.","February 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Just try every option.\n\nSo I tried the other options after successfully finishing the game.\n\nThe "bad endings" felt a little rushed to me, and the real ending unfinished. But not less enjoyable because of it.\n\nIn fact the game has some good points of "working-class/everyday/easy-to-understand" philosophy. "Simple thoughts, nothing really new or that profound" you could say about it, but are the simplest, most quotidian things the ones we pay less attention to, the ones we forget with ease. Quoting some lines from the game, "I had forgotten the last time I found joy in [whatever you love doing]. (...) All I obsessed over was how much, or rather how little, people paid attention to my efforts." I ask to you, fellow reader, Have you ever forgot about the purpose on doing what you love to do?\n\nNo need to answer me in a comment, just answer yourself.\n\nAs a response to the negative reviews I've read, I quote something from the game again, "I had every intention of tossing this game aside. I kept demanding excitement without offering an ounce of passion in return. If I played my part, I might be able to discover so much more."\n\nIt's short? Yes.\nIt feels incomplete? It does.\nBut it delivers a simple yet charming story, and the dev announces here that more of Vinty's adventures are planned for the future, along with some kind apologies about the game's length.\n\nI almost forgot commenting, the soundtrack is cute, and it goes very well with the rest of the game.\n\nI also found myself related to Vinty when she buys the game just because how the shop's employee was gazing at her lol.\n\nI hope this review has been useful.\n\nFor the dev team, thanks for making this nice and lovely VN.","January 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(I know you'll read this eventually since you seem to be following fan feedback very closely from what I've seen :D)\n\nSo I saw this game on the Steam front page and I figured "Well hey! It's a free game and judging from the reviews it doesn't take that long to complete!" So I installed and played it.\n\nIs it absolutely amazing? Eh I wouldn't say so. Did I feel that it was worth my time? 100% so and maybe even more than that!\n\nWhen I walked away from Without Within I felt not the amount of immense triumph and satisfaction that I get from the best games ever made but instead a small warm feeling at the pit of my heart.\n\nI am currently a Master's student in Taiwan (So yes I speak Chinese :D) who is pursuing a degree in digital software, and gaming in general so I have felt more or less the experiences a creative person goes through. It is not uncommon to lose sight that you do what you do simply because you love it. It's unfortunate but it happens.\n\nAfter playing Without Within though I experienced a nice slice of a relatable experience through Vinty's short little journey. Despite the fact that being supported is every artist's dream one should not forget the reason that you started off: Because you love it. Vinty lost her way for a moment and I'm happy to see that she found it back.\n\nWhen you love what you do it will show in your work and that will be what gives it its soul.\n\nIf I want to be a bit critical I would say that the biggest current problem may be in the pacing of the story. The story tends to jump around an awful lot and scenes don't seem to pan out properly before they go on into the next one. Also many of the endings seem to cause the game to end very abruptly which just leaves me sitting there baffled at what had just transpired. It's seemingly a small problem but one that bogs down the experience from being a much better one. It can be easy to lose sight of pacing as an author of a work so lots and lots of beta testing will definitely help one stamp out errors such as these in the final release!\n\nEven with that being said though I liked the 10 minutes that I spent with this game. So...thank you InvertMouse. Thank you for this short and relatable experience. I wish you the very best of luck in your future endeavors! :D\n\nI will be sure to tell my friends about this game and tell them to go check it out for a nice little 10 minutes!\n\nAnd for all my fellow gamers who happen to be reading this....the game is free! Go play it and have a nice little 10 minutes :D","January 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fairly short and free visual novel, with tiny bit of comedy, in which you are (like on most of the VN) presented with two choices, that can either lead to a good or bad ending.\n\nThe art and soundtrack aren't that much special, but then again, it's just a short and fun VN.\n\nWith the simple option of double choice, it can give a feeling of what a VN is, without a complex story or taking too much time.","February 6, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I recommend this, but not because it's -gay voice- ssssuper duper ssscooper cuuute. I recommend this because people really don't realize the fear and stress people have if they want to become a professional artist of any kind. This is essentially what we go through. Even if you aren't kicked to the dirt like poor Vinty, a lack of feedback in general can really hinder you. If you're an artist, this will speak to you directly for sure. For those of you that just don't get art.....maybe this will at least allow you to respect the ones that do. So in short, I guess I'm saying I recommend this because it's a funny little visual novel that speaks to everyone.\n\nOn a separate note, since this review and this visual novel is about art, I'll go ahead and post a link for anyone who's interested in music. If you choose to comment, that comment would reach me very quickly here or my profile.

The concept of the game is simple enough but in the span of the gameplay it never evolved or went anywhere really.\n\nI play a lot of VN's so i don't want to judge to harshly so ill cut myself off with saying i would like to see more, perferably something longer.","February 1, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And... It was definitely worth the time I spent with it.\n\nFor you guys to know, Without Within is a very simple and short VN about a girl, Miss Vinty, who is pursuing her dream to become a famous caligrapher. As far as I know, you won't find anything so simple in mostly VNs... But that's not half bad. It's actually pretty good.\n\nUsually, people try to make VNs with long story arcs, with deep messages and stuff. Without Within does the contrary and actually manages to be a nice game. Even better than some deep stuff I've seen around.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a reason to play this game, take my opinion as a nice indicator of quality. haha\n8/10 would play again (and I did... a lot of times. haha)","February 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Short Yet Personable AVN.Genre: Anime Visual Novel\nDeveloped & Published by: InvertMouse\nPlatform: Windows, Mac and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Free.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nThis game is really short. I finished it in 20mins. When you finish a game that quickly, what is there to really to talk about? Well, other than it being an anime visual novel following a weekend in the life of a creator. No, it's not the most exciting or interesting concept you've ever been presented with. The game was originally created for the fans of the artist's original works and I came in not knowing anything about the creator or her work.\n\nPC Settings\nIncluded settings are basic with windowed/fullscreen mode, text reading speeds & language options. It runs, it doesn't crash and I didn't have any bugs crop up either. But with a game this short, I would certainly hope not. It's not too bad.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIts a day in the life of a struggling creator. I will admit that it does speak to me because I’m in a very similar boat. Is it worth playing? I'm 50/50 on it but as this is free, well, hard to say no. I think it's worth playing if you're a content creator or struggling artist because I think you'll sympathize with what the character is going through. I did take a look at the "bad" endings (I finished the game in one go on the good endings. It's not hard to figure out which choices are "right" and "wrong"). The bad choices were rather humorous if slightly exaggerated.\n\nRead this review and other AVN reviews on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","February 7, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a mostly lighthearted tale with plenty of comedy throughout. Binary choices appear here and there in which one option will lead to a "bad end" after a few lines while the other will continue the story.\n\nBetween the price (free) and the short length, even if you end up hating Without Within, it's no big loss and is thus easily recommended, especially since I consider it to not be bad at all.","January 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I haven't gotten around to the DLC yet, although I intend to eventually.  While the game is incredibly short, all in all it was enjoyable.\n\nAside from the length, the one thing that bothers me about Without Within is the decision tree.  (Somewhat spoilers) every decision in the game either leads to the next decision (or the good end) or a bad ending.  If you choose "right", the story continues, and if you choose "wrong", the game proceeds to one of the bad endings almost immediately, with no buildup or other choices.  The story branch that takes you to the good ending is rather enjoyable and quite easy to get, but the bad endings are all dreadful - not because they make you feel bad, but because there's simply no story in them, and the game just ends.  Despite this flaw, the main decision path is quite entertaining, and I am still intent on buying and playing the DLC, as soon as I am able.","February 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Without within- a free game definitely worth it if you have time to kill, it has some intresting points where you have to decide whether or not to put you life ahead of others or help a little, lost kid. On top of a nice art style (looking good)\nIt also questions you (indirectly) as situations imply the question 'what would you do?'\nHowever, it's pretty short (as expected) the DLC wont add and more story, just the soundtrack that, isn't very good, yet I bought it because it really is worth supporting. I suggest you take a look and decide for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n","February 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Loading this into a visual novel engine was overkill; like many other indie free visual novels I've played, the save and load functions provided by the engine were never utilised. It would've been far better as a story or a short manga composition.\n\nThe story is still funny and charming, nevertheless, with a hint of admiration for memes. I got the good playthrough in one try (maybe because I'm a good person and picked the good option for each decision, lol); trying out the other options showed me that there was only one path to succeed in the game. Not much effort in terms of building a plot. Picking a bad option rewarded you with a few blocks of text and a trademark "BAD END" (thank goodness with no gruesome imagery; 'tis a cheerful and innocent VN).\n\nI recommend it because it's free, is well drawn and is a nice 5-10-minute treat to enjoy in our otherwise rather depressing world. The plot itself ultimately serves only to preach moral values, probably Chinese in origin: Be patient, be pacifist, be optimistic, be good, do not commit prejudice... and ultimately, to always put your heart into your work and remember the reason why you do the things you do; that if it was born out of love, keep that love first and foremost, never to be forgotten.\n\n360/420\nEyecandy\n\n*EDIT* Few things I forgot to mention: There are little loading screens / scene separators that aren't coloured, instead being rather beautiful sketches. Seeing one shows that you're in the right track towards the good end.\n\nThere is also Without Within 2, which is being sold for $5.50. I have not played it, but I am fairly confident that this game is supposed to be an introduction and advertisement for that. If you like this VN and have money to donate to good artists, consider keeping an eye on that.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DallyXD/recommended/345650/","DallyXD","DallyXD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DallyXD/","243 products in account","Without Within is a cute, but rather short Visual Novel both Developed and Published by InvertMouse. The game clocks in to be around 15 minutes to an hour-ish depending on the choices you make in the game. I happened to choose all the correct choices my first playthrough resulting in a 15 minute completion time, but the game was very well made and very stylized despite its length.\n\nWithout Within's story is very relatable and contains a few morals that anyone can value. The dialogue was funny, cute, and well written with a few choices here and there that can ultimately bring you down a different story path. The soundtrack and sound effects were nicely composed and blended well with the scenes, thus adding more life into the story. The art and animation is, hands down, one of the strongest features of the game. The art is reminiscent of many animes (Lucky Star comes to mind) and the animation helps to liven up the scenes a bit so that they aren't too static.\n\nThe developer has confirmed that they are working on a sequel to Without Within and I am definitely looking forward to learning more of Vinty's story.\n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely recommend Without Within to anyone since it is short and not too heavy on the reading. It provided me with a cute story in 15 or so minutes and I couldn't ask for anything more especially since it was free! Everyone should definitely check it out!","May 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","3"

I was really starting to get into the story when suddenly it ended.\n(-) I expected a bit more decision-making-moments, but it didn't bother me much.\n(-) There are no alternate story paths, meaning you HAVE to pick the right choice to further progress. Picking the wrong choice gives you the "bad" ending and ends your game.\n\n\nEven though there certainly are many things that could be better with this game, this is still fantastic, especially considering that this is a FREE game.

Maybe show Vinty a few months later in a better apartment, or even show her with some friends. She seems like a loner from the way this game only shows her interacting with less than a handful of people. Princess Aria doesn't even sound that fun anyway!

There is no proper resolution menu (the protagonist actually makes a joke about resolutions within the story) and it is too short, with the novel ending a little too abruptly.\n\nHowever, i really liked this visual novel. Every scene has great detail and the colours were great. As a result, i found myself to be pretty invested in the main character, to the extent of being really tempted to buy the extra edition in order to see more of the main character.\n\nIf you have 10 to 20 minutes to spare, go ahead and give it a try.","January 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/recommended/345650/","chairmankao","chairmankao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmankao/","1195 products in account","The bad: Short, overly simplistic, generally pointless, and made me feel like I wasted 15 minutes of my life.\n\nThe good: It is free and it is super short, so the damage was negligible.\n\nPlot: Virtually non-existent. The story follows an aspiring calligraphist as she dreams of a lucky break that will put her on the path to becoming a legend in the calligraphy world. The problem is that EVERYONE tells her she sucks. Seriously. Every single person. So very soon it becomes clear that you are playing a delusional character who is following an unattainable dream. What's the point? After a few playthroughs, when she questions whether she should persevere, I wanted to shake her through the monitor and scream, "No! Quit already! This is utterly hopeless. Give up! Go do something else with your life!"\n\nVariety: Not much. Pretty linear. Your choices include things like "get out of bed or do not get out of bed" and "get angry or do not get angry". I might have missed something, but every choice I made ended in her varying degrees of failure or embarrassment.\n\nOverall review: 2/10. The two points are because the art is kind of cute, and the delusions of the main character are pretty amusing, until you realize she's wasting your time, hers and that of everyone else around her, and there is no option to making her quit her dream and get a job to actually pay her rent on time. But no ... let's keep sitting along the street and showcasing her terrible calligraphy and subjecting herself to public ridicule. Even if there's one rich person who is willing to pay for her work, there's no way she would ever be accepted by the general populace as being even competent, so what's the point?\n\nFinal thoughts: It disturbs me that so many people have given this such positive reviews that a paid sequel was released. The only way I would change this vote to a recommendation is if I found out this game had been developed by a frustrated parent that wanted to find another way to communicate to their deadbeat kid to get an effin' job.","November 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","2"

All the options you can choose are sudden death, and it's obvious which is the worse option. And it's pretty obvious whoever wrote this wanted to write a story about the emotional and financial foibles of being a visual novel writer - not a calligrapher, as the protagonist is. Everything *emotional* about this story relates back to visual novels, not calligraphy, to the point where the calligraphy angle feels week and squeezed in. Their story would have been more effective overall if they'd just made the protagonist a visual novel creator as well.","October 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I felt nothing towards the character, nor did I care about her and her story.

The Sunflower War was an interesting concept for a game that I would love to see to come to life. I spent about half an hour on the game and I regret it. Terrible plotline, no alternate languages, lazy visuals, and leaves you with no emotion at the end I have absolutly no feelings for this game but regret. This can be improved in so many ways and it could be a great visual novel, but I don't like it in the slightest. The choices in this game are so black and white that you know what you have to click on to get the "good" ending. The bad endings felt more like a chore than anything as you simply had to start over.

I was very interested in it from the time it was released, (come on, visual novel in steam, and it's free!)  but after playing I feel like I wasted my time.\nGraphics\nWhat could I say about graphics? It's not brilliant, but despite very simplistic manner, it's  nice and appealing. At least I like the style of the artist. But you know what? It's not good enough to recommend this game. It's not the game you would like to play because of sight seeing. Also, the game is quite short (read below about it), and if you've seen screenshots on the store page - you've seen about a half of game. Disappointing, huh?\nMusic\nWell, there is music. It's not bad, but I wouldn't listen it outside the game. When I was distracted from the game for a while, my wife asked me to turn off the sound, because she was annoyed of listening for it too long. Definitely, that music can't be a reason to play this game.\nPlot\nAnd now, the worst part. The plot. It's short. As you can see, I have 2.5 hours in game, and as I said - I was distracted for a while, leaving game open. So, real time to explore all the choices in game, reading all text thoughtfully should be less then half an hour. Did I say choices? I lied, if you chose wrong answer - the game just give you a bad end almost instantly, so actually there isn't any routes, it's linear. Deep meaning? Well, ideas in game are good, but all simple and plain, so it actually don't made me think about it a lot. Nice characters? Oh, sorry for the plural form, I should have said character. Nope again, protagonist is simple and not interesting, not the one you would sympathize. I wonder, how much time author of a plot spent on writing it. One hour? Two? Ten minutes? We'll never know.\nSummary\nNothing to see here. I've read this game to be sure if I should buy the second part, but now I'm sure I should not. The game didn't touched me even a little. I would like a deep game with meaning, I would like a stupid game with boobs, I would like a funny game with good humor, but this game is not one of those. Waste of my time (and waste of game artist's time too, sadly).","November 27, 2015","false","2.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","3"

Your choices are basically just "right or wrong" and if you make any wrong choice, you're quickly led to a "BAD END".\n\nThe story of the game alludes to the game developer's own struggles, as the character in the game buys a dated game from the same studio and while at first the character was convinced her new purchase is going to be a waste of time but once played she praises the game as being wonderful and noteworthy. This suggests that the game studio wants us to feel the same about this game - unfortunately I don't.\n\nHer own struggle to sell (albeit terrible) calligraphy perhaps alludes to the game studio's struggles to sell games (this game is free and the add-on is $2.50). The keyword here is "terrible".\n\nThe gameplay is very short and can be finished in 10 minutes. Also, when I installed the game, there was already a mysterious saved game when I first launched it. And the default options were terrible - the Auto option was turned on, and the speed was at maximum - which led to the text parts being skipped over really really fast (doesn't pause for you to read).","February 18, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It IS a free game, so i guess there is no harm in trying it. It will only take 10 minutes, (no joke, like even if you are a major slow reader) of your time, so i suppose you wont be dissapointed about wasting it. The artist obviously can draw well, but instead does lil chibi characters the entire time, leaving the entire thing feeling cheap. It is a visual novel, so you do have a few choises, but only two options EVERY TIME and one of them INSTA GAME OVERS you, EVERY TIME. But since the choices are ridiculosly obvious which is right and wrong, i suppose that doesnt really matter. The story seems cute, but then switches into cheap advertising... for itsself. It actually mentions its creator and how 'its so amazing and down to earth and trying so hard and putting their heart into it.' Not to mention the story never even concludes. -.-\n\nSo in short.\n*ridiulously short\n*only two options of choice at a time\n*linear, CAUSE IT INSTA GAME OVERS YOU IF YOU CHOOSE THE BAD ANSWER\n*actually mentions itsself to either invoke pity or for free advertising\n*no real conslusion\n\nMore like an insultingly cheap thoughtless comic than a visual novel.","March 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I won't go into much detail to spoil it but, the story is the main drive here focusing on the theme of persuing one's dreams and the difficulties people face when doing so. During the game, you can make choices which determines whether you can proceed to the plot or get the bad ending (which there are plenty of).  The game is quite short taking 15 minutes or more to complete depending on whether you made the right choices or not. There is no voice acting in the game, with characters speaking only through text. The music does a decent job at setting the mood. The artwork/graphics aren't amazing, but not bad either for a visual novel.\n\nSince the game is free, I recommend this game to people who are new to visual novels and curious to try them out.","January 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/345650/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Without Within is a very short independent Visual Novel that was developed by InvertMouse with art by Karousel.  The story revolves around our main character, Vinty, and her struggle to make ends meet while following her dreams of being  a professional calligrapher.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint Without Within does just fine.   It runs off Ren'Py so all the normal quirks associated with the engine are present.  Font is easy to read and everything functions as expected.  The music is well done, though often understated and lilting, it does fit the various scenes well.  As for art, Karousel did a fantastic job and more thought went into the design than the average reader will initially expect.  More on that latter.\n\nThe actual journey that we take with Vinty, whether she is dreaming of stardom or fending off the soul crushing nature of actual reality, is short but sweet.  Clocking at under 20 minutes to explore all of the paths (which function in a Bad End versus a continuation of the story system), Without Within can be immensely charming, funny, sweet, a bit too real at times for those of us that did a stint as a starving artist.  The story is a love letter to creative types but something everyone can relate to: It isn't easy to blaze your own trail but if it was would the journey actually be worth it?\n\nSo, is Without Within worth your time?  Absolutely!  It is a cute little tale that is short but full of character.  Is Without Within worth your money?  That is a difficult question to answer and one I leave up to the reader after they finish the story.  If you enjoyed it, as I did, I personally suggest spending the meager amount to show your support and unlock some goodies.  The Art Book in particular is very interesting as they discuss some of the design decisions for the game and you get an interesting inside look at how a small team would go about putting together a project like this.\n\nBut if you find Visual Novels even the least bit appealing, there is literally no reason to not spend a bit of time to go through this one.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's free, and it's an alright VN, but not without faults.\n\nThe writing is not wholly bad, but I wouldn't say it was exceptional either. There are times where I thought the writing was humorous, and had a silent chuckle, but then there are other times where it felt pretty forced and hurt to read (mostly from Vinty's thoughts - the way the writer attempted to have her also address us at the same time was not written in a way that flowed well). Vinty as a character does seem very grating when you first read her lines. However, she does go through a change, and I feel like she represents a lot of people who are out there looking to sell their work (whether they be artists, game developers, writers, etc.). The plot itself is short and simple, with not much beyond the story of Vinty's struggles and changes. Don't expect depth with this one, either in the story, its characters, or its branches.\n\nSpeaking of branches, there aren't really any "branches", per se. It's incredibly linear, and you immediately are cut off with a BAD END if you don't choose the correct choices (which, to be fair, are incredibly obvious choices so it should be easy to get the Good True Ending first), Even then, the Good End doesn't really do anything and acts more like a Bad End, with the exception of a change in Vinty's outlook on life (though it does serve to be a comedic end, if that counts for anything).\n\nArt and music wise, it's okay. I personally don't like the art style, but I admit the artist knows how to draw and colour, though I think the colouring could have been improved because the soft shading did not work in some of the CGs. Also, her chibis are pretty good (and Vinty is a chibi most of the time). However, a complaint about her clothing - Why exactly does Vinty wear the white outfit everywhere? I get maybe to make herself more flashy to sell her work but...meeting the landlady and at work she wears it so I'm not quite sure about that. Probably art and time constraints...Anyways, Backgrounds were passable, and the music is nice to listen to.\n\nExpect at least 15 minutes of playtime with this. It's incredibly short. It's free though, so it might be worth a look if you're interested. Just don't expect much.","February 21, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/345650/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Without Within is a very short independent Visual Novel that was developed by InvertMouse with art by Karousel.  The story revolves around our main character, Vinty, and her struggle to make ends meet while following her dreams of being  a professional calligrapher.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint Without Within does just fine.   It runs off Ren'Py so all the normal quirks associated with the engine are present.  Font is easy to read and everything functions as expected.  The music is well done, though often understated and lilting, it does fit the various scenes well.  As for art, Karousel did a fantastic job and more thought went into the design than the average reader will initially expect.  More on that latter.\n\nThe actual journey that we take with Vinty, whether she is dreaming of stardom or fending off the soul crushing nature of actual reality, is short but sweet.  Clocking at under 20 minutes to explore all of the paths (which function in a Bad End versus a continuation of the story system), Without Within can be immensely charming, funny, sweet, a bit too real at times for those of us that did a stint as a starving artist.  The story is a love letter to creative types but something everyone can relate to: It isn't easy to blaze your own trail but if it was would the journey actually be worth it?\n\nSo, is Without Within worth your time?  Absolutely!  It is a cute little tale that is short but full of character.  Is Without Within worth your money?  That is a difficult question to answer and one I leave up to the reader after they finish the story.  If you enjoyed it, as I did, I personally suggest spending the meager amount to show your support and unlock some goodies.  The Art Book in particular is very interesting as they discuss some of the design decisions for the game and you get an interesting inside look at how a small team would go about putting together a project like this.\n\nBut if you find Visual Novels even the least bit appealing, there is literally no reason to not spend a bit of time to go through this one.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire thing can literally be beaten in a matter of minutes.....and that's assuming you actually take the time to read as opposed to blasting through to the next choice.\n\nThat being said, it's not that bad of a demo. The artwork was good. The writing seemed to be pretty decent to me overall. A few grammar mistakes here and there but overall it was fairly accurate. The writing for what little story there is was pretty decent overall as well. Certainly not terrible, but hard to really call it "good" or anything when there's only a few minutes of it to judge. It didn't have me throwing up or anything, so I'm definitely willing to give the writing a better review when there's another (longer) VN.\n\nOverall it was a decent way to spend a few minutes, and has me looking forward to seeing more of what this/these guy(s)/gal(s) can do.","April 11, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only problem is that she's supporting herself with another minimum wage job, and calligraphy isn't... well.... in demand.

There's ups and downs, and there are lessons to learn along our pursuit. On certain occasions, an impromptu turn of events can teach a lesson that ignites a new spirit, even when one is close to forfeit. We see this idea and scenario applied to almost every tangible entertainment medium possible, and unfortunately most are basically sick of such buyoant tales. Thankfully, InvertMouse takes this unanimously known concept and creates a free, jovial, hour (Or <) long chronicle following a young woman in high hopes of leaving her mark in society, Without Within.\n\nTake the role of Vinty, an aspiring calligrapher that is unfortunately not having things in accord with her ideals as her art, or should I say, "greatness", rarely gets acknowleged by anyone. In addition to that, she has an unfavorable part-time job and a landlady vexing at her to make ends meet to pay for another dull month in the disheveled apartment Vinty has on rent. With the game's very short length in consideration, not much can be said without spoiling the novel for you, so I'll leave off with this, stuff happens and Vinty encounters a relevation. Simple.\n\nAlthough Without Within stays abstinent from making any unorthodox creation decisions, that doesn't mean it's deplorable by any means. It is evident that the writer(s) for Without Within enjoyed themselves during production, and it is exemplified in the outcome. As conventional as the story might be, nobody can help themselves but to have a handful of chuckles while reading this story as occasional jokes here and there are made and they're funny enough to form a stupid grin on my face most of the time I read. The optimistic themes of self-discovery and inspiration is what the assembles the core of this game, and they are covered rather well as Vinty's change by the end of the novel is believable and to some extent relatable.\n\nAn apprehension regarding this game some might have is that it is rather short, clocking in at less than an hour. However, there was no rationale to make this otherwise as the game accomplished in getting it's message across in the time allotted and the game only recalls the events of a day or two. Should you still not be convinced, allow the mention that the game is FREE, damnit. Gratuit pour tous. Doesn't get better than that. Therefore, I cannot denigrate the game for that shortcoming (see Sakura Spirit). My only true issue with this game is with the choice making aspect, which is rather stale. It's as clear as a cloudless morning sky which choices should be made to progress the story, and the alternative choice immediately follows a BAD END. Therefore, no weight is actually on the choices you make as there is only one legitimate end to the game, the others are along the lines of "My carrer has ended.". Lazy to say the least, but it isn't such a massive, game-breaking problem.\n\nNo profund contemplation should be done before clicking the Install Game button on the store page. It's a very small file and in it has a nice story for you to unravel by clicking the left mouse button. It's humorous, accessible, and has a nice ending that warrants your efforts to read the thing. And it's free. Do yourself a favor and get it.","January 27, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's free, and it's an alright VN, but not without faults.\n\nThe writing is not wholly bad, but I wouldn't say it was exceptional either. There are times where I thought the writing was humorous, and had a silent chuckle, but then there are other times where it felt pretty forced and hurt to read (mostly from Vinty's thoughts - the way the writer attempted to have her also address us at the same time was not written in a way that flowed well). Vinty as a character does seem very grating when you first read her lines. However, she does go through a change, and I feel like she represents a lot of people who are out there looking to sell their work (whether they be artists, game developers, writers, etc.). The plot itself is short and simple, with not much beyond the story of Vinty's struggles and changes. Don't expect depth with this one, either in the story, its characters, or its branches.\n\nSpeaking of branches, there aren't really any "branches", per se. It's incredibly linear, and you immediately are cut off with a BAD END if you don't choose the correct choices (which, to be fair, are incredibly obvious choices so it should be easy to get the Good True Ending first), Even then, the Good End doesn't really do anything and acts more like a Bad End, with the exception of a change in Vinty's outlook on life (though it does serve to be a comedic end, if that counts for anything).\n\nArt and music wise, it's okay. I personally don't like the art style, but I admit the artist knows how to draw and colour, though I think the colouring could have been improved because the soft shading did not work in some of the CGs. Also, her chibis are pretty good (and Vinty is a chibi most of the time). However, a complaint about her clothing - Why exactly does Vinty wear the white outfit everywhere? I get maybe to make herself more flashy to sell her work but...meeting the landlady and at work she wears it so I'm not quite sure about that. Probably art and time constraints...Anyways, Backgrounds were passable, and the music is nice to listen to.\n\nExpect at least 15 minutes of playtime with this. It's incredibly short. It's free though, so it might be worth a look if you're interested. Just don't expect much.","February 21, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I won't go into much detail to spoil it but, the story is the main drive here focusing on the theme of persuing one's dreams and the difficulties people face when doing so. During the game, you can make choices which determines whether you can proceed to the plot or get the bad ending (which there are plenty of).  The game is quite short taking 15 minutes or more to complete depending on whether you made the right choices or not. There is no voice acting in the game, with characters speaking only through text. The music does a decent job at setting the mood. The artwork/graphics aren't amazing, but not bad either for a visual novel.\n\nSince the game is free, I recommend this game to people who are new to visual novels and curious to try them out.","January 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/345650/","seffles","すみか","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/","499 products in account","Without Within is a very short independent Visual Novel that was developed by InvertMouse with art by Karousel.  The story revolves around our main character, Vinty, and her struggle to make ends meet while following her dreams of being  a professional calligrapher.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint Without Within does just fine.   It runs off Ren'Py so all the normal quirks associated with the engine are present.  Font is easy to read and everything functions as expected.  The music is well done, though often understated and lilting, it does fit the various scenes well.  As for art, Karousel did a fantastic job and more thought went into the design than the average reader will initially expect.  More on that latter.\n\nThe actual journey that we take with Vinty, whether she is dreaming of stardom or fending off the soul crushing nature of actual reality, is short but sweet.  Clocking at under 20 minutes to explore all of the paths (which function in a Bad End versus a continuation of the story system), Without Within can be immensely charming, funny, sweet, a bit too real at times for those of us that did a stint as a starving artist.  The story is a love letter to creative types but something everyone can relate to: It isn't easy to blaze your own trail but if it was would the journey actually be worth it?\n\nSo, is Without Within worth your time?  Absolutely!  It is a cute little tale that is short but full of character.  Is Without Within worth your money?  That is a difficult question to answer and one I leave up to the reader after they finish the story.  If you enjoyed it, as I did, I personally suggest spending the meager amount to show your support and unlock some goodies.  The Art Book in particular is very interesting as they discuss some of the design decisions for the game and you get an interesting inside look at how a small team would go about putting together a project like this.\n\nBut if you find Visual Novels even the least bit appealing, there is literally no reason to not spend a bit of time to go through this one.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 25, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only problem is that she's supporting herself with another minimum wage job, and calligraphy isn't... well.... in demand.

Even so, I had alot of fun playing Without Within. My only real complant is that they give you options that are suppose to change the story but picking any of the bad options it gives you a bad ending. Wouldn't it have been cool if you could continue the story while picking good and bad options? The choices don't really feel like choices to me. That asside, it's a fun little story to read and with it being f2p, you have nothing to lose!","January 26, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want about 30 minutes of a girl drawn in a cute art style and being entertained then I recomend this one. I can't argue though with how the artist drew, everything is so cute and the diolouge isn't that either.","May 5, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
