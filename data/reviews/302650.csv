It was developed by the Ukrainian studio Room 8 and succeeds admirably in what it sets out to do: to provide no-nonsense, casual gameplay. The core gameplay is built around a more than decent physics engine that allows for puzzles of gradually increasing difficulty. By carefully adding new gameplay elements, the developers kept my interest for quite some time, and the above average, colourful graphics help a lot to provide quite some hours of carefree entertainment.\n\nThere is even a story behind it all: you play as Cyto, who has lost his/her memory and needs to collect snippets of memory during a voyage through space and several worlds/universes. By collecting these snippets, more and more levels and worlds are unlocked, as are parts of the - basic - storyline. In some ways, Cyto reminded me of World of Goo: there too, one basic but flexible physics-element provided some quite interesting challanges. Cyto is generally less hardcore and more forgiving: the puzzles get seldomly really difficult, and there is always the option to skip a certain level. This grants the game a more casual character, as does the relaxing and very appropriate music.\n\nMission accomplished - Cyto comes with Steam trading cards, but misses achievements which could have been easily implemented into this kind of game.\n\nOverall score: 8/10","January 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","1"

I stopped to have lunch =)\n\n(optional let's play footage - coming soon)\nhttp://youtu.be/j3FJsfJlE7A\nThe game looks nice. The movement of fluid bags (first way I could think of describing them lol) of your character and objects looks good. I like the music, sound effects and the facial expressions that little Cyto makes.\n\nI guess you could call it a problem solving game, how do you reach all the pickups while avoiding hazards and getting to the exit. You have various methods of navigating the environment with Cyto. Launching, slingshotting, climbing, stretching out or just dropping down.\n\nIt's very easy to learn to play. I don't think I even saw a main menu, the just begins from level one and provides visual tutorials as you go. Just use the mouse and one button.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone looking for a simple puzzle game of this type.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 10, 2014","true","1.0"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

This game didn't dissappoint me at all. Though here you won't find such Steam elements as Workshop availability or achievements (at least at the current moment), this game is truly awesome. It makes you think even more then other modern games with "shoot-and-fly" gameplay. "Cyto" is worth all the money spent on it.\nI recommend this game because of:\n-Nice and cute main character;\n-Puzzling and challenging levels with the outstanding design;\n-Ambient atmosphere;\n-Perfectly designed SFX;\n-Great soundtrack\n\nAnd there are many levels to go.","December 3, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The levels get progressivly harder. This game reminds me a lot of Angry Birds, except i find Cyto much cuter. And working to bring his memory back is a much more interesting goal for me.

It has good music and a lovable character (and he doesn't even have to say one word!). I like the story of it. The puzzles can get challenging as your progress through the levels. Each level you have to collect 3 memories to 100% it (however you don't need to 100% every level to pass). It's well worth the sale price ($1.79) I would even pay up to 3 dollars for it.","December 25, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

(Get from Point A to Point B)\n- The story is vague, and slow moving.\nFor example, the story starts out through speech bubbles with your character basically trying to get his memory back, however 20 levels in, and nothing else has been told. No cutscenes, visuals, or dialogue besides a image of a homeworld\n\nIn short, I do not reccomend this game. It's far too generic and you will likely bore yourself to death before you get halfay through. I'd suggest only those who LOVE slingshot based puzzle games to give this a try.\n\nDevelopers need to learn that some games need to stay on phones / tablets...","December 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Expensive cards(when i bought the game, cards had price from 1 $ for one).\n- :\n1. Like a lots of puzzles - this game is small.\nCyto - це наша українська гра, яка представляє собою жанр головоломки. Рівні відрізняються не тільки виглядом, а й складністю - після легкого настає важкий, але і часто буває навпаки.Але тут є функція пропуску рівня, що є корисним і немає тут проблеми головоломок, де є "непрохідний" рівень. Гра заспокійлива як і музика в ній, для короткої перерви від роботи. Сюжет гри короткий, простий і зрозумілий: наш маленький герой втратив пам"ять і нам доведеться подорожувати, щоб згадати, що трапилось і чому ми тут опинились. Дуже цікава і оригінальна задумка зробити гру на "клітинному" рівні. Справді, наш маленький герой Цито(від. лат. "клітина") взаємодіє з іншими клітинами і має своїх ворогів. Так як це 2D платформер, фізика і вигляд гри мають бути добре пророблені. Тут все це є. Гра кольорова, але не обтяжує око. Фізика в грі також реалістична, адекватна, а завдяки різноманіттю рівнів, її цікаво досліджувати. Крім цього ви отримаєте рідкісні та недешеві картки, які можуть навіть окупити вам гру!)\nВисновок: у біблотеці ця гра зайвою не буде, можна грати однією рукою і пити чай, заспокоює нерви.","September 14, 2014","true","4.8"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","23","44","0","2"
