"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/298850/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","Millennium 5 is a very disappointing ending to the series. Obviously, if you've played the first four you're going to play this and it's not a bad game on its own. However, there are things you should be prepared for.\n\nFirst problem is, just like in Millenium 4, the overall game feels kind of lacking. There's one town and a lot of very long dungeons and that's about it. In the first two games, and, to a lesser extent, the third, it felt like there was more to the game world, more to discover, more NPCS and secrets other than the secret rooms.\n\nSecond, the big showdown. This is what the entire series has been building up to and it's okay, but not much more. What should be tense and epic and interesting, is kind of. . .meh. Most fights are over in one or two hits. The quick fights make sense because there's over 100 fights in the showdown. However, with so many fights it kind of gets old. Depending on how your team is leveled it might be a tense thing, but it's not effective if the grand finale of the five game series only works if you're a certain level. If you're too low, you'll get slaughtered and get a bad ending. If you're too high-leveled, the tournament is a breeze and you'll still get a bad ending. That's right, the game punishes you for winning to much. To get the real ending, your score needs to be in a sweet spot range. So, if you're leveled too much, the high-stakes, series ending, super important tournament devolves into you purposely losing matches. It's dull and tedious to say the least.\n\nThird, and the BIGGEST problem, is the writing and story. RPGs, especially RPG Maker games depend on the story because the gameplay is fairly standard. The story of the Millennium games has always been pretty light (find people for your team), but this should have been the grand conclusion. The ending should have wrapped everything up. It does not. There are three endings, two that are basically just "game overs" and the real one. Even the real one doesn't wrap things up. Things are brought up IN THIS GAME that don't see any closure. So many things are brought up and then the game goes, "Okay, well, moving on." All the characters? Barely factor into the narrative of the ending. I hope you weren't invested in any of them.The end goes by very fast and it's incredibly disappointing for an something that's been five games in the making. The ending, the real, grand wrap up, is brief, very passive text summing up the next few years. For the region, not the characters. Except Marine. Her last little bit feels so tacked on it feels like, "I don't know. . .let's say THIS happened. Do you buy that? That kind of makes sense, right? I know that almost nothing has been built up for it, but. . ."\n\nIt's still an okay game, but very disappointing as the capper for a series.","February 16, 2015","false","58.7"," 62 of 78 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","62","78","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/298850/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","So... this is the conclusion to the 'epic' story of a girl that stands up to an oppressive regime of martial arts fighters by gathering 12 martial arts fighters to challenge the current government, because that's the only way to win an election...\n\nI've played through all five games and while after the first one I didn't have much motivation to carry on, the second and third game are actually decent and offer a good amount of exploration, secrets and somewhat interesting characters. Still the main story and companion comments aren't good, but at least the gameplay keeps it together. That changes in game four. Not only does the game fall apart into lengthy dungeons with annoying secrets and almost nothing else, the story takes a turn for the even worse.\n\nIntroducing time pressure into an RPG Maker game doesn't work. It simply doesn't. The main character turns into a psycho forcing people to fight for her by burning down their house. The companion dialog gets overwhelming and so thin that it's just plain annoying. At the end of the fourth game my motivation that was kindled by the second and third game was running very low again.\n\nNow it's time to talk about the fifth game. The game splits your characters into *5* groups quite early on and then happily jumps back and fourth between the groups without any real reason except for padding the game out a bit more. By now it's clear that the game was separated into five parts and then padded out to have the proper amount of 'content' in each of them. The story consists of endless and pointless rantings by all characters. It's by now really painful to read the overly lengthy and completely non-relevant dialog.\n\nThe dungeons are as to be expected long and boring, but (mostly) filled with enough monsters to train you for the big showdown. It feels tedious to drag through the game knowing that you only do it to train for the final battle. The worst bit though is when the game makes you play the exact same dungeon five times in a row. It's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nAfterwards it's the 'good' old fight-99-dragons showdown with another round of meaningless dialog thrown in. If you hit a small window of grinding the right amount you get the better ending of the game, otherwise if you train too less or too much you get a worse one. That's it.\n\nI still admire the amount of work that went into this game and there is a lot of good in the presentation (minus the horrible 'manmade' sound effects), but overall it just doesn't work. Make it a two part game, cut a lot of the ballast and you have something that is fun to play and that isn't dragged out this much. As it is there's just way too much dead weight for it to be a good game.","October 12, 2015","false","22.3"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","31","39","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynadiad/recommended/298850/","ladynadiad","ladynadiad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynadiad/","967 products in account","I will just say that I cannot recommend this game enough.  It was truly a very amazing conclusion to the series and anyone who just dismisses these games for being made in RPG Maker is missing out on a great RPG.  Though I do feel that while this game could in theory stand alone, all the best moments mean so much more when you have played the first four games and really understand just how much everyone went through to finally make it to the grand finale.\n\nAbout the only real drawback is that you do have to level up all your characters pretty high to have a shot in the final showdown, it's recommended to just max them all out.  That definitely took quite a bit of time, but the game does give you a very ideal chance to pull this off by basically having the plot send you off to go grind a ton.\n\nI also do feel that it is obvious a lot of care was put into the dialoge for the tournament.  The dialogue between your characters and their opponents not only does a great job of characterization for everyone, but it varies depending on what your current score is, whether you won or lost that time, and what the character's overall win/lose record is.  Some of the dialogue is downright hilarious.  The characterization here is really great as well.  By the end of it I really had a good sense of what the Mystrock Lords and Ladies were like and actually even came to find a few of them to be interesting characters.  I definitely liked Gisele and Mai a lot.  Nate also was pretty interesting even if he was obviously meant to be hated.  Truly, all of them were interesting characters with distinct personalities and that shows the love that was put into the final showdown.  What was even more neat was the fact that enough care was taken to give each of them their own battle theme.  The soundtrack in this game was quite good even if it's been good in all the games so far, but this one just had some added stuf that did a great job of making all the scenes all that much more emotional.\n\nHowever what really makes the game is the ending.  Even though it's pretty obvious that since we're playing as Marine and her friends that the true ending is for her to succeed, how this happens is not something that would be easily guessed.  I won't spoil it, but it definitely got quite the reaction out of me.  To me any game capable of making me feel something for the characters and events is doing it right.\n\nI also feel this game did a much better job with the realism and having everything be well explained by the plot and done so well.  For example the game gives a beautiful excuse to have the Bear unable to be in your party for most of the game because you'd rely on him too much and not train the rest of the characters if you could.  The plot that came with that reason then gave a great excuse to use all those characters you haven't used since they games they joined in, though at times it was annoying because you'd get a party that really wasn't good and would need to grind a bit to have a shot.  The monsters in this game are definitely tough!\n\nOverall pros:\n+Quite a lengthy game, you're looking at about 30 hours of playtime and the tournament is actually not a large chunk of that.\n+The characterization is top notch here.\n+Very challenging monsters and the tournament is also pretty challenging as well even if the battles are shorter there\n\nOverall cons:\n-A lot of grinding.  While it's not as bad with it actually being justified by plot much of the time, there were points where it dragged because you needed to grind up a not so hot party.\n-Definitely going to want to get the guide for this one because the parties switch up so often and you have to be well prepared to even have a shot.  The guide does a great job of advising without spoilers on how to prepare for all of this, howevr.\n-As of now, the game has 6 broken achievements so it cannot be 100%ed without cheating.  The dev is aware and has been good about fixing them for other games, but it is likely to take time.\n\nSo in the end, I very much recommend this game and truly, play the series from the beginning if possible.  The series ends up running at about 90 hours of play all together and a very large amount of that is very good and leading up to an incredibly epic conclusion that will mean all that much more if you started from the very beginning.  The final conclusion will mean so much more when you truly understand all the things Marine has done to get to this point and it really starts off with that fateful day when Marine left Green Grass, tripped on something and met a little fairy who decided to live in her earring from then on and it means so much more if you get to see Marine grow from being a weak peasant girl to being a capable martial artist who inspied others to join her on her crazy quest to challenge Mystrock.","July 19, 2015","true","38.9"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","2"

Aldorlea has topped themselves with this creative, captivating game.\n\nAll games of this type begin and end with a solid, well-told story, and this one is flush with all the elements of good, no, great story-telling. The player is captured in the very beginning (doesn't matter if you played the first four or not), and held in the most beguiling way thoughout right up to the conclusion of the "Showdown".\n\nNow add to the story the other positive elements of thegame\n\n-the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and fully detailed.\n\n-the music is never intrusive, but is captivating, and adds to the impetus of the game.\n\n-the characters are numerous and fully fleshed out. The main characters come alive with personality whether the particular traits are heroic, simply ordinary, or foible laden. Each and every one of them is memorable. Even the monsters are creative and drawn beautifully with an extremely imaginative flair.\n\n-the variety to the game is enormous. So many choices. Which of 4 difficulty levels will you choose? Do you want a bit of directional guidance? Do you want the monsters visible or not?\nDepending on your choices, the game can be very long, even longer, or longest.\nSo that adds to replayability. I can imagine going through this game multiple times, changing your selections every time.\n\nThis is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It is fantasy at its best, with many sidequests to complete, many hidden areas to discover, animal kings to discover, and lots of other secrets. So many "a-ha!" moments.\n\nAnd the mechanics of the game are flawless. You move through the world with ease, there are no gaffes in logic, and everything flows seamlessly.\n\nThe dialogues are done as well in this game as any I've ever seen, and they are excellently used to both explain the game to newbies while propelling the story forward at the same time ---- often with a lot of humor.\n\nThis is an obvious work of care and love that shines through in every possible way.\n\nI can't imagine that any fan of classic rpgs would not want this game in their library. It's in mine, I give it my very highest recommendation. Aldorlea never disappoints ---- rather, they continue to get better every time.","November 21, 2014","true","12.3"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","1"

Since they only have a few days left, they basically need a miracle. And as it happens, the Bear knows a place where miracles can happen...\nThat's how Millennium 5 starts. The story has many surprising twists and thrilling and emotional moments. And in the end, there's the Grand finale - The Showdown.\n\nThe gameplay offers the traditional "fight and explore" experience, with many optional or secret locations and side-quests. Maps are two dimensional, but some of them are more "platform-like" and require a lot of jumping. Usually, the maps offer relatively straighforward route to the main objectives and many side areas with bonus loot and secret rooms. The bonus items do make a difference, especially on harder difficulties, so thorough exploration really pays off in this game.\n\nBattles are turn-based, with Speed attribute (and a bit of randomness) determining the characters action order. You can have four party members, plus Marine can summon Jeanne (the fairy). Each character can either attack, or use spell / abbility. Since Marine and the others need to train for The Showdown, they don't use weapons, only Bare Hands. Only some of the support characters (such as Marine's younger sister Merline) can use weapons.\nAs for the spells, they have damage elements (red, blue, ...) and can have a chance for causing a "status" (Paralysis, Poison, ...). Since different enemies can be susceptible or immune to different elements and statuses, an appropriate strategy can change the battle outcome dramatically. For example some strong and dangerous enemies can be easily paralyzed and so on.\nEnemies often cast spells vith various effect, too - especially the bosses. Some of your party members are more resistant to these effects, some are less. You can help them with the right equipment, though. Add things like counter-attacking, multiple-attacks-equipments, health and mana regeneration, and you'll see soon enough that knowing the right equipment plays a major role.\n\nThe Showdown represents a special part of the game. It's your 13 warriors against the Mystrock 13 ones, one on one. That is 13 rounds and 169 fights in total. It feels very intensive - no exploring, no random fights, just you and the Mystrock. The game ending depends on your score.\nIn the battles, you have four options: defend (to help you survive enemies' special attacks), attack, use your abilities (different from the "normal game" ones, with limited number of usage - so you need to use them carefully) and try to "trick" your opponent (works well against the slower opponents). Based on the outcome and the total score, you get different dialogues and comments from both you party and Mystrock people. Some of these lines are pretty hillarious. Btw, beating the bully Merryll felt very satisfying.\nI should note one thing, though - no matter what difficulty you chose, for the Showdown the game always switches to Normal (to ensure a proper difficulty tuning).\n\nApart from the main storyline, Millennium 5 offers a lot of optional content: Sidequests, secret rooms and animal kings. Animal kings are special tougher versions of some the normal enemies and all of them are only available in Hard mode. Since sidequests and secret rooms are pretty hard to complete, too. This adds an incentive for replaying the game. Usually, you start on Easy or Normal mode and then do the Hard on your second (or third) playthrough. The total playtime easily exceeds 30 hours with all the optional stuff, so spending 100 hours is perfectly possible in Millennium 5.\nConsidering the difference between difficulty modes and customiyation options (visible/invisible monsters, encounters rate, in-game navigating arrows), you can tune the game to almost everyone's needs. Overall, it's a great game, even as a standalone one. But if you want to have the best experience, then playing the whole series is definitively recommended.\n\nP.s. For the record - I played the original non-Steam version, too. Except from the achievements there are no differences, though.","November 11, 2014","true","11.5"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","0"

The Bear will lead the team to a lovely beach but also the damn place of training.

You have short replies at the start of duels. Read carefully as it can give you clues on the enemy’s fighting profile. Even take notes and save well.

It is a rather long episode cuminlating with the battle against Lord Dragon and his offsiders. This battle must be won in a certain way as there are 3 different endings so it is best to save and play each ending for effect.

Again, got this in a bundle so maybe it's more fun if you've played the previous games, but for a first timer to the series it's just a bunch of people you know nothing about yammering on.  Apparently we have to train to fight some dudes.\n\nSo you actually start playing.  There's a sidescrolling platformer thing going on for the level, which is actually a pretty cool idea.  You fight the actual enemies in your standard turn based rpg fight, which is a bit annoying as a new player because you have no idea what each character can actually do because again, the game assumes you've played the previous games.\n\nThis brings me to the menus... The game makes the weird choice to have almost half the screen space in each battle filled up by the character portraits.  They're not bad portraits (altho the four people you start out with appear to be generic white anime teens... maybe the rest of the cast is more diverse? I think the angry old dude was black?)  but it sucks that the also pretty decent monster art is being covered up/ squished.  It's also a little harder to see the hp, ect, as it's layered on top of the character art and semi transparent.  The out of combat menus also look a little weird imo.\n\nAbout the art... The character portraits, the monsters, and the pixel character sprites all look pretty good on their own, but kind of clash when they're all on the screen together.  The difference between the really clean character art and the more textured monster art isn't too bad, but they really don't look good on a pixel background.  A lot the levels don't look great (especially the caves) and it looks like a photograph was used for the far background.\n\nOther stuff:  There's a knock off Wolverine called Wolfgang, what.  The game is fully mouse compatible which is a nice change from most of these types of games.\n\nOverall rating: Nah, man.","May 19, 2015","false","2.3"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","10","25","0","3"
