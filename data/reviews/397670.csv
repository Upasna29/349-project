You control a cute and colorful penguin who basically has to escape from a test laboratory by jumping over lethal obstacles to progross from level to level. Graphically, the game is colorful with some nice lighting but you won't get a chance to look for long before your first death! You collect yellow orbs in each level with the aim to escape by completing 24 levels. In the background is some manical music which will drive you crazy!\n\nThere really isn't much more to say about the game. It offers partial control but after a few minutes it becomes dull and repetitive. There are much better and cheaper games in the same catergory as this and the game is just too dated and simplistic to play for more than a few minutes. Thumbs down from me guys :(","September 13, 2015","false","0.2"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","41","52","3","0"

The jumps are almost impossible to time. The perspective turns in unexpected ways and at unexpected points in the level. The effects get in your way sometimes.\n\nI couldn't even make it past level five or so. If the first couple levels (or chapters) were easier, I could see myself enjoying this somewhat, but until then, it's just not something I would want others to play.\n\nPros:\nNot much, to be honest.\nCons:\nWay, way too hard\nNearly impossible to time your jumps\nPerspective changes in weird ways, unexpectedly","September 30, 2015","false","0.5"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","26","34","0","0"

I would not recomend spending more than 50 cents on this.","December 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

May possibly annoy you. I got this for free, but an honest review is needed. Also, it can be fun if you're very good at it...\n\nEDIT: Not gonna lie though, the game seems original to me by how its made and how you play it.

I personally didnt enjoy the game (hence the low play time).  I found the jump arc far too short to have much fun, as you had to get right next to (basically until there was clipping between the player model and the obstacle) the obstacle before you jumped.  There was no variable jump, either.  Idunno,  this game didnt appeal to me, but it's also not the type of game I typically play.  You dont lose much by checking it out, so if you're on the edge, just go ahead and buy it.","December 6, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Which I like. The game isn' too hard once you know how to jump properly at parts,once you can master it you can do it pretty well,though the camera isn't exactly on your side and can lead you to your demise pretty fast on most levels. Either way around it I enjoyed it for what it was and didn't quit the game after 20 mins of playtime of it being "too hard".","December 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

The whole "red is evil" thing really enhanced the 'crazy' aspect. Haha I gotta say, some parts were funny, some parts were sad :( . Overall really fun game, I went through the first dozen or so levels, and it got pretty difficult fast. I liked the interesting backgrounds, and the text, I dunno. I don't know what mimi means, but i thought it was a pretty funny thing to say :D\n\nOther than that, my advice for the devs is to try and fix the camera angles, and mayyyybe add in more difficulty levels. That way u can survive getting hit, and also maybe get a better look at the whole game while your running through it. THEN it would be great, better than it already is !\n\nOverall, 9/10 for the 12 or so lvls I played through it. I really liked your guys' other game Sanctuary RPG, and I saw this super cheap, so I figured hey, I should get this game! Really enjoyed it :D. Hope you guys make more stuff in the future.\n\nSo YEP, I would recommend it!","September 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 13 of 37 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","13","37","3","1"
