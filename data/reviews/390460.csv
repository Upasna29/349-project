This game is a puzzle platform game. You try to connect each point of the same colour together, which raises platforms to allow you to reach the keys. Its basically a 3D version of the game "Flow" on the iphone/android app stores. It only costs 4$, so its kinda worth it, especially if your name is TYLER! :)","January 14","true","2.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","16","21","9","0"
