"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALvL20Wizard/recommended/212500/","ALvL20Wizard","[BSTH]ThreeSixty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALvL20Wizard/","72 products in account","From a player that's played this game since release back in 2007, playing across 3 servers, founder account, over 15,000 hours logged over the years. I can tell you that my feelings for this game are very genuine and it's taken me a good two months to write this review after leaving the game.\n\nI'll be honest, the game truly has fallen from what it used to be, it's become, let's say, easy from what I remember years ago. Angmar content is probably on par with what vanilla WoW was for me, The massive amount of meticulousness that had to go into every single character that you had. From the start of character creation, you were in danger of getting absolutely smacked by landscape mobs if you were a certain class and pulled mobs badly (I'm looking at you hunter). The way you had to play a class was very different from launch than it is now, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all, things change, just me reminiscing over times long past. This is just the tip of the iceberg so to say.\n\nNow, on to the content. The developing team behind LOTRO has put out content consistently that appealed to the audiences up to Rise of Isengard, which in my opinion, was one of the best expansions I've ever played in any MMO. The content before and including Isengard (Angmar, Mines of Moria, Seige of Mirkwood) are incredible, everything from the instances, zones, questing, down to the ambient sounds, it was amazing. Now this basically talking about the expansions as a whole, (I consider Angmar an expansion in this list, but it was vanilla content more or less) but the zones in between the major content areas were amazing as well, North Downs, Lothlorien, Evendim, Enedwraith, If you have never experienced the night in Forochel, you are missing on one of the most amazing game sceneries ever. Great instance designs in all of this content, from forging into Carn Dum with your friends and overcoming the managerie of bosses and Mordirith, to conquering places like Barad Guldur and the Tower of Isen along with toppling Saruman in an incredible battle atop the tower itself. Many many memories will never be forgotten that pertain to such events that took place in the game.\n\nAlas, many new players will never get to experience this content simply because the game has progressed far beyond all of this. Most of the players that I met during my final year and a half or so were players that were there to rush to level cap and do "end-game", that's the joke kids, there is no end-game. All it is at level cap is a daily grind for your daily reputation factions for that "highest tier raiding set" that you will never put to serious use because most of the players that play the game now will NOT run content that will challenge them. It's that simple, I led pug tier 2 challenge runs on my main server of Windfola for years for players not in raiding guilds, and people would rather run Sambrog 6 man spams for crap rewards than spending a little more time in a bigger, more challenging instance for big reward. It pained me to see that the game populace had declined to such a lazy group of "give it to me without the challenge" group of people, because let's be honest, anyone that played in vanilla LOTRO can tell you how bloody hard it was, JUST to get your resistances right to actually stand a chance in Carn Dum, let alone actually fighting the bosses. But don't be let down, there are groups of players on many servers on both EU and NA that play around the level of that old content when it was released so they can specifically run that content and have it challenge them, they are great people and they organize themselves in server world chats and forums still.\n\n\nNow on to the "current" content. After Isengard, the game started to decline, Rohan was a let down for most players, the introduction of mounted combat looked fun on paper, it was ok, but it was buggy, and it never really fit in with most players. The landscape was pretty for a bit, but you got used to the rolling plains. The instances were sadly a joke in terms of difficulty, aside from the raids in that cluster for the expansion, the three raids that were introduced were pretty fun and challenging at the highest difficulty of tier 2 challenge, Fires of Smaug and Battle for Erebor were great fun, but the third, Flight to the Lonely Mountain was pretty much impossible at release because it was buggy, it got fixed, but far to late for such a simple problem. Then you had the the most outrageous rep grind in the form of Hytbold reconstruction, something that would take around a solid month to complete if you were very diligent about your dailies, something that had to be done to aquire your level 85 class set pieces. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but the real knife in the back really came with the area expansion of Wildemore with the atrocious rep grind at the end of finishing every quest in the zone, it was terrible, an everyone that I knew hated it, and it was all for a shiny epic accessory piece that didn't mean a whole lot.\n\nAfter this Helms Deep released, Big Battles came with it, I won't go into detail about it, but it was something to see, especially as a player from the beginning. All the classes were redone, traits were completely overhauled into tree progression, basically the game was stripped and redone in most aspects. No new instances were included, no raids, nothing except the battles that most hated, I did my progression through them, did A LOT of bug report testing for them over the months, some say to this day that they are still buggy. When they released update 14 I called it quits, said my goodbyes to many, and uninstalled.\n\nAs for players that really enjoy playing PvP, I STRONGLY recommend you watch videos and visit the official LOTRO forums and read through the PvMP threads. Personally, I think the community for PvP is toxic and players are simply looking for who has the bigger E-Peen at any given time. On any server you will find flavor of the month players that jump from class to class every update so they can destroy you with minimal effort, it's just terrible habits that a fair amount of them have and it's nasty, one of the main reasons that led to me leaving the game, considering there really is no PvE endgame anymore.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong I will recommend this game to anyone that every asks me about it, it's very good looking, classes play pretty well, questing isn't a total bore, crafting can be ok, there is amazing RP opportunity. Just remember that this game has been around for a good while and is going through it's decline because of recent content release, but there are still servers with 200+ player login, people still play this game, I leave it up to you to decide whether to drop subscription money to do a large amount of things that this game has to offer in terms of content. I've made many dear friends because of this game, maybe you will as well.\n\nAs for the players that have never progressed anywhere near the end of a character's leveling path and experienced a large amount of this game, they truly have no opinion of the game. They haven't gone through anything that would give them any right to judge the game in any way shape or form, it hurts greatly when I read a review from someone that hasn't even logged an hour and down votes this game.\n\nAa' lasser en lle coia orn n' omenta gurtha\n(May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown) :)","August 30, 2014","true","310.6"," 434 of 461 people (94%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","94","434","461","31","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caboose_az/recommended/212500/","caboose_az","Aaron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caboose_az/","246 products in account","I played this game from the time when Evendim was first introduced up to when they released the Helm's Deep 'expansion'. In that time, it was my primary game. It was great. Kins, raiding, PvP. It was all I wanted in a MMO, with a Lord of the Rings theme. Unfortunately, the game went down hill.\n\nThe first expansion was Moria and was a good expansion. Probably the height of the game. We got loads of instances, a lair raid, a legendary weapons system and two new classes. They even gave us a few more updates with some instances and a couple of raids.\n\nThe second expansion was Mirkwood. It was marketed as a 'mini-expansion', and though it was smaller than Moria was, it was still much larger than anything we had later. We got a new instance system called 'Skirmishes', where we got soldiers and about a dozen instances to fight with them in. It was good, it filled it out. Mirkwood also came with 3 x 3 man instances, 1 x 6 man instance and a 3 boss raid with a gauntlet at the start. It wasn't as good as Moria but it was cheaper, so we accepted it.\n\nThen came the biggest issue: Turbine was bought by Warner Brothers. Only a couple of months after this, the game went 'free to play' (you can play for free, but it's heavily restricted and you need to pay to unlock things). The community was a little concerned, thinking that it would mean the reduction in quality of the game or finding lots of 'pay to win' items. Turbine assured us it would be alright.\n\nThey released a large update with about 4 or 5 instances and a raid. It was a good instance cluster, but it didn't come with any level cap increase so loot wasn't that desirable. It also came about 6 months before the release of another expansion.\n\nRise of Isengard was our first expansion since F2P. And cracks were beginning to show more and more. They released it without any instance cluster initially. Only a single buggy lair raid that was originally promised as a free update and later tacked on to the expansion to fill it out. Then, slowly, we got the instance cluster and raid. It was an alright raid but it felt hollow. We'd waited a long time and then got nothing more than a mini-expansion had provided before, especially when it cost twice as much as Mirkwood did.\n\nAfter that, we got Riders of Rohan. This 'expansion' was the biggest joke of all. Originally, they didn't tell us what was in it when they released pre-purchases. Then, after people bought it, they revealed it wouldn't have any instance cluster. No raids. The only end-game would be a daily grind to rebuild a town. That was it. The community kicked off. Eventually, they gave in and said they'd include an instance cluster. But the instance cluster was about Erebor (the mountain in the Hobbit) and not anything to do with Rohan. It was clear it was intended as a cash grab for people who watched the Hobbit films. We got the first half of the instance cluster a few months after the expansion first released. Then we got the second half. Both times they gave us these instance cluster halves, they called them 'updates'. Usually, updates had new content in. This time, it was just delayed content that was supposed to be part of the expansion. The downside being all of the instances were terrible, the raids were 2 lair bosses and a gauntlet (so less than the Mirkwood raid), and people gave up.\n\nBy this point, Turbine had also gone out of their way to monetise what they could. They ignored complaints about lag, grinds, and broken old content. Instead, they began selling more store-only items. They milked what they could from the playerbase without caring what sort of content to deliver. It got to the point where the community was so divided between fanboys and people hostile to Turbine that the forums became a propaganda-fest. The CM banned dissenters left and right.\n\nWith customer trust erroded, Turbine finally announced their next (and my last) expansion. Helm's Deep. They didn't have any instances, only these things called 'Big Battles', which took away any importance of class and relied on generic big battle upgrades. They also did the thing that killed the game for many people: Trait Trees.\n\nBefore, you could trait your character how you wanted. It made hybrid builds viable and widely varied. You could make a class built for survival, or DPS, or whatever you wanted. But Trait Trees took all of that away. They gave generic builds to everyone. Now, you couldn't run a hybrid build because you could only choose one line and the skills it came with. They literally locked our skills behind 3 different lines. Where a person might have a few healing abilities in their DPS build, they were now locked behind the healing line only. Sure, you could put points in other lines, but it didn't give you the skills you wanted like before. In effect, they took everyone's characters and made them generic, cookie-cutter builds.\n\nAfter this, they said they had no plans for another expansion. A few small updates here and there, but it's basically maintenance mode now until Mordor. A cash cow to squeeze, not a game to please.\n\nAnd now we're at the point where they've driven so many people away that they're having to merge servers to save cost and to make the population look busy again. 29 servers cut down to just 10; 5 US servers, 5 EU servers. It says a lot when a game is forced to make such drastic changes, while pretending it's doing fine. Not only that, they've been unsuccessful with actually transferring characters between servers, so in true Turbine form they've got no clue what they're doing.\n\nTL;DR: Do not play this game. It's no longer what it once was. It's a broken, hollow, generic shadow of its former self, and Turbine are only using it now to milk the few remaining loyalists for all they're worth.\n\n\nEdit: To clarify, I have a Lifetime account. I get full VIP perks forever because I paid a large amount when I first started playing. So my complaints are from the perspective of someone who doesn't even need to pay for it, yet still can't bring themselves to play it.","August 22, 2015","false","19.3"," 1,367 of 1,581 people (86%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","86","367","1","80","42"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bart95/recommended/212500/","bart95","Sir Papercut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bart95/","412 products in account","I've done nothing but farm work, help hobbits set up a festival, chase animals and beat up brigands for two hours, and I loved every minute of it.\n\nIt's strange really, I've played practically every major MMO at this point, and the only one to grip me alongside WoW is LOTRO. Personally, I'm tired of being treated as the SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE as soon as I hit level 2. Hell even by level 20 in LOTRO I still often help ordinary folk with ordinary things, and I enjoy that. If I want over the top epicness there's a million and one games that do that, but LOTRO keeps things level headed for the most part (Excluding a dream sequence that was hamfisted in at level 5 where YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE or some crap, but that's generally disregarded by the community and even  the devs as it has yet to be brought up again). This is greatly aided by the fact the MMO is based on the -books- and not the films, which is a great relief as Radaghast for example isn't an insane lunatic and there's no mention of a rabbit sleigh just yet.\n\nThat said, when the drums of war sound, and orcs and goblins march, the game isn't afraid to take a turn into the dark and foreboding. The sky goes from a clear blue to a grim dark grey or even red as I approach Angmar, the woods and wildlife growing more desolate. I can't help but feel I've only made a small scratch in the surface of the adventures that await me yet. The mundane quests are gradually being set aside in favour of "Oh god, ♥♥♥♥'s going down, halp pls" from townsfolk, which suits me fine.\n\nHaving sunk money into the expansions and quest bundles as they were on sale (Fairly frequently), I have all but negated any -need- to subscribe. A subscription at this point would only give me a few more character slots (Which I don't need, already have five), access to PvP (Which I have no interest in), a daily XP bonus (Which doesn't last very long) and an allotment of premium currency (Which I don't really need either).\n\nI subscribed for a single month a while ago, and that has removed currency limits, given me more character slots, and even removed the lock on my class, race and virtue trait slots on all characters I played back then.\n\nA lot of people are put off by the in-game store, yes it does pop up now and again, especially after level 30 or so if you haven't bought any zone quest packs, but really at the point I'm at I don't really see it all that much.\n\nAdditionally, you can grind out premium currency in a fairly adequate amount, hell last time the expansions were on sale I managed to get one -purely- by grinding. It was a bit boring, but it was helped by a lovely bunch of max level players offering to help newer players like myself farm out the currency. There's even guides on getting said currency in a quick, efficient manner, if a little repetitive as it involves making characters and doing specific tasks over and over.\n\nIs the game perfect? No, it shows some signs of age, namely in the graphics (The Beoring race/class is a fair grade higher quality than the other race models), some could argue the combat was clunky. But it's otherwise well-preserved, namely with exquisite attention to detail. Weapons make different sounds on hitting enemies based on what the enemy is or what they wear, rather than the same generic SFX being heard for hours on end, to name just one example.\n\nAs a frequent role-player, LOTRO holds the crown as the most RP friendly MMO I can think of, cut down only by it's rather archaic housing system, which is very restrictive in terms of decor (Seriously, you have to place furniture in fixed locations, meaning my bed has to be in the middle of a room...). Which is a shame, as the RP community has shrunk significantly, to the point where the only prominent RP takes place in the prancing pony inn. And obviously the quality there can often be... lacking. A great shame, but the game is niche so a tiny RP community is expected.\n\n\ntl;dr: The game is good, try it. Premium currency can gradually be gained for free. Wait for zone quests and expansions to go on sale before buying them. if you like the game, considor subbing just for one month to remove the worst of the limitations on your account and characters (Remember to login to each character to unlock their traits etc while you're a VIP).","April 1, 2015","true","188.3"," 282 of 298 people (95%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","95","282","298","28","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ariatloak56/recommended/212500/","Ariatloak56","Aria T'Loak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ariatloak56/","125 products in account","So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:\n1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game?\n\nThen LotRO is definitely your bet.\n\n2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.\n\n3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.\n\n4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!\n\n5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.\n\n6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for).\n\n7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.\n\nThese developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.\n\n8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.\n\n9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.\n\n10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game.\n\nYou'll certainly fit in our bunch :)\n\nTotal score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.","December 18, 2015","true","612.7"," 168 of 182 people (92%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","92","168","182","21","0"

First off I want to explain what's fantastic about MMO's and that people have forgotten they're for: They're not just for rushing to endgame, they're not just for PvP. They're for fully enjoying a well-fleshed world and essentially living a second life in said game, and having a variety of experiences. Something alot of MMO players have forgotten in their impatient rush to end-game and gear. The best MMO's make a rich, versatile, alive world for you to explore and experience.\n\nLet me explain and tell you a very recent scenario that actually happened:\nIn preparation for the 3rd Hobbit installment, my girlfriend and I travelled to the Shire to enjoy the sights and sounds. We ventured up to Bilbo's house, and explored it a bit. We saw a humorous painting of Smaug, and a few other notable things. Another traveller walks in as we were staring at the painting, he bows to both of us and tells us he is from Dale, and came to thank Bilbo for his assistance so long ago. He informs me they've rebuilt well, and he will travel back soon after attending to some business. We tell him we were simply exploring, adventurers who wanted to visit the unlikely Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. He invites us for a round of ale. We walk down to the Green Dragon, discussing the dire business going on South. He buys us a couple pints and we have a smoke and talk more (more real life things at this time.) He adds us as friends, gives some gold (at the time we weren't very rich, so it was very helpful), invites us to go fishing (of which we had to decline for we had other matters to attend) and is away on his own journey.\n\nThere was no combat, no hobbies, no crafting, no end-game, no raids, just good ol player community and interaction. Add in heroic combat, interesting and fun crafting and hobbies, raids, and you have a fantastic MMO. That is essentially what you're getting with this. A tight-knit VERY friendly and awesome community.\n\nLotRO does a fantastic job of letting you experience Tolkiens world in a wonderful setting. The music, the graphics/areas, the overall feeling is very immersive. Countless times I have stopped and enjoyed the wonderfully presented and created zones. Yes the graphics are a bit dated, but it is a somewhat older MMO. The graphics are still decent and even in some spots beautiful enough to not be unenjoyable.\n\nYes, the F2P pricing model is very bad. But does that remove it's pros? No. Most MMO's have subs,  can you *really* mark off this game so much for it's new pricing model? Just sub, and buy expansions for the most enjoyment and unhindered experience.  You can't really expect them to not want money, they need it, and you need support.\n\nThe combat is normal and decent. The story is great for fans of Middle-Earth.\n\nThe music system is truly innovative and new, even to this day.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, ESPECIALLY if you're a huge fan of Middle-Earth. Enjoy the experience, live in the rich setting.. Stop rushing. Enjoy it.","December 24, 2014","true","21.9"," 170 of 187 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","170","187","11","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felryn1/recommended/212500/","felryn1","Felryn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felryn1/","123 products in account","TL;DR is at the bottom of the review for all of you who didn't want to read the whole thing!\n\nIt's been 350 hours as of this writing and my main character has hit the level cap of 100, quested through almost all levelling zones, participated in raids, instances, big battles, is a guilded tailor, and has been a long-standing member of a kinship (known as a guild in other MMOs), in addition to a whole host of other things. So, needless to say, I think I'm finally qualified to write a proper review of this game.\n\nEven though this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews listed for The Lord of the Rings Online (or LOTRO, from here on out), I still felt like it was important to write a review for this game because I feel as though it is a vastly underrated MMORPG. There is so much to love about this amazing game but people often dismiss it in their early minutes of playing because of its appearance or other factors, and I think that this game deserves so much more than that.\n\nI want to try to keep this review short (which will be difficult because LOTRO is an enormous game, so there is a LOT to cover if I really wanted to touch on everything), but do keep in mind that from hundreds of hours of playing I have a lot to say and am strongly opinionated on some things, so I won't shy away from going in-depth when I need to.\n\nPROS:\n\n(+) - GAME WORLD: This point, right here, is what really makes this game so magnificent for me. I've got to hand it to the devs at Turbine, because you can tell right away from your first moments in Middle Earth that there was some SERIOUS time and effort put into studying and implementing Tolkien's visions from the famous Lord of the Rings series into a vibrant game world. The scale of the game itself is incorrect (if it were correct then the game would be terrible, because crossing the map would take forever), but what IS mostly correct is the geography and topography of Middle Earth in video game form. From the icy peaks of Wildermore to the lush and colorful forests of Lothlorien; every zone is intricately crafted to match the descriptions found in Tolkien's masterworks, not only so that the areas are accurate, but also so that they are absolutely beautiful and lively to play in.\n\n(+) - SIZE AND SCOPE: I mentioned earlier that LOTRO's scale is largely inaccurate, but Middle Earth is still ENORMOUS. Seriously, it's hard to understate this. I've played open-world games like Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and LOTRO puts their game world sizes to shame. This, in turn, makes the game so much more immersive and memorable because there are just so many areas in the game, each with their own unique aspects and characteristics.\n\n(+) - ART STYLE: The devs at Turbine decided to adapt a more realistic graphical and artistic style, and in my opinion it really paid off. I will touch more on graphics in the "cons", but one thing that newer players to the game have to realize when playing LOTRO is that much of Middle Earth's charm isn't found in the textures and pretty effects, but rather in the creative and artistic direction that it aims to portray. LOTRO is such a beautiful game, and you can really tell throughout all of its scenery. It's difficult to talk about art direction for very long because everyone has their different interpretations on artistic superiority in video games, but in my eyes, LOTRO's art style should really be appreciated because it makes the game world stand out from many of today's newer MMORPGs.\n\n(+) - SOUNDTRACK: Another feature that makes LOTRO such an immersive game is its epic soundtrack. There's a wide variety of songs here (like, hundreds of themes), and each compliments their respective regions fittingly. Although I can't describe in detail what the music is like because I feel as though players will get a better handle of it by playing the game themselves, but I feel like the music is not only strong and melodic but also very atmospheric, which develops an even higher quality gaming experience throughout LOTRO's Middle Earth.\n\n(+) - COMMUNITY: LOTRO has, by far, the best online community I have ever experienced in ANY multiplayer video game. As a League of Legends player who constantly encounters toxic, rude, and straight up disrespectful players, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that LOTRO has a welcoming and kind community of many different members. I'm currently in a closely knit kinship with many different members that always speak to each other and take pleasure and helping each other out with the game. The thing is, it's not just my kinship! Among the ten servers, there are many awesome kins that are not only helpful but also very friendly, which just serves as a testament to why LOTRO is such a joy to play with others.\n\nCONS:\n\n(-) - PAYMENT MODEL: LOTRO's payment model remains to be my single biggest problem with the game and it's structure. I don't want to go too far in-depth because the model present here can be very confusing, but essentially, LOTRO is free up until you hit about level 30. After that point, you have two choices: you can either cough up some money (in some cases it can be quite a lot, I paid about $80 to unlock all of the game's questing and expansion packs), OR you can grind yourself into misery and depression as you do a bunch of boring tasks called "deeds" which range from "Kill 360 of these monsters which you can only find in one concentrated area!" to "Run throughout an area and try to find specific locations!" The problem is, even these tasks aren't unlimited, so you can only do so many until you run out and you can't earn any more premium currency. Don't be confused, this doesn't mean that LOTRO is "pay to win," as there are no gamebreaking items or anything that you can buy with premium currency, it just means that instead of being "free to play," as LOTRO advertises itself as, it's really more of a "buy to play" game.\n\n(-) - GRAPHICS: I hate to say it, but LOTRO just isn't a graphically pleasing game anymore. The game has been around since 2007, which makes it 8 years old and it really shows. Textures are muddy, distant objects are pixelated and the character models... don't even get me started. The character models are mostly just flat-out ugly and when most people get into the game, the deciding factor of whether they like it or not is going to be usually determined by the graphics, which is a shame, because I believe that LOTRO should be looked at not for its graphics, but rather for it's content. However, it's inevitable and I understand how people feel about it.\n\n(-) - COMBAT: Not much to say here. Some skill animations are cool, but the combat of LOTRO consists of very simple key combos and doesn't really provide much difficulty. When it takes you as long as I did to get to max level, this combat can get to be EXTREMELY monotonous and boring.\n\nTL;DR: If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings and of MMORPG games, maybe even if you're not a die-hard fan like I am, there are still plenty of things to enjoy about LOTRO. It's gorgeous, it's lengthy, it has an extremely friendly community, and it's great for anyone who has ever wanted to explore what may be the best iteration of Middle Earth to ever be portrayed in a video game. However, if you're not crazy about The Lord of the Rings, there probably isn't much for you here. The graphics are very dated, the combat is often monotonous, and the payment model is arbitrarily confusing. There are plenty of other MMOs on the market too, and I can even recommend some! Go play RIFT, or TERA, those are modern day MMOs that do things right. Overall, if I could say one thing about the game that applies to all kinds of players, it's that you should at least try it out. It is free to start, and if you like it as much as I did, then you can buy the rest of the game and still have a great experience.","July 10, 2015","true","482.6"," 136 of 160 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","136","160","11","0"

It's a "Hotkey-MMO" similar to Everquest 2, RIFT and World of Warcraft. Focusing more on a player storyline that goes through-out your leveling experience. Don't be fooled by that last bit. It's not a 100% in-a-line story RPG experience in a Massively Multiplayer world, there will be level gaps where you'll take time off from the story and do the good ol' MMO questing. That's the short description I can think of.\n\nAside the basic questing and the Story-line, known as the "Epic", we also have instances (some scalable with your level with a minimum level and some with a set level), skirmishes(scalable to your level starting from the level you unlock them at), raids(same as instances) and PvMP(Starts around lvl 10ish. Scales to cap.) among some here-and-there lore, references and the like.\n\nThe F2P model. Well this is something that rubs a lot of people the wrong way. To be frank, no one likes that a game, advertised as free, has the cash-shop surprise. However one should keep in mind that there's a difference between Free to Play and Freeware games.\nIs it bad?\nIt's better than most, but then again, all F2P games should be taken with caution.\nWhat exactly is available to you from the start?\nThe flat out free content includes the majority of the classes (with the exception of Rune Keeper, Warden and Beorning), all the starting zones (The Shire, Ered Luin and Bree Land) and 1 post-start zone, Lone Lands, which ends around level 32.\nAccount limitations:\nNo level limitations. (Aside the level cap, of course)\n3 bags out of 6. (Static 15 slot bags)\nAll crafting tiers are available, but you only have access to the first 2 reputation tiers in a crafting guild. (Or something like that.)\nGold (100c = 1s, 1000s=1g) is capped at 2.\nYou have 2 character slots on each server.\nEach character has 2 free virtue and race trait slots out of 7 and access to the Class Specialization tree, but not the specialization bonuses (an extra bonus per 5 points in the chosen "main" specialization tree).\nMain Story/Epic is unlocked/free up untill the start of Helms Deep (Roughly around lvl 90).\nIs this really it for a Free player? Just this?\nWell, yes and no. You are able to gather the cash-shop currency through gameplay. There are deeds, which are the equivalent to achievements. Majority of the deeds reward the player with the cash-shop currency known as TP (Turbine Points) allowing players to unlock further content for just playing the game. In my time on LotRO I have ran into more than a few players who have been unlocking their way through the game via just that. At times it does feel like a grind, but it is a viable way for a Free player to expand their experience.\nWhere's the, you know, PvMP talk/stuff/review/whatnot?\nI have no interest in PvP.\nIs Lord of The Rings Online Pay to Win?\nWell, LotRO focuses mainly (but not only) on PvE and the Epic questline. In that regard, I have not seen a single thing on the VIP features list, nor the cash-shop that would indicate that this is a P2Win game. It really isn't. Yes, it has PvMP (Player versus Monster Player) meaning PvP is in the game which in its essence is endgame Raid PvP and not your standard Arena PvP. Even there I don't see it being P2Win in any way. This is my point of view on this, opinions may vary.\nWhat is my stance on the F2P model?\nIt feels like an extended trial, infact it has enough content to be considered as something more than just a trial. I haven't seen a lot of games with a F2P model as fair as LotRO has. Which is partly why I've stuck with the game.\n\nMy experience so far:\n\nWhy such a long time?\nI started playing a few weeks after LotRO went F2P.\nWhat have I achieved in the game with that time?\nTo be entirely honest. Not as much as one would expect. I've never been a fast leveler. I like to explore a lot and alt-oholism takes its toll. Which is why I generally prefer to work on deeds for TP, instead of throwing money at Turbine. My highest level character is capped at 100 (provided there hasn't been a sneaky cap increase I'm unaware of), I have a total of 10 character slots and various convenience upgrades, most of which I've unlocked via Deeds rather than real money.\nSo, am I a VIP or?\nPremium. The status between VIP and Free. The player who has spent some money on the game, but isn't sitting on a subscription.\nDo I love it?\nYes, a lot. I'm a LotR fan and so far I have not been disappointed in this presentation of Middle-Earth.\nIs it possible that this form of gameplay will tire me and result in me leaving the game?\nIt's possible. I am quite surprised I've been with it for so long. However I do believe that this is highly unlikely and if I recall correctly the Epic questlines goal is to reach Mordor which is something I would love to personally witness.\nFinal verdict if such a thing is possible with an ever growing MMO (it really isn't in my honest opinion):\nIt's F2P, try it. If you don't like it then at least you have experienced something different and are that much wiser.\n\n\n\nEDIT(s): Grammar and section arrangements for a more sensible format.\nEDIT(s)2:Updated information. Increased the amount of sense made and such.","January 14, 2014","true","161.0"," 90 of 97 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","90","97","0","0"

While the epic quest/storyline continues to be interesting, the rest of the questing is saddled with tedious chores as players help various towns prepare for evacuation, or to resist the advance of the orcish hordes (while that OTHER fellowship goes off to do the exciting stuff); boars, barrels, and inane activities abound. LOTRO's questing content as literary work also seems to have been an age long past and beyond return. The text is mostly banal, contemporary, and ineloquent.\n\nClasses have been revamped, complete with unnecessary, WoW-like spec trees that restrict choices rather than give more. Players interested in overpowered classes will be glad; those hoping for an engaging overhaul will find combat over too unobligingly soon. Item levels have also been introduced/exposed; itemization inflation is set to soar, at a time when the MMO that popularized loot porn is contemplating an item squish to reign in the absurd circumstances they find themselves in. It's as if Turbine hired ex-Blizzard developers.\n\nIt's difficult to recommend this expansion at the current offered price (US $40). If you can afford it, and are invested in the long range to seeing Gondor, Mordor, and the ending of the Dark Lord, then you're probably willing to endure the bad for the good, in which case, forth into ruin and a red dawn, and all that. Despite this expansion's insipidness, LOTRO remains one of the few verisimilar fantasy MMOs available, and the opportunity to experience it with new content is plenty and good enough reason to get Helm's Deep.","November 25, 2013","true","107.8"," 128 of 153 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","128","153","0","3"

The gameplay is very similar to you if you have played MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Everquest and does not offer anything on this front you could not find from another game. Where LotRO shines is the lore, story and world design.\n\nThe Lore stays true to that of Tolkien's works for the most part and, usually, what deviations exist usually are still in the spirit of the professor's works. The story follows the Lord of the Rings book trilogy's story mostly, with lot's of additional content that portrays events during the War of the Ring which are not delved into in detail in the books. The world design and art direction is great, what the game lacks in pure fidelity it well makes up for in design.\n\nLord of the Rings Online offers an unrivaled experience when it comes to exploring and immersing yourself in Middle-Earth, from the burrows of the Shire to the plains of Rohan. The game will hit home with Tolkien fans who enjoy exploration, roleplaying and solo/small group oriented adventuring.\n\nPros\n-Great Story, that follows the books faithfully and explores additional lore friendly events.\n-Good solo experience, the games focus has during the years switched to cater to solo players.\n-For fans of the Middle-Earth Legendarium\n-Very friendly to Roleplayers.\n-Gorgeous world.\n\nCons\n-The game feels somewhat dated by now.\n-Lack of raids and traditional instances in later expansions. ( which might be alleviated if you are interested in alternative instance types, like the Skirmishes and Big Battles.)\n-Weak PvP-content. The PvP has been relatively stagnant and there doesn't seem to be much improvement on the horizon","November 28, 2013","true","001.8"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","88","97","0","0"

Once upon a time, it was a thriving title with a fantastic future. Somewhere along the line, the Riders of Rohan pulled away, Gondor's Men retreated back to Minas Tirith, The Hobbits holed up in the Green Dragon and the Elves left for the West.\n\nTo put it honestly, the change to free to play is what started the death toll for Lord of the Rings Online. Instead of being able to be a part of Middle-earth, you are met with "BUY THINGS FROM OUR STORE" every chance Turbine can get. This is not a "free to play" title. Quest packs are required in order to progress and with the new expansion you are also required to pay for the epic quest line - something Turbine once promised would never be part of the pay to play experience.\n\nIt's a shadow of what it once was. The engine is in desperate need of upgrading and the feeling of being a part of Tolkien's Middle-earth is gone. Even the cosmetic, housing and music system feels old and outdated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/212500/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","Ive got a love/hate relationship with this game.\n\nLove:\n\n- Its lord of the rings, with all the epic story, characters, locations and events from the books (or films)\n- Huge world that has vastly different locations to play in.\n- In depth game systems and mechanics that dont treat you like a brainless idiot gamer, actually requiring you to learn the game and how to master it.\n- Its free (well, sorta.)\n- Due to its dated graphic engine, I can run this game completely on ultra high maxed out settings, and still get super high performance (and most things look pretty nice, especially the world graphics)\n- Its got dwarves, my favorite race.\n- Its got years of content to keep you busy.\n\nHate:\n\n- Dated graphics engine. While i can max out the settings, and some things look nice, other things, like character graphics, are just UH GLEE. Dwarf beards look awful. Most hairstyles look awful. Many textures in the game are super low res/blurry, even using the high res texture pack. The game can also suffer from bad "pop up/pop in" in areas, especially with trees. (would love it if turbine would update some of these things)\n\n- Unintuitive mechanics. Especially when it comes to quests. So many quests (especially early on), not only dont really tell you what they want you to do exactly, but really dont even point you in the right direction. The UI sometimes helps by saying "go in this direction" but not always. And when you get in the general area you are supposed to be in, you are still left trying to figure out exactly what it is you are supposed to do. Ive played The Secret World, and THAT game required a LOT of investigation and brainstorming to solve quests. This games quests, have simple objects that are simply cumbersum to complete due to bad design. This isnt an issue of "hand holding" or making the game easy. Its probablly one of the things that drives a lot of new players away. Factor in the horribly worthless and unhelpful game map, and new gamers are going to feel like getting even a simple delivery quest done to be a major frustrating chore.\n\n- This game really clings to the "You have to wait to you are higher level to do the fun stuff" mentality.  Its seems like all the improved gameplay, better design content, group play aspects, and cool events are designed for players level 45 and up. They also require the paid DLC like Moria and Helms Deep. (which is fine if you like the game. One time fees arent an issue). This "low levels are boring and slow and you just have to endure through them" mentality however, is yet another thing that will drive away players. (which is probably one of the reasons why the game is suffering from server population issues.\n\n- Super boring and grindy quests (especially at low levels). Short of the epic storyline (which makes up about 5% of the low level content), most of the quests in this game fall into 2 categories. Fedex quests (especially if you are a hobbit), and kill quests. No attempt is made to really stray from these either. If you HATE fedex (deliver this item to steve for me!) quests, I seriously recommend NOT starting out in the Shire.\n\n- Lack of low level group content. Pretty much everything low level can be easily solo'd. Even most of the elites you have to fight. The games first dungeon isnt until 20+, and due to the lack of low level players, good luck finding a group for that. In fact, the group finding tool is 99% worthless to low level players. If you are wanting to play this game for the multiplayer aspect, to group with people, its not something you will really experience until you reach much higher levels. My advice, bring a friend or two along when you start playing this.\n\n- Not as Free 2 Play as some other more recent F2P games. Lotro is more of a "Free to try" game. More than a demo, or a 2 week trial, but dont expect a DC Universe or Neverwinter experience. If you dont plan on spending ANY money, its impossible to get to max level in this game. (100). Starting around 35, you will find yourself out of areas to quest in that are free. This will require you to make 1 time purchases to get a "zone" of content which will get you through the next handful of levels. At a certain point, you will most likely need to spend money on some of the games DLC. However, the DLC is priced decently. In fact, you can get the first FOUR (out of 5) DLC packs together on steam for like 40 bucks. However, if you are looking for a completely free playthrough of the entire game, this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, this game is well made, and full of content (some good, some bad). There is a lot of choice and variety to be had, and a set of mechanics and gameplay that leans more towards old school mmo's rather than the simplistically brain dead mechanics of some newer games out there. However, be prepared to google/wiki/forum search for answers about things in the game, because there will be plenty of things you will need to learn.\n\nIf you are ok with spending SOME money on the game, my recommendation is to play to about 20-25 first to see if you enjoy it. Then pick up a VIP subscription for a couple months (30 bucks for 30 months last i checked), and eventually grab the 4 pack of DLC. That is probably the best bang for your buck, giving you as much of the game to experience without it feeling like a paywall is locking you out any further.","January 23, 2015","true","50.1"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","62","69","3","0"

I've seen it from it's early release to it's current days.\n\nSince i live in the EU i started playing this game when the EU part of it was run by Codemasters.\n\nMy first memories of the game are probably some of the strongest memories i got from any game out there, it had a enourmous depth in the game world, i remember running around in Ered Luin and questing (this was before they added quest trackers, so you actually had to READ the quests to get directions of where to go - this was a key thing for a immersive exploration that this game world deserverd.)\n\nAs you crossed borders in the game the music tune changed to something bit more dramatic or peaceful, i ran around for hours just exploring casually, stumbling across named mobs that dropped "rare" crafting materials. At some quest you had to group up to complete them, it took some waiting time but it was a lot of fun doing so - some even remained grouped and decided to quest together after these instance quests. An easy way to develop friends in the game at a early stage.\n\nOnce the first area was done you were to set off to Bree, the current main city of the humans back then (while Rivendell was for elves, Thorin's Hall for dwarves, The Shire for Hobbits) My first time i did this i had no clue about fast travelling, this was my first MMO after all. So i ran through the entire Shire and Western Bree-Fields, this is nearly the size of two maps and it did take some time doing so, but it was amazing!\n\nI later tried out all classes and i got very attatced to being Captain, i raided and did high lvl instances with it. Carn Dûm being one of the best instances ever in my experience, it was massive and it took a decent amount of time to do it not to mention the loot you could get from it and the challenge it gave. (this was before GlobalLFF was born and way before world chat was born, so you had to use map chats to recruit people + no instance finder was there)\n\nThe raids was Rift and Helegrod, both were amazing, Rift being 12 man while Helegrod was 24. There was also open raid bosses out in the world that could drop thropies, a fun addon.\n\nSo, why dont i recommend this game after the experiences i've had with it?\n\nWell it all started with Mines of Moria, Turbine added something called "hope gear" (later renamed to radiance) this was something crucial for Moria raiding, without it you would die nearly instantly since your morale would be -80% at worst or so. This could be considered "tiered gear progression", you need to achieve tier one to be able to raid in tier two (tier one being instances). But the major fault here was the "Legendary Weapons". This eliminated all other weapons in the game more or less, crafted weapons became completely useless, normal weapon drops? Useless that too. Classes that could dual wield had a purpose to get a normal weapon, but your main focus were placed on Legendary Weapons.\n\nAt a start, legendary weapons was a massive grind, massive RNG. You wanted it to be perfect, so you had to be lucky when you "identified" them to see your legecies on them (legecies being stat boosts like boosting certain damage on skills, crit damage, cooldown rate etc etc) and the maximum legacies was 4 when you identified them + 3 reforges after you would be on 7 legacies, then you had to be lucky that you would be given the right legacies. (back then there was no store to buy legacies off, if i remember correctly you could not farm other legendary weapons either and deconstruct them for their legacies to put on your main weapon, the legacies you were given were then ones you had to live with, if you did not like it then you had to start over on another weapon).\n\nThis entire system was extremely time consuming, and it became very crucial at certain points in raiding.\n\nTurbine later decided to trash the radiance system in later Mirkwood i think or early Enedwaith. This was a GOOD move.\nBut the legendary system remained as a plague and even exists today, every update, 5 levels extra, our legendary weapon was uselss and you had to upgrade - endless gear treadmill at a maximum level.\n\nBut then it came, the major issue. And there are only three words for it.\n\nFree to Play.\n\nAt this point, many of us lifetime players were very uncertain at this, microtransactions was a thing too since the store got added at the same point. This was added with Enedwaith or Ost Dunholt raid.\n\nSo what happend after this is how i could call it "the huge war between the casual players and the raiders" - raiding gear started to became non unique since everyone could get them easily, turbine eliminated the true challenge for raids and gorup content. Suddently you could not see the difference between a decent raider and a shire potato farmer.\n\nThey added skirmishes with Mirkwood, this became a massive disappointment, now it's a forgotten content, entirely.\n\nIn the end, the casuals won this war. We raiders got more or less not wanted anymore, our voices was not heard. And of course, if your major playerbase are casuals then you develop more things for them, add more pay to win items in the store to please them, you could be working 20-40 hours on your first age legendary weapon, grind those legacies, max it out, make it perfect. While the guy next to you could spend 40 euros and max it out from store within 10 minutes by buying the legacies he wanted and relics even.\n\nTurbine started to revamp the old areas we had in Shadow of Angmar. Making it more easy for new players, ruining the immersive feeling in those areas and instances, eliminated exploration entierly and made questing linear, it became like following an invisible red line through the maps, more dead then alive.\n\nThey butchered the first instance, by splitting it up in three wings, it became faster to complete, but the feeling died with it too. They butchered one of the most glorious mid lvl instanced called Fornost, and that was my final straw. I personally dont find it funny to have one major boss in each instance due to they simplifying them. The old dungeons had many minor bosses you could run into (sure you could get lost many times but you will learn local direction as time goes by, now a hamster could do it)\n\nThey ruined pvp by adding "Audacity" a specific pvp stat, that killed many builds since we were forced to wear pvp gear (that was mediocre compared to our raiding gears). Turbine have never been able to balance pvp beteen the Free Peoples and the Servants of Angmar. (freeps and creeps)\n\nMost balanced was during Shadow of Angmar, and even then it was not entierly perfect either. We was promised a new PvMP map in 2008 i think, we got it 2015 - and i don't think they worked on this for 7 years, if you have seen it with your own eyes you can see for yourself that 7 years work was not dedicated for this.\n\nLoTRO's reputation has sunk entierly, most of us that loved this game is waiting for it's killing blow, the announcement of  the servers being closed so it will die with some dignity and honor, but thats too late now since everything is gone.\n\nMany new players, those who began after f2p might still love this game - they never got to experience it's true glory.\n\nNow LoTRO is just a p2w exploited game. The developers have run out of ideas and just sprinting to reach mordor then end it. They copy paste old structures in new content (minas tirith got the wall textures that are around isengard, the white city, with a black obsidan wall protecting it - call it what you like, but thats not acceptable.\n\nI highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's not worth your time, trust me.","December 9, 2015","false","239.0"," 408 of 595 people (69%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","69","408","595","34","29"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crackdatdopamine/recommended/212500/","crackdatdopamine","блин","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crackdatdopamine/","139 products in account","Heads up, my review was too long for the review box so I will post the remainder in follow up comments Comments include Pay Model and summary\n\nWell, I feel its time to give this game a fair summary. Lord of the Rings Online is true to the T to Tolkiens Trilogy: The Lord of the Rings. Bare in minds this means a lot of differences if you expect there to be assimilations to the movies. That being said the books h definately delved deeper into the lore and ideas that Tolkien wanted to explore when creating the world of Arda.\n\nA little backstory:\nLord of the Rings Online is now a little over 9 years old as of the creation of this review and is sadly speculated to be taken down in the coming  years due to lack of funding and rights to the ownership through warner brothers. Many many players have come in and out of this game over the years to experience myriad updates and journeys. I myself started my journey into LotRO 3 years prior to now. And I found what the definition of an MMO truely is.\n\nI have witnessed but a third of LotRO's life span but in that time have finished the story up to update 18 with my hunter reached the half way mark in leveling with a Rune-Keeper and had fun exploring and challenging other classes along with friends to the rough mark of level 20. With this I can tell you LotRO is a wonderful game.\n\nWhy?\nLotRO provides and caters to all types of players. Hardcore MMO players can bash out levels swiftly find tough solo and multiplayer challenges at end game and the casual gamer who is in here for the experience can still sink many hours enjoying the combat and content the game has to offer.\n\nWhat are some of the things you can do in LotRO?\nCraft: Choose a proffession with 3 crafting skills within allowing you to create gear for yourself and harvest materials for friend that have different skills you can cater for. Hunt for materials, gather and make. Its simple and rewarding.\nRolePlay:\nLotRO allows players the freedom of doing what an MMO was designed for and it hits the mark harder than any other game, as a hunter I can make a campfire just out the town of Bree, smoke some pipe-weed, much on Lembas bread and listen to my kin play their music. By this I mean you can litterally do player made music and it is wonderful. People will spare time to listen to and you feel like a star when it happens.\nFight:\nWhen you start the game you have the option for quite a few classes such as Guardian, Minstrel & Lore-Master. Each inspired by characters from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. They each give you a unique play style and can be customised down trait trees to a specific deriverative of the class. Build yourself to play alone or to fight aloneside friends almost all classes can be brought to many different styles of combat and it does not get dull. The combat will set you up with a few working combo's but nothing really true, it leaves it up to you to fight the way you want and build abilities how you like. The combat itself feels smooth and satisfying, sound effects are on point and really feel good. Animations may be a bit dated but they still work well and feel fairly suited. You cans tart fighting weak enemies in your starting region. Move on to groups of mobs and eventually come to fight some that learn to buff themselves or gather squads to group up and take you down. The enemies change themselves up as you play through the game and it feels good learn to take your new opponents down. Or to crush them beneathe your heel when you have out leveled them.\nUI:\nThe HUD and UI of LotRO has to be hands down the most customisable interace I have used in gaming... ever. absolutely everything can be moved and scaled EVERYTHING and it isn't difficult to do either.\nAudio:\nThe audio is astounding rarely do you get a game that really slots the soundtrack perfectly into place but by the Gods if anything will be remembered about this game for year to come it will be the music. No you will not here the iconic shire theme or theme of the fellowship but they are replaced with equally memorable unique and above all amazing soundtracks. If you don't believe me wait until you enter Bree and tell me you can forget that wonderful rythm.\nAtmosphere:\nNow LotRO isn't exactly new and some fault it immediately for lack of texture quality or too little amount of polygons simply to forget the appeal of video game graphics when they are OPEN WORLD. This might be hard to get by at first but you can quickly come to appriciate how wonderful Middle-Earth actually looks. The design is for the big picture, zoom out your camera run into the distance the world is created picture perfect plains are open, hills steep ruins are run down and towns are bustling its all how it is meant to be in an RPG and mostly it feels like THE LORD OF THE RINGS.\nGameplay:\nLotRO gives you a few things to do in the gameplay area. Quests the main scenario will take you through your own story as the saviour of Western Middle-Earth; Eriador and your fight against the shadows of Angmar. Later scenarios take you on the story to follow the Fellowship and fight for your life along side Rohan and Gondor. Side quests offer real rewards that are worth your time. Neatly set up so nearby quest objectives are as they should be, close to each other for convinience and a lot of enjoyment when handing them in by bulk. There is other stuff available to you as well such as deeds and skirmishes. Thse are the staples that make LotRO LotRO. Now most MMOs have their conventional dungeons but Lord of the Rings Online changed things up a bit with small enemies engagements similar to that of a dungeon. You may sometimes be running into a camp blind to wipe it of enemies take position fight counter attacks and be rewarded with loot but you might sometimes be defending and have some groups of goblins or tough Lietenants of the enemy pushing your ground for control. These are great fun to do with your friends on and can be done at all levels and for good rewards at that. Deeds are the second staple. Deeds allow you to go out into the world fulfill your duty as a hero and explore. Some are tough but they can be worth your time if you put that time into them. Deeds ask you to do a set number of tasks in each region of the world such as kill so many enemies, find certain objects, explore different places and help people out (quests). Each deed rewards you with Turbine points [which I will get to in the next section] & hard deeds will give you virtues which can be put towards buffing your character. Some give you marks a currency for trading to buy new gear and crafting recipes. Some give you loot-boxes you can open for free stuff. It ends up being worth it and seeing you have completed deeds in your log for an area is one of the most satisfying things in gaming I have experienced yet.","May 6","true","940.9"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","54","58","4","9"

As every fan of the genra kows, most have major flaws, or are just bad copycats of World of Warcraft. This game stands far aside of the common I call it standardised MMO. It's a game I can recommend to anyone that does like the Lord of the Rings story, because that's where this game has it's strength.\nIf you are seeking for fast paced action like MMO's like World of Warcraft has become nowadays, then this is the wrong game.\n\nWhen should you give it a real try?\n\n- If you are a player that enjoys the original sense of an RPG: exploring a world, without the target to rush your character to a crazy maximum.\n- If you like storytelling, because the world with it's combined storytelling is what makes this game, there is no other MMO around that merges these two things and presents them to you while you play like this.\n- If you want a real relaxation, I could never lay back and chill out to an MMO that well as to this, while definately not being boring\n\nAltough it's a free to play title, there is no such thing as pay to win, nor would it even matter. I absolutely hate common f2p models, because they ruin all the fun because you feel like being begged in any point at the game.\nHere, you get your expanision, pay a month of vip, have a lot of stuff permanentely unlocked, such as character slots and goldlimits, and there you go. If you want to advance, get an expansion and keep on. There is no need for starters to instantly buy any expansions, because you can have a lot of things to explore if you play the game with the aim to enjoy the story.","December 29, 2013","true","576.8"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","1"

But time has changed as did Lord of the Rings online, so I will comment on how the game is now.\n\nLord of the Rings online is almost a MUST PLAY for every Tolkien fan. The developer always works close with the Middle-Earth Enterprise (the license holder of Tolkiens legacy) to make sure that the game is very close to the lore. A lore that's one of the most richest ones in the whole Fantasy genre.\n\nThe game world is very well done and gives you a very good feeling of how Tolkien meant Middle-Earth to be. Weather you visit Bree to take a drink at the Prancing Pony, take a stroll across Rivendell or walk through the Mines of Moria, the world feels quite real.\n\nOne of the best features of Lord of the Rings online is the epic story. At the start of the game your character is about 3 months behind the Fellowship. While playing through the 'original' game (the one that was released in 2007), you'll stay behind the Fellowship, only to catch up with them in Rivendell at some time.\nThe epic story does not tell the story of the Fellowship or your character though. Instead it tells a story of what's happening all around Middle-Earth and reveals things that are not written in the book.\n\nGame play though is an other thing. For a MMORPG there's very little player interaction in the lower levels. Mainly the last 2 expansions (Riders of Rohan and Helm's Deep as of this writing) are the places where you need to party to get your progress in the epic story. In the 'older' expansions the game has been modified so that you can actually play the old party content all alone, which I think is a sad thing.\n\nIn all, I think Lord of the Rings online is still a very good MMORPG for it's age and I hope that Turbine will be able to extend it's license (about to expire in 2014 and no word about it so far) so that we can play the game for an other 5 years","November 25, 2013","true","75.5"," 84 of 105 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","84","105","0","2"

The game does a pretty good job at recreating  the lotr universe of Middle-Earth or at least it did at one point. For you see it would seem the worlds are almost empty, If you are thinking of just playing cusually then get ready to grind like hell to get the turpine points to buy most of the items you need in-game. For example you need turpine points to buy the riding skill early game and alot of the other good cosmetic items, but dont get me wrong i like how you can actually get the coins with out having to pay real money it will just take a long time to get them. With the Semi pay-to-win out of the way there is the problem of the servers drying up, beacuse if you are wanting to get into this game now unless you are starting with someone get ready to walk the halls alone. There are a good amount of pros and cons to cover aslso\n\n-Pros\n-well crafted maps\n-decent gaming community\n-not entirely pay-to-win\n-story with an interesting twist\n-crafting is rather good\n\n-Cons\n-close to empty servers\n-lots of grinding for "turbine points"\n-some glitches (though what games don't)\n-armour doesn't have the greatest apeal in the looks\n\nThe lists can go on for both but that is always up to the indivual person, because i have found you can't always go off of reviews you have to figure out if you like the game yourself.

The game is free, so you might as well try it, even if you're not into MMOs or Lord Of The Rings (who knows, maybe you'll get hooked?) and unlike most F2P games, it is NOT pay2win, and you'll probably have no need to pay any money to keep playing until arround level 30-something, when you need more quests (people usually complain that you also need to purchase the riding skill, but this is false, as the game rewards you with store points very often, for completing some actions, and by the time you are able to buy a horse, you'll have more than enough for the riding skill.).\n\nSo, bottom line is, a truly wonderful game, that remains true to LotR lore without sacrificing gameplay in anyway, with a great community and pretty inexpensive to play for a really long time.\n\n\n\n\nOh, you can also slap people with a fish.\n10/10","January 8, 2014","true","384.1"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","39","48","0","0"

The RMT (real money trade) store items are mostly cosmetic. There are some that effect gameplay convenience wise. However, the RMT currency (Turbine Points) can be also earned in game in many different ways. Basically, the game gives you RMT currency as a side result of playing.\n\n-The Community. The community is not the typical MMO trollfest. MOST players you come across are more than willing to lend a hand, give advice or even (sometimes) free items etc. They are very friendly and generally tend to help the new players out.\n\n-Social MMO. Despite this game having boatloads of grindy combat like any other MMO, there are many  unique social aspects to this game. Making/playing your own musical instruments in a band, player/guild housing etc.\n\n-Massive world. The gameworld in this is rather big. While certain areas are locked out until you purchase the expansion, there are equivalent zones for the free (budget) player.\n\n-Customer Support is very ... human. And tends to be helpful with the player rather than absolute sticklers to policy.\n\n-Mounted Combat/Legendary Weapons/Raids/Dungeons/Crafting/Typical MMO stuff etc., etc.,\n\nCONS:\n\n-I had performance issues on my budget laptop.

If you are a fan of the aforementioned books then LotRO has a lot to offer you. It's rich in material from the books, and despite its age still offers a detailed and beautiful rendering of Middle-Earth.\n\nIf you are a fan of MMO's then LotRO is probably not the best bet. It is lacking in PvP (only one region allows for PvP, The Ettenmoors) instead opting to focus upon co-operative play and PvE. At the present point it is difficult finding beginning region play, with most activity occuring at current end-game level. This makes the beginning game play tiers somewhat lonely and more akin to a generic offline RPG than an actual MMO, just another reason why those wanting a true MMO experience will probably be put off.\n\nAnother criticism (as with many free to play structured games) is the increasing reliance on Pay to Win structures in order to make money. This has somewhat unblanced the game and makes it especially difficult at lower tiers. The ability to buy most weapon enhancements and skill increases means those who pay will quickly outstrip those who do not.\n\nThat said the community is wonderful. By and large most of the players are helpful and happy to proved assistance in various forms, with a level of maturity that is fairly uncommon to MMO's. It is also a fairly active community, it may not boast huge subscriber and player numbers but the players by and large are people who play regularly and consistently. In terms of roleplaying the RP servers are quite active, and regular events are held and arranged by players, yet further evidence of why the player community is one of the friendliest and active around.\n\nOn the whole I would definitely recommend LotRO especially to those who are fans of the world, as it provides an extended experience of the literature. It is by no means a perfect game, and it is fairly old now. but seeing as it has lasted so long, is testament to not only the love of Tolkien's works but also to the dedication of its player base.","December 30, 2013","true","391.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

Honestly, this game is not what it once was; that does not mean I don't recommend it. The Lord of the Rings Online is truly a masterpiece made a very passionate team. My first few years in this game were phenomenal - Don't let my Steam numbers fool you - if anything this game has given me a much deeper love for the lore. It's a game where the little things are the best things. The Yule (December) festival is by far the best festival I have participated in in any of the MMOs I have ever played. However instead of going on and on about this game, here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Middle-Earth is huge. Turbine has covered The Shire, to Bree, from Forochel to Mirkwood, Moria, Rohan, Ered Luin, Rivendell, and everywhere in between.\n- Very lore-friendly. Turbine has created an almost seamless integration of your character into the lore, the events that transpire through the main story (epics) fit together wonderfully with the lore.\n- Meet and fight alongside mighty heroes. You will get the chance to meet and fight alongside members of the fellowship. Not only that, but you will also meet people such as Halbarad, Elrond, Galadriel and Celeborn, King Theoden, Radagast and Bilbo Baggins; the list goes on.\n- Witness major events in the story. This includes the Breaking of the Fellowship, the fall of Boromir, - which is waaaay better than the movies -  The Battle for Helms Deep, the final stand of Prince Theodred, the forming of the Gray Company, and many more events, which Minas Tirith and the Battle for Pelennor Fields on the way later this year.\n- The crafting system. The crafting system is by far one of the best I have experienced in an MMO.\n- Legendary weapons. You will be able to obtain powerful legendary weapons that grow in power as they are used; you can even name them!\n- The outfit system. By far the best outfit system I have ever witnessed in an MMO. With the purchase of a wardrobe, you can cosmetically wear ANY piece of armor/clothing in the game regardless of class or race.\n- The deeding system. The deeds while 'grindy' award Turbine Points (TP) which can be used to purchase quest packs, cosmetics, and other things from the LOTRO store (See Below)\n\nThere are no doubt a few I missed, but these are the highlights for me. Now onto the cons:\n- It is impossible to advance in the game without spending money (unless you grind a LOT). I was able to make it to level 52 without spending a dime, and having no quest packs for levels 30+ Levels 1-30 are free, however 30-100 (yes level 100) all require the purchase of quest packs and expansion packs either with real money or Turbine Points.\n- The game is not what it once was. While still enjoyable, the game has just started to really lose it's spark. I truly feel sorry for those who did not get to experience the game before 2012. It was amazing back then. But with all the gameplay/mechanic/etc. changes it has ruined the experience for me and many veteran players.\n- While nice for new players, the game is not very veteran friendly. I covered this more or less in the above statement. With all the changes going on many of the veteran players have left the game. I have seen lots of new players joining, and the game is definitely new player friendly, but at a terrible cost.\n- Lots of the servers are dead (or dying). Brandywine is the server to choose. It is one of the most populated servers and one of the few very populated ones still in game. That's not to say that LOTRO has a tiny playerbase; most people are just on a few servers like Brandywine.\n\nI hope I have been able to sum up this game in a positive way with the 5 years of experience I have with it. I truly recommend giving LOTRO a try. ESPECIALLY if you love the lore; that's one of the things that keeps me in the game. With this in mind, I will mention that Lord of the Rings is nearing it's end. I do not believe Turbine will renew their license past 2017. We will luckily get Mordor, and from the looks of it, the Grey Havens and the areas that are needed to "Complete" the game. If you're on the fence about this game, I suggest you get it while you can; it is free after all.","July 9, 2015","true","218.3"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","31","37","3","0"

Because I am broke.\n\nI feel like writing this review in caps lock and yelling at the top of my lungs “pay to win pay to win pay to win”.\nTo think I used to have so much fun playing this game.\n\nMiddle Earth is beautiful. Beginnings are sweet as you’re not engaged in battles straight away. You start in Eriador, and exact place depends on which race you chose to play with. Crafting is soothing, exploring is fun, everything looks amazing. When you get a horse, things get a lot easier and you find yourself immersed into the world and enjoying it so much. It leaves you curious for other parts of Middle Earth and you want to level up to enjoy them all. Music is great too and fits every scenery beautifully.\n\nBut then, around levels 20-30 you realize you need to purchase a quest pack to play the next area on the map. So you do that, still being into the game. Then you grind grind grind, until you face the same thing again. So you buy another area. And so on. Thing is, I didn’t even mind purchasing packs to see more. What I really did mind though, is how boring and repetitive quests became while levelling in parallel became increasingly harder and frustrating. I'm starting to think the best way to play this game is getting a horse and just riding like there's no tomorrow until you reach Mordor. Noro lim Asfaloth, noro liiiiiim!\n\nUnless on top of all those purchases you want to buy experience tomes. Thanks Turbine, but no thanks.\n\nCommunity used to be better too, but I’m guessing a lot of people left for which I can’t really blame them.\n\nAlso in walks my biggest regret, and that’s starting my toon on a non RP server which is extremely boring and has very little activity. However, if you do the same mistake and want to try other server with the same toon, Turbine offers you to transfer it for 20 €. What a surprise, I think I'll get a heart attack.\n\nStill, there were times when I was so desperate I was willing to put all that aside and give it another shot. Then server started crashing. Guess it’s not meant to be, Lotro.\n","September 24, 2014","false","398.5"," 122 of 191 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","122","191","12","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/l3murcatta/recommended/212500/","l3murcatta","LemurCatta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/l3murcatta/","263 products in account","Wow. It is really hard to review a game which became a part of your life and of your soul. I'll start with negative points then, hope it will be easier for us all this way.\n\n1. Move along if you're not familiar with Lord of the Rings. This game is made for fans of Middle-Earth by fans of Middle-Earth. It is story-driven game which rewards you for being into this world. It is not worth your time nor money if you are indifferent about LotR. Better go read some books. You might as well close this review, won't be anything more useful here for you.\n\n2. Teh graphics suxx. LotRO doesn't hold its line against any of nowadays-popular MMORPGs (except maybe WoW, which looks just as awful now). I'm not sure if I placed 2 first points in the right order, but anyway: if you're looking for impressive effects and fappable grills, move along. Go play TERA, it's just what you need (and quite good a MMORPG by the way).\n\n3. The combat system is decades since deprecated. Yes, it's THAT point-and-click we all were tired of for years. If you consider it disgusting and still reading it for some reason - move along. Go play TERA or anything else, there is a plenty of action MMORPGs nowadays.\n\n4. The game is not free. Period. If you don't spend a single penny on the game, you will have really hard time past level 25. However, don't leave yet. It's the first matter I'll deal with below.\n\nThat's it for contras, I think.\n\nAs promised, concerning money. You have two options: to buy a subscription or to purchase all items (mostly, quest packs) separately. Aside from that, you'll need two out of three DLCs ("Steely Dawn" is auxiliary, nothing mandatory there). Taking all the discounts into concern (~20% off in-game items, 50-75% off DLCs at large Steam sales), the second option is much more convenient. Still, it will cost you dearly (around $30 for Russian players and probably twice that much for all the others: there's a solid reason for this difference, but I won't elaborate here).\n\nStill reading this? Kudos to you then. Now I'm going to persuade you to install LotRO.\n\n1. THE STORY. I cannot stress this enough. The game is highly story-driven. Every single quest is a brick in a huge building of the Middle-Earth story. The epic storyline follows the road of the Fellowship of the Ring. It reached Gondor as of when I'm writing this. And it's called epic for a good reason. Still, side quests play no lesser role. All of them contribute to the story and to the atmosphere.\n\n2.  The graphics. You've got it right, and f**k those who left in the progress. The effects might seem simple, the grills might seem not fappable enough, but it's LotR, not a manga. It feels natural, however natural it might be for a fantasy world. And you have my word that you will stop once in a while just to have a longer look at that landscape.\n\n3. The world. Do you remember? It's the good old Middle-Earth. You can venture into icy crevasses of Forochel (don't jump in the water!), walk among the golden mallorns of Lothlorien, explore the dangerous depths of Moria and ride with rohirrim against the tide of Uruk-hai. You can even find a hat Gandalf dropped at the very bottom of the Endless Stair.\n\n4. The atmosphere. You get used to it, to every good and bad thing about the game, and you really feel like you live in this world. The domestical system. The music. The language in quests is good and proper English (or Elven, mind you). The mobs are not concentrated at farming spots, but are mixed and scattered across vast logical regions. The crafting system (you can actually cook, Valar be damned!) HP is called Morale, so you don't actually die, but desperately flee when severely outmatched. The Dread system which turns your screen gray and replaces minimap with a flaming eye, when you encounter something truly fearsome. Like a Balrog corpse. It is, definitely, the best LotR-inspired game in terms of atmosphere that ever existed.\n\nI could go on. I could mention the community, the music playing (yep, you can play any music in the game at a MIDI quality), the PK absence, the epic battles and whatnot. But I will conclude.\n\nCome and feel it yourself. If you're still here - it is worth it. This is an experience you'll never regret. And LotRO will love you back.\n\nTHIS GAME IS A F***ING BLAST AND I LOVE IT. DO IT. Join the Fellowship.\n\nOh Eru, I wanted to say it from the very start.\n\nSincerely Yours,\nTalcano Mithrenhen, Landroval (ex-Mirkwood).","February 23","true","254.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","27","32","11","0"

Instead, I will focus on other elements of the game.\n\nSo, congrats: you've just found the portal to Middle-earth. LOTRO does a wonderful job recreating the world. Despite the graphics, I still had loads of fun exploring whenever I wasn't off killing orcs. Some places, like Lothlorien, are gorgeous and breathtaking. Others, like Angmar, manage to get under your skin and make you feel just a tiny bit repulsed. The atmospheres of each region are wonderfully conveyed.\n\nTolkien gave us a fleshed-out world, and instead of drastically changing the lore, LOTRO adds onto it. Granted, the LOTRO-created lore is plausible within Middle-earth, so I'm usually content to let it slide. As an added plus, a lot of it is interesting!\n\nI haven't been able to get far into the main storyline (nearly through with Volume 2), but I can vouch that it's engaging. While the Fellowship is off doing their own thing, your character is tasked with helping the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Side quests are the usual fetch/kill quests, so nothing really notable there. You can choose to run around in groups of people (appropriately named "fellowships") or just go solo.\n\nAnd that leads to what I reckon is my only complaint. It's not really a free game. You have to buy quest packs for some regions, so it's a lot harder to level up quickly when you've run out of things to do solo and don't have money to spend. That's how I got bored.\n\nServers are usually populated with a fair amount of people, with most hanging out on the roleplaying servers. Something that made LOTRO really stand out for me was the kind community. I've met a large variety of players ranging from high schoolers to parents. Many offered to help me out whenever I needed it. There will be the rare troll in the chat, but you can simply ignore them. Everyone's there to have fun and nerd out over Tolkien's works.\n\nIf you're a major fan of Middle-earth and don't mind some tweaks here and there, I recommend this game. 7/10.","June 9, 2015","true","117.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","0"

Don't listen to folks who have one or two hours logged, you really can get a lot out of this game if you can put in some time and a little money. After all we all put time into games and some are bloody expensive!\n\nLoTRO is the least frustrating free to play experience I've had as Turbine gives you a taste of everything. They don't lock out 99% of the game. Completing 'deeds' (challenges like kill X amount of goblins) will earn you Turbine points for micro transactions in the LoTRO store. With enough time and patience its possible to buy several store items from in game rewards.\nIf you spend even the minimum on Turbine points (£5) you get upgraded to premium account status. That gives you two more character slots per server and removes the gold cap.\n\nHowever if you're aiming not to spend anything at all you can't have a job or life and do that. That is some serious grinding. You'll also HAVE to spend time grinding the Turbine points if you don't even want to spend a fiver to remove the gold cap, as two gold is not nearly enough in game currency later on. Good thing is that before you remove the cap all money you earn gets saved in an overflow wallet ready for when you do gain access to it.\n\nWHAT FREE TO PLAYER'S GET\n\nThe epic quests that make up the main story line are mostly free (to continue it you need to buy the expansions).\n\nPlayer housing is free. Some items used to decorate can be bought in the store but most you get for free.\n\nSome trait slots are free. These are different to trait trees (the skill trees you spec into to get your abilities). You gain most of these by deeds and they can be slotted to give either passive buffs or more skills.\n\nSteeds. Getting your horse/pony/goat (can only ride goats in Moria) is a free option but the riding skill itself is not free. Don't throw your arms up in protest yet. With small effort you can get the 95 Turbine points you need to purchase this skill. Most deeds that award Turbine points (and most of them do) are worth between 5-10 points. Some deeds are worth more. It's easy to get (VIP's get a free quest that grants the skill). Some steeds are available in the store. With the Rohan expansion you can ride a war steed for mounted combat and customize it's appearance but that can get bloody expensive.\n\nThe Shire, Bree, Ered Luin, Lone Lands and Celondim areas are free. Free, Premium and VIP players all have to buy the expansions, there are five in total. There are quest packs for other regions you can buy in game from about 595 Turbine points. You can travel to the areas you don't have the quest packs for, you just can't do quests there. It's important to note that free content (excluding skirmishes) drys up around level 35-38. Moria, the first expansion is best entered around level 50 so you'll be needing a quest pack to fill in the gap.\n\nSome skirmishes and repeatable instances are free.\n\nJoining a crafting guild is free but you need to pay for full access to it. You don't need be in a guild but it gives you access to far more recipes than you'd have otherwise. Having full access is a distinct advantage as there is far more choice.\n\nAll but the Warden (one of the tanks) and Rune-Keeper (DPS and healing, not the only DPS or healing class in game) classes are free. The Rune-Keeper is well worth it, lots of ranged DPS magic fun. The Warden is more of a secondary tank with combos (called gambits) and other tricks thrown in.\n\nThe fishing hobby (the only hobby) is free. You can catch fish to display in your home or to cook if you or any of your alts have the right crafting profession.\n\nThe in game mailing system is free and is very useful to post items to your alts, not just other players.\n\nCreating a guild (known as a kinship here) is free (well it would be stupid otherwise lets face it).\n\nFree daily silver hobbit present.\n\nWHAT VIP's GET\n\nIf you go the subscription route you become a VIP. VIP's pay the following:\n\n$15 a month\n$29.97 for 3 months\n$59.94 for 6 months\n$99.99 for 12 months\n\nFor your chosen cost/sub length you get:\n\nMailbox field access\nAccess all character trait slots\n500 Turbine points per month\nAccess all quest packs and skirmishes that are not a part of expansions\nUnlimited chat\n20 Slots of shared wardrobe space (this enables you to cosmetically equip gear on any character)\nAdditional inventory slots\nCustom character portrait frame\nDaily +100% XP (for 30% of a level)\nFree weekly gold hobbit present\nAccess all monster classes (Monster play is mostly PvP)\nAccess all crafting guilds\nNo currency cap\nMaximum auction house listings\n\nThe most major benefits are the quest packs, skirmishes, 500 free Turbine points, crafting guilds and monster classes. That gives you a ton of extra content.\n\nPLAYING THE GAME\n\nChoose race of men, hobbit, dwarf or elves, then pick your class. The usual DPS, tank and healer classes are present, along with the squishy pet class (Lore Master, that does more than just use pets). Next is the choice of where your character comes from. Choosing this region doesn't determine more than a preset skin tone and hair colour (which you can change). Choose your hair style, facial features etc, pick a suitable name and away you go. The level cap for characters is 100.\n\nThe tutorial is easy and makes it clear how to use your abilities. A nice touch is the tutorial skip option available at character creation if you've already done it before.\n\nThe usual MMO type features are here. Choose a crafting profession to make useful items along the way, level up and upgrade your weapons and armour, collect type quests, kill type quests, quests in instances as well as those in the open world. Most are set in the open world. There are also repeatable daily quests in certain areas. The interface makes it easy to see who is in your area if you want to start a fellowship (team). There are different instance quests called skirmishes. These can be repeated and are a bit more entertaining than the usual quests as they have a few different objectives and ambushes. You gain 'marks' for successful objectives as well as completing the skirmish itself. These can be completed solo or in a fellowship. Turn the marks in for rewards.\n\nWhen you start to level up you'll be getting trait points. Each class has three trait trees that will determine specifically how your chosen class plays and what skills you gain. Some skills however are not determined by which trees or how far into them you spec as they are standard skills. The Guardian (one of two tank classes) for example has a tanking, DPS and two handed tanking tree choices. You can choose to specialize in one tree or spread yourself a bit thinner into others as well.\n\nBeing an MMO the graphics are not top notch but they are beautiful. Water effects are nice.\n\nUSEFUL INFO ON CRASHES\n\nMany players have suffered from constant crashes. Check out post #11 in this thread;\nhttps://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?521607-Lotro-keeps-crashing\nThat may solve your issues. Also if you have Pando Media Booster installed get rid of it! Not only is it pointless it can slow LoTRO to the point it crashes. Both these solutions worked for me and my wife.\n\nYet again this is one of the vast amount of games these days that has annoying bugs. Hopefully you won't suffer them or at least be able to sort them with the above solutions. Also some of the store items are far too pricey (extra bags and anything steed related in particular).\n\nThere's a lot of nice places to explore and plenty to do once you have a stable game. There are many more features I've not covered such as raids, PvP and monster play, not to mention the legendary weapon system and your free hobbit present you get each day. Have a bit of patience and you'll love Middle Earth. :)","December 6, 2013","true","715.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","3"

I was a bit concerned about it going F2P because most games that do that pretty much design it as Free to Win or design it in a manner that gives those that shell out the big bucks an unfair advantage. Fortunately LOTRO didn't go that route. You can play this game and never spend a penny because you earn points within the game to spend on unlocking material and servives. Sure it comes easier and quicker to those willing to pay for the points but if you don't mind grinding some then you can bypass spending real money. LOTRO to me also did a great job with the immersion factor. You feel like you are a part of Middle Earth. While the graphics don't hold up to the latest titles, LOTRO is still a great game and worth trying.

The -1 is  only  for the slightly outdated graphics.\n\nIf you like MMO's, and know a little about the Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this game. Although, the more you know about the lore, the more you will love LotRO. There is enough content here that  you can easily make the 2 charicters without repeating the same quests. I have put in 2k hours and it is still fun for me.\n\nPaid subscription  - This is  not necessary. In the beginning, this can help with level gain and will unlock a few perks. At level cap, a subscription only allows you into the player vs. monster player area, and  does not make players over-powered. Additional areas are seperate purchases ($7 - $50).\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope this info helps!","November 22, 2014","true","497.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","0"

It has its flaws, but yet there is just something special about it. The community in general are always helpful and willing to help out new players, and after the server migrations the world feels much more populated. Even if you are not a fan of J.R.R Tolkien's work, I would still recommend you try this game for at least the first 30 levels, as you would not have to buy a single thing until then.\n\nPros:\n- Great Community\n- The only game that allows you to explore most of Middle-Earth\n- Very active RP groups if you are interested in that\n- Hundreds of hours of content\n- Possible to play this game completely free (You can earn Turbine points by doing deeds in-game)\n- PvP is fun, as you can play either as the Free Peoples, or as Sauron's Army\n\nCons:\n- The game is old, so even though it still looks very good, the outdated graphics might put some people off\n- There is a lot that you would need to purchase or grind for, if you do not pay a monthly sub.\n- Server issues can cause lag quite a lot, especially in PvP, though in general it is fine\n- Balance issues with some classes, though the game is still being actively developed and balanced\n\nSo overall, I would score Lotro a 8/10, and would recommend anyone looking for a decent MMO or just a fun game to try it out.","May 4","true","730.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

The recent (2013) introduction of trait trees has somewhat dumbed down the gameplay and has particularly hurt support classes, making them less useful in raid situations. The Helms Deep battles however have added some level of strategic play which may compensate some players for the loss of complexity elsewhere. Of course new players will not experience the loss felt by long term players to the complexity of play and can just enjoy the excellent epic storyline and the great graphics (these improve as you level and reach regions that have been created more recently), but all the areas look pretty as long as you have a half way decent graphics card.\n\nSkirmish and instance (dungeon) play does not become available until you reach lvl 20. Thereafter as you level up more areas of play become available.  It is worth buying the packs as you get more areas to explore and some decent perks. Although you can earn these in game if you are willing to grind Turbine points.\n\n92:100","January 9, 2014","true","394.9"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The story litteraly fallows the books with the player being a step behind or a vanguard for Frodo and the felowship.

A bit outdated now, while this game is seemily f2p in reality it's not really. F2P only takes you so far, until around 38-42. From then on you run out of quests and the grind is so tedious and boring makes you want to quit. But no fret! You can get quests, by buying all the expansions or VIP. Lets not forget you Turbine Points basically become essential mid game.\n\nTo top it off, getting a 4 man dunegon let alone 6. Is a nightmare even on the most populated servers unless you are near max level. Because hardly anyone is leveling new characters. The solo grind is beyond lonesome.\n\nIf you are genuinely interested in playing this game 1-40 then go ahead, it's a good testing margin to see if you like the game enough to invest in the expansions and VIP account.

The game is a beautiful interpretation of Tolkien's lore, and a fantastic rendition of Middle Earth.  If you enjoy the journey, rather than rushing to cap, it's perfect.  Many of the quests are interesting, some funny, some touching, a few a bit over the top with the running back and forth.  Exploring is always fun, you never know what's around the corner.  The devs have hidden little "Easter Eggs" throughout the landscape- a little cabin in the woods housing 3 bears, the occaisional bear-skin rug with a rabit sitting on it, and many others.  Hidden deeds suprise you with a new title when you accomplish an objective you didn't even know you were going for.  These are just the extras, as the whole point of your journey is to help in the background as the Fellowship persues thier goal.  I love it, and the community.

I just added LOTRO to Steam just long enough to write the review.  LOTRO has been my favorite MMORPG since City of Heroes closed.  I have bought all the quest packs and expansions and many unlocks for my only account.\n\nLOTRO is a "Free to Play" MMORPG but if you want to reach levelcap in LOTRO, you will have to pay some real money.  You can grind for store points by completing deeds on each character on your account, but you would have to work hard to earn enough just to buy 1 quest pack.  The best way to play LOTRO, imho, is to pay for the all the Expansions and Quest packs, then take VIP for 1 month, then create all your characters, then play for free as Premium account.  You can also Google for guides to show you how to earn enough TP to Play for Free, check steam guide also.\n\nI suggest you try it out from Steam as Free to Play, then if you really want to pay, go to Turbine to pay.  Expansions have to be bought separately, but can be bought with Turbine store points. The Quad Pack and the Helm's Deep pack from Steam is a good deal when on sale.  Paying for VIP for 1 month will unlock all the stuff for each character you open that you would have to buy separately.  With store points, you are able to unlock alot of things that VIP players get for free, and are in premium and free accounts to annoy them.  Turbine store has a lot of sales on points bundles and items in store.  There are No Pay to Win items in the game store.\n\nThere is no pvp servers, just a pvp zone for level 105 subscribers to fight player controlled monsters. Plenty of raids, dungeons and instant action content.\n\nFree to play accounts only have the landscape enemies, epic story quests, few instances, some instant action games, 3 starter areas and 1 area lvl 20 to 30, and can make 2 characters.  Has a great Crafting system.\n\nLOTRO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in a fantasy universe based upon J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth writings. It takes place during the time period of The Lord of the Rings  movies. The graphics and controls are good still.  The level cap currently is 105 and there is plans for more expansions. The game like all other games has it's faults but it is better than the other games out there currently still, imho.  Turbine is quite generous with awarding store points for just playing LOTRO and the game is more Free To Play friendly than others.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PqXELxO5LI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByyVimWhxgw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b-TuBs2OC0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMlUpz-hzWY\n\nhttp://lotro-wiki.com/\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-review/\n\nhttp://www.engadget.com/2013/01/31/why-i-play-lord-of-the-rings-online/\n\nhttp://mmohuts.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-online\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Online","December 16, 2014","true","0.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Tolkien's famous works. Here you get to explore Middle-earth at your own pace, together with friends or all alone. Since LOTRO was first launched in 2007, it has grown from being a fairly small MMO to be among the biggest and broadest worlds out there. You can explore famous sites as seen in the movies and read about in the books, such as the Shire, Bree-town, Weathertop, Rivendell, Isengard, Helms Deep and as of one of the more recent updates, Minas Tirith! And not only do you get to see these landmarks, but you can also explore everything inbetween.\n\nOkay, you can't go everywhere straight off. In fact there is alot you'll have to go through to get to Gondor and Minas Tirith, but the story and places you visit on your way is just so masterfully created. You create your own character and you get to be the hero of Middle-earth in your own adventure paralell to the travels of Frodo and the fellowship. You'll see sides of Middle-earth that you never really noticed in either the books or films before.\n\nAnd the best thing about LOTRO is that it is completely free to play! Okay, you can buy Turbine Points and VIP membership to help you on your adventures. But it is also completely possible to farm Turbine Points in-game and get to the level cap, which is currently at level 105, without spending a single real-life dollar.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who has a slight interest in Tolkien's work, be it the books or the movies based on them. I also recommend it to anyone who likes a good MMORPG and wants to try something a little different. Because LOTRO is different from other MMO's. Not only does it have by far the most established lore of any MMO, but it also has one of the very best player communities. Sure, there are a few jerks in Middle-earth too, just as there are in any other place, but overall the LOTRO community is among the friendliest and most helpful communities out there.\n\nThe only con I can state about this game right now is that since it's come so far in development it is a little hard for new players and those of us, me included, who's taken a longer break from the game, to catch up with the newest content. But luckily, the friendly community has got you covered!

I had thoroughly enjoyed the books and loved the movies to an equal measure so I decided to see what kind of game the MMO would be like.\nThe experience was honestly the best I had ever had out of an MMO up until that point and I loved it down to the core of my heart. I loved exploring around the vast maps on my mount, dismounting to farm and complete quests and then return to uncover more story and venture deeper into more and more locations.\nThe I found instruments but didn't know about how to use them correctly so I left them to one side.\nEventually during my adventures I caught up to a group of people in the same area who were courteous to me and even allowed me to join them in their party so that we could all complete the quests faster and adventure together.\nNot long later they invited me to their Skype group and we would talk and play LotRO for hours on end. Slaying everything from the lowly mobs to major bosses and we would do so joyously.\nThen one person in the group stated they had been looking online at guides and forums and had stumbled across ABC files. These were essentially MIDI files that were programmed to work with instruments in LotRO. We messed around with them initially until someone in the group had the brilliant idea of synchronising our music by counting down in Skype and beginning to play the same song simultanbeously.\nWe did so and the result was fantastic; we were essentially a small orchestra of terribly mismatched instruments but the sound was fantastic to us nontheless. Not only this but when we began to do this in centers of population like towns and hubs other players began to gather around in small crowds and use dance emotes as we played the Star Wars theme tune, MJ's Smooth Criminal, the Pirates of the Carribean theme tune and so on.\nEven though this had nothing to do with the game itself it was as if we had created a tiny meta-game within LotRO which we as a group resided and we even stopped questing as a whole. We simply went from town to town as a traveling band and it was the best time I have probably ever had in an MMO. It was also an extremely unique experience. Never in my life had I ever played an online game in order to avoid playing the online game in favour of doing some stupid pointless thing and it was still so enjoyable.\n\nThen the updates happened. Not only did servers begin to die out and disappear but they eventually released a patch which broke the instruments. HOW they broke the instruments, items which have literally no impact on the rest of the game or needed modifying or changing in any way shape or form is still beyind me, but they did and this crushed my heart and the hearts of my fellow group. We had spent what mjust have been three or four moths running aroudn playing music and being generally stupid while occasionally helping lower level people who required assistance withing quests.\nWe unanimously decided to all leave the game. The thing which had become the core gameplay to us long after the grindy and repetitive combat had become stale was lost.\nWe waited for a few weeks. We posted many complaints. There were quite a lot of forum posts. But this was to no avail. After each passing week the desire to return to LotRO had subsided and I have never return since.\nThis in it's entirety is the tale of my LotRO experience. Although it may not be the most useful or the most interesting this is how I viewed the game during my playtime and the reason why I abandoned it.\n\nP.S. If under any circumstance they have fixed the instruments please reply to this so that people will know if they have not played the game but my desire to play is no longer here so I will not be returning regardless, thank you.","February 16","false","41.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","18","26","4","2"

Within 10 minutes, I saw such incredibly horrible rubberbanding on my warsteed (which was something people complained about when this system came OUT in 2012), that I don't wanna see more.\n- Game feels empty now, hardly saw any players, my formerly big and active guild is deserted now\n- Whatever you wanna do, you are always reminded of the store, and there will be always something blocking you unless you sub or buy TP (or grind)\n\nI am saddened by what the game has become. It was so immersive, had such a great community (especially on Laurelin-RP), but now feels empty and abandoned, and for a returning player, there is hardly any motivation to stick around and come back because everything is locked unless you pay. So this "F2P" feels more like an extended trial. I have no issues with F2P, many games do it so much better though.\nThis is just a shadow of its former glory, and the few minutes I just spent after my last hiatus gave me no reason at all to ever come back.","December 27, 2015","false","2.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","3"

Almost had 200 hours playtime now and I'm just approaching the point where you have to start buying expansions to carry on playing the game in the same way. The game is still playable without expansion though and there is still more things to do, but you will be unable to do all of the sidequests which make progression in the came natural and prevent you having to grind levels.

Or perhaps you aspire to be a warrior of the Free Peoples by wielding a shield with as much expertise as shield-master Boromir or string an arrow to the bow as elegantly as the archer Legolas and leave a pile of Orcs in your wake?\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Online offer all those opportunities and more. Excellent graphics means that you really feel the whole Middle Earth experience when you walk through the town of Bree and into the Prancing Pony for a glass beer or mug of ale. And yes, LOTRO will let you do that!\n\nHaving spent the past few years of my life playing this game in my free time, I will admit that initially downloaded the game not knowing what to expect of LOTRO's idea of Middle Earth but now many years later, I am proud to say that I've got the chance to do deeds that would make Aragorn consider leaving Arwen for. Or make Boromir betray Gondor - if that makes more sense to you.\n\nFrom simple solo exploring of the fields of the Shire to raiding up with up to 23 other people (24 in total) to fight the likes of vile creatures such as Balrogs and Dragons, LOTRO has it. A good combat skill and trait system allows for dynamic fights and variety of gameplay amongst the various classes. Feel like wielding a shield and turning into a unstoppable version of a defensive god or grasping a greatblade and breaking the Middle-Earth record of "number of Uruks killed"? Then make it happen by playing LOTRO.\n\nTaking all of the above into account and adding on things like a wide choice of mounts for players, a flexible and in-depth crafting system, unique legendary items, player housing filled with the Balrog's Sword (a loot dropped from killing him) makes The Lord of the Rings Online THE MMO to play.\n\nTake your first baby steps in Middle-Earth by giving this game a try - who knows, you might even get into the history books found in the Library of Rivendell.\n\nFOR GONDOR!","June 13, 2014","true","683.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","1"

Each "slots" purchase gives you 3 slots to sell your items. Pathetic and not nearly enough\nYou need to buy a "Mount Skill" in order to use the mounts in-game, which are desperatly needed since your character in-game is stupidly super slow\n\nAny basic features you need to use that are provided for free and easy to use in any other F2P MMORPG, you need to grind and spend hours on end just to use in this game\nThere is such a heavy focus on the LotRO Store and the game practically forces you to buy into their stupid VIP Premium crap, and punishes you if you don't\n\nLoTRO is just a P2W exploited game\n\nAll the pointless restrictions can be unlocked, via the LotRO Shop, by doing "Deeds"\nBut Deeds are just a boring, endless grind of killing the same monsters that take hours on end just to turn up with afew Turbine Points (LoTRO Shop Currency). You get 15 Turbine Points for about an hours worth of grinding the same, slowly respawning Monster, and some of the lower costing features is around 95 Turbine points\n\nThe game is incredibly boring, and just a long boring chore\nIt's just jam-packed with courier missions that make you back and foward from one town to another, to transport an item, give a letter to someone, or tell someone something. Things slowly pick up by level 20, but not nearly enough to make the game fun or intresting\n\nTL;DR - The game is one long, boring, P2W chore\n\nI highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's really not worth your time unless you're willing to drop so much money into this game","March 2","false","44.5"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","1"

But I cannot recommend it anymore, because some year ago something bad happened to the game.\n\nSomething R-E-A-L bad.\n\nNamely: Warner Bros.\n\nYes, this bad. You could've heard enough about recent WB fails, like selling "early access" Arkham Knight PC port, or not so much better Mortal Kombat X PC port launch, dropped down completely amidst the console version's life cycle. It's no different with an /initially/ PC-based MMORPG.\n\nFirst thing WB got their greedy hands on this game, the developers team were cut down in nubmers then set on the quest of making more updates yearly than ever before. After a year of this development strategy, we have a typical WB's PC game: unoptimised like hell, bugged everything, constant crashes. I'm not even going into in-game balance or quality of the new content itself. It suffers and sucks.\n\nHere're some facts. Current lategame locations of Gondor can hardly present one or two original models, everything else is re-used "spare parts" from previous locations, starting with trees and bushes and ending with textures and city architecture elements. I never go to the latest released location because I always crash on entering it then crash every 30 minutes while traversing it. (GTA V 1080p ultras AA x8 40 fps) I've recently completed an instance and it bugged so I didn't get my loot. And the game's full of it.\n\nIt is dying. Two years from now WB's exclusive licence for Middle-Earth franchise expires, and it will be the end of it. Don't go there, because you'll fall in love with the game's early content and are going to be hurt witnessing the current state of it's decline.\n\nP.S.\n\nBack before the Russian servers were closed, I had around 4500+ hours /played across all of my 4 mains and couple of crafting alts.","February 12","false","474.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","14","21","5","0"

I know there have been some folks who played it when it had been sub based, and they make strong valid arguments for why it was better before. I wish I could have played it back then, but while this game now is pretty fun and unique I fear this game may be dying. Only for two reasons first each content update is closer and closer to mordor, maybe they have plans for after but this is a problem for an MMO that has an "end game story". Second the servers seem a little.....under populated some times, most players are now long time hardcore ones who play the high lvl maps so being a new player will be lonely for a bit. By all means play the game, the community is friendly and extremely helpful, the content is immerssive and well written, and the map is YUUUUUGE!!! Now once again I could very well be wrong about the end game, they may have other plans, either way if the Tolkien world and MMO's enthrall you then this is a MUST PLAY for you.

This is because a lot of the features in the game, such as fast-travel, mile-stone bindpoints (teleportation points), and upgraded mounts aren't available immediately to free-to-play players.  That is not to say that mounts are entirely unavailable to free-to-play players however, a mount is available to any character at roughly level 20.  Obviously it is necessary for the company to provide services that must be paid for in order to keep the game running, and considering the fact that an entirely new player could go into the game and immediately start playing what would be roughly 70% of the game content without spending a penny; that is a pretty good deal.  Not to mention that, as i said previously, if you grind 'turbine points' in game enough, you can collect enough to pay for all of the expansions - granted it would take a long time, but it is certainly possible.\n\nAll in all, i would rate this game 9/10.  The point loss is purely because there are still a few extremely minor inaccuracies in the game that are noticeable to Lord of the Rings fans who are extremely knowledgeable to the lore.","February 12","true","120.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

R. R. Tolkien's Trillogy - The Lord of the Rings. It is based solely on the books, and therefor differs from the Peter Jackson movie version -- which took significant liberties with the books. There is no "Dwarf Tossing" or "Shield surfing" in Helms Deep to just pick two glaring examples.\n\nThe world of Middle Earth is huge, and contains many "easter eggs" from both the books and Tolkien's life.\n\nAt present, November 2014, LOTRO has no "end-game" - it has only just begun the third book of the Trillogy, and will probably not reach the Black Gate until 2016. But while we hope Sam and Frodo reach Mount Doom on their own, there is much to do to clean-up Sauron's deviltry in the rest of the world.\n\nThere is much to do in Middle Earth. 29 Servers provide a wealth of opportunity for players to create different characters for each of the four races - Dwarf, Elf, Man and Hobbit; and in each of the classes - Hunter, Champion, Guardian, Captain, Minstrel, Lore-master, and with the appropriate expansions, Rune-keeper, Warden and the just introduced Beorning. Players can create characters on each server!\n\nThe Fan-run website: https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Main_Page provides a wealth of information about the game, from items and quests, to background lore.","November 17, 2014","true","616.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm a big fan of Middle Earth and getting to see bits of lore that you don't experience in film (like Tom Bombadil for instance) really helps bring this world to life. I love the emphasis on kindness and friendship, and following the epic storyline makes you feel like you are a part of this world and that you all matter.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I feel it is fairly standard in terms of controls - easy to get the hang of once you learn the differences from other games. Some people may not agree with the locking out of certain features in-game for free players, but these are easily unlockable with enough effort and determination without having to spend a penny.

Its an absoloutely amazing game, especially if you're a big fan of the LOTR triology, as you can easily relate to many parts in this game, story, characters etc etc...The game truly has great content, and a huge world to explore as you level up to capin at 105 :) ...Graphics are quite decent , especially on high specs, and runs quite well on alot of systems.. no matter if you have an average pc/laptop etc...Communities are great and there is always someone there to give you a helping hand when you start off. Apart from the exciting and adventurous story and quests, LOTRO also brings PVP, which is quite competitive involving the Freeps( the good side :) ) vs Creeps( the monsters/bad side). Both are playable and both are great, its all up to a matter of preference which side you would like to PVP as :) I wont review that in detail, but there's plenty of playthroughs and info on pvp online.\n\nIm currently a lvl 52 Beorning [ with a lvl 63 hunter : Dirar ] ( totally F2p ) in the server of Evernight, Name : Hranvir, and have not spent a single cent getting here, with an expansion, and around 3 quest packs, as well as gold cap, Auction house slots,beorning class w/ character slot , and  more restrictions all unlocked by doing the deeds, quests etc to unlock these ( Turbine points/ TP ) , basically farming and also using different alt characters to repeat... making hundreds each run. It just shows that if you're a F2p even for the start, how far and how much you can achieve without paying anything, just with some time,patience and dedication, which will pay off in the end :) . Its up to you if you want to pay for the end game expansions, content etc something that i might possibly consider, (even going VIP for 1 month will unlock many permanent restrictions on your account, aswell as giving you some TP, only for the price of $15 I think) I have not done it yet but its definitely worth it imho.\n\nOverall, if you loved the LOTR story/books, and are a huge fan of MMO's ,you like open world action, the freedom to do/go as you wish, meet many new friends, and encounter some great adventures... this is the game for you! :)\nI personally love this game and once you get started, its quite tricky to let go :) its just really exciting, and is a great experience to try out.. and i would certainly recommend this to anyone and you should download and give it a go right away! ^^ If you would like to have a deeper look into the game/gameplay/action and so forth, Youtube is simply the way, as it will show you through gameplay, the races/classes/mounts/ etc etc. so do check that out!\n\nLOTRO is definitely a great MMO, and one you will certainly get to grips with and enjoy! :)","January 10","true","524.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

TL;DR: In conclusion, worth a shot, not worth sinking money in because literally everything can be gotten from horribly spaced out achievements.\n\nEDIT: i don't need f*cking grammar lessons i wrote this review as a vent","July 6, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","1"

This was a fantastic game with great visuals, story, and the best community in any online game I've ever associated myself with, but it has been turned awry, presumably by the heads at Warner Bro's Interactive. The levelling experience from 1-75 should be as fun as ever, but thanks to horribly uneccesary class changes, among other things, the experience is desecrated. Thankfully, newcomers should still be able to get some enjoyment out of this marred product, though returning veterans will undoubtedly be dissapointed.

Playing solo is boring, as it is slow. Some classes can actually make soloing easy. However, playing solo is entirely viable. At the moment, any class can mow down tons of enemies on their own. At levels 1-90, you will hardly find anyone to play with, there isn't enough people to do stuff with, or they don't have the content, as they have to buy it.\n\nThere's also a bunch of classes with their own mechanics, the most basic of them being the Guardian.\n\nIf you like LOTR lore, this is for you, however, don't expect amazing end-game stuff, and don't expect a top-of-the-line story.\nSome may enjoy the story of LOTRO, as it ties you with the main characters from LOTR, but some may also be bored with the main stuff, rather quickly.\n\nThe PVP is...meh. There isn't any structured PVP so it's all in a region called the Ettenmoors. The balance is for PVP has always been bad/awful, as there is always something OP.\n\nThe community is fairly helpful compared to many other games, but there is always an occasionally jerk/idiot/whatever.\n\nIf you come expecting amazing, you'll kinda feel let down. But it's good enough to say the least.                                                                 Try the game, see if you like it.

For some reason, they decided to take away group content and focus on "Big Battles" which some would argue that it is still group content, but it is extremely lacking. I have played this game since Shadows of Angmar beta and loved it, but without the group content and developers being let go, I have a feeling this game is dying. I hope that isn't the case.

It happens in their D&D game as well. you can run through a long Instance for 20 minutes and get a bit of skirmish marks, or you can do a quick skirmish and get the same number of skirmish marks. And the daily gifts are usually something you don't need or want\nPvP is lacking - I'm not very much into PvP, but if you are, this probably isn't the game for you. The PvP (in LoTRO, PvMP) system seems stale and boring. It is cool to be able to fight on the monster side, though\nGraphics are outdated - models and animations need to be updated, though there are many times the graphics are quite beautiful. I appreciate that the graphics are less cartoony than other MMO's, but an update would help a lot\n\nMany people complain about it now being F2P, but it doesn't bother me, I just love the LoTR world and love being part of it.

It's called Monster Play and has had very little done in terms of making it even remotely balanced. They never have been very bright about this kinda thing though (Turbine tends to think PvE can completely carry an MMO).\n\nIf you're a hardcore lord of the rings fan or you have a lot of patience for grinding slayer achievements for turbine points then I can recommend this game to you.

The main story (epic quests) has you following the fellowship (or running parallel), working in the background to fight the rising evil, aiding the good cause.\nYou will quest around landmarks from the books like Weathertop, and you can find little touches like the petrified trolls in the Trollshaws.\n\nIt may not have the best graphics (but certainly not the worst either). I grew up with a Commodore 64, so gameplay is more important than graphics for me, but things like the use of lighting to set the mood works really well for me, as does the weather.\n\nIt is F2P, but that doesn't mean it doesn't cost a thing to have all content available.\nThe good thing is that the store credits (Turbine Points) can be earned in-game, and that you can buy almost everything that is included in the VIP status with it. The only notable exception is 'fast travel' which you really will miss if you haven't got it, as the game is BIG.\nThe bad thing is that earning TP quickly is a grind, although it can be sped up if you have some high level characters.\n\nCombat is old school skill clicking, which you either like or dislike.\nCrafting is extremely simple; you have the mats, you make the item. (with a % to critical success). I would have liked something more involving, like EverQuest II's crafting perhaps.\nCrafting does require interaction with other players, as you won't be able to get all materials you need yourself for the crafts you choose.\n\nIf you are into PvP, then this game is not for you.\nThere is some sort of PvP (PvMP), where some players have a character on the evil side, and some players play their regular 'good' side characters. There's one map for it, and the PvP crowd varies wildly per server.\n\nIf you are into endgame raids, then this game is not for you. There is no (new) endgame content. There are scaling instances, which are essentially the same from L20 upwards, except with harder enemies.\nThere is some new endgame content in the making though.\n\nMost of the population is helpful and mature, but, as this is an online game, there are some trolls and trouble makers on the chat channels. Although vocal, this is a very small group compared to the helpful people.\n\nOh, one major bad thing: The download is HUGE, and the update process is extremely slow compared to other MMOs.\n\nOverall: If you like the Lord of the Rings lore (whether from the books or the movies) and like to explore Middle Earth yourself, then this is the only game to play.\nIt's free up to around L30, after which you need to unlock quests for other areas.\nWhether you pay for it with money or with time is up to you, which is a fair deal IMO.\n\nAnd remember, the journey is more important than the goal.","April 28, 2015","true","938.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Every server is still highly populated (although some areas may seem barren because really, who wants to spend all day in an area that has litterally one building for miles?) and filled with people of all ages. I've met high school freshman and college graduates. The people playing this game are extremely nice and mature. I've only had two encounters with genuinely mean people and I never had to deal with them alone even if I was playing alone.\n\nThere are lots of quests to do solo and lots to do in groups as little as 2 and as big as 8. There's also a mode where more than one fellowship can play together or somehing I'm pretty sure but I have yet to hit the appropriate level so I can't confirm. If none of your friends wan to play with you worry not! Most everyone is approachable and everyone has common ground. Unlike WoW or GW2 where you could start playing not knowing if you'll ever care about the lore, everyone on LOTRO likes LOTR. Some prefer the books, others prefer the movies, but you all have that common ground.\n\nThere are RP servers but if you don't only want to roleplay, there are an abdundance of roleplayers running around on the normal servers to satisfy your urges when you get them.\n\nGameplay itself is also fun. I wouldn't say it's the most outstanding thing in the entire world. You'll find similar mechanics in other MMOs and it's not any more or less engaging than those other MMOs. Depending on your class you'll get to see some really cool animations, though.\n\nThe main storyline is also very engaging and very fun for fans of LOTR.

Released in 2007, this game has captured my attention since it was first launched with the title Shadows of Angmar. One of the last true RPGs found within the MMO genre, the game captivates with its art and design that still manages to impress nearly a decade later. Despite drawbacks in population, ownership change at Turbine (purchased by Warner Bros in 2010), and the launch of A Free-2-Play model shortly after, LOTRO still has a magical draw about it that compels players to take up arms against the Dark Lord and trek across Middle-Earth. The game is worth the subscription cost, especially if purchased for 3 or more months in advance. If unable to afford the fee, there is a Free option with limitations; just about all of which can be unlocked in-game through the use of Turbine Points gained from completing various Deeds, both kill, quest and reputation. In general, the community is helpful- much of the time willing to assist a newcomer with answers to their many questions. Give the game a try, it is perfect for the hardcore quester, casual gamer, role-player and explorer; something for just about everyone.","January 16","true","176.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And while it my look like an overwhelming ammount of content to go through to a new player, the fact that this game is most proud of is, be you a level 1, 30, 50 or 100, there always seems plenty to do to feel rewarding, and a time well spent.\n\n\nMechanically, its a by-the-numbers MMORPG game, very much entrenched into evey known trope of an early 21st century online game. But its style and gameplay hasn't yet been hampered by it, rather built around it. There's the standard 50+ skillbar of each fairly ballanced class which compliment eachother in a D&D kind of way (the tanky one, the squishy dps one, the buffer, the healer, the run-around-do-whatever-you-like one), working together without ironic subtext, since Tolkien basically wrote the book on them  (ugh...) inadvertently defined the classical dungeon crawling class system anyway. You TAB around the monsters presented and diminish their red bars. Alternatively, you gather materials, craft, randomly explore, complete numerous deeds, roleplay (it is, obviously, an extremely RP frienldy game), buy junk, sell junk, play through story mode, pvmp, do instances (scalable) do quests, do quests, do quests........\n\nThe strongest parts are indeed the stories of numerouns inhabitants of the world, gated behind and propelled by your typical fetch and kill x quests. You could do a lot worse then reading through abysmal ammount of text walls of these chatty NPC's, and, if you're a fan of the setting, it will be a treat throughout the game. It is skippable of course, but this is a text heavy game.\n\nThe FTP model can safely get you through 1-50 without much hassle, and the remaining content is gated behind purchases, but, by then, you'll already decide if its worth your money and time. As stated above, there's plenty to do in Eriador anyway, before venturing forth through Moria into Rhovanion, Rohan and Gondor.\n\nTip: Get a mount as soon as you can, it's a massive game. And don't venture into Prancing Pony drunk.\n\nOh yeah, grinding is, for the most part, optional.\n\nHighly reccomended.","August 21, 2015","true","529.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played it before getting Steam, so I have way more game time than it actually shows.\n\nThis game is basically WOW, except less limited in the free to play.\nYou can unlock everything in the game just in F2P, and there is no difference, except for a few perks, between a player who is F2P or not. There is one location that requires you to be VIP : a location for Player vs Monster Player fighting, but there is another location for that.\n\nThe graphics are not disappointing, considering this game was initially released in 2009, but could use an upgrade to bring them to modern level.\n\nSpeaking of updates, these are happening constantly, with bug fixes, but also new areas and locations, quests, and other content.\n\nNow for the quests. Well, to be completely honest with you, while the main epic quest is loads of fun, and actually had me engrossed in the story for quite some time, (It's really good !), the intro quest for the Elf start is.... lacking.\n\nSure the beginning of it is, kind of awesome, in the middle it is just pure boredom. I had to spend several different day doing it, simply because I was bored with the walking - talking - walking - fetch item - walking quests. That would literally be nearly half of the quests in the tutorial, which takes an HOUR to complete. That being said, the end of the Elf tutorial picks up the pace once again, but - not really that great.\n\nCombat is absolutely fine, no issues with the abilities of any kind, Hunters' focus system is to be enjoyed with the balance. Different combinations of the abilities can be used to fight different monsters and also people. There is a PvP system - you can spar outside of major cities.\n\nThe map is just spectacular. You can explore the entirety of Middle-Earth, with different regions corresponding to different skill levels so you always have something to do in the game.\n\n\nOverall - 8/10, really fun game, but a few of the quests are boring and repetitive, with a few bugs.","August 14, 2015","true","66.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is the ONE MMORPG that I continually play. Why? Because it is so engaging. JRR Tolkien's world comes alive as you visit those most famous of places in any fantasy setting. Rivendell, the Shire, the Misty Mountains, Moria, Lothlorien, Mirkwood, Isengard, Rohan and Helms Deep, Gondor, and soon setting foot on the threshhold of the Dark Lord himself; the Black Gate, and Mordor!\n\nThere's so much more to explore. Turbine has done a wonderful job creating so much content that is in the Middle Earth lore and your character is engaged in many different stories on their way to assist the Fellowship of the Ring in their ultimate quest; to destroy the One Ring!\n\nGameplay is average for an MMO, but I find with the different classes and especially as you level, your character becomes more powerful; no matter which class you play!\n\nThere's so much more to the game than just PvE and questing. You can craft until your heart's content. Decorate your home, kinship home, or entire neighborhood of kinfolk. Legendary Items and armour definitely set your character on the path to greatness!\n\nMounted combat and collecting so many different types of mounts and steeds is pretty fun. Along with the numerous year-round festivals that occur. It allows you to continue to do something new all the time. If you get bored with raiding and questing, go take down some Roving Threats with your friends, hunt for lost treasure, and even engage in some rather fun PvP raids in the Ettenmoors. PvMP as it is called in LotRO is fun; either solo, small fellowship, full fellowship, or join in on a raid to take down some powerful enemy fortresses! There are also associated quests and rewards for gaining ranks in PvMP.\n\nSo, overall, I would give LotRO a 8.5/10. The -1.5 would be for a bit dated game engine and graphics, but it is definitely a lot better than same-aged MMOs and older for sure! (WoW, EQ, EQ2, etc.) Also, it lacks a bit of visual panache that some of the current movies and games offer. The gear artwork is a bit too middle ages European style (clothing, gear, etc.) for my liking. I rather like some of the cosmetic outfits style far better than the actual gear that you get as armour, clothing, etc. They feel far more like what you might see in the Lord of the Rings / Hobbit movies. Much more realistic imho.\n\nSo there's my review. I hope it gives you a feel for the game and that you will come and try it out. Just stick with it! Grind past in to your 70s and you will definitely see what I mean! Stick with LotRO and you will be rewarded and see why I've stayed with it these many years!\n\nRegards!","February 14","true","447.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes, only with a few elder members, but still ..\nGraphics dont look like an high end title, but ye ... it still isn't trash.  Much of key features fot times when game was new, like hobbies, great farming, nice crafting, exping of weapons, raising your own horse, housing for everyone not only for high lvl players. A lot of games after has tried to use these philosophies from lotro with theyr own little inovations.\nIt's the only mmorpg what i have still instaled, all these 9 long years and i'm still loging back. Not for long gaming sessions, I'm now 32 years old grandpa :D But for strong bond with this game, great sceneries, lovely soundtrack and a cup of nostalgia for sunday afternoons. I know, for today's young players is a lot of new games for chose from, with high end graphics etc. But in this game, you've got 9 years of ading quest with no "clicktobehighestlvl" like in wow = months of questing, months of collecting, months of making deeds, months of making your unique named and stated weapon, etc. Try it with your friends for the best experience.

I just felt the need to mention one feature that no one else mentioned, and that I feel makes LOTRO unique like no other MMO- the player music system. You can equip a musical instrument in game and, either by hitting keys or launching an ABC music file, play a song in game that people in the area can hear. Players have formed bands that give concerts, and on Landroval server there is even a yearly event called Weatherstock that attracts musicians from many servers for a day of music on Weathertop. Even if you don't roleplay, the abilty to perform and listen to player music in game adds so much to the experience.","September 19, 2015","true","433.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You won't find better in terms of lore, immersion, and a die hard tolkein fan base.\n\nThe game's one downfall in my opinion is the free-to-play model that is currently in place. You will be spending a lot of time re-rolling characters and running the same zones over and over to earn enough points to unlock the next quest packs, expansions, bag upgrades etc.. etc..

The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game "play speed". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.\n1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.\n2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel\n3) The casual nature and pacing of this game.

The combat and graphics may seem a little outdated but it is still fun beyond belief. It's not easy but it's not too challenging, it's super fun to play with your friends, the map is GIANT and there's so much to see and do. Within my first few days of playing I was invited to a guild by very nice players who taught me everything and showed me how to play, I progressed slowly until I was a total bad ♥♥♥, I spent hours looking for the correct ores to make the best weapons and armor possible. The gameplay is perfect. You start out by fighting wolves with a weak short sword and leather armor and a few days later you'll be taking on orcs and giants with your friends and dual wielding swords that took hours to make and heavy steel armor. THe progression is quite slow which personally I love. But that may bother some people. You can do epic boss fights and raids to earn special money that you can spend at camps to get weapons and armor that look like they were crafted by the gods. This game is also truly free to play. If you want to spend real money on special coins go ahead but it's definitely not forced upon you. You can do everything without spending a dime. I played this game all spring break with my friend. It doesn't matter if you have an old mac and a poor mouse. I spent the majority of this game on a mac and a poor mouse and it ran perfectly. This game may not look like it but if you put the time and effort into it, it will blow your mind. If you can get over mediocre graphics and sorta outdated combat then trust me you'll love this. Anyone who appreciates a good MMO will absolutely LOVE this game!","August 8, 2014","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolframcore/recommended/212500/","wolframcore","Thrain856","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolframcore/","84 products in account","Lord of the Rings Online.. Is it good or bad? I would have to say this is a generally good game. This game is very much your typical mmorpg game. The controls are very simple and easily understood. You spend most of your time in third person observing your character, combat involves locking onto a target, then clicking (or using a hotkey) to trigger the different attacks that are displayed on your action bar. Area attacks do exist, and generally the physics play out reasonably well.\n\nThe World: The world is big. There is plenty of places to explore, and the graphical level is pleasing to look at. While it will not match up in freedom of movement, or detail to Skyrim, it is definitely a fun place to view and explore. At first the world will seem pretty small, it is only as you go along that the distances between locations grow to the point where it is unpleasant to travel there by foot. They did, however, do a good job of matching up when distances get long, with when you your character can get a horse. In summary: medium-big world that is aesthetically very pleasing to look at.\n\nQuesting: The questing system is very closed. You progress through them, some of them are voiced, most only have one or two lines of voiced dialogue the rest you have to read on your own, you rarely have any options. They do not support the player choosing to be evil or good, or making choices that will have impacts upon how the quest will progress. Despite the limited nature of it, they did a fairly good job of making stories that are interesting, and that fit with the lore of Middle Earth. Summary: lack of player options, but decently entertaining anyhow.\n\nCharacters: Character setup is highly limited. You can choose from four races (Dwarf, Elf, Hobbit Man). Then you have a group of Classes;[some titles may be wrong] Guardian, Champion, Burglar, Warden, Rune-Keeper, Hunter, Captain and Lore Master. The races share the classes, with a few classes being disabled for each race (for example no Dwarf Burglars, or Human Rune Keepers. Each class also has three 'paths' that they can follow, those will effect what kinds of weapons they will be good at, and how well your character is at solo play. In general, there is almost no cross-over between classes, and no way to change once you make your character, so research well before you make a choice.\n\nCrafting: There is almost nothing to talk about here. You choose a craft that contains three skills. Some skills let you gather, others let you craft. No single craft you can choose is completely self-reliant, so you will need the help of friends or the general world market to level up all of your skills. Crafted weapons are, however, well worth the effort of getting. They are on average far better than what you can find through loot for your level.\n\nGeneral play: While this game is termed a "role-playing game", there is very little actual role-playing to be found on it. The role-playing servers rarely have players who actually actively try to take on their character's roles. There are some good communities that you can join in with, but if you are on your own do not expect players to be particularly sociable or in character. Outside of role-playing the community is very open and helpful. Questions are typically answered quickly and nicely, and there are almost always players around who are willing to help you out. There are also plenty of player friendly guilds/factions out there to join if you enjoy that kind of play.\n\ntl;dr, generic mmorpg, with its biggest highlight being that it is based in Middle Earth.\n","January 14, 2015","true","47.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game "play speed". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.\n1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.\n2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel\n3) The casual nature and pacing of this game. Everything about LOTRO is tailored toward a more mature type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥mer, So much so before the last major exspansion Turbine just flatly said that there will not be creating any more raid or large group content since no one does it anyway.\n\nA lot of people may or may not agree with this review but I really tried to distill why the people who play this game play it.

Yet I still comeback and play it.\nIt's like the classic MMO but with the LOTR lore, sounds awesome.\nThe game plays great, even though they use target-tabbin, I have yet to see such fluid combat in other MMO.\nIt feels great. You really feel like you're hitting or being hit. This is one of the reasons I keep coming back.\nThe PVP can be freaking awesome and incredibly tedious.\nQuesting can actually be fun, but to get from 1 to 100 should take so long that I'd doubt it feels fun after a while.\nPVE used to be really great, but the old content is abandoned and they haven't released a new raid in a while now.\nThe community is one of the best assets of the game, I have made quite a few friends for life over here.\nFinally, with all the great things I had to say, and that keep me coming back, I must say:\n\nThis is Free-To-Play until some point. You can always play it, but you'll eventually need to take some money off your pocket to unlock later content. The currency you buy, Turbine Points, can be gathered through gameplay, but to get enough would take over a thousand hours.\n\nP.S.: This isn't a P2W game. They surely sell a lot of convenience, and people who pay can really get to that point with less effort, but they don't really sell advantage (anymore).","December 14, 2014","true","772.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would say the game itself is a fairly standard RPG, perhaps above average for a free to play and it doesn't bog you down in restricted VIP only areas. However, a big selling point for me was the fact it was LOTR and I got to explore all the places I wanted to visit from the films. This was FRIGGIN AWESOME. I admit, I spent the majority of this game playing with friends, so I cannot vouch for the solo experience but questing together was the most fun I had on an MMORPG.\n\n\nThroughout the game, you may be able to save up enough currency to never need to invest actual money into it, however I bought the mithril starter pack which gave me enough points to progress as far as I wanted. The first purchase you need to save for is buying a horse to actually be able to get around. This is relatively painless and involves completing a fair few early tasks to get the points. Apart from that advice, take your sword, your bow and your axe and go out and explore the world of MiddleEarth!","August 2, 2014","true","268.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this game is not near as inteesting and I don't think there are many fun quests. I still haven't figured out how to get trained in mining. I saw the trainer on my mini-map, but I never found him. It's like he just disappeared. I still think it's a nice game for someone who is new to MMORPG games, and when you're experienced, get World of Warcraft. I do like the combat system, though. I just wish that the creators would add hundreds of more enemies and enemy types. And also make it to where it doesn't take me half an hour to find a mining trainer. I still like it, though. Even if this review sounds like I completely hate it. It's a free MMORPG, and that's what made me want to get the game. Maybe it's because none of my characters are high leveled, and that's why I don't get many fighting quests. Good game, though. Thank you for whoever read this review.

The combat and graphics may seem a little outdated but it is still fun beyond belief. It's not easy but it's not too challenging, it's super fun to play with your friends, the map is GIANT and there's so much to see and do. Within my first few days of playing I was invited to a guild by very nice players who taught me everything and showed me how to play, I progressed slowly until I was a total bad ♥♥♥, I spent hours looking for the correct ores to make the best weapons and armor possible. The gameplay is perfect. You start out by fighting wolves with a weak short sword and leather armor and a few days later you'll be taking on orcs and giants with your friends and dual wielding swords that took hours to make and heavy steel armor. THe progression is quite slow which personally I love. But that may bother some people. You can do epic boss fights and raids to earn special money that you can spend at camps to get weapons and armor that look like they were crafted by the gods. This game is also truly free to play. If you want to spend real money on special coins go ahead but it's definitely not forced upon you. You can do everything without spending a dime. I played this game all spring break with my friend. It doesn't matter if you have an old mac and a poor mouse. I spent the majority of this game on a mac and a poor mouse and it ran perfectly. This game may not look like it but if you put the time and effort into it, it will blow your mind. If you can get over mediocre graphics and sorta outdated combat then trust me you'll love this.

The movies where amazing. So when my brother introduced me and got me into the game ( A change of pace from my usual Chaos Space Marines)  but the opportunity to play a fantasy realm in witch we both were avid fans about, I took the chance.  Both of us being our favorite hero as Gimli, son of Gloin, we took to the character creation with an idea of mind. ( I'm also a dwarf slayer fan from the Gotrek and Felix novels.) To be long bearded, axe toting dwarves. And as it was , we could! Other than dwarves you can play as other races of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth...men, hobbits and elfs. Also like other rpg's you can choose from various classes. Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Burgler and Loremaster. Each class and race brings to the game a specific play style along with culture and language and skills and story line. Dwarves for example, get and axe damage bonus and a stamina regenerative bonus for being a harty people.  So choosing and making you're character does change you're online game experience.\n\nThe game itself is so fully in depth and full of fantasy lore that its hard not to be overwhelmed and lost in it. Even if your just a fan of the books, or just the movies or just like rpg's. You'll find yourself reading the quests and missions, enjoying the simple basic rpg mechanics( Legendary weapons is A LOT of fun) and instances its hard not to be captured by Tolkiens world. Its all there, down to the movies soundtrack to add to you actually want the music up and loud when you’re slaying goblins in the Misty Mountains. In game you play as a hero of the Free Peoples defeating every orc and goblins in league with evil, from Erin Luin to Moria (my favorite) to Gondor.\n\nCommunity wise it has to be the most friendly based I have ever played with. There is always a fellowship, kinship out there to help with a quest or instance or get items or even craft them for you free of charge. Honestly it has a great atmosphere with a '' Were in this together'' and ''All for one and one for all '' attitude. A great game if you like joining with others and having fun rpg dungeon crawl wise.\n\nAs a free to play game technically, there is a pay to play feature. With real money you can buy traits, skills, steeds, quests and maps that can easily create a large hole in your pocket. But if you choose to pay you definitely wont be found wanting. Even as a free to play game there is plenty of content and game play that you won’t be crying exactly that you didn't get the full experience. but there is so much more, if  you are willing to pay for it. It doesn’t make your character so much better than others or game changing where you become a God amongst men, but it definitely can change your experience. To make your steed go 250% faster or to play that one instance where you defeat the orc armies of the Iron crown. It’s up to you. As a free to play player myself sometimes you do wish you could do a certain quest or skirmish and there is a way. In game, for completing quests and deeds you can earn Turbine points which can pay for real money perks! It's a nice way to get some of those pay to play perks for us that have empty wallets.","March 5, 2015","true","325.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a classical MMORPG outlook of Middle-earth but the walks between Bree, Shire and Blue Mountains aren't as tiring and long as it would be if the game was 100% canon.\n\nMind you, there's a very complex process in recreating scenarios and plots when you try to make a game or a movie from events of a book. Likewise, to make a movie after a very complex game. While not impossible, the quality won't be the same, and from a fan's point of view, might as well burn the whole thing...\n\nNo no, I'm not going to start a discussion about what the Tolkien society thinks of Peter Jackson's works or any of the other bs.\nMy point is that you will encounter some artistical improvisation in the game that might confuse most of you Middle-earth fanatics. Bear in mind that making a balanced game world, even with Tolkien's ideas, requires some improvisation here and there.\nAs such, you will encounter areas, monsters, bits of unknown lore, either made from scratch or continued from the bowels of all speculations.\n\n"Does that diminish my gaming experience as a die hard Middle-earth junkie?"\n\nThat depends on you  really, while the atmosphere is very canon, you have to delve into the game to feel whatever charm it has.\nTry the music system of the instruments you can find and learn, go fishing, explore areas that aren't too dangerous. Do you feel dwarf-ish today? Go mine ore to make armour, shields, swords and axes for your kinsmen. Feeling like a greedy dwarf today? Go mine jewels and make amulets for your...self.\n\nThe game is F2P mind you, though you will need to pay a monthly fee to have acces to advanced areas to quest around, though you can make micro-transactions in the store and just buy the quest packs you desire. Want Angmar, Evendim, Forochel and Moria quest pack? Sure, knock yourself out.\nAlso, bear in mind that the main Epic quest is free to all players.\n\nToo frugal?\n\nJust do slayer and exploration deeds where you receive Turbine Points which you can use in the store to buy game content you desire, traits, unlockable craft guild traits and so on. There'll be a bit of work to be done through that method but there's no hurry either way, especially when dem discounts are lurking on the horizon ;)\n\nAm I talking too much? No, YOU'RE dilly dalllying too much, you filthy Tark.","June 14, 2013","true","097.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is so massive and fun to explore, all the quests are enjoyable and I actually want to do all the side quests, and the story quests are really engaging. At many points I find myself wanting to know what happens next. The lore of Middle-earth is very well represented, and the game feels very true to the source material, even though it does take liberties, as one would expect. The community is a good one, and you can almost always find somebody in-game to help you out. Even when you can't, for the fellowship quests you just have to gain a few more levels and it's definitely within reach. Of the nine classes I've played (all but the Lore-master) they're all unique and fun to play. The Hunter in particular is a good beginning class, since it has a wide range of ranged and melee skills, and the quick travel skills are lifesavers. I'm only at level 70 on my main character, and that's exactly the sort of pace this game requires: nice and easy. It's a game that really draws you in, and even when I'm not actually doing a quest or deed or other objective, I still love just going around and exploring the Middle-earth Turbine has created for their game. I cannot stress the beauty of the game enough. Each and every area is unique and beautiful. From the rural hills of The Shire, to the torch lit caverns of Moria, each new vista amazes. I can't wait to see where my adventures will take me next!\nOverall, not only is this a great MMO, it's just a great all-around game, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in the world of Middle-earth.","May 9, 2015","true","245.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then, after they released the update for Helm's Deep, they abandoned the whole skill tree, and re-did everything.  I felt overwhelmed...I had carefully planned my character's development over LITERALLY THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay.  Yes, I know that there's something wrong with that.  In my defense, between bouts of grinding, there was something terribly soothing about standing above the valley of Rivendell.  But how could I start over?  Without the skills and perks configured, MOBs of my own level would likely waste me.  Yet if I mis-spent them, I'd be stuck with a fouled-up configuration, unless I paid to re-spec.  So it sits in the queue, unused.  I thought Minas Tirith was available now...I had so longed to make my way to the White City.  But even that appears to dangle out of reach.  (thanks Dr. Wumbo for correction)  Perhaps someday I shall yet return...some day...ah.\n\nIf you enjoyed the books, and have a LOT of extra time on your hands, and sometimes find yourself wishing to spend some time in Tolkien's world, you could hardly do worse than to spend some time with this game.  I bought it long before it was free-to-play, and it was worth it.  (Shoot, I'd have bought the lifetime sub back when it was available if I had known how much I'd like it.)  And if you're starting now, you needn't face my conundrum...unless Turbine does it AGAIN, in which case it may be time to craft a new legendary weapon.","June 5, 2015","true","055.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Thousands of hours more than Steam will show. It has been a long running favorite with huge amounts of space to explore and a skirmish system that other MMOs need to pay attention to.\n\nThe downside is the game is starting to show its age a bit more than WoW does. The art in the game manages to land square in the uncanny valley and the player animation is sloppy. Anyone with a speed buff comically trots in place when starting or stopping. No ability to unsheath weapons, and everyone in your party will be synchronized when entering or exting combat. These things are minor, but jarring. Hunter's port system has become a chore, and travel from point to point to point is now confusing and tedious. Travel needs to be revamped to just a drop down of where you want to go at this point. Also, a lot of this game is simply NIH going extra lengths to not be WoW even when WoW-like was the right thing to do.\n\nThe upside is the game continuously expands and improves. New gameplay mechanics, often new innovations, are introduced with each year. The lore is immersive (as it should be), and elaboration happens with consent and approval from the Tolkien estate. The cosmetic outfit system is an example of a place where WoW (and every other MMO) specifically needs to take notice. Content is often truely difficult rather than outright unfair, even when playing retro-content several levels under you.\n\nWarsteeds were a fizzle addition to the game, largely because they amplified the slop in the controls by an intentionally sloppy and unweidly system. PvMP (because WoW calls it PvP) is amazing, but often unbalanced as stats start in favor of monsters and end in favor of Hobbits by the end of an xpac cycle. Legendary weapons are not cosmetically customizable and obsoleted every xpac. This flys in the face of the intent of the original intent of the system, and is a very tedious grind. The legendary system is also confusing and dependant on huge amounts of randomness. Keep these as your forwarning as they will be the biggest sore points.\n\nDespite the complaints here, I still love this game. I still recommend this game. I hope that they will approach fixing the sloppy controls and simplify the legendary system as these are the only things causing me to drift towards other games.","October 5, 2014","true","70.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The community is very friendly, and this is especially important when you have the ability to create and join Fellowships and Kinships. The combat is simple enough to understand easily, yet advanced enough to not get boring after playing for as long as I have. The landscape of the many lands you can visit is very well made, with amazing mountains, valleys, and of course, plenty of enemy buildings to raid. The enemies are fun to fight, especially if you find a randomly generated boss wandering the wilderness. This game also has great economy, with ways to earn large volumes of money at low and high level areas.

This MMO is directly linked with the books and only a few popular movie scenes are seen in the game. Beautiful and breath-taking views, tearrain, story, quests, gameplay and more. It's certainly a game which they spent a lot of time making. Playing this game is a lot of fun and very addicting. Many people play this game despite the fact that Steam is just rerouting players to the official LotRO launcher. However, I enjoy this game and I've been playing it for over three years now. Multiple toons, high levels, gone through all instances/raids/big battles, et cetera. The game will never end, and your toon will never be finished. It will always be better, though. This game is a bunch of fun to play with friends as well, so I highly recommend you invite some friends to join you up.","June 14, 2013","true","211.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really looking forward to the Riders of Rohan expansion that will be released in September -- mounted combat, combat mounts you can advance, and lots of new turf to explore!

It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe.\n\nOverall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!","March 20, 2014","true","240.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

O'Neill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonathanJOneill/","378 products in account","One of the few MMO titles I've played for more than six months. If you are a fan of Tolkien's universe, LotRO is a wonderful adaption of it. Rather than having you be a part of the fellowship, or actively assisting the ringbearer at all times, Turbine has devised a story that follows the events of the book by foiling the plans of Sauron, Sarumon and others who do not have the interest of the free peoples of Middle-earth in mind.\n\nStart in Ered Luin (home of the Elves and Dwarves), The Bree-lands (home of the race of Man) or The Shire (home of the Hobbits), and make your way through one of the largest game worlds created. Travel through Evendim (it's landmark being Annuminas and Lake Evendim itself), Forochel (home of the Lossoth, a tribe living on the frigid tundra), The North Downs (where the Rangers have made base to keep guard over The Shire), The Lone Lands (it's landmark being Weathertop), The Trollshaws (it's landmark being Imladris, the city of Elves), The Misty Mountains (it's landmark being Goblin-town), Eregion (which leads you to the black pool and gates of Moria), down into the Enedwaith and on into Dunland (it's landmark being the Tower of Orthanc).\n\nShould you journey east from Eregion, you then enter the vastness of Moria on into Lothlorien, where you can journey further east into Mirkwood or south down the Great River to the Wildermores and Eastern Rohan, a massive region comprised of four areas; The Wold, The Entwash Vale, The Norcrofts and The Sutcrofts. From there, you will travel into Western Rohan, on to Edoras and on to Helm's Deep.\n\nLotRO is also the epitome of Free To Play. While a player does not have immediate access to everything the game has to offer, one can purchase nearly everything with Turbine Points, a currency you can purchase with  real cash or earn by playing the game and completing deeds. If you're not willing to spend money, you can spend time to get the newest stuff, from cosmetics to mounts to expansion packs.\n\nStorywise, as of this writing, LotRO has just reached The Battle of Helm's Deep with it's new expansion (released Nov. 20, 2013), aptly titled "Helm's Deep".","November 25, 2013","true","175.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(The Quest Log section may be updated, so you may want to check back at some point if you're interested, which I expect you aren't).\n\nPLOT:\n\nJudging by the intro and the dream sequence at level 5, your character (my first one being the Hobbit Burgular, Mimbulius) is the chosen one (or something like that) whose destiny is tied to the fate of Middle-Earth! The story is set out in quests that vary depending on which character you are (my friend was a dwarf and met Gandalf and Thorin and all the other dwarves from The Hobbit while I was just helping out around this little village that got attacked for five minutes).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nOpen World, quest-based gameplay. It is very much like World of Warcraft, but it's still a good MMO.\n\nQUEST LOG:\n\nDay 1: My friend and I set out from Erebor on the free horses they give you for 24 hours after completing the intro, and we decided that we were going to go from Erebor to Mordor, stopping at certain locations to look around. We rode to Hobbiton, where we found Bag End and looked around, then we headed off into the Bree-Lands to find The Inn of the Prancing Pony. My friend thought he could take on a bear, and it chased us all the way into Bree. At the Pony, I got my haircut and got drunk, while my friend sold all his junk items to Barliman Butterbur. We then set off for Weathertop, as my friend did not want to stay the night in Bree as to be safe. Weathertop is in the Lone Lands, what we now know to be as quite a dangerous place for two Level Sixes to be riding through at night. My friend was lucky and actually managed to make it onto the ruins, but I, however, was attacked by some freaking ravens! Meanwhile, my friend wasn't having the best time up on the hill, and he managed to use some magical item or something to teleport back to Erebor. It was just me now, so I rode on, past Weathertop, to try and go through the Trollshaws to Rivendell...I was killed two minutes later, and used my instant respawn, only to be killed again about twenty seconds after. I then respawned at a safe place (the entrance to the Lone Lands) as day began. My ride through the Lone Lands was fine, and nothing attacked me at all. If only my friend had actually listened when I suggested waiting in Bree until morning. I entered the Trollshaws, and the game warned me that this area was Level 30, but I was determined. I rode through the Trollshaws, with monsters chasing me. I reached the river that seperates the Trollshaws from Rivendell, and rode on. I could not see a path to Rivendell, so I rode up a hill to get a better view. At this point, I stopped, and, as I checked the map, the monsters caught up with me and attacked me. I moved away from the monsters, and they chased me. I moved back again, forgetting a crucial detail - I was on the edge of a hill. I fell 200ft, still riding my horse, and died as my body smashed into the same river I had believed to be the end of my worries. I had to use a 'Safe Respawn' that took me to the middle of a place called Archet, on the borders of Bree. I left to go and play Town of Salem instead.","March 2","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So in fact if you want you could play this game completely for free but it just takes longer.\n\nI personaly realy like the game because of the realy big world and the manny possibilities you have withing the game.\nfirst off when starting you have 5 differend races to choose of and within those races manny differend classes (some don't work with some races). a few you have to buy with TP.\nthere are 4 differend starting stories that help you to get to know the game.\none of the big things on the side is crafting. you can make annything. in the differend areas are differend recourses.\n\nthe grafics are not top notch but for such a huge game it is fantastic and if you have all the grafic setings maxed out you can find some realy nice vieuws.\nThe social aspect of the game is realy important for manny quests are hard to impossible to complete on your own.\nthanks to the fellowships this can be done. And a mayor part of the time you will find yourself playing in a kinship.

What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)","March 4","true","448.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(The Quest Log section may be updated, so you may want to check back at some point if you're interested, which I expect you aren't).\n\nPLOT:\n\nJudging by the intro and the dream sequence at level 5, your character (my first one being the Hobbit Burgular, Mimbulius) is the chosen one (or something like that) whose destiny is tied to the fate of Middle-Earth! The story is set out in quests that vary depending on which character you are (my friend was a dwarf and met Gandalf and Thorin and all the other dwarves from The Hobbit while I was just helping out around this little village that got attacked for five minutes).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nOpen World, quest-based gameplay. It is very much like World of Warcraft, but it's still a good MMO.\n\nQUEST LOG:\n\nDay 1: My friend and I set out from Erebor on the free horses they give you for 24 hours after completing the intro, and we decided that we were going to go from Erebor to Mordor, stopping at certain locations to look around. We rode to Hobbiton, where we found Bag End and looked around, then we headed off into the Bree-Lands to find The Inn of the Prancing Pony. My friend thought he could take on a bear, and it chased us all the way into Bree. At the Pony, I got my haircut and got drunk, while my friend sold all his junk items to Barliman Butterbur. We then set off for Weathertop, as my friend did not want to stay the night in Bree as to be safe. Weathertop is in the Lone Lands, what we now know to be as quite a dangerous place for two Level Sixes to be riding through at night. My friend was lucky and actually managed to make it onto the ruins, but I, however, was attacked by some freaking ravens! Meanwhile, my friend wasn't having the best time up on the hill, and he managed to use some magical item or something to teleport back to Erebor. It was just me now, so I rode on, past Weathertop, to try and go through the Trollshaws to Rivendell...I was killed two minutes later, and used my instant respawn, only to be killed again about twenty seconds after. I then respawned at a safe place (the entrance to the Lone Lands) as day began. My ride through the Lone Lands was fine, and nothing attacked me at all. If only my friend had actually listened when I suggested waiting in Bree until morning. I entered the Trollshaws, and the game warned me that this area was Level 30, but I was determined. I rode through the Trollshaws, with monsters chasing me. I reached the river that seperates the Trollshaws from Rivendell, and rode on. I could not see a path to Rivendell, so I rode up a hill to get a better view. At this point, I stopped, and, as I checked the map, the monsters caught up with me and attacked me. I moved away from the monsters, and they chased me. I moved back again, forgetting a crucial detail - I was on the edge of a hill. I fell 200ft, still riding my horse, and died as my body smashed into the same river I had believed to be the end of my worries. I had to use a 'Safe Respawn' that took me to the middle of a place called Archet, on the borders of Bree. I left to go and play Town of Salem instead.","March 2","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe.\n\nOverall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!","March 20, 2014","true","240.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are a fan of Tolkien's universe, LotRO is a wonderful adaption of it. Rather than having you be a part of the fellowship, or actively assisting the ringbearer at all times, Turbine has devised a story that follows the events of the book by foiling the plans of Sauron, Sarumon and others who do not have the interest of the free peoples of Middle-earth in mind.\n\nStart in Ered Luin (home of the Elves and Dwarves), The Bree-lands (home of the race of Man) or The Shire (home of the Hobbits), and make your way through one of the largest game worlds created. Travel through Evendim (it's landmark being Annuminas and Lake Evendim itself), Forochel (home of the Lossoth, a tribe living on the frigid tundra), The North Downs (where the Rangers have made base to keep guard over The Shire), The Lone Lands (it's landmark being Weathertop), The Trollshaws (it's landmark being Imladris, the city of Elves), The Misty Mountains (it's landmark being Goblin-town), Eregion (which leads you to the black pool and gates of Moria), down into the Enedwaith and on into Dunland (it's landmark being the Tower of Orthanc).\n\nShould you journey east from Eregion, you then enter the vastness of Moria on into Lothlorien, where you can journey further east into Mirkwood or south down the Great River to the Wildermores and Eastern Rohan, a massive region comprised of four areas; The Wold, The Entwash Vale, The Norcrofts and The Sutcrofts. From there, you will travel into Western Rohan, on to Edoras and on to Helm's Deep.\n\nLotRO is also the epitome of Free To Play.

What I love most about the game are the story and the immersion you feel when you're playing. You really feel like you're a part of the Middle Earth World, which to me means a lot (I'm obssessed with Lord of the Rings). The regions are varied enough that you feel like every place is different. Also, each class has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the other classes; most people have multiple characters on multiple servors because they want to capitalize on all the different class options and play styles.\n\nThe main problems I have with LOTRO are that the combat is getting clunky, certain classes are way overpowered compared to others, and the questing in certain regions is getting a bit monotonous. The combat is generally the same the whole game, so it's important that you pick the class that goes with what you want in the game. It can just be very repetitive at times. Likewise, certain classes are way stronger than other classes. My hunter is so frail at level 89 compared to most other classes. So frail that it becomes difficult to get through basic solo quests. Finally, the quest are around the same thing over and over again. I know there can only be a finite number of quest ideas, but I would appreciate more diversity in questing.\n\nOverall, I find myself coming back to this game every couple of months, getting bored, and then coming back again in a cycle. I've done this for four years now, and I expect to d othe same for at least a couple more years. 8.5/10","June 5","true","95.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed anything The Lord of the Rings is, you should play this game.

A good one for me personally. But undeniable a bit of a joke.\n- Not as populated as back in the days, if you play this kind of games with people there are 2 main servers you can join on LotRO for alot of action... (Brandywine for the US & Snowbourn for the EU) The rest are pretty near empty, even compared to other games' "low populated" servers.\n\nOverall score I would say a 9/10, but this game has alot of emotional worth to me.

You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game.\nAnother clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use "Turbine Points". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world.\nThere is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.\nIn short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.\n\nPRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.","March 4, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Fortunantly, you can earn currency for the store through certain accomplishments inside the game. This secondary means of gaining store currency is an outstanding feature that is rather elegant compared to other models seen in other free to play titles.\n\nTo unlock everything you must either grind out ingame (recommended) or purchase the currency, the game actually providing a choice for a completely free to play experience.\n\nDo note that this game has a habit of deleting characters of extremely low activity, so don't expect a character to last longer than 2 months without some sort of activity.","January 29, 2015","true","72.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you enjoyed anything The Lord of the Rings is, you should play this game. It has its flaws, like any game, but overall a great experience!!\n\nGood things:\n- Immense world\n- Fine graphics for a MMO\n- Less pay2play than most free2play MMO's around\n- Very great community\n- Legendary Weapons (for me they are the most great expression of gear in a MMO)\n\nBad things:\n- PvP system is kind of a joke... A good one for me personally. But undeniable a bit of a joke.\n- Not as populated as back in the days, if you play this kind of games with people there are 2 main servers you can join on LotRO for alot of action... (Brandywine for the US & Snowbourn for the EU) The rest are pretty near empty, even compared to other games' "low populated" servers.\n\nOverall score I would say a 9/10, but this game has alot of emotional worth to me. Most people would rate lower.","February 25, 2015","true","591.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game.\nAnother clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use "Turbine Points". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world.\nThere is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.\nIn short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.\n\nPRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.","March 4, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Nice game to play with your friends with great combat, beautiful graphics and a lengthy list of quests to complete. One problem I found is that if your game is a tad buggy for whatever reason. Do NOT verify the files with Steam, the client will redownload the game. If anything needs to be updated, Turbine will release it, not Steam. Steam is just the portal to LOTRO. Otherwise, it's a good game all round.

WoW players out there might be interested in this game. In my opinion, this game brings Tolkien's books to life. You can actually travel around Middle-earth and fight different creatures, like orcs, wargs, Uruk-hais and a lot more. You can also invite people to form a fellowship and then do skirmishes together, which can be epic! This game is playable without paying money, as you can complete deeds to earn turbine points to purchase things in the lotro store, like expansions etc. Graphics are not the best, but the landscapes are still very beautiful, say Evendim :) I played like a month ago and absolutely fell in love with it, its free, so why not try it? :)","December 23, 2013","true","558.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it installed for a very, very long time until Steam came over to Russia. Now I had my chance to play and form my opinion.\nI really liked the graphics - much better than I expected. The mapping of the world is nicely done, lots of great and beautiful locations, and an interesting storyline too. At first, that is. Unfortunately, it all gets rather dull as you have to perform tons of similar quests to get that XP and get stuff without paying money for it. Because, truth be told, all this game does (like any "free" online game) is try and squeeze money out of you. You can play without it, but it's much more difficult and in the end it gets plain boring because you can't level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest, so you're stuck will all the small quests all over the place. It also takes you plenty of time to go places, from location to location, from quest to quest. There are lots of servers, and I played on Landroval which has plenty of players. However, it's still difficult to find people for team quests as they're so busy running around with their own quests. In the end it gets rather annoying when you just need to find one item and you're killed right in the tomb's hallway or something. The thing I loved were the holidays, all the challenges were fun and rewards worthy. And the good spirit of competition, too!\nAll in all, I would recommend this game, though it's individual whether you keep playing or get bored at some point. I know I'm not the most patient person - with Lineage II I quit at lvl 69, and here the maximum is a 100... I surely do have better things to do with my life;)))","October 31, 2015","true","293.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But I don't play this game vary often. It is a good standard MMO based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy world that brings old Celtic and Norse Mythology into today's lores. The game is much bigger since I started playing it sometimes, and there can be much to do in this game. Play the main story, practice your toon or character's crafting skill, go fishing, chat with other players in the game about whatever if they're willing and in the mood, or just roam around this mini version of Middle Earth like a Hobbit without a hill or a Dwarf without a Mountain.\n\nTo put the rest in short, the community is good depending on server, the gameplay is good, and it does have a serious pvp community even though this has lost some participation compared to a few years ago. The only drawback to this game is the ftp option feels more like a free sample than free to play. It's allot like Star Wars the Old Republic with micro buying. So its still technically pay to play like WoW, but one can still have fun with the ftp option. It's just not as generous as Star Trek Online or Rift.\n\nSo yes I would recommend this game to nearly anyone.","November 14, 2015","true","79.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noretus/recommended/212500/","noretus","noretus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noretus/","191 products in account","TL;DR version: A solid game, very entertaining for slow and casual playing where you enjoy the leveling and don't even bother to think about "the end-game". Consider this Skyrim, except it's Tolkien, and you might occasionally run into other people.\n\nRP ( on Laurelin ) is good if you find the right people and places.\n\nPVP ( or Monster Play ) can vary on servers but mostly it's rather dead. Don't expect PVP to be at all balanced as it has almost no focus in the game.\n\nEnd-game: There are raids and bosses but as I said, don't bother thinking about them. Just focus on enjoying the leveling progress - it won't be fast, and the end-game isn't grand enough to be worth rushing your way there.\n\nRambly version:\nFirst the most important thing: you should really consider this more of a Free to Try game, rather than Free to Play.  It's true that you earn Turbine Points ( = money )  within the game ( quite a lot too, and easily if you don't mind grinding ) but subscribing is still vastly better if you actually want to play the game without significant limitations ( all of which you can remove with Turbine Points though ). Honestly, you shouldn't think of this as a huge drawback - F2P ( P2W ) games are still a rather new thing and the common model for MMOs has for a long time been to require a subscription. LoTRO wasn't initially free either.\n\nThat aside, I wouldn't recommend this game to the usual ADHD MMO button smasher kiddie ( for one thing the combat system is queued ). While it has been eased up from what it was, there is still significant grinding involved in the game. Pure, "Kill 300 Wolves for X" grinds, straight up. These are called Deeds and you earn stat boosts ( and Turbine Points, titles and other things ) by completing them, but for the gameplay purposes, the stat boosts ( Traits ) are most important. However, if you are the type of person who just loves to put on some music, audiobook or even just watch TV while sloooowly advancing your character, this game will be awesome for you.\n\nGameplay is alright, but I admit it's not the greatest out there. Movement is pretty fluid, though some of the animations are a bit stiff. Skills and such don't feel very streamlined ( I feel there's a lot of redundancy - skills are there just so that you have many buttons to press ) and the combat queue is a bit clumsy. It's unique, I give it that but on certain classes I've found it very annoying. Still, it is as planned and the combat is relatively slow as a result. There are also some minor UI annoyances here and there that take getting used to ( stack splitting, cannot vendor items straight from inventory - need to use vendor ui, have to drag and drop a lot ). On the plus side, you can rearrange your UI exactly as you please and also get some nifty 3rd party skins if you're into that ( there are few other plugins as well ).\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated but unless you're used to always only playing newest and shiniest games, it shouldn't bother you overly much. However the overall atmosphere with the music and scenery is amazing, especially if you are a Tolkien fan. Even if you aren't in to RP, I expect one would appreciate the first time they see the valley of Rivendell open up to them, or watching the sunrise in the Shire, not to mention many of the other iconic places mentioned in the books, or seen in the movies.\n\nThis is a very fun game for those who enjoy Tolkien's world, casual but very grindy PVE, casual to no PVP and any amount of RP. For social people, the community is generally friendly and you shouldn't have trouble finding a Kin ( guild ) that suits your tastes. For lone-wolves, there is plenty of solo content and for the most part you don't really need a group either.","June 30, 2014","true","388.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The only reason that people from Steam say that is because Steam only shows people who are playing Lotro through Steam, but this amazing game was available, still is available to download through their website. This game has a flourishing community, many helpful people that would happily start playing with you, but only if YOU give this game a chance.\n\nIn this next section, I will review what I think are the Pro's and Con's of this game.\n\nPro's:\n~Many friendly people who absolutely love to play together, just waiting for you.\n~Flourishing community to answer all your questions and comments.\n~Fun and engaging content to keep you hooked for hours.\n~Simple crafting to gear your leveling character.\n~Many different classes to choose from to fit your playstyle.\n~Dungeons just waiting for you and your friends to plunder them.\n~The best gear in the game is crafted by players, not bought from a cash shop.\n\nCon's:\n~Many servers have a decline in population. (To move to Brandywine.)\n~Over-Simplified crafting.\n~Lag spikes in highly populated area's (As expected.)\n~Longer-than-usual server downtimes for simple repairs and maintenence.\n~Many things are still bought from the cash shop. (Personal Con.)\n~No real end-game (Yet, but plenty of gearing and skill tweaking to do.)\n\nYou may notice that I have crafting in both Pro's and Con's, mainly because in the last massive update they (Turbine) made crafting super easy, but still fun for the leveling character.\n\nIf you have read the review and agree, or disagree with what I have said about this magnificent game, go ahead and send a friend request and we can talk it over.\n\n~If you're a new player, or a returning player who found my review helpful, you can find me on the Brandywine server, or even better, just send a friend request here. :D Always happy to help and chat. :3\n","June 30, 2014","true","876.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RTMPro/recommended/212500/","RTMPro","(NZADR) RTMPro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RTMPro/","128 products in account","I strongly recommend this game for any classic MMORPG & LOTR fan.\n\nLOTRO has an immense amount of side story & lore vs. the traditional movies.\n\nAlthough this game is quite old now, the graphics are still considerably good.  DX11, DX10, DX9 settings allow backwards compatibility with older machines & laptops.  Choose to download HD textures, or not.  Choose to play at 1080p, or not.  It's your world for the taking!\n\nFor a free to play game, you start off with everything you need.  A decent amount of character creation selection, a decent amount of storage space, access to all beginning area quests, as well as access to two more area quest packs.  Once you're in your LvL 20's is when you will need to purchase quest packs.\n\nTo purchase quest packs, you have four choices:\n1) Go VIP & get access to them as part of VIP.\n2) Purchase packs from the LOTRO store/Steam directly.\n2) Use real money to buy in-game premium currency to purchase them.\n3) Create a grind character to grind TP (Turbine Points) to purchase them.\n\nYou will earn in-game premium currency (Turbine Points) just by playing the game.  Completion of certain quests, or deeds, will grant a set amount.  Deeds are "passive" quests.  Example, kill 100 wolves would be a deed.  Use a certain skill a certain number of times is a deed.  I was able to grind 150TP in just over 1 1/2hrs.  One hint, it involves creating a second character, Elvish, and doing certain quests & deeds.\n\nIf you're a crafter, this game has a very in-depth crafting system.  It is also simple to wrap your head around.  An added bonus, certain crafted items allow you to name them.  Every item you craft, the characters name who crafted it will be in the item description.\n\nIf you just like a quick jump into battle then log off, there is a feature called Skirmish.  This is a closed mission/dungeon where you can take other players with you, or go it solo.  Either way, you can just hack n slash.  Skirmishes are unlocked around lvl20.  Although you don't get drops off of the foes, you do earn Skirmish Marks.  These are spent in Skirmish Camps.  You can purchase armor, weapons, rare crafting materials, cosmetic attire, etc.\n\nHere is a video, from 4 months ago, that I recorded when doing a solo Skirmish:\nhttp://youtu.be/e7utB69IXLs\n\nIf you like to play in a group with other people, there are two types.\n1) A Fellowship.\n2) A Kinship\n\nA fellowship is your standard everyday party/group.  You're just out to do a quick quest.  A standard fellowship has a maximum of 6.  A raid fellowship has 12.\n\nRaids can be extremely difficult, or, extremely easy.  You will find, as usual, most PUGs (pick-up groups), will fail unless they have a much higher level player, or a very experienced veteran player, leading the way.  Raids are also only ever done at end-game.  Unless you're in a kinship.  Many hours can be wasted during a raid with nothing in return other than a very costly repair bill.\n\nA kinship is your standard everyday guild/clan.  These are the groups of people you prefer to do raids, quests, events, etc. with.  Kinships also gain levels based on time.  A kinship can reach a max level of 10, with a max number of members at 1,000.  Every character you create can be in a different kinship.  A kinship can also have a Kinship Home.  Similar to a guild hall.  This comes at a fairly steep cost at lower levels.  A kinship is only allowed 1 home.  The kinship leader decides on access rules, though all kinship members generally have full access.\n\nEvery LOTRO account is allowed to have 1 home for their characters.  You can purchase, & find treasure, cosmetic gear to spruce up your place & make it look just how you want it.  You can also purchase additional storage chests to keep extra special items.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is FREE!  Download it & try it!\n\nIf you like casual, but still exciting, playing at your own pace, or even just only crafting and never doing anything else, this game is for you!\n\n\n\n\nP.S.\nAlthough it says I've played less than 100 hours, I never really had a need to use Steam.  I only ever played LOTRO & nothing else.  Played it straight for nearly 4 years & also Beta tested it.  I've seen this game change so many numerous times, but I still hear it's call in my dreams...trying to drag me back...back to a neverending world of lore.","August 10, 2015","true","73.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Despite its age (6 years and thriving), it still looks good and has been for a while. But the strength of LOTRO, and what has kept it attractive for so long, is that it's one of the rare remaining MMO that still has a soul.\n\nLargely oriented PvE, with more quest and story content that you can play through with one or even two characters, it is focused on story and characters, and dedicated to the fans of the Lord of the Rings universe, which it reproduces very well.\n\nRaids and PvP exist and are nice, but they're probably slightly sub-par comparing to more recent MMOs. We've already stated that the PvE and story content, as well as the way the universe is depicted, are probably at the top of the crop. The last thing I want to mention is the community: after playing the vast majority of MMOs that are out there, I can definitely say that the LOTRO players are the most friendly, helpful and welcoming community I've ever encountered in over 10 years of MMOs.\n\nI hope this review helps everyone picture the game well. I am very happy to see it thrive so much after 6 years of operation, growing in content and in quality with each expansion. If you like the Lord of the Rings universe and quest content in MMOs, surely give it a try !","November 25, 2013","true","66.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It has beautiful scenery and feels vast and coherent. It is tantalizing to explore areas, places, towns and villages you have read in the books, and seen in the films. Once in a while you encounter the famous characters from the stories of Lord of the Rings which is ongoing behind the scenes. For a lore player this is a dream since there is always so much to delve deeper into if you wish.\n\nThe only downside to the feel of the game are the player characters. They have an outdated or even unnatural feel to them, which is contrary to the rest of the world (which has a fantastic natural feel).\n\nThe epic quest line is a joy, and I recommend that you take your time and follow the actually story in those quests.","January 7, 2015","true","614.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As an avid LOTR fan, I love the game, but to me, it's lagging behind all the other games. This game, in short, has a very small community; you can't even find a dungeon unless you wait a half hour or more. I do, however, like the story aspect to it, as it follows the storyline as the books tell it and not how the movies tell it. It does not have all the features as the leading MMORPGs do, but it could definitely be a competitor if there was more time and effort put into advertising the game. Even if it doesn't have a ton of features compared to other MMORPGs, it is free to play, with the option of paying for expansions in-game. The free-to-play aspect is rarely seen in today's gaming world, but it is also very restricted. This game has a great potential and there is an immense amount of people who love the LOTR franchise as well as the related Hobbit franchise.\n\nLike I said earlier, this game is very addicting and has potential, but I'm not going to recommend it. My recommendation for if you want to find a good MMORPG is to look somewhere else. Yes, I'm going to say it; look towards World of Warcraft. It is much more addicting and has a much bigger community base than LOTRO. Also, Elder Scrolls Online has just been released for the PC and will soon be released for the PS4 and Xbox One. ESO has a lot of potential and should definitely be considered.\n\nYour opinion on LOTRO may be different from mine, so download it for FREE and give it a try.","May 2, 2014","false","60.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game hasn't aged at all it still looks pretty for those hard core graphic fans and is still being updated to this very day. It has an pretty basic combat system but very hard to master the skills and which skills to use first and etc, just because of the skills I dont even use my mouse, I have to put both of my hands on the keyboard.The game hasn't died yet and I think its not going too with people still starting this game, most servers are pretty active and most of the community is mature but the only stupid things I saw on world chat is dont say sh** or f*** ye my kids play this. Like I can barely understand how to play this game and how are kids going to play this, but there are kids who lose their child hood pretty quick. Don't worry about in game money which is turbine u earn most of it by just playing the game and skaying everything. Crafting is key in this game and you'll need a couple of friends to craft what u need or multiple toons because crafting is the only why u get good sh**. It's full of quest and so much dialogue but not much talking maybe some lines ,because if u thing about it it would cost a fortune to get so many voice actors. But don't worry the cut scenes for story have sexy voice acting;). Also trust me when it says massive u'll be running ur ♥♥♥ up and down but it is all worth it in the long run. This is my first MMORPG that had a very good first impression  so I'll give it an 9/10 because they didn't f*** it up yet.\n\nWhy are u stilI reading its free go ahead and already get it.","April 7","true","63.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's got this great sense of you doing something meaningful cause it's not all blown up into you being the one person who'll save Middle-Earth (cause let's just be clear, the original storyline is still vaguely in the game, you occasionally meet members of the fellowship)\nBut 2 things really bother me in this game : although it stands proud despite the test of time, the graphics and dialog system show it isn't as modern as it used to be. (On dialog : whenever you talk to someone, a huge window appears, and your only options are accept or decline. Often even only accept or close the window)\n\nOne other thing : the "cool stuff is for higher levels" mentality. I have a terrible problem where I rerun the early levels content 250 times because my character doesn't turn out exactly the way I want it to, and that mentality makes those early levels kinda boring. Once you get there, it's really worth it though.\n\nLast thing : the social pannel for searching a party needs some reworks/hype cause I usually end up having played for over 5 hours while searching for others to do a skirmish with (which is a small instance) and no having found anyone.\n\nBesides all of that, I absolutely love this game, it's my all-time favorite.","July 6, 2015","true","98.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you get this logic right; you can discover a whole world of possibilities through video games. Someone could just decide to create a "goat Simulator" for fun (and you would pretend to be a goat), or create a Massive Multiplayer Game where everybody interacts with each other to accomplish goals in the game.\n\nThere is a myriad of games out there today and some will tickle you to play, based on your interests of course.\n\nAbout Lord of the Rings Online :\n\n1st. Interests:\nYes I am interested in the Lord of the Rings lore. I like the Medieval style, the powerful evil, the hobbits, the elves, the faith, the glory, the flowers, name it. I read the complete story years ago, way before the movies. Am I a complete sold out and corrupt Lord of the rings fan ?  Nope, not at all. I just like the writing style and the human-side, possibly believable logic-reality-fantasy, story of it all.\n\n2nd. The Genre:\nMMO. I am not a MMO FAN, in fact, I hate MMO's. They are a repeatable-similar-cut-and-paste infinite same thing said differently, lather repeat. This type of game is kinda of free-roaming-reading do the same thing. The story is vaguely known, the sense of it is tasteless.  Just roam, talk to someone and pretend it is fun. Now that's my point. (Lord of the GATHErings I called it back in my debut)\n\n3rd. Entertainment:\nIs Lotro entertaining? Well... I must say that something was entertaining, and still is... after playing this type of game for so long now... and still playing it !\nWhat happened to my anti-MMO player side ?  It got impressed !!\n\nThe cutscenes were a nice feature that propels you directly into the current conflict (linked to the departure of the fellowship...and following right down in their footsteps is totally great. The feeling of being part of the LOTRO world was achieved greatly with all those characters and storyline. The sense of my character being known to this fake-world was cool.  There is also an outrageous number of QUESTS ! From main quests, side quests, skill quests, deeds quests, trait quests to crafting quests, I am probably forgeting some.. there is so much.\n\nYes, the graphics are now outdated even with full DirectX11. But it doesn’t get you out of the story that much. If you like the Lore, you will probably find it cartoony acceptable.\n\nWhat was the most entertaining to me, was the fact that I can take out the time I want in the LOTRO world to do whatever I wish. Roleplay with some stangers, do quests, craft, manage my house and garden decorations, look up the price of some useless item that some people desire. (Of course, in other MMO's you can also lose your time the way you want) But the most appreciable assets in those moments; The sounds !\nEverytime I hooked up my headphones.. I was submerged in the wild environment, the ambiance and the tension felt everywhere in the wilderness.\nLOTRO convinced me where no other MMO could. The sound ! Especially in Moria... this is where it all began down the hill for me... I became a LOTRO FAN :) in Moria.\nBefore that, It was Lord of the Gatherings !\nI hopped in from time to time with a friend or two... running beside them and trying to follow up their leveling. Which was a pain ! Since they were so much into it and were leveling Fast in VIP mode.\n\nOK Now we get to VIP and the Free to Play thing.\nYES, before... believe it or not. IT was not FREE. You had to pay the game, and subscribe for the experience. I was not playing at that time.\nIt then became f2p. Which is a matter of attracting new players to try the game and hopefully, make them pay to achieve their pleasure.\n\nIt is FREE totally up to lvl 20... then you get the point, that if you want to continue and level up... or have some fun in this world, you will have to grind a lot of time to achieve some goals and earn some turbine points (In game store currency) to buy some useful needed quests pack or stuff. Yup, it’s a business world, where programmers need to eat, and infrastructure guys needs funds to host the game on Technical Horsepower, If you want a free computer, free energy, free internet, free games... well... Then you better get out and change this world to accept FREE as a currency.\nIn the meantime, you won’t have any time left to play your favorite game, you will probably be outside growing your food and waiting the harvest to exchange some for... lets say... a computer! :)\n\nIs this game entertaining? YES, to me it is! And it is well worth some money. I bought some Turbine points with real money when there was a double bonus points event... and then waited for the 30-50% rebate on quests pack that comes along once or twice a year... It was well worth the ride. (More than VIP)\n\n4th factor: Replayability:\nYes you can replay over and over again. Let’s say with another character.  There is so much quests... that you can probably live a lot of adventures in a completely different manner.\nThe rest will be similar, in traits, deeds, skills and all with a slight new flavor. It's the same Game.\n\n5th factor. Price over time spent:\nIf you pay 60$ per year for the new call of duty and you only play the campaign like me... well it is a shame. The game is much more satisfying online versus people. You can frag for a full year ! 60$ for 300 hours of game play.\nBut for me... Since 3d Shooters is not my Main Genre, I play the campaign for 15 hours, do some LAN party with friends... and then put it on the shelf. 60$ for 40 hours ! Not the most satisfying purchase.\nIn LOTRO, I spent about 70$ and got... if one level is 3-4 hours roughly...  320 hours since 2010 and I am not done at all with my purchases !  (Played with independent Client)\nIt is well worth the run.\n\nIf you are a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, you will probably like it even more. Besides that, it is well balanced in simplicity and complexity and its pace follows comfortably your period of learning the game.\nIt's a MMO, you may be charmed by the genre or you may hate it. But from an adventurous point of view, even with my hate of MMO, I still have fun in this game.\n\nConclusion, LOTRO is good, and for myself, my adventures continue mainly because of the subject world; Lord of the Rings, and its outstanding engineering sounds that keeps me coming back into the woods.","November 3, 2014","true","63.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

For example you have to kill 50 beasts of one specie to get a Turbine Point. And with a couple of Turbine Points you can buy inventory slots, or a mount. But it takes so long it doesnt feel rewarding.\nOr you can pay obviously, but the Turbine Points are overprices imho.\n\nAlso in a later stage of the game you can't do certain quest because they are locked, and you have to open them by paying, otherwise you can't advance in level.

While it's free to play, the free content is straight up limited, and the paid content is all over the place. It's practically a demo, giving you some extremely boring areas to explore and quest in, and teasing you with the paid content.\n\nThis would be all well and good, but the paid content is also lackluster. To get the full experience, you have to both subscribe, and deal with a metric tonne of microtransactions. And if that's not all, the gameplay somehow manages to be more boring than World of Warcraft's.","April 5, 2014","false","8.0"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

F2P model turned the game into nothing more than endless cosmetic item fest and since the launch of F2P, there hasn't been any good expansion packs either. More and more quest lines are being dumbed down and future of the game is just to be another WoW clone, without proper budget ofc. I remember when Lotro developers said that revenue doubled with F2P model, well where does that show? In absolutely nothing, game is developed and maintained with minimum effort and smallest resources to make more cash.\nPerhaps it's time to give the license away to a team that loves LoTR or perhaps it's time for Turbine to get its act together and do something else with it than cash in with easiest possible way. And at the moment, im not so impressed with future plans of Lotro.","May 6, 2014","false","56.3"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshatner/recommended/212500/","theshatner","TheShatner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshatner/","239 products in account","I played beta and launch of this game... there was a lot of potential and it was very pretty at the time of launch- especially considering it was competing with the very cartoony look of WoW. There were some really interesting, unique features to the game as well as beautiful environments that were neat to explore as part of LotR lore...\n\nI popped back into the game, just to check out the f2p spin and see how things have evolved. On the upside, the game doesn't suck and all of my characters were still there. The down-sides, however, unfortunately, make me not recommend it. From my perspecitve, the game hasn't evolved (possibly de-volved), is a bit dated, continues to be a bit clunky, and is still not quite intuitive (coming from a veteran MMO player: EQ, SWG, WoW, Vanguard, Eve, AoC, CoH/V, DC Universe, D&DO, ESO, Entropia, SWTOR, blah blah blah).\n\nMost importantly, it seems barren now... so, if I want a LotR fix I'll just play one of the quality single player titles to get the same jolt... or maybe Skyrim. If I want a solid MMO (with actual players to interact with) to swing a sword around in, I'd spend my time and money on ESO or WoW. But, for other people, I guess if you really hate on WoW or ESO for whatever reason and really need an MMO fix in a similar genre or are REALLY into LotR and are willing to pay to play, it might be worth it.\n\nAll of that said, it really is free to play at the start- so trying it and not liking it will only cost you the time to download, the space on your hard drive (temporarily), and however much time you put in. If you have time to burn and enjoy spending it trying new things, it probably won't be a waste.","November 9, 2014","false","2.9"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

(We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)\nEver since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it "cost money" to do anything...\nNews flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.\nHere's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.\nThe issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...\n\nAnyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.\n\nPlay the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.\n\nLong story short, See you in the Moors.\n\n~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamed\n\nP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)\nYes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)","December 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game will eventually require money to be spent in order to progress meaningfully and also to reduce frustrations in basic gameplay aspects such as gold caps and inventory slots. Despite it's repetetive enemy models and requirement for endless travelling, LOTR really shines in bringing Tolkien's world to life. The game has very accurate depictions of characters and tales from the mythology, whilst providing an outstanding feeling of immersion through a beautiful soundtrack and carefully crafted environments. Some of its systems such as music composition and housing make it one of the best MMOs out there for atmospheric and paced gameplay.","April 10, 2015","true","48.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)\nEver since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it "cost money" to do anything...\nNews flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.\nHere's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.\nThe issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...\n\nAnyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.\n\nPlay the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.\n\nLong story short, See you in the Moors.\n\n~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamed\n\nP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)\nYes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)","December 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can say it is PROBABLY fun to play with a load of your friends and go on quests but whenever i ask if anyone in my group if they want to do something they tell me to lvl up to 30... 30, come on why should i even try to go to 30 if its NO FUN GETTING THERE.......*sigh* but i cant beat the game up about thiese things too much the game i beautifully intertwined with the books and the design is very nice, theres a massive map and is very compelling to go there, but trying to jet there is full of waiting and long drawn out tasks, i mean i shouldnt be waiting to get somewhere in an "open world game". but to sum all this uo i think its good to play if you have a CRAP TONE of time on your hands and are good at lvl'in up it could be fun so im going to leave this up to you and keep my voting at yes.","October 20, 2014","true","36.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

While it is a very good MMORPG, it has its ups and downs. Let me name the ups and downs of the game and then you'll see the issue's.\n\nUps: Great graphics, nice world, lots of towns all different and unique in some way. Crafting, class's, Ive seen some players look like knights, on a horseback. really feels like a Medieval England world. Sadly no castle's round Bree. Chatting is nice. Filter blocks bad stuff while it lets good stuff through. The looting system is one-of-a-kind, PvP, PvE, and you can even try out the Monster Play for a change of pace. The PvP is nice, and the PvE is also gonna be a critical role as you progress.\n\nIf your the type that enjoys getting online, making online friends, joining groups, battling monsters, players, exploring different landscapes, and socializing, your probably thinking, whats the issue's? This sounds FANTASTIC!! Well let me now show you the downs of the game.\n\nDowns: Too much lag. Especially going into the towns. And towns are where your gonna buy n sell, meet the characters to progress through the story, and mail letters to players. Ive uninstalled two games to see if it would help. It helped, but still a little laggy. Next, the class videos, where it shows what each class is like, is SOO laggy, and usually in some battle/land area where your not gonna be for a long time. Plus it dont show you what weapons you can and cant have. So, you choose a class that sounds good. You complete the tutorial, and are ready to equip that shield you got awhile back. Oh wait, you cant cause its not available for your class. Wouldv'e been nice to know that ahead of time. And weapons aint the only thing lacking instructions. You get some dye to change your armour's colors. You can spend real money for extra amounts. Oh wait, it never said how to use it exactly. But they'll gladly let you spend money on it. How bout a horse? It says visit some guy in Bree-land for a starter horse. But wait! Whats this? No instructions where to find this random guy in a 10+ mile land? And without a horse, it takes ALOT LONGER to get anywhere. Oh and real money is needed to buy a riding trait. Take a LONG time to earn the points to buy the trait. Oh and some lands cost money to unlock.\n\nIve found an active server on my fourth try. Its called Gladden. An active server will be important. According to some players I met in a kinship, they say level 40-50 is where your gonna have to spend some money to progress. I cant say thats true for certain however. By now, I'd say its safe to say, "free to play" needs a fine print saying "until a certain point" though it still leaves alot to run around and see...until it gets boring. My final overall thought: look at game, find an active server(Gladden) and spend hundreds of hours trying to figure it out. If you figure it out, and got money, you have hundreds of hours to look forward to. If not, hundreds of hours trying to figure it out down the drain. Oh and dont get discouraged when the usual "new player bug" pops up 45 seconds into the game. Just relog. To me, feels like alot of potential going down the drain.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE: It seems LOTRO has a rather dedicated and very loyal following of players, judging by the other reviews. However, when they say it still has an "active community" they either mean seeing no new players, every once and awhile some chat through the world chat box, seeing 2 players on through the week, with one of the 2 being AFK(Away From Keyboard) and then seeing a "crowd" of 4-7 over the weekend, means "active to them. It  dont sound exactly "active" to me. Though on Gladden I have seen lots of new players, and lots of chat through the world chat. Recently, however, even Gladden was rather player-less, but world chat filled. Some places even on Gladden are quiet as a grave. Unless of course they've all gone to another, far-off region where new players needing help wont get to. Or they are all sitting on the LOTRO official website on there forums/community or something like that. I cant say for sure. The game is "ancient" by MMO standards, and even the movies have been out awhile, with one last final movie to look forward to. Reason I even out the "thumbs up" sign was in the hope maybe it'd encourage new players to help clarify the confusion this game creates within itself.","July 6, 2014","true","121.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nor can I give any inclination into the Raids or larger group play that comes at end level.\n\nWhat I can tell you, however, that this is a truly rich game world that can really suck you in.  The various ways to progress are immense.  Bar the Mines of Moria expansion, which I found a slog, this game has never been tedious.  The landscape is rich and varied.  I've lost count of the number of times I travelled into areas far over my level just to explore.\n\nArguably the game has got easier over the years, with the map practically pointing you directly to the quest objective (rather than some vague area) but it does help speed your progression.  And, I guess, you can switch off the help.\n\nI do not think you could find this game as entertaining if you aimed to spend zero on it.  It would undoubtedly be more of a grind than I found Aion.  You need to purchase the quest packs.  The Epic Quest line is good, but some of the zone quest lines are equally fantastic.\n\nAnd, no matter how hard I try to utilise a different Starter area, I always come back to The Shire.  The tranquillity of the area is made even more beautiful when you go further and further afield.","November 25, 2013","true","250.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)\nEver since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it "cost money" to do anything...\nNews flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.\nHere's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.\nThe issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...\n\nAnyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.\n\nPlay the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.\n\nLong story short, See you in the Moors.\n\n~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamed\n\nP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)\nYes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)","December 4, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it is a very good MMORPG, it has its ups and downs. Let me name the ups and downs of the game and then you'll see the issue's.\n\nUps: Great graphics, nice world, lots of towns all different and unique in some way. Crafting, class's, Ive seen some players look like knights, on a horseback. really feels like a Medieval England world. Sadly no castle's round Bree. Chatting is nice. Filter blocks bad stuff while it lets good stuff through. The looting system is one-of-a-kind, PvP, PvE, and you can even try out the Monster Play for a change of pace. The PvP is nice, and the PvE is also gonna be a critical role as you progress.\n\nIf your the type that enjoys getting online, making online friends, joining groups, battling monsters, players, exploring different landscapes, and socializing, your probably thinking, whats the issue's? This sounds FANTASTIC!! Well let me now show you the downs of the game.\n\nDowns: Too much lag. Especially going into the towns. And towns are where your gonna buy n sell, meet the characters to progress through the story, and mail letters to players. Ive uninstalled two games to see if it would help. It helped, but still a little laggy. Next, the class videos, where it shows what each class is like, is SOO laggy, and usually in some battle/land area where your not gonna be for a long time. Plus it dont show you what weapons you can and cant have. So, you choose a class that sounds good. You complete the tutorial, and are ready to equip that shield you got awhile back. Oh wait, you cant cause its not available for your class. Wouldv'e been nice to know that ahead of time. And weapons aint the only thing lacking instructions. You get some dye to change your armour's colors. You can spend real money for extra amounts. Oh wait, it never said how to use it exactly. But they'll gladly let you spend money on it. How bout a horse? It says visit some guy in Bree-land for a starter horse. But wait! Whats this? No instructions where to find this random guy in a 10+ mile land? And without a horse, it takes ALOT LONGER to get anywhere. Oh and real money is needed to buy a riding trait. Take a LONG time to earn the points to buy the trait. Oh and some lands cost money to unlock.\n\nIve found an active server on my fourth try. Its called Gladden. An active server will be important. According to some players I met in a kinship, they say level 40-50 is where your gonna have to spend some money to progress. I cant say thats true for certain however. By now, I'd say its safe to say, "free to play" needs a fine print saying "until a certain point" though it still leaves alot to run around and see...until it gets boring. My final overall thought: look at game, find an active server(Gladden) and spend hundreds of hours trying to figure it out. If you figure it out, and got money, you have hundreds of hours to look forward to. If not, hundreds of hours trying to figure it out down the drain. Oh and dont get discouraged when the usual "new player bug" pops up 45 seconds into the game. Just relog. To me, feels like alot of potential going down the drain.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE: It seems LOTRO has a rather dedicated and very loyal following of players, judging by the other reviews. However, when they say it still has an "active community" they either mean seeing no new players, every once and awhile some chat through the world chat box, seeing 2 players on through the week, with one of the 2 being AFK(Away From Keyboard) and then seeing a "crowd" of 4-7 over the weekend, means "active to them. It  dont sound exactly "active" to me. Though on Gladden I have seen lots of new players, and lots of chat through the world chat. Recently, however, even Gladden was rather player-less, but world chat filled. Some places even on Gladden are quiet as a grave. Unless of course they've all gone to another, far-off region where new players needing help wont get to. Or they are all sitting on the LOTRO official website on there forums/community or something like that. I cant say for sure. The game is "ancient" by MMO standards, and even the movies have been out awhile, with one last final movie to look forward to. Reason I even out the "thumbs up" sign was in the hope maybe it'd encourage new players to help clarify the confusion this game creates within itself.","July 6, 2014","true","121.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've played this game since and recently docked it to Steam in an OS reinstall ( thus the low number of hours here ). Premium membership is highly recommended but you can have a good time for quite some time for free as well. Epic character music capabilities ( my Hobbit minstrel plays a mean Misty Mountain Hop ) are unique and envied by other games. Scalable raids to your party's level of choice. Solo instances that are also scalable by level! Massive crafting system. There are things and systems in LotRO I've seen blatantly copied by other games, including that Blizzard game. Oh, my characters can also smoke pipeweed! A real pleasure playing this game for all these years.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

OK, if you're an old-school WoWer then you'll love this (after you get over the graphics).  If you like the current dumbed-down WoW then you'll struggle to pick up LOTRO.  There's simply not as much hand-holding as WoW, but in ways that's better as you have to really get into the game (not just endlessly run raids and dungeons as in WoW nowadays).  And you really can play to level cap for free (I've met people in game that have done so).\n\nPROS: Crafting system is good after you get the hang of it, and you really can make better items than the drops at the same level.  The auction house system is good too.  And having your own home can be fun.  People are as friendly as they used to be on WoW and I haven't seen a single farmer bit yet.\n\nCONS: It is free-to-play BUT it is very much structured to make playing without buying TPs (Turbine Points) as annoying as possible.  For a start, there is the 2 gold pieces money cap - you need TPs to remove that.  And you can hit 2GP in an hour's play.  Yes, you can eran TPs but it's sloooooow.  And fellowships (forming a party) is a pain and you really need to make sure your fellow fellows know what they are doing.  I got to level 23 without dying, joined a fellowship for a dungeon and died almost immediately.  The housing system can leave you miles from where the action is so you'll probably end up buying and selling several homes.\n\nTry it!\n","May 17","true","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like questing in MMOs in general then you have the normal grindy leveling situation. I am not sure about endgame stuff  because I never have the time nor attitude to do that so I have no opinion. Plus, most endgamers won't even give me the time of day since I have bad gear and not very good on the keypad in Raids. Kind of stinks since at one time I loved MMOs and wanted to do end game stuff when it is hard not when they dumb stuff down for pug groups. The graphics are dated now although the game still looks "good" but definately looks older than it is. The game is worth trying to see if it is your cup of tea. I won't rate it since most people who like MMOs will try them out to see if they like them. It is F2P now anyhow and I think you have to buy level packs to move past a certain point but that make be changed now. I have played the game more than 8 hours before I installed it on Steam. I made it to the 30s before I stopped playing on another account. If you like LOTR lore you will like playing the game other than that try it out past level 20s.","May 5","true","8.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

Lore-accurate and immensely immersive, Turbine has truly created an epic to do justice to Tolkein's work. Unlike most other MMORPGs, the whole gaming experience is suitable for both the solo and group player. Endgame is just as fun playing alone as it is in a group and you are not forced into pigeonholed quests or raid runs if you don't want to play that way in order to access good endgame gear. A unique and enjoyable PVP experience playing as either your character or creating an evil character to challenge the Free Peoples means that you can never get bored of this game.

The complex skill systems, how to get around the map without getting lost is very complex and copious as this game is literally the LOTR scaled to what its supposed to be.The Atmosphere and enviroment is a great thing to enjoy and explore but there are pro's and cons as many games do. Some suggestions could be that they update their combat system and explain to players how everything works clearly as I stumbled a lot through the game not knowing what are how to interact or do certain things. Other things that would be great if they would give discounts on the monthy subscriptions at certian times or events, as it is annoyance that certian interactions would not be available.","May 11","true","21.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a much more casual MMORPG that doesn't eat up all your time, but still manages to be immersive and works very well with the lore of Tolkiens works. This has been the only MMORPG I ever got hooked on. I first played it at launch and still return to it from time to time.

Don't buy the triple pack here in the store.\n\nThere is of course pvp, but it's not main of the game excatly. Since the biggest part is pve or raiding and such. But there will be more new content in the future.\n\nThe things you can do as free to play player. you can go to cap level which lvl 95.

The bugs aren't gamebreaking so you'll survive. Other than that it's an amazing game, with loads of lore and exploring. The leveling system is slow AF but it isn't about leveling, It's about enjoying the experience of the universe.\n\nI'm currently playing it solo, I'm in a kin so I'm not completely alone, but I prefere to quest alone and LOTRO is a nice and calm solo experience. The Community on the server are amazing, everyone helps everyone and people are nice and mature. This isn't a game filled with 13 years old and it's noticable.\n\nIf you really wanna enjoy this game it's not F2P. You should think of the F2P title as a trial to for the game, because if you don't pay anything it's gonna be hell to play through. I myself don't mind spending 35.99 Euros on steam market for most expansions and 14.99 Dollars monthly for VIP. I know the money will be spend well, and I'd gladly give some money for the cause. So if you don't mind spending some money on the game, you really should buy into this game, bacause it's really ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\nAll in all I'll recommend this game for the Middle-Earth fans and MMO fans. If the game was supported better and not F2P the game would be much better.\n\nI myself support the developers in any way I can, you should too! :D","November 8, 2015","true","35.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The devs hear what the community has to say and what we want out of the game, and does their best to implement those things. PVP is fun as hell, roaming solo or run through as a kinship.

I understand how it might have been different in the past, but overall all the free playable content is astounding.\nI love this game and I try to play it every chance I get.\nIt features all the best parts of a RPG/MMO, including factions, creatable characters, creatable homes, changeable ability sets, mounts, craftable items, races, classes, and the graphics and detail are overwhelmingly beautiful.\n\nThe quests are simple enough for the "casualest" gamers (such as myself), yet detailed and challenging enough so that it is not boring. Future quests grow with you, and become some of the most memorable times played in the game, and are just tough enough to leave you wanting more.\n\nI can't go on enough without spoiling the whole thing for you, but as a HUGE Tolkein fan, and for those that aren't, it is hands down the best Medieval/Reneissance/Dark Ages/Fantasy MMORPG that is out there.","November 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah, its not so expensive but still only advertisments and in-game errors like unfunctional in-game store, its something unpleasant....\nOther thing is that f2p players have only 2 character slots, but its hard to put to pros or cons, lets leave it between, its good that f2p has a chance to play for more than 1 toon, but from other side its only 2, some people love crafting and in this game is great system of it, everyone can make very good armor or weapons but still needs more than 2 toons to be not addicted to auctions or other sources of equipment and other items....\nTo say something as pros, there are really great places for just enjoying of that beautiful scenery of Middle-earth, large amount of weapons and enemies, also hobbies and other things like smoking weed (which made me laughing, its very good idea from author and same from creators of the game: )) or musical instruments....\nAnd one really large pros: outfits, its great because it makes player happy to see his toon, without this system there would be so many ugly toons because of bad looking armor, with this there disapear problems with chosing between usable and good looking, great work if i can say it: )\nAnd about paying again, i understand that everyone needs money especially when team of people wants to make something enjoyable for other people like this amazing game which leads players through Middle-earth, i admire it also because iam a great fan of Lotr books and movies. So i dont pressure to anyone, i only said what i like and dislike: )\nYeah and something from in-game expirience, i played as Lore-Master (LM), Hunter, Champion and Guardian, if i can say, the best (in case of fun) are Hunter and then Lore-Master, Champion is perfect in PvE but in duels with other players i have the best expirience with LM, Hunter is great in case of fast killing, teleports and has lots of hp, but he loses his powers quickly so i can recommend to fellowship Hunter with Lore-Master as his powersource when fights are long and other help is not avaliable at the moment, then for tanking Guardian is great, he does low amount of damage but his power is hidden in high amount of hp, he stands many attacks and when there is also Champion or Captain, damage is large and Captain can heal well....\nThen i like deeds, sometimes hard to do but great way to earn points for in-game store.\n\nSo its something from me about this game, as you can see, i can totally recommend it but like always, nothing is perfect:)\n","December 30, 2014","true","120.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have only been able to install it on 1 out of 3 Windows machines.  One of those would play for a few weeks, and then no longer launch the game.  Really limited information online about how to fix it.  It would be nice if I could send logs / diagnotic information somewhere for these problems.  It doesn't look like I'm the only user with the problerms.\n\nThe game has plenty of free content to get comfortable with the world and game system before deciding to put more money into it.  Staying "free" means slower progress, less areas to explore, harder to manage inventory with less slots, no mounts, etc.\n","November 27, 2014","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a very boilerplate MMORPG experience with boring combat. I can't find myself actually enjoying the combat even though the story aspect of the game was pretty good. Alas, as great as story is I can't find myself liking an MMO that isn't very...multiplayer. I always felt like I was playing alone and while that can be great in a single-player game, it feels lonely in an online game\n\nIt's World of Warcraft in the Tolkein universe and with better questing but...the low player population and basically the same themepark gameplay means that ultimately I left Middle-Earth.","March 25, 2015","false","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
