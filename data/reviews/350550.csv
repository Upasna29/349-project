It  has officially joined the ranks of the few OELVNs I'd definitely recommend to people if someone asks me to recommend an English otome game. All of the love interests are endearing in their own way and Elcia is a wonderful heroine, I couldn't help but adore this game.","July 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","18","22","3","0"

It's absoultely stunning; the author and artist should be extremely proud of themselves.\n\nFirstly, the art is beautiful. The animated eyes can look a little awkward on some characters, but overall everything is drawn in lovely detail; the characters are distinct and the backgrounds are never lazy. Then there's the music, which is sort of techno in style; it suits the game and the mood. Personally, I'd buy the sound-track if I could.\n\nThe story is engaging, interesting and well-written. Despite finishing only today, I'm already hungry for more. There's still so much mystery left, so many characters arcs I haven't explored. I felt for the characters. Some of them were very unique - in particular, I appericated Elcia, who isn't the stereotypical, sweet and loving otome protagonist.\n\nEdit: I previously wrote here you cannot skip text, but this isn't true! Holding the down arrow allows you to fly through text. Also, you can press Enter to skip whole segments of the game after you've progressed to a certain point.\n\nI'll also add that "romances" in this game are restricted to male/female couples, so no female love interests. In addition, none of the romances get too, well, "romancy", if that's what you're looking for. There's no declarations of eternal love, passionate kissing or desperate hugs - the affectionation between Elcia and the boys can be interpretted as romantic, platonic or queerplatonic, which I particularly liked.\n\nDo yourself a favour and buy this game!","July 10, 2015","true","30.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Without a doubt, it is one of the best visual novels to come out ever.  Where do I start?\n\nFor those familiar with X-Note, Area-X is the second game in the series.  It could be considered either a prequel or sequel, depending on how one looks at the storyline.  Basically, you take on the role of Elcia, who is from the Future and has the capability of traveling to different time dimensions via the use of a time machine.  Although others do have this ability, Elcia can use it more.  I won't go into spoilers as to how since that should be reserved for the true path.  ;)\n\nBasically, Elcia travels to different time dimensions originally with the goal of negotiating for natural resources since in the Future, these are lacking.  However, events take a turn for the worse...Without giving away spoilers, I won't reveal what they are.  Buy the game if you wish to know what happens.  XD\n\nThere are a total of five guys in the associated time dimensions that you can pursue although at the start, you're only given two of these guys.  As you complete paths, you'll be given letters to assemble passwords so you can unlock more paths.  Basically, you should play for both good and bad endings to get access to passwords to unlock more paths.  Now some might say that this is a bit inconvenient although I can understand the developer's intent.  If one were to get access to all of the paths early on, it would be spoiling the story and personally, I prefer to unlock paths as I go so I can learn more of the story.  ^^\n\nAside from the story, the gameplay is pretty standard.  There are puzzles to solve and some of them are challenging.  In addition, the art is absolutely stunning.  I think it's a great improvement from X-Note, and I loved that game.  The music is fitting as well and I found myself crying a bit as I got near the end of the true path so yeah, I think this game is beautiful.\n\nOverall, I'd totally recommend getting it and it's interesting to see how elements from X-Note are implemented in Area-X.  I'm excited to find out that there will eventually be a sequel although we shouldn't expect it any time soon.  Still, I can't wait and again, I recommend getting Area-X, especially if you're a fan of VNs.  ^^","January 1","true","36.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I was glad that the graphics stayed the same as I truly liked it the last time.\nScore: 10\nStorylineThis VN delivered such an amazing mystery story just like X-note. There are some puzzles to complete to progress in the story, but they aren't too hard to do.\nScore: 10\nSoundThe soundtrack definitely improved from the last game, which I was pleased about. The soundtracks seemed more appropriate in this VN and the soundtracks did not seem to repeat itself quite as often, but it still isn't top-notch soundtrack and there was no option for any kind of volume control in the "Options".\nScore: 7\nStructureThe artwork and the storyline make an awesome combination, the soundtrack was certainly improved, but I don't feel like it was enough. The "Options" menu barely had anything to change, there was no option to change the volume...it was either ON or OFF and there no other "text" options. Also, just like X-note, there is only 15 save slots which I feel isn't enough if someone is going to do all the 9 routes.\nScore: 8\nPriceFor £18.99, this VN is over-priced just like the X-note. I would've liked to see the price reduced to at least £10 as it’s too expensive right now...\nScore: 5\nOverall Verdict: The VN has amazing artwork, a great story and a decent soundtrack going for it, but the lack of options in the "options" menu, save slots and the price might be the only aspects keeping this VN down.\n\nI totally recommend reading this VN if you have the money for it or you could just wait until it goes on sale.","August 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","10"

Each major branch of the storyline is quite different from the others, so players aren't repeating so much of the same story as they play through multiple times. Area-X is definitely a game you will want to play through over and over, as more of the story is unlocked and more of the mystery is unravelled with each different completetion. Really, the game doesn't get started until you complete the first four basic endings, and then there is still a lot left to experience. The replay factor for this game is huge, and grinders who love to take a Visual Novel to its full extent will be fully satisfied by this game.\n\nElcia is a really strong female protaganist with a bit of a sadistic streak to her. Still, she is able to make connections with the other characters in the game, and some of the endings are super sweet. The game isn't about hooking up with the various characters or even finding true love. Some of the endings are more about making a special connection with a character, and the endings are really rewarding.\n\nThe writing for Area-X could be a little better, but as the writers have done a ton of work for this very long game, some players might be willing to accept some of the weaker parts of the story and move on.\n\nOverall, if you can get past some cheesy writing at a few points and press the "I believe" button at a few story elements, this game can be a lot of fun. Hard core VN players who love to experience every scene and ending will be rewarded with Area-X, and those same players should find that they certainly got their money's worth out of this game.","July 16, 2015","true","28.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

All pursuable characters have a role in the story and thereby cannot be taken out.\n-Well thought out story that have little to no plot holes.\n-art is fantastic\n\n-If you've played X-note, all your answers can be found here.\n-Even w/o playing X-note, you can still play the game as a stand alone.\n\nCons\n-For most, the price will be a hurdle espcially since there are not even voices. However, given the cohesion of the story and amazing writing/story telling, I do not regret paying at full price.\n-Lack of romance. There is a MUCH greater focus on the plot.\n\n+/- not a fluffy otome game. Plot driven with more emotional/ serious undertones.\n+/- has minigames. I honestly wasn't too fond of them since I found most puzzles to be quite difficult and required a walkthough.\n\nArea-X is one of my favorite otome games and (I know I sound like a broken record) a story that is so well developed, carefully planned, and intriguing that the price is worth it. If you've become jaded with otome games (mobile, pc, etc) do give this is a try. You will witness what a visual novel is truly capable of.","December 23, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","3"
