The graphics are polished and the gameplay is enjoyable.\n\nWeapons\nThrough this game you will find 8 weapons, each showing something different. You will start off with a basic pistol that has infinite reload. But soon you will find a shotgun, a flamethrower, a tommy, an electricity gun, and 3 other weapons\n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay was highly enjoyable and supports controllers. You start off as Vinnie Cannoli, an enforcer of the mob who has been hired by Mr. Bellucio to find Frankie the Fly. You head to the destination of your job "Thug Town". Soon you will be fighting fellow mobsters, zombies, mutant rats and of course the army. This game is set in the 1920's. Throughout the whole game it really gave that classic mobster feel. The game has everything you would find in a normal mob movie. The combat is nice and fluent and you will find a number of enemies and a few bosses.\n\nConsider buying this/ not buying this if\nConsider buying this if:\n- you love platformers\n- you like a nice little story\n- you like mobster movies\n- you love shooting zombies/mutants/army guy/mobsters\n- you love cannoli\n- you just want a nicely overall designed game\n\nConsider not buying this if:\n- you hate 2D platformers\n- you hate zombies\n- you hate the mob\n- you hate cannoli\n- you hate fun\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game was highly enjoyable through the time I have played it. It had everything I expected with a mobster and the mafia. It had a satisfying ending. For some reason I really liked the name Vinnie Cannoli and now I'll want to try Cannoli.\nI would recommend this game to my friends because of its art, gameplay, story, and mobsters. I also hear skins are coming, so  YAY. I really don't have anything negative to say on this game's behalf because I enjoyed the game so much.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 21, 2015","true","4.5"," 89 of 97 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","89","97","17","1"

A pixelated look does not necessarily deliver an old school gaming experience.\n\nWell, this game here comes very close to what I think is a very good "gaming in the 80`s experience" and it does so without the blocky look of its competition. And it`s pure survival, no leaderboard race...\n\nWhat fascinates me, besides the artwork and sound, is the flow of events you take part in. The weapons, enemies and levels are very well designed and after a while of playing you feel like the main dancer in a gun ballet...\n\nYou can handle each situation with your standard pistol, you are never defenseless, it`s just a little bit more fun to take out the other surgical instruments. Some guns are better in specific situations, but basically you could use the pistol throughout the whole game and this, in my opinion, is very good game design.\n\nAnd if you solve a tricky situation with just your standard piece it will put a huge grin on your face.\n\nWhat else makes me smile all the time? The reloading animations and general physics engine!\n\nIt`s just fun to see (and hear) how your guy is reloading the good old double-barrel shotgun, and the empty cases gently sliding down an elevation. After reloading the pistol he is even pulling back the slide...\n\nThe levels offer a great variety of putting your gun ballet dancing to the test and are well balanced. At some points you just need to rush through a room guns blazing and then there are other moments in which you can pause and hide behind an obstacle...\n\n...and speaking of the grin you got while playing: The chain reactions caused by a misthrown grenade are just hilarious.\n\nSo, my final words regarding this game:\n\nTo the developers: Where can I sign-in for a monthly subscription of more levels, enemies ... more everything?\n\nTo you: Never forget to reload your gun after a shoot-out!\n\n(If you don`t ... meh, it doesn`t matter anyway, if this game is your thing you will just smile and return ...double prepared this time, of course)\n\nIf 2D enforcing for the mob is something you always wanted to try this game is an offer you can`t refuse!","May 2, 2015","true","23.9"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","44","46","4","1"

Very simple shoot and run game with hope guns, gore and canolli. Story line is very funny and wonderful put together.\nGame has some amazing art and the creators did a really great job and I think this gives the game head jump from other indie games in the same genre.\nThe background music give you that totally feeling about the theme of the game.\nI'm a a big soundtrack nerd so this are things that I think are very important..\nMain character you play with have some great and funny lines that he says when pumping some lead in the freaking zombies. One of my favorites .... I sell lead by the kilo these days. :P\n\nControls:\n======\nI think this game can be played best with a controller I prefer the original Microsoft Xbox 360 Joypad / controller. The game plays very well and easy to learn because of the basic button layout like in the old arcade games from the ‘90 era.\nWhen you start playing this game you will find out you only can shoot left or right most game I played in the ‘90 this can be weird in some way when you try to shoot some enemies that will attack you from the sky.\nKicking your enemies is a fun and easy way to attack you enemies without losing all of you bullits find it strange you can not use this when jumping.\n\nWeapons:\n========\n\n\nThere are a lot of different weapons in the game and further you play the story more you will find them no faster way for unlocking them.\nEvery weapons has been well balanced only I think you will always have a favorite one.\nPersonally I love the shotgun of his power and you can shoot multiple enemies with one shot.\nSometime you really can use it because they come with 4 or more zombies from all directions.\nIt's a shame there is no way to have all weapons from the beginning. (cheat code maby !!!)\nThat would make the game extra fun to choose what weapon to have from the start.\n\nEnemies:\n=======\n\nThere some classes zombies like in every games only one I think the most annoying is the Rugby Zombie.\nBecause this one is very strong and sometimes need more than 3 hits to get it down.\nZombies are fun and give you a great challenge sometimes getting them out of your way.\nNot to forget a few of them need to be kicked before you shoot... that helps a lot sometimes.\nAfter you play not only the zombies will be your enemies so.... this is getting fun after some levels.\n\nMultiplayer:\n========\nGame only supports co-op 4 player offline mode.\nIt's a shame maybe for some people only I prefer to play with some friend on the couch.\nThat will give that fun co-op like the old days if you not from that era ? It's fun...\nI hope Online co-op will be added in the future with a update.\nAnd I can't play with friend on the couch everyday :(\nIf enough people buy the game... maby this will happen ?\n\nFinally:\n=====\nThis is a great game.. people who like this platform will love this one.\nIt’s a shame the game has no online support so you will need to play this game offline like old times and some people will find it a little bit disappointing.\nThere is no level system, no items to collect.\nIt just a basic arcade shoot 'em up.\n\nIt's fun, It's haves a great gameplay, love the theme.\nI give it a 9/10 score.\n\n((Update 16-03-2016))\nAfter some month the game is online the devs have added new multiplayer mode deathmatch.\nIt’s a fun way to play against your friends and yes only offline mode possible.\nGame have a few maps to choose from and they added the option that every player can choose their own favorite skins.\nAnd also story mode has the option for selecting your own character.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/322210\n\n\n== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==\n== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==","April 30, 2015","true","234.0"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","52","65","7","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/322210/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli is a a side scrolling action shooter with the welcome addition of zombies. This game was released in April 2015 and has actually got a surprisingly low number of owners given how awesome it is. You play the role of a gangster named Vinnie. You are thrown into Thugtown to find another gangster who has gone missing. You soon find the town has been overrun by zombies as you wade your way through streets, buildings, sewers and urban America.\n\nThis is one of the best side scroller games of this type; it's action packed and face paced. Gunplay is a key factor, with about 8 or 9 different weapons which you will eventually find, you have plenty in your arsenal. Whilst working your way through the levels, you will find health packs in the form of Cannoli and tons of ammo to keep you rolling. All of the weapons have their own feel and different uses and none of them feel useless.  There are a couple of jumping type puzzles in the latter levels, but the platforming element of the game is very limited.\n\nThe art style in Guns, Gore & Cannoli is gorgeous. The cartoon magazine style look really works well with the setting and story. Not to mention all of the animations are perfectly done too. I often find problems with games that have a generic cartoon look, but this is easily one of the best games to pull it off.\n\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli also has some very nicely recorded voice acting; the American/Italian accent feels like it has just come straight off the streets of New York. Hats off to these devs who put in the extra work for the voice acting, as they could of quite easily just put in text instead, for me it made the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThis game has a very gentle difficulty curve, I only really struggled with the last couple of levels of the game, but was able to push on through once the best weapon was chosen for the scenario. The end boss is also quite challenging too which is a refreshing change compared to other games nowadays.  At some points trying to kill everything on site is not always the best option too; sometimes you just need to run and hope that there is a checkpoint near by because you are just being overrun - keep that in mind.\n\nLength wise, I completed the game in just under three hours on single player. Whilst there is no real need to replay it again, there are also plenty of achievements for you to go back and hunt, and this can be done easily though the Chapter select option. Guns, Gore & Cannoli also has a local co-op feature too, I have yet to try it out but have watched a couple of Youtube videos of it; and it looks so much fun. This is going to be one of those games that I sit down and play with my partner and finish it for a second time.\n\nI had one technical issue whilst playing; sometimes the game would freeze for half a second. This seems to happen especially when reaching save points; but also happens at random points too. This is a known problem with the game and has been reported to the devs. It seems to point to an issue with the fact that the game records lots of stats, such as headshots etc.\n\nIn conclusion; Guns, Gore & Cannoli is a really nicely put together game, and one that needs to be experienced by more people than it already has. For the none sale price of £6,99, this is a bargain to pick up especially if you have friends to play with.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

You play Vinnie Cannoli, a mobster working for a large family, traveling to a town plagued by zombies and rival gangsters. The story is pretty basic, but fun. You could totally enjoy the game by skipping the cutscenes, but I don't regret watching them, they ended up being pretty funny and the voice acting is pretty good.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, your shooting zombies/people. I was very happy when I realized I'd be fighting more than just zombies, I feel that would have gotten old pretty quickly. The game does shine in variety, however. By the end of the game, you have a total of 10 different guns, ranging from a pistol with infinite ammo to a Tesla gun, used to electrify your opponents. Weapons are more viable against certain enemies, which makes it a lot harder to just run through the game with the pistol(although I'm sure its possible). The game also has a nice variety of enemies. There are several types of zombies, including ones that will chase you down the map, big exploding zombies, and more average zombies that are only aggressive when you're next to them. You also fight soldiers and other mobsters, each with their own variety of enemy types. As you can see, the game shakes it up throughout\n\nI enjoy the game greatly, but obviously its not perfect. The biggest issue I have is with the AI. While its competent most of the time, and I do like that zombies won't avoid grenades but regular people will(nice touch), I've found the AI killed themselves more times than I'd like. There are stages that should probably be hard that you can exploit to get the enemies to kill themselves. I'm not talking about the Zombies here, I'm talking about the regular people, and they should be smarter than that. But, the AI overall is pretty competent but its not perfect. The last complaint I'd make is the length. I get the game is meant to be replayed, so its short to warrant other playthroughs, but for people like me that want to play through different games, and only replay a handful of games more than once, it makes it hard to recommend at full price. I still would, but its harder.\n\nOverall Guns, Gore & Cannoli is a well done 2D action platformer, that has great gameplay with a strong mix of enemy types. If you worry about things like $1/hr of enjoyment, maybe wait for a sale. Otherwise, I recommend it, Especially if you have someone locally to play with.\n\nBuy At Full Price","May 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","0"

The story was actually pretty cool such as it is, and was a pretty unique take on how a zombie outbreak might begin. You play as a hitman/enforcer, Vinnie Cannoli, sent by your boss to pick up a dude named Frankie who is held by a rival gangster family. ♥♥♥♥ just gets out of hand from there, lol.\n\nThe graphics were really cool looking. Very cartoon and gangster Noire all at once, with vivid colors and striking landscapes, minimalist as they were.\n\nThe enemy variety is fairly limited, but the game isnt long enough for that to really matter. You basically have a couple different types of a few different enemies (zombies, zombie rats, gangsters, and military).\n\nThe gameplay was pretty fast and furious, with an assortment of cool weapons that you find along the way and can scroll between on the fly. Ammo isn't generally scarce although you will have some barely eked by with not much ammo left moments. Also, health packs are in the form of cannoli, lol, which Vinnie seems to love and comments on pretty much every time. This alternates between funny and annoying depending on how many times you here it in a short span of time (such as if there is a cannoli at the start of a boss battle which you keep dying in). Speaking of boss battles, there are pretty much three of them, although the last has several parts to it.\n\nWhat else? Lots of jumping around and blowing stuff up. Some platforming mixed in.\n\nOh, and the script was strictly followed by the voice actors. They embellished a lot, as is evidenced by the fact that the subtitles wont necessarily match what is being said. It works though. You can tell they had a lot of fun with it, and that is a theme that carries through all the aspects of this game. Just the right length to keep you interested and allow you to appreciate the labor of love which was created here.\n\nHoly Cannoli! I give this 9 drunken, St Patties day gangsters getting in your bullets way and being eaten by zombies out of 10 possible.","August 23, 2015","true","9.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","3"

I really love this game, everything blends together so well. Every little thing is put into place so nicely. I really do thing this is one of my favorite modern platformers. I do have a problem with one thing though, for some reason when I beat the game I didn't get the achievement for beating the game on normal mode, but this does seem to be a one time glitch because I didn't see anyone else say anything about this.\n\nOverall I rate this game a  7.8/10  game is a bit short but the price isn't so bad and you should totally pick it up.","May 10, 2015","true","6.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","1"

The dev contacted me and asked for some impressions, but I already had this on my radar before. Its pretty short with 2-3 hours for a first playthrough (so maybe keep an eye on it during the Steam sales if that is important to you), but the VERY challenging higher difficulties and challenges through achievements (beat X level by doing Y, etc) add a lot of replayability to it. Its also just... plain fun. Throughout those 2-3 hours, the game constantly introduces new enemy types and a wide range of weapons, so you always have something new to play around with/learn and the level design/enemy hordes keep you on your toes for most of the game.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the polish, which I havent found often in such a game. In contrast du many other 2D platformers, it uses a VERY well done comic style, nunanced through snarky comments, a very moody soundtrack and extremely pretty animations. I had more than one moment, where I was marvelling at small graphical details, like the multiple subtle layers of background animations, very fluid character animations, extremely satisfying killing animations or small details like an in-style animated water shadow when you are walking in water or ... splashes from bullet cases hitting the water:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZjRq5bW.gif\n\nThis game is drenched in love for making games, I am really surprised to see it seems to be one of the devs first efforts into game developing (at least according to the devs website).

It's so satisfying firing that shotgun, hearing the cartridges drop to the flaw and then it being reloaded. All in the middle of pure carnage.\n\nThere are a variety of enemies, although many are well known if you've played Left 4 Dead. Which is no fault to the developers at all. There are only so many variations of zombies you can get.\n\nThe 1920's setting is extremely fun, and I've always enjoyed shows, movies, and games set in the period. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is no exception.\n\nThe narration is done rather well, with comments being thrown about mid fight from the protagonist Vinne; which only adds to the atmosphere of the game and your current situation.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons you have everything the 1920's was known for; from the world famous Tommy Gun with drum magazine to molotov cocktails and magnum revolvers. Each extremely satisfying to use in their own right. Not every enemy can be effectively taken out with any weapon, and finding the right tool for the job can be messy if you're suddenly overwhelmed by a small horde of face ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nEven so I've been really enjoying the game and would easily recommend it.

I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nMafia meets zombies and infected rats in a 2d shooting adventure!\n\nGuns, Gore & Cannoli is a very weird name for a game but it basically explains some of it\nAn interesting 2d platformer that combines comedy and yet stays serious\n\nAbout the game\nYou're Vinnie Cannoli, a very badass mob guy, I mean really he is your typical tough as nails mafia dude that shoots and asks questions later and his character is very well-made and the voicing is outstanding.\nYou basically start shooting zombies with a pistol and finding more different guns as you play.\n\nThe designs looks really good, the cutscenes are great, the music and sound effects are also something to admire, and the gameplay is pretty cool.\n\n- About 12 levels, packed with action, zombies, mobsters and much more.\nAlthough 12 levels might not seem that much, but each level is actually pretty long and takes time to finish.\n- 4 Difficulty levels to choose between that can be changed in-game any time.\n- Local co-op up to 4 players, although I feel like it was mainly meant for one guy to play it because it was fun playing it alone, but the local coop certainly adds some spice to the game and more fun.\n- kick, shoot or throw bombs at your enemies, jump or duck to avoid their attacks and travel between platforms and kick more stuff to reach the end of the level.\n\nGameplay - With fully re-bindable keys you can design them however you want which is cool.\n- The game is not too crazy that type that gets you frustrated, pretty reasonable with great check points and many cannoli's to find on the ground to restore your hp, that said its also not too easy.\n- The boss fights in the game are great, feels real and intense.\n- All kinds of enemies to encounter with weaknesses and attacks.\n- Interesting and fun levels to play.\n\nAnd all in all the game feels great, to shoot and kick zombies and to throw explosives or blowup cars, it has its downsides but i'll get to that in a minute.\n\nWhats good  - The music, the level and character design, the sound effects and pretty much everything.\n- The story and the comedy and dialogues and the lines the character says while playing.\n- The achievements in the game are nice, not too crazy, steam cloud and controller support and trading cards.\n- Boss fights, enemies, difficulty and well a lot of parts of the game are pretty good.\n- The game's length and the time it takes to finish it and get the achievements.\n- Local coop with 4 players.\n\nWhats not so good\nI kinda feel that how the game plays is not done right, for an example when the zombies attacks you they just come close to you and basically touches you while doing the attack animation which looks great but feels that you're not being attacked just being slowed down. And making it harder to jump and perform actions.\nSo kinda feeling that its just not done right.\n\nAlso the aiming, you cant really change the aiming you shoot forward and it tilts up or down if you're injured or jumping, so gets kinda hard to shoot zombies that are under the hill so you'll always need to wait in a horizontal place to kill them or jump behind them and shoot them which will usually get you injured if you timed it wrong\n\n\nTL;DR\nA very fun to play action-packed zombie and mafia killing game, with a good story, funny dialogues and challenging gameplay. And its for 9.99$ so the price is worth it, if you're into zombies or mafia or just 2D platformers that looks like this, then you should probably get this game because its doing it right.\n\n\n\n\nThis review was written while i was a part of the original traders group OTG, however you can trust that the review was not effected by that fact, I was not forced to lie or anything, you can read it and judge for yourself, all my reviews are honest and I am no longer a part of the group.","May 21, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"

I downloaded the demo which consists of the complete Bonnino's Stripclub level in October from Mod DB.  It was an immediate hit at my house and got put on 4 gaming PCs.  Having bought the full game I'm equally pleased and it's good to see so many positive reviews.\n\nAnyway the demo is still available and I recommend you DL it.  Note, the demo only supports 2 player co-op while the released game supports 4 players.  Co-op usually makes most games easier but not this one (at least the demo version).  I think this is a plus as you can't simply spam your way out of trouble.\n\nIf you play on "easy" (one of the 4 skill levels) you can complete the game in about 3 hours (and much faster if you speed run).  However, to gain 100 percent achievements you would have to play on impossible and this will make some of the achievements really hard so you would be wise to do a run through on easy and then play again on impossible.","May 4, 2015","true","11.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

You will play “Vinnie Cannoli” who was payed big bucks to rescue “Frankie,” a very important acquaintance of a mob boss call Mr. Bellucio!\n\nYou arrive from the sea in “Thugtown”, dressed with your coat, slick blue hat and a small gun in your pocket.  Everything seems to be upside down in this town and soon you will find yourself in a action-packed story fighting zombies (1920??????) , gangsters and the military.\n\nYour arsenal is very thin at the start of the game, but it will increase quite rapidly, and thank god for that! The likes of the 2 barrels shotgun, Magnum, Thomson (machine gun), grenades, Molotov cocktails, Bazooka and even a Flamethrower will be put at your disposal to kill all your enemies!\n\nThis game has a marvellous atmosphere with its cartoon graphics and superb soundtracks.

As you might expect, it includes guns, gore and, you guessed it, cannoli. Vinnie, who has a mission in Thugtown, is one of the rare humans still in town. Zombies are all around it, but luckily, he gets a few guns to fight them. And man, was that a fun fight!\nYou want ups and downs, right? There you go:\n\nPros:    Despite its style, this game actually has a really good story. I don't want to spoil it, but it exceeded my expectations. The story is evolving, more people are getting involved in the story ...\nGraphics. There are lots of blood and explosions everywhere and they look awesome. Characters also look really nice. By the way, the whole game is hand-drawn. Awesome.\nIf you are into weapons, this is the game to play. It features pistols, machine guns, shotguns, flamethrowers ... you name it!\nDifferent zombie types. There are crawling ones, running ones, shooting ones and more.\nCo-op! You can play with your friends if you have controllers! It's only local, however.\nAchievements, Trading Cards and Steam Cloud are present.\nThe price is pretty low.\nThe developer is super nice. I've talked to him and he is an awesome person, he is also keeping his game updated and is open to suggestions. Right now, for example, he is accepting suggestions for new main character skins.\nCons:    No Linux support. Sorry, Crazy Monkey Studios, but I'm a Linux freak ;)\nNo online multiplayer support. This game could be just as fun as BattleBlock Theater with it. What's better than playing with your friends?\nI would really enjoy this game much more with mouse controlled aiming. At least consider enabling this for the easiest difficulty.\nSometimes, there's not enough health pickups. Could be just me playing bad, though.\nWuts?!?:    One of the options in the settings menu is "Flip cutscenes upside down". What the heck is this good for? Am I missing something out?\nEDIT: I spoke to the dev and he said that some people had their cutscenes upside down. The easiest way to solve this was apparently the option I mentioned above. Interesting.\nThe final verdict:I like it and you should, too. It's super fun, has an awesome story and even includes some humour in it. It offers great relaxation on the easy mode and a painful challenge on the hardest mode, if that's what you're looking for. Co-op is a very nice addition, but you need real life friends to sit next to you.\nThe graphics are hand-drawn and look amazing. The developer is active and cooperates with community. You should give this game a try.\n\nGreetings,\nBird\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

If you get cheaply or in a bundle, its a fun, playable little romp.\n\nA quick summarization of the plot of this game is simple, you're a mob hitman who has a job for your boss and the location is infested of the job is infested with zombies. Not much else to say! Its a fairly well crafted 2D sidescroller with some very nice art, passable voice acting, and music that fits the time period.\n\nMy playtime is a bit skewed. At the time of this review, I have 4.8 hours into the game, but that is double my actual playtime as I was about to finish the main game around the 2.5 hour mark, but an update broke my save so I had to start over again. It's length leaves a lot to be desired needless to say.\n\nPros:\n\n+ It looks great. The artwork alone is enough reason to install this game.\n+ Its fun. There's a decent variety of weapons throughout the game and blasting zombies stays fun. It has a lot of classic side scroller elements that bring back the old days with a modern coat of paint.\n+ The level design is fairly varied.\n+ There is traditional side scroller challenge to bosses that is reminscent of similar games from back in the day.\n\nCons:\n\n- Extremely short. Almost insultingly so.\n- Local co-op only in a game that is screaming for online multi. It's 2015, not 1994.\n- Low replayability.\n\nThis game deserves to be lauded for the heart that went into it. I really loved the artwork in virtually every respect. I could nitpick some aspects, but I don't think that would be fair because it succeeds in making a light hearted 2D zombie game within an era that is represented very well by the work that went into it. However, as I stated in my opening, I do not feel this game is worth the regular price of admission. It just doesn't provide enough gameplay if someone is on a limited budget. A multiplayer mode and some more depth to the single player game would go a long way in justifying its price point a bit more.\n\nVerdict: 6/10. Its good at what it is and worth playing, but its definitely something to wait to get on the cheap.","October 23, 2015","true","4.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Probably not but heck give this game a go anyway.\n\nStep back into the roaring 1920’s and face off against Johnny law and the prohibition. Of course Johnny law has decided that normal crime fighting is going to lose the war on booze so where else would they turn? Zombies of course. Step into the shoes of Vinnie, the wise cracking sociopath with a penchant for death and a hankering for Cannoli’s.\n\nThis game is more fun than you can shake a stick at. Face off against hoards of the undead that come in all shapes and sizes. Want foul smelling football players or whip cracking corpse call girls, this game has it all. And not only the walking dead either, you have a fair share of gangsters, mutant rats and a soldiers to boot. All of which can be dispatched using your large array of assorted armaments.\n\nThe comic book art style adds to the humour and leads to a truly unique experience, in my opinion anyway. The jokes are pretty good, the story is detailed and presented in a way that makes you want to play through to the finish and see how the truly disastrous adventure ends. The varied environments add to the overall doomed feeling of the city and its damned inhabitants. The score was nice and really lended to the time period.\n\nA particular note of interest that I had were the many varied ways you could kill your foes and the animations they brought about. I loved how much detail was put into the game and how each of the more unique weapons had its own way of melting, burning or blasting enemies to puddles, ash or guts respectively.\n\nThis game is a riot and I had a great time with it. I would recommend this game to anyone even at full price. Also if you want a challenge try for the achievements, some of them are more nightmarish than a city full of blood thirsty undead.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","January 15","true","33.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

(and there are a lot)\n- you don't have a reliable melee attack to kill enemies. Kicking enemies only helps you get a few seconds to reload weapons. Unless you kick them into fire or off a rooftop. I guess that counts as melee kill?","May 1, 2015","true","19.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/322210/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Guns, Gore & Cannoli puts you in the stylish shoes of mobster Vinnie Cannoli. Residing in Thugtown during the 1920's, Vinnie soon finds himself in the middle of not only a zombie apocalypse, but a war between two mafia families. The game is a 2D side-scrolling shooter that is promised to be packed with action. The real question here, is whether or not this title is worth your time and money.\n\nThe hand-drawn graphics have a great comic style to them, and they're very pleasing to look at. There are vibrant colors abound, which off-set the overall noir style and tone of the game. Completing the 1920's gangster era vibe, the jazzy music is a classy touch that completes the overall immersion of the setting. However, there are relatively few enemies that you will encounter; although Vinnie does make a quip about this from time to time, noting that it feels like he's killing the same people over and over again. Oddly enough, the lack of foes does not hinder the game much, as the backgrounds and foregrounds are consistently changing to something new and fresh. That, and the amount of fire, bullets, and explosions pretty well cover up the bad guys anyway.\n\nWhen it comes to gamplay, Guns, Gore & Cannoli is pretty straightforward. There are copious amounts of weapons that you will acquire throughout the game; a shotgun, mini-gun, flamethrower, rocket launcher, and a magnum are just a very small amount of the large arsenal that you will come across. Likewise, not only do you have grenades at your disposal, but the ever-so-handy Molotov as well. All ammunition, with the exception of your starting handgun, is limited and you must be conservative of your bullets. Like your bullets, your health can also deplete rather quickly in a large swarm of zombies, and you can only heal by gobbling up delicious cannoli that is scattered throughout the levels; usually after a well placed checkpoint.\n\nThe game only clocks in at roughly 2 hours in the longevity department, and this is if you take your time to explore and kill as many enemies during your first run through as possible. This time frame is pretty well to be expected for most run-and-gun types, just be forewarned that this is not a title that will keep you entertained beyond one or two playthroughs at the most. The good thing is, is that there are multiple difficulties to try, and a very handy level selection menu in case you want to try out that new laser weapon at an earlier point in the game.\n\nAll in all, Guns, Gore & Cannoli is a fairly decent side-scrolling shooter. It takes a unique twist on the over-saturated zombie market of today, by throwing in some Italian gangsters, humor, and a nice plot twist at the end. For the two hours of play time, I wouldn't recommend grabbing this title at its full price, but on sale it's a definite steal. I didn't get the chance to check out the 4 player local co-op, but if you have some friends over they could make this game even more fun.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 25","true","2.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The four-hour campaign is fine. Why the negative review, then? Because there are currently very few of them, and they don't address my issues with the game and why I find it so annoying.\n\nLet's start with the good: the (cartoony) graphics are great, and the game is a pretty solid game, mechanically speaking. You have to go to the right killing every enemy in your way... or just running past them when the enemies just pile up and you are tired of replaying the same section. (Yes, sometimes I got bored and just ran to the next checkpoint as in a bad Call of Duty level.)\n\nWhat's my problem with it, then? Well, the game tries to be edgy... and fails. I'm not even criticizing how the game goes for a cartoony visual style that seems fit for kids but in a world where every headshot just blows a head clean off... No, the problem is that the waffer-thin story is not well told, just jumping from one cliché to another (Mobsters! Zombies! Your boss is Vito Corleone! There's a German mad professor!), and the main character is an amoral killing machine that is oblivious to what happens around him, and in the end he's even glad that everybody died because he made it out alive and with a lot of money. "Ha, ha, seems like a good plan!"\n\nDo you enjoy playing as somebody you don't like at all? I didn't enjoy Watch_Dogs because Aidan Pierce was a complete tool, but your mileage may vary. Also, the efficient but frankly annoying voiceover here goes for the most over-the-top Italian American clichés, and hearing how the main character named "Cannolli" enjoys eating "cannolli" to regain health got old immediately because no, it's not clever. Hey, but maybe none of this annoys you, you just skip the (longish) cutscenes and you don't care who you are shooting and why (first you just kill zombies, and then éven your own mob pals, because why not? Explaining what happened to them would take too much effort). "No, I don't care that it's so moronic, I just love mindless shooting." Well, here's some bad news, then: you can't just play this like you play Metal Slug.\n\nIf you expected to play this an old-school "just fire away" shooter, forget it... You have to be very aware of how much ammo you have and the next weapon you are using (the game just switches automatically and silently to another weapon that may not be too useful against the type of zombie you are currently fighting), because otherwise the zombies will run up to you, grab you (you can't jump away unless you kick them first) and then it's game over. Because of all the possible combinations of weapons and zombie types, sometimes the game feels like a puzzle and you have to be very careful.\n\nBut what you have to be most aware of is the timing when you reload. The game, for some reason, chooses to be realistic in its approach to reloading and it takes *really* long, which seems fair, I guess, but not really when you are reloading your pump-action shotgun one shell at a time and your walking Mafia stereotype just can't stop doing it and shoot away when he sees a zombie approaching, unlike any other shooter with pump-action shotguns in history.\n\nTL:DR:\n\n-It looks very good, but you may NOT like this game if you want a good story and mindless shooting.\n-Some aspects of the game are VERY annoying.\n-It has some great shooting mechanics, but the game is too punishing at times. You may like it a lot if you enjoy challenges.\n\nI think a demo would be quite useful for this game. But that's why we have Steam Refunds now, right?

It looks great, sounds great and has a nice theme (1920's zombie gangsters...) which it does really well. But it was the attention to detail that surprised me.\nIt's full of nice touches and it's clear that someone has really thought about how they want this game to play, then made it happen exactly.\nI've really enjoyed the storyline so far and been impressed by the voice acting (the main character reminds me of Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit!) The addition of new elements as the game progresses, combined with said storyline have kept me interested throughout, and the variety of enemies and level design have kept it challenging.\nIf you're in the mood for an Arcade Shoot-'em-up you could do a lot worse...\n\nFor a quick look at some gameplay, you could try this...\nhttp://youtu.be/YzG8MIgPLck","May 3, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

So far i finished it twice -  on Hard and Impossible, and second run was even more fun than the first one .\n\nPROS:\n- great art style: detailed backgrounds and nice animations - the longer i look at it, the more i like it.\n- good voice acting and dialogs.\n- nice story\n- nice set of weapons ( And everything is usefull - till the end of the game. Even the first handgun )\n- humour and movie references\n- local coop ( I didn't have a chance to try this feature yet, but it looks fun x4 :) )\n- CHALLANGING. Yeah, it's difficult. I started playing on 'Hard', and it was harder than i expected :p But finally after many, many failures i made it to the top. I also noticed that some spots spawn random enemies, so there is always something like 'element of suprise', even if you replay game on the same difficulty lvl.\n\nCONS:\nDon't know ... I can't really say to much negative about this game ( and i don't want to ), but ...\n- main character movements could be little bit faster - i just get used to platformers, where hero is more agile ...\nBut, hey - Cannoli not a ninja-commando ;)\n- campaign could be longer.

The gunplay is satisfying because every weapon is balanced to the point where any weapon can be used throughout the entire game. Enemy variety ties directly into gunplay, offering appropriate challenges without being OHKO bulletsponges. In other words, when I play Doom, I expect to walk into a room full of imps and pinky demons, and circle-strafe with the weapon of my choice until they are all dead.\n\nGuns, Gore, & Cannoli is not Doom, yet adopts its own sense of timelessness and “perfection” in its faithfulness to the SHUMP genre, as well as Crazy Monkey Studios’ commitment to quality presentation. Though lacking in secret rooms and power-ups, GG&C lasts long enough to provide a great experience in mayhem and gunplay, and I can easily see myself returning for higher difficulty and challenge runs (read: ACHIEVEMENTS). For fans of SHUMPs and video games in general, I would highly recommend GG&C. There isn’t much better out there, but there’s certainly a lot worse.\n\nFull Review at  Geeks Under Grace[www.geeksundergrace.com]","October 21, 2015","true","17.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It plays alot like Metal Slug is what I have heard from other people although I have never played a Metal Slug game before so I wouldn't know personally.\n\nRegardless though, the bloody and fast paced action, the good variety of satisfying to use weapons, the cartooney graphics,  the many (and I mean many) references to Mafia films and novels (The don of the crime family looks like Vito Corleone for crying out loud) and the overall satire of the game really helped to bring the game alive for me.\n\nI mean there is nothing quite like blowing the heads of a clustered group of 8 zombies with one shot from a double barrel shotgun in a beautiful looking shower of blood, guts and bits of zombie flying everywhere while the angry and extremely determined mafioso we have for a protagonist spouts a Goodfellas themed one liner to underline just how an over-the-top video game like this should be, FUN.

It plays like a cross between a Metal Slug game and the old arcade classic Rolling Thunder. I compare it to Rolling Thunder mostly because you can only shoot horizontally. While this seems a design flaw at first, it soon instead becomes an integral part of the gameplay that will greatly affect your tactics. Add in some fantastic hand-drawn art, voice, music (roaring 20s style) and sound and this is a gem of side-scrolling shooter. 12 levels that take about 20 minutes each deliver great value for the 7 quid I paid for it. It's hard in places but the check points are very liberally spread around so it rarely becomes frustrating. Highly recommended.\n\nEDIT: Just completed the game on Hard.

The game and its story is basically that you play as the mafia enforcer Vinnie Cannoli in the prohibtion time who is up against both rival gangs and hordes of different zombies aswell. The different enemies you are up against has different weapons and skills like some are fast runners and others are slow, some can be killed with one shot and others are more resistant and demands either more shots or with more heavy weaponry.\nThe gameplay is pretty much to get from point A to point B while blowing enemies and a few bosses  to kingdom come. In the gameplay sense this game isnt very  original but where the game really exceeds itself towards other platformers is in the graphics,soundtrack and comedic departments. The graphics is like taken out from a cartoon and eventhough some usable platforms sometimes blends into the surroundings it all works very well together as a live cartoon. The soundtrack is also very fitting to the game with its jazzy toons that is like taken from the time period of the prohibition. The comedy of this game is really funny as it is as stereotypical as it comes in regard of italian american mafia flicks and mr cannoli often comes with a kliche' one liners about the guy/zombie whom he just blew to smotherines.\nThis game had my attention from the first time i saw it but i wasnt sure it would live up to my expectations so i just bought it in the summer sale eventhough it wasnt really much reduced in prize and im really happy that i did that as this is a really great fun. Ive played platformers since sega master card system and on the amiga aswell so i have played my share of these types of games and this one is really great even at full prize. The only thing i can complaint a little about is the length of the game but still in my opinion its an acceptable one.\nIll rate this game 8.5 out of 10 and its very recommendable for all platform and cartoon and gangster fans with a love for over the top comedic violence and funny one liners.

But all is not well. Before Cannoli has time to get his bearings, the ship is awash with rotting lunatics. Best grab your guns and persuade these walking stiffs to a horizontal lifestyle!\n\nRight off the bat the monster design, the guns, and the atmospheric soundtrack grabs hold of you and refuses to let go. Every gun has a purpose, every mob a weakness; it's up to you to experiment and find out what works. For example: Try getting close to the hatchet-throwing zombies and use your sawed-off shotgun.\n\nNow for the problems (and there are a bunch). The game gets pretty frustrating due to its sparsely placed checkpoints and punishing game mechanics. One unlucky jump and you're right back where you started. This is an issue, especially on mouse and keyboard, since you'll be doing a lot of jumping in this game.\n\nThen there are the boss fights, which are just… tiresome. They break up the flow of the game for no apparent reason other than “here's a boss fight!”. And then you die. And have to start all over again.\n\nOkay, so here's a drinking game for ya: Take a shot every time you spot a stereotype or someone says the word “Cannoli”. You'll be drunk off your ♥♥♥ in no time.\n\nOn the bright side, I encountered one (count 'em, one!) bug in my entire playthrough. Twice, enemies got stuck in the scenery, and I kindly offered to pry them loose. With a shotgun blast to the unmentionables.\n\nTL;DR: If blasting zombies in a 1920's apocalypse sounds good to you, give it a go.","May 22, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One of their wifes was just here and she mentioned they are releasing a game at the end of the month."\nMy heart skipped a beat the moment that I found out that they are releasing a metal slug like game.\nThe NeoGeo was always a diamond for it's age. And Metal slug only kept his throne warm. It's good to see that Guns, Gore and Cannolli is giving me the same chills in their gameplay.\n\nI've always been a fan of the claeys brothers artwork. From everything I've seen, from posters, art work of their baby-announcement, they always put their heart and soul into everything they draw. And the art style within this game goes the same way.\nThe levels feel and breath anno 1920, though with alot of Z-apocalypse sause trown over it.\nIt's noticable that the levels are sometimes made out of the same toolsets. The same lorry from last level was blocking again my passthrough towards finding Frankie. But the variation of the levels don't make it feel far from repetitive.  You'll encounter the same foe a few times through every level, though as they've added a whole army of different zombies to butcher, you can live up to every challenge as if it's a new one.\n\nThe gameplay feels fluid, your character reacts as it should and the bullets fly whenever I feel like pushing the trigger. Through the whole playtrough, I never had a single glitch or death related to the keys that I've pressed. From time to time you can blow up a car and the doors will still twirl like a little ballerina bumping up to the garage door. But you'll only notice that once of twice in the whole game.\n\nThe soundtrack and the voice acting only enhances the fact that you're being pulled into the game. The nice Italian accent and the hand guestures only make you wanne go more to an italian and have some "good cannoli". The story isn't too deep, but you'll love the story just for it's humor. The oneliners they throw in once in a while add up to that. :)\n\nGameplay is very forgiving. You'll always end up at your last checkpoint on death, with the same armory and health when you last passed through. Zombies bite, but don't kill you instantly on normal difficulty. Going to harder modes you'll need to be skillfull to stay alive though. The difficulty can be changed any time, but I like the  "try till you finally survive" aproach alot more.\n\nThe game isn't too long. But it's very replayable and enjoyable. And for it's price, it's a bargain for it's quality.","May 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The music does an excellent job of connecting all the aspects of this game together, and tailors each section very well to what is happening on the screen. The theme of the game is less about the zombies, and more about a mafia gangster from that era in history, and you feel like a badass hitman striving to complete your mission. One thing to note is that while the game does offer a co-op option, there is no ease of access in how to add a player; there is no interface via steam, an no friends list. It's not as simplistic as it should be, which is a shame.\n\nThe weapons that you play with have weight behind them, with each weapon having strengths and weaknesses depending upon the enemy you are facing. There are also Molotov cocktails, flame throwers, and rocket launchers for more specialized attacks. I go over each individual weapon in the video summary, if you are interested in more details. The only issue I had with the weapons would be if the game offered upgrades to weapons to increase damage, accuracy, or reload time, which would encourage replay-ability.\n\nThe platforming is more basic, but not disrespectful to your time. The different elements within the world and the different themes of the maps fit in perfectly with what you were being asked to do. There are a multitude of save points and health so that you don't lose much progress when you die. Enemies will come from behind you, but nothing randomly or continuously spawns in, so you do feel a sense of progression. There is no fall damage, which can be beneficial when you fall, so you don't die, but also can be detrimental to the game, as when you knock a zombie off a building for example, you don't get to see them go 'splat'!\n\nThe story in the game is surprising; the cut-scenes and aesthetic does a good job of connecting you to the character. The voice acting as well does a good job of making you feel like a badass mafia enforcer who goes in to get the tough jobs done. It conveys a good sense of purpose with what you are doing.\n\nThe game give you action at a steady stream.The story isn't award winning, but is entertaining. The platforming and the weapons both give you a feeling of accomplishment and progression. The game does an excellent job of providing and excelling at what they promised, and it's an easy recommend.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","February 9","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have fully beaten the main campaign on the normal difficulty and though I did die quite a bit, It never put me at the point of quitting out of frustration.\n\nGameplay:	Although the game is 2D, the environment is quite explorable. I never had any issues with the height  of what I was shooting like many other platforming games do. There is limb damage meaning if you shoot them in the head, it'll be faster kill than shooting them in the foot. You start out with a basic pea shooter but vastly grow your arsenal of killing tools as the game progresses, adding a fresh touch to every level.\n\nGood Things:	- Amazing art style and animation\n- Progressive balanced difficulty\n- Controls feel good on both keyboard and controller (Which is fully compatible)\n- You gain new weapons as you progress through the the game\n- Local play on same system, 2 keyboards, 1 controller\n- Several different enemy types and Boss levels\n- Creative and clever story line. "Wow that ending..." - Jahn\n\nJust Things:	- Runs fairly easy (Non-high tier PC capability)\n- Settings for audio, control mapping, resolution etc.\n- Translating subtitles\n- Throughout the whole game enemy's attack you from both sides (left and right) which in the early stages I found a nuisance but learned to adapt after I found the Tommy gun\n- Humor that forces a grin but nothing that knocks you out of your chair with laughter\n\nNot So Good Things:	- No online multiplayer\n- Not too much replay value (I only played one playthrough, and it was very satisfying)\n- Pretty short\n- There is no way to jump down from a platform\n\nConclusion	Overall I would say this game is a good buy. 8.3/10 would cannoli again.","June 25, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

To accomplish your task you are going to have to sneak into ThugTown and find Frankie, there's only one small issue, it appears that something bad has happened to the people of ThugTown, and now they are all walking zombies.\n\nIn Guns, Gore & Cannoli, you will have to utilize your proficiencies with different guns to fight your way through wave upon wave of zombies, rival mobsters, mutant rats, and even the military. There are plenty of twists and turns in this game that will definitely keep you guessing.\n\nNow you might have noticed I mentioned guns, plural, that's because you will be handling pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and more. You just have to make sure you keep a good stock of ammo, if not you might find the path through ThugTown gets a little bit harder. Personally I liked to have the magnum with me, it has a tendency of taking off multiple heads as it tears through one victim to the next. You will also have grenades and molotov cocktails at your disposal, just to spice things up.\n\nThis was one of these games that definitely got my attention. It looks amazing, and it plays like many of the old school games that I grew up with. There was enough difficulty to keep things interesting,  and there was enough action to allow me to lose track of time.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with games that send wave upon wave of enemies at you is that they all look the same, and yes there was a stream of like faced individuals, but there was enough variety that I was never distracted. One of the main reasons was that different looking enemies actually attacked in different ways. You had the football player that would bull rush you, you had a butcher that would throw cutlery at you and then EXPLODE upon death, hell you even had leprechauns hanging upside down throwing toxic bottles while floating by on balloons.\n\nAnother thing that put a smile on my face was the witty comments that Vinnie added to the game from time to time, sure it did start to get a bit old with his "That's some GOOD Cannoli", but for the most part is sarcastic over the top badassery comments just seemed to flow right with the game.\n\nOh and did I mention that not only can you play this game solo, but you can bring along 3 of your friends. This to me puts the game over the top, we're talking about a game that allows more than one person to play the game on a single computer, and all of them kicking ♥♥♥ at the same time.\n\nThe only thing that made me sad was the fact that the game/story had to end. After almost playing through without wanting to stop, I need to find out what Vinnie is going to do next, or what he did in the past. I need more Vinnie action, and I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe we can see a sequel or prequel of this game because this game was above and beyond solid, and is needed on anyone's system. This game gets a 9.3 out of 10.","June 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a beautiful art style, and makes its levels very enjoyable to be in. The 1920's Prohibition-Era Chicago looks amazing, with several real world references (i.e. Capone's Soup Kitchen). The experience is mostly linear, with the only "exploring" being entering a door or window off the main path for ammo. The gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game, simple platforming elements in some segments, with linear 2D shooting being the main element. The basic keyboard controls were confusing at first, but you can customize the controls however you want. The story isn't much, but the few cutscenes are very polished and are filled with nice voiceovers of the characters. The protagonist is a mob enforcer, and he is can be sarcastic and makes several jokes throughout the game. The only real complaint I have, and it's only because I like this game so much, is I wish it was longer. This game is definitely worth your money.","June 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Amongst are favourites are not just the obvious Battletoads, Metal Slug, and Final Fight, Streets of Rage, TMNT, and X-men Arcade, but obscure classics like Spiderman: Maximum Carnage and The Punisher (to say nothing of Comix Zone and other single-player excellence). To say that we like our side-scrollers co-opy and button-mashy is an understatement.\n\nWe're also Italian and love Sopranos.\n\nSo Guns, Gore, Cannoli to us is pretty much the dream game, and aside from some rough edges — particularly level transitions and its weird spawning system — GGC proved to be a welcome return to form for a genre that has been largely neglected.\n\nThe corny story is actually very well executed, with nicely-voiced and drawn cinematics that break up the otherwise excellent gunplay and average platforming. The animation of the action, in particularly, is worthy of note; the flamethrower and electricity gun produce some very satisfying results. It all feels, plays, and looks very Metal Slug-ish.\n\nPiece by piece, you can easily tear apart the game's mechanics — nothing is really best-in-class here — but the parts are very much greater than the whole.\n\nGiven that, it's not hard to recommend GGC if you're at all a fan of the side scroller and have a bunch of bros or broads to help you fight the good fight.","July 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

When I was done standing in one place at the very start, right after starting new game and shooting that M1911, reloading, shooting some more, reloading, shooting even more observing brass eject and marvelling at how detailed and awesome reload animations and sounds(!) are..I was wondering how do I aim. Figured the game was about to walk me through, first basic movements then the rest. But as I played, I couldn't move my aim. Is this how it was supposed to be, or am I missing something? I mean, when I watched the trailers I didn't pay attention, I was just expecting some kind of aiming, since there is shooting involved, right? When I realized I can't, I thought that maybe all the aiming is based on positioning yourself accordingly, depending on where you want to hit; body or head. I thought I fell on my head, but I didn't see any other way of aiming left.\nDespite all this confusion, and being unable to decide what to think at first, I absolutely love how the game looks, plays, and sounds. And just to add one more thing; this game is about the second one I've ever seen to take weapon reloading animations more seriously than just SLAP! There, done! being a 2D sidescroller. Maybe most people pay no attention, I don't know but after Spec Ops: The Line I thought I won't see weapon animations receive that much love, as they get in 1st person shooters for a while. To find animations of guns that beautiful and detailed in a 2D sidescroller was the biggest surprise, and a very pleasant one. For that, I salute the whole development team, including the sound department - hell of a job.\nLastly, the only reason I would voice my concern of aiming, and bother anyone reading was because I couldn't see my role in deciding where I want my shots to go. I'm talking here about headshots mainly. Honestly, I was sad that it seems the only way to get headshots was "like this", especially since they're so well done and satisfying and I'm one of those who hates Aim assist. Of course, there is none in this game, but leaving my left hand unfulfilled with nothing to do but left mouse button to shoot only makes me a little bit sad. Other than that, brilliant game!","May 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The harder enemies require either a specific weapon to effectively kill them or a specific tactic. The movements and sections seem somewhat repetitive but it's a side scrolling game and I don't think that could be any other way. The way the developer changes up the enemies from one climbing stair section to the next or changes obstacles around, makes each step new.\n\nI found this game pretty addictive the first time I played it and it was 3 a.m. on a work night before I felt like stopping. The game has a decent checkpoint layout and that makes it seem like bite-sized segments and I wanted to keep going. My only complaint about the game is that it is difficult to change directions quickly, especially when crouched and surrounded by fast moving zombies.\n\nOverall the game beats the old 80's side-scrolling games that I used to play in the arcade. I even found an old friend from the 80's in the game as well when I saw R2-D2 next to a trashcan in the foreground of an early level.

When I was done standing in one place at the very start, right after starting new game and shooting that M1911, reloading, shooting some more, reloading, shooting even more observing brass eject and marvelling at how detailed and awesome reload animations and sounds(!) are..I was wondering how do I aim. Figured the game was about to walk me through, first basic movements then the rest. But as I played, I couldn't move my aim. Is this how it was supposed to be, or am I missing something? I mean, when I watched the trailers I didn't pay attention, I was just expecting some kind of aiming, since there is shooting involved, right? When I realized I can't, I thought that maybe all the aiming is based on positioning yourself accordingly, depending on where you want to hit; body or head. I thought I fell on my head, but I didn't see any other way of aiming left.\nDespite all this confusion, and being unable to decide what to think at first, I absolutely love how the game looks, plays, and sounds. And just to add one more thing; this game is about the second one I've ever seen to take weapon reloading animations more seriously than just SLAP! There, done! being a 2D sidescroller. Maybe most people pay no attention, I don't know but after Spec Ops: The Line I thought I won't see weapon animations receive that much love, as they get in 1st person shooters for a while. To find animations of guns that beautiful and detailed in a 2D sidescroller was the biggest surprise, and a very pleasant one. For that, I salute the whole development team, including the sound department - hell of a job.\nLastly, the only reason I would voice my concern of aiming, and bother anyone reading was because I couldn't see my role in deciding where I want my shots to go. I'm talking here about headshots mainly. Honestly, I was sad that it seems the only way to get headshots was "like this", especially since they're so well done and satisfying and I'm one of those who hates Aim assist. Of course, there is none in this game, but leaving my left hand unfulfilled with nothing to do but left mouse button to shoot only makes me a little bit sad. Other than that, brilliant game!","May 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Get it if you enjoy Metal Slug and the like but only get it if it's on sale, I don't recommended it at the current price cause, besides being too short, it doesn't have online multiplayer which is a must for these types of games in this day and age.\n\nI enjoyed the art-style, the high-res 2D graphics and animation, the 20s/30s theme and loved the music -tho it might get repetitive for some at some point- the variety of weapons is a plus, tho the way you change between them is unintuitive when you have many and in several occasions it can get you killed, 'juggling' through 'em all. There's different types of enemies, you fight more than zombies. On hard mode it proves challenging in many areas, especially cause of the AI which I really liked, I'm specially talking about the living ones, they sure do have more 'tricks' than moving forward and shooting and even then, there's also variety for the dead ones. I enjoyed the writing and the voice acting, the story is cliché and filled with Italian stereotypes which isn't surprising given the title but surprisingly it does have zombified, drunk leprechauns so for that reason alone you should get this game! A first in any genre, game of the millennium material right there.\n\nReally looking forward to Crazy Monkey Studios & Claeys Brothers' next game.","August 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Especially in Local Coop the game is a blast. Well done!","August 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Probably best played in co-op I however spent it on single player and still had a fun go of it. It's a fun little gem that I suggest picking up...just maybe on a sale.

The main idea is solid enough, and starts out as a light hearted platform shooter, but quickly becomes annoying and poorly designed, and if I'm honest very repetitive.\n\nThe art style, and voice acting are very nice, but the ideas become tiresome very quickly.  The game took a massive nose dive off a cliff when you had to kill a monster rat as the end of level boss.

It has to be nervous and tight. These games tend to be focused on reflexes, jump trajectories, shooting timing, like a shoot'em up with gravity. Guns, Gore & Cannoli is nothing like that.\n\nBelieve it or not, with its badass lines, it's cartoonish look, and its promotional videos pumped with action... this game feels and plays more like a survival platformer where you can jump really high than an action game.\n\nEvery weapons has to be reloaded. Its not just the counterpart to the infinite ammo of the basic small gun, you have to watch out for your clips so you don't get caught reloading with zombies on you. You only have so much ammo for each gun at any given moment, so you have to keep swapping weapons to keep a steady output of damage going on. Most weapon are only effective if you shoot the head (double damage)... but you can't aim, so you're constantly trying to kick enemies or jump up slopes to level your gun sight with the enemies' heads. You can't really outrun the running mobs, so each time they run on you while you reload, you have to run for a long time before safely turn back and shoot them. And when monsters manage to get a grab on you, you can only jump at the minimum height, you keep being stunned, and since it bumps your avatar sideways, your aim changes accordingly, making you shoot the ceiling instead of the enemies.\n\nThe only working approach I could think is to walk carefully, take on small groups of enemies, always retreat when run onto, handle each situation separately and spare ammo so that you don't run out of it. This is NOT how a run and gun should be played, but that's the only way I can think of playing that game.\n\nSo in the end I COULD recommend this survival gory game, but the physics are bumpy as hell. You don't lose life because the game is hard, you lose life because controls are hard.\n\nIt's not very expensive though, so if you want to prove me wrong, be my guest and try it for yourself.","May 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 14 of 43 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","14","43","2","14"

Guns, Gore & Cannoli takes 2D Action Side Scroller Shooting into a next level. Although a bit slow-paced and lacks on the variety of boss battles, the graphics look great, the details on the guns and their reloading animations are just straight up sexy, the ammo management feels realistic, the cutscenes provide immersive experience into the story, and the classy music brings you back into the history of mobs and gangsters.

I have played it for over 20 hours, on every difficulty (see my achievements for more). I have not played multiplayer as my Friends do not play, but would love to.\n\n*Overall: I like this game so much I believe it is worth the purchase price, and certainly any sale price. I would hope to see a sequel! Perhaps the [Int 20; Wis 3] Professer returns for revenge...\n\nThe gameplay is great although completed within 4 hours, thankfully containing very minimal bugs. (The only annoying one is rare, and involves the player or AI getting "stuck" in mid-jump when adjacent to objects.)\nThe gameplay is exciting, raw (have you heard the zombies screaming pitifully when you incinerate them?!), action-packed but not wild, and expectedly there are only the simplest puzzles to solve.\nThe artstyle and graphics are really vivid and detailed. I personally enjoy this style a lot. For example, when the zombie sprinters die, they have this look of almost pain and sadness, and I briefly feel bad for killing a once-father-of-four, if but only briefly.\nThe design is creative yet refined, and thoughtful. The levels are challenging; the weapons are sufficient in type and quantity as well as being "DOTA Hero-like" (each having distinct strengths and weaknesses); the enemies are likewise fun, varied enough, and well-placed; the bosses are great but FAR too difficult on the Impossible setting - so I suppose the setting name fits.\nI could go on but if my review hasn't interested the reader thus far...\nThanks for a great game Claeys Brothers Arts!\n","April 29","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
