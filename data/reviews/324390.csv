This makes no sense, at all.\nThis game is not a metroidvania so don't be fooled by that, while there are rooms connected between each other that's not what makes a game a metroidvania in ANY WAY.\nThis game it's an action adventure full of puzzles and with a funny (even if not that innovative to be honest) mechanic, you can swap your body between human like manikins to resolve puzzles and go further in your adventure.\nYour mission it's to depure a scientific plant.\nAnd this is all about the story for now, let's talk more about the game, shall we?\n\nGraphically the game does not offer anything special, the enemy models are color swaps of the same 4 so no variety under this aspect and the scenarios textures are almost nonexistent, of course this could be the developers' choice after all.\nThe musics tracks are few and you are probably going to easily forget there's any music at all, aside for the "battle theme" wich is a 10 seconds theme repeated until the battle ends, really.\nStory wise the game does not offer anything special, sure it's still in alpha stage but i expected something more than "you are there to fix the mess, bye", after all this is adventure game and the story, at least in my opinion, is really important.\nControls are really messy sometimes and the aiming is a real problem, you get no crosshair aside for the "laser" but that does not help that much, maybe that's just a matter of practice but when you are doing the "light balls" puzzles not knowing where you are actually aiming makes these puzzles really frustrating sometimes.\nThe dodge is basically a barrel roll and after a patch you can do it pressing left or right two times, surely easier than before.\nThat and the realoading wich makes you really slow for like 3 seconds makes some battles really hard (and it's not a bad thing) and frustrating in some cases (and this is bad).\nPuzzles are really easy, in fact the only way to waste time on it is to die because of some glitch (like the deaths sometimes happen in the "mirror rooms") or because enemies hit your uncontrolled character throwing it into the red water killing it without any way to save it, sure you need to be alert so maybe it's just a way to punish you if you get distracted, maybe.\nYou can't save your game whenever you want, the game saves automatically so if the save it's far away from the point of your death... well you got the idea right?\nI guess this is another discutible choice, not everyone loves such a thing in fact.\nThe map it's so small and there's no way to enlarge it and this makes it. most of the time, completely useless.\n\n\nThis is my opinion (for now) about The Body Changer, the game is still in alpha but, to be honest, i haven't seen much changes from the old alpha.\nThe game has been released for less than a week on Steam so the developers have plenty of time to fix some things still, for now and for the price asked, this game it's a No for me.\nIf you still want to buy it you have to know about something, the game does not have an ending yet, infact when you get to the fifth depurator you can't go further (and that's half of the game).\nSo yes you are paying for half of game for now.\nThis is all I've got to say for now, i'm probably going to change my review if something big changes or maybe when the game comes out of Early Access just in case.\nUntil then.","October 19, 2014","false","10.4"," 344 of 378 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","344","378","4","14"

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big graphics guy. I can easily dig a good game with retro style graphics like Shovel Knight that pays good homage to its era. In comparison, TBC just looks dated (gaming circa 2002) and has probably the ugliest use of cel shading I've ever seen. The game's atmosphere feels sterile void of any charm or interest. And the audio? Completely forgettable, I don't remember a single tune from the game, granted most of the playtime is with the Desura build so this may have changed with the Steam release but from my brief testing, the game appears unchanged from its most recent build on Desura.\n\nThe gameplay isn't much better. The controls are ultra clunky and the combat reminds me slightly of the old PS2/XBox horror game Cold Fear but have action games come a long way since then and honestly Cold Fear already did it better. The puzzles are easy and occasionally well crafted but don't feel substantial enough to carry the game. It feels like the game was trying to be a mix of something cerebral like Portal and while having action similar to Resident Evil 4 but fell completely flat in both regards.   If a developer is going to price their game at the level of some of the 2 year old AAA games, it should be able to hold its own. No, I'm not expecting AAA quality from an indie developer, but the pricing falls in the premium range as far as indie products go therfore I expect something good. This game is far from the indie cream of the crop. TBC fails miserably in many areas and it's simply just not fun to play.\n\nI'm glad I won my copy in the winter auction for far less than the regular price. At regular price, the game is far too boring and unpolished to be worth the $$$. There's some honest hard effort evident in this game but good effort is not enough reason to give a recommendation. At least, the game seems to launch more stable in its Steam release, I had to jump through hoops to get the game to simply load through Desura. In comparison I tried loading the game 3 times in Steam and it loaded perfectly each time.\n\nI could comment of the developers' behavior regarding bundle buyers but I won't delve too much into that area. I will say this: the gaming consumer base does not take kindly to censorship. The developers will have to learn how to better handle criticism of their product or for any of the choices they make. Deleting comments and censoring the issue simply doesn't help or resolve anything. I'm not one of the people who expect a Steam key from Desura games so this incident did not affect my choice in not recommending this game. I solely judged the game on its merits (or lack thereof) to give my rating.\n\nKeep in mind this is an Early Access game, things could improve in the future and if they do improve I will be willing to re-visit the game and change my recommendation if the game warrants it. As it remains now, the game is a mess and not one I can recommend.","December 19, 2014","false","1.4"," 248 of 272 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","248","272","4","3"

It's a 3D, character changer puzzler with shooter elements. Think 3rd person Gobliiins with guns.\n\nI have a limited amount of playtime on Steam, but keep it mind I had the game on Desura from my previous purchase and had played it before.\n\nThe game is still in early alpha and it shows, very much. Controls and movements are sluggish, graphics are very bland and sterile (the washed out cell shading effect doesn't do it for me), and in my case the game wouldn't even start without completely deactivating audio. The default controls aren't well thought of either and you will find yourself frustratingly deactivating panels while trying to change character. You are thrown into the game with no real explanation but a few engrish lines of text as you go on, teaching you the bare minimum. The atmosphere felt dull, and I got no real entertainment factor. There's a reason no one is playing the game, including those who provided such good reviews.\n\nI understand that the game is currently in Early Access, actually it has been in alpha state for nearly 3 years, and I'd be happy to revisit this review if I'm told that any significant improvement has been made regarding these issues.\n\nThere's also the fact that communications between the developers and the community has been less than stellar, their choice of providing only a subset of their previous customers with a Steam copy of the game they bought, and deleting negative comments on both Steam's community hub and the Desura game page. (Some of those comments were downright nasty but there was also legitimate criticism that got deleted.)","December 26, 2014","false","3.1"," 131 of 150 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","131","150","6","169"

I tried running it on my really bad 2gb netbook and I was able to get a solid 30fps.\n- can run on a gaming rig and still look half-decent. Cel-shaded art doesn't need to look super detailed.\n\nCons\n- clunky combat. I'd prefer to dodge-roll with Q or E. Double-tapping A and D in the middle of a fight is really tricky!\n- The first level requires you to do some MAJOR backtracking to pick up an item. Literally; most of my time in this game was spent trying to figure this out.\n- clunky Synb/item switching switching system. I feel an action wheel would work better than opening up a separate UI.\n- You can switch to a Synb in a different level. This is really cool, but I haven't seen the feature used in-game at all. I think it would be cool if you had to use a Synb stuck in another level to activate a switch to progress. (This may be me being an idiot, but what do I know? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n- ALL OF THE ACHIEVEMENT NAMES ARE IN ALLCAPS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.\n- Personally, I feel that a top-down view with RTS-style controls would work really well for this game. It would certainly make the game easier to play without taking away from the challenge.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is definitely in its' early stages of development and absolutely needs more polish. In its' current state, it's definitely not worth $20. However, the game's concept is definitely there. When I finally finished the first level, I was on top of the world. I wish the devs the best in making their dream game!","June 9, 2015","false","1.8"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","45","58","6","0"

It is not a metroidvania game. Even given the limited grasp of English displayed by some of the text in game the devs should know what a metroidvania is: gaming is a universal language.\n\nThe game itself is a pedestrian (almost literally, given the slow speed you move, even using the run button) character-switching puzzler. If you played Head over Heels in 1987 you know the kind of thing.\n\nThe game is too expensive for what it is. If it's 75% off or more and you like this kind of "get the first guy to stand on this pressure pad, move the 2nd guy to here, unlock this door, come back with the 1st guy..." kind of stuff then feel free, but I can't give the game a positive recommendation based on its price and features at the moment.","December 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","27","49","0","0"

It didn't crash on me. It wasn't too bad to play. It downright functions, unlike 50% of the games on Steam, including some of the brand new shiny, fancy AAA games.\n\nMan, tho, srsly...\n\nEverything being said, the game isn't friggin' terrible. I might play it all the way through because of this fact actually, on the other hand...\n\nYou know when you meet an attractive person?\n\nBut then they're really mean, and it makes them seem way less attractive than you thought they were at first? That's kiiiiiiiiiiiinda what the developers of this title did.\n\nOkay, maybe that's a bad analogy..You know when you meet your favorite band?\n\nBut then MC Chris is a jerk to you and you can't really listen to his music anymore, because even though you totally love everything he made, his jerk attitude that he had that ONE time when you met him totally ruins it for you? This game is like that, only without the good music.\n\nSo what I'm saying is...\nThis game is probably better than what I think it is because of the developers' interactions with the gaming community by failing to extend a common friggin' courtesy to their player base after bothering all of us for Greenlight votes. No, people aren't entitled to a free game.

Regardless, I gave it a try. And I will say I am impressed. The game was made by 2 people, and I was honestly shocked they could pull it off.  This game is full is puzzling scenarios and fun adventures. The story is a bit clunky, but I think the gameplay really makes the game what it is. The controls are good with a controller, which for me personally is a huge plus. This game has been tailored to what the community suggested. I can even run this on my bad laptop. Not just that, but the graphics are great! And the graphics are a new-style unlike I've seen before. It's weird, cool, and ascetically pleasing in a way.I'll be honest to say it's not the best game ever, but it's above ok, FOR SURE! Last but not least, the game isn't the longest game ever, but I'm sure that'll change. If you are looking for a game that requires strategy, and a truly unique experience, pick this game up if YOU fell it looks good :) But if you don't have a controller, the keyboard controls are difficult, for $20 it's not a bad buy, but apparantly more levels and such are being added, so you may want to pick this up!\n\nScore: 7.5/10","October 18, 2014","true","1.8"," 258 of 522 people (49%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","49","258","522","5","143"

Having to change bodies at the right time to solve the various obsticles adds a whole new element of difficulty making the game very challenging. Pretty horrible watching from a distance as one of your bodies gets mauled by a couple of zombies. But the auto save feature once you make it to a certain point means you don't have to replay to much of the same thing over. Still learning the controls a bit so hoping to improve a bit and get further in the game.","October 24, 2014","true","3.5"," 13 of 150 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","13","150","0","0"

The game focuses around the mix of puzzles with different elements, combat and the ability to switch characters with different abilities (and on different locations) to solve those puzzles. IMO it started out a bit slow, but from chapter 3 on I really had a lot of fun. The combat itself sometimes requires techniques to win, simple shooting won't always win. The puzzles are never unfair, yet sometimes challenging.\n\nI am running this game with a AMD X2 4000+ with a ATI 4670 (toaster) and I could still run it on medium graphic settings without bigger problems.Only 1 passage with a lot of combat gave me FPS drops, but still playable. (with lower graphic settings no issue)\n\nThe game still has a lot to do imo. More content ofc and some optimization, and maybe it will develop its full potential, although I am not so sure about that since it has only 2 devs. As full potential I mean not just a working game that delivers, but also does some extra, like better told story, voice dubbing and maybe a coop one day. This would be a nice plus.\n\nIn general I see the devs are going into the right direction. They quickly answered to bug reports and fixed them so far.\nAs the game is atm I give it a 7/10.","October 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 20 of 178 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","20","178","0","0"

The awesome graphics and textures remind me of jet set radio. Been playing the game since it was launched on desura, and I've witnessed how it has evolved significantly with every update. The title "Body changer" is awesome due to the fact you can change bodies or SynB's to complete some tasks. Each Synb has it its own characteristics and attributes which can be distinguished by their colors. The atmosphere feels like a space base in a distant planet, where your character has to take control of the base and try to maintain it stable before it becomes damaged from an unstable contaminated atmosphere. Love the fact that this game was made as a third person perspective, kind of missed those and hope to see more 3rd person games released in the near future.\n\nThe developer team has been in contact with me since I've been playing it on desura where I could let them know about my feedback and if I saw some bugs during gameplay. The game has some way to go since its in early access, but from the updates I've seen, I know the game will be worth it in the end due to its huge potential. I can't wait to see the future updates for the game and future game releases from the team.","October 17, 2014","true","3.6"," 19 of 175 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","19","175","0","0"

The art-style choice creates a nice atmosphere, and is still detailed. I do not like it when cell-shading is used as a crutch but this doesn't feel like that at all. I really enjoy the game-play a lot, and I like the puzzles. They are well thought-out, and are difficult enough to be fun without being completely bonkers (like some other games where you have to combine a rubber-duck, rubber-band, paper-clip, and a piece of gum, so that you can pick up a key from rail-road tracks). The 30 minutes I have played on STEAM has been awesome, but I have also already played the game a lot on Desura. For those who might see that 0.5 hours and be like "wait you've barely played it".\nIf you enjoy good adventure/puzzle games, and you like to have some action to go with it, then I believe you will have a lot of fun with The Body Changer.\nPlease keep in mind that it is Early Access, so this is NOT a finished game but it already plays well with the content that is there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/r3trosim/recommended/324390/","r3trosim","MKS | R3troSim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/r3trosim/","371 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Body Changer is a genuinely intriguing blend of genres: at its core, it's a third person puzzle metroidvania game. But then it also splashes in some tense action gameplay alongside for you to experiment with (and these scenes are pretty tense). The challenges get progressively harder as you complete the objectives, and you get to tinker about with more guns & gadgets as well. And that's before we get onto the fantastic 'body-switching' mechanic - which adds that extra bit of ingenuity to make it a really fun game.\n\nIt also provides a solid return to the metroidvania genre* (see below). Expect to be racking your brains to figure out the puzzles, going back on yourself, finding objects which you just can't quite lay your hands on ;)\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the backdrop story and notably the art-style, which help provide an authentic, other-worldy (and eerie) atmopshere.\n\nSo it has a lot of potential, and with its open-minded devs, hopefully the ideas streaming in from players should be realised to a great standard. I am not trying to over-hype this game (which is a bad thing!), but it really does show a lot of promise, and does a lot of things well.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Original blend of mechanics. Puzzle, action, themes from survival horror even. All encompassed by its evident dedication to the metroidvania genre.\n+ Brilliant 'body-switching' mechanic. A lot of realised potential for this.. but there's more that's waiting to be explored with this I'm sure ;)\n+ Great devs (only two of them as well!). They have a growing workload, yet they still remain in constant contact with their players. In my personal experience, they have only ever listened and acted on my feedback.\n(Not directly to do with the game content, but hopefully should turn the faces of anyone put off by the 'Early Access' label)\n+ Art-style is subjective to opinion (we might see some discussions arise in its Early Access stage), but I think it suits very well.\n+ Weirdly eerie. Atmospheric and even frightening at the right times (there's that survival horror coming in!).. Decent SFX\n+ Challenging puzzles & sticks true to metroidvania genre. You work out the puzzle (yes, it might be difficult!), and be prepared to go back on yourself a few times (a key mechanic of the metroidvania genre)\n\nThe Bad:\n- Slightly clunky combat mechanics. These I'm sure will get a lot attention though.\n- Environments could be a bit more .. pretty. In its current state. Minimalist world does suit though (complements the cel-shaded art-style).\n- Some game progression bugs.\n- UI needs a lot of work.\n- Some QA (Quality Assurance) issues (relatively minor stuff though).\n- Game could be longer (with more varied puzzles/combat sequences)... although it is by no means unimpressive at its current completion time (devs have said they are working on adding more levels).\n- *EDIT: In my view, I would call this a solid metroidvania title.. however having read other reviews, some might think it doesn't do enough to earn that title. The game is likely to evolve more though to suit that genre if you felt it doesn't quite cut it.\n- EDIT: Price. I would have imagined this as more of a below £10 (approx. $15) range title.\n\nAll in all though, this for me has been one of the most interesting games I've played for a while. Its setup very well by this original blend of mechanics, as well as reintroducing a dedicated and fitting return to the metroidvania genre.\n\nThe devs are great too - and rest assured you will be listened to! (Of course they are also very busy - but they have shown nothing but passion to deliver on this project!)\n\nAnd yes.. I have temporarily renamed my display name in respect to the devs and the game :)\n\nEDIT: So having looked back at this review (and also after getting some downvotes), I hope I haven't over-hyped the game and made it seem like something more than it is (in its current state). I do have a lot passion for this game, and I genuinely believe it will be something great -- but some people might not be satisfied with, for example, the 'metroidvania' stamp, or the actual innovation behind the mechanics.\n\nI stand by what I've said - because the bottom-line is I do love the game, and I have faith in the devs - but I can understand if people feel it's not cutting it for them. Of course - it is still Early Access, and definitely only *half-finished* at the moment. The devs have stated that they are working on adding more (interesting) levels, and I think there hasn't been a game like this on the market for a little while, at least not presented like The Body Changer has.\n\nThanks for reading anyway :)","October 19, 2014","true","14.4"," 12 of 149 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","12","149","0","3"

Think of it as Lost Vikings in third person. You control several characters (mainly 2 or 3) each with a limited set of abilities and inventory, and need all of them to solve puzzles. But you can sometimes swap items (such as keycards) with other characters too. Combat feels okay, the weapons are a bit generic but work like expected. I also like the new arena modes that you unlock after completing the sectors, it intensifies the action element of the game. Overall, it's a solid mix of puzzles and action that has a lot of potential.","December 6, 2014","true","1.8"," 8 of 137 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","8","137","0","0"
