Played a lot of it on PSP back a few years ago but never actually owned the game until now. Nice artstyle and fun zelda-esque gameplay. The game also runs locked at 30fps (I think but im not entirely sure) so if you're the kind of person that wines about 30fps then you might want to hold out until someone unlocks the framerate. Otherwise Gurumin is A cheap, fun RPG from the creators of Ys. Pick it up if you're a fan of Zelda or games like it.\n\nThe game has a pretty choppy/weird performance for a lot of people (including me). Its annoying at times but it isn't much of a bother. (However if this is something that bothers you, You might want to wait for a patch or a mod that fixes it or try turning off Vsync. Which fixed the problem for a lot of people)\n\nEDIT: A little side note. The game has trading cards marked in the steam store, However the game does not have any trading cards at the moment. They'll probably be added in a few days or so though.\n\nEDIT 2: The game has recieved an update which adds WASD to the control scheme.\n\nTL;DR - Fun Zelda-like game. However is held down by Questionable control scheme and 30fps lock.\n8/10","March 30, 2015","true","7.8"," 70 of 88 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","70","88","3","2"

Forcing AA & 16x AF on your control panel is also recommended.\n\nThe controls are responsive, and simple to use.\nYou simply go around Hack 'n' Slashing your enemies to the beat of the music with combos, while going through simple platforming and puzzles. Please bare in mind that when this game first came out, there was no xinput. Although gamepad support was added by Mastiff, you might need to configure your controller with the game config.\n\n***But I can confirm that with a 360 controller or wrapper, you shouldn't need to do anything besides changing [Show Forward] & [Show Enemy] to the Stick Buttons.\n\nThe music was created by the Falcom Sound Team jdk internal band, which also made the original soundtracks for most of their releases (Ys series, The Legend of Heroes series, et cetera). So you can expect a great listen all throughout the game.\n\n\nA must have for any ARPG lover, or Falcom fan.","March 31, 2015","true","6.3"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","42","48","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/322290/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Looking at the box art of Gurumin, one may simply pass the game off as a simple, average children's adventure game. It's important to remember just how deceiving looks can be. Because behind the art of the adorable red-haired girl, and her equally cute monster friends, is an adventure game developed by the fine people who brought us the Ys RPG series. An adventure game that should be well worth your time...\n\nWhile the Ys series has a fairly small following, the existing fans may find a few quirky connections between Gurumin and the Ys games. The star of Ys is a red-headed girl named Parin who enjoys a good adventure. The game states that Parin is the daughter of two very famous adventurer parents who were known for exploring ruins. Likewise, Ys starred a red-headed adventurer named Adol, who later on in the series did have a red-haired child. So it seems like the game is insinuating that Parin is supposed to be the daughter of Adol.\n\nWhen the game starts, you meet a lost Parin as she enters Tiese Town and looks for her grandfather's house. Parin was sent to live with her grandfather while her parents are out excavating an ancient ruin. You soon meet grandpa Hyperbolic (that's his name, no kidding) and find out that he's also the Mayor of the town. Tiese Town is boring and Parin finds out that there are no children her age for her to play with. So she sets out looking for someone to talk to and something to do, and she runs into a little girl cornered in by a barking dog. Parin butts the dog out of the way, and then discovers that the cute girl she's just saved is actually a monster. Yes, a monster - her name is Pino. You'll be invited inside the Monster Village, which is located in a secret warp behind a wall in your town, and you'll meet a host of other "monsters".\n\nYou'll befriend the cute little guys and the game will pick-up from here on. You'll embark on your first journey through a ruin, as you'll have to go off and find Pico's brother Puku. Before you set off, you'll be given your primary weapon, which is a mysterious drill shrouded with untapped powers. Once you find Puku, the evil leader of the phantoms named The Prince appears and destroys Monster Village. The Prince threatens to disturb the balance of the world and here is where the story officially starts. As you progress throughout the game you'll be able to enhance the powers of your weapon by attaching elemental properties to it, or adding new moves to your arsenal.\n\nFrom the start you'll have a drill power gauge which will be used to measure the strength of your attacks. If you're at perfect health and using your weapon every chance you get, then the gauge will stay full and your attacks will be at their full potential. Likewise, when your gauge is full, you'll also be able to fire a projectile from your drill. If any of this sounds familiar, that's because it's similar to what Zelda's done in the past.\n\nAnother featured inspired by Zelda is Parin's charge attack, except there are three different levels that Parin can unleash. The gauge is broken into three bars, so the longer you charge the gauge, the stronger the attack; if you charge it to the fullest, Parin will perform a powerful drill attack as she hurls herself forward. When you're attacking normally, you'll be able to pull of a number of different combos - most of which you'll learn as you progress.\n\nThe game will take you through a variety of different "dungeons", and you'll be required to jump over obstacles, unlock doors, move boxes, solve a few puzzles, and other common basics you often see in adventure games of this type. One of the neater aspects to Gurumin is that you'll be able to cross large gaps by performing a chain-attack in midair that'll move you from one enemy to the next, until you reach the platform.\n\nNo adventure is complete without the ability to purchase upgrades, and Gurumin has that covered too. You can purchase new accessories, but you can also upgrade them, as well. The game relies on collecting not just coins, but also junk parts that a merchant named Disk will use to enhance your equipment with. Likewise, you'll be able to purchase parts and oil for your drill from Cylinder, the town skeeve. And of course, let's not forget the token heal shop; in this case, pastries are what will heal you - cookies and cakes.\n\nThere's a lot to love about Gurumin, despite its simple nature. It's unusually addictive, and the scope of the game seems to get larger and larger the more you play it. Moreover, the game also rewards you with some pretty cool mini-games, secret modes, hidden characters, and secret costumes - so there's quite a bit to unlock.\n\nVisually, Gurumin is nothing amazing, which was to be expected considering that the game had been previously released in 2004 for Japanese PCs. But there's certainly nothing bad about the graphics either. The characters are extremely simple looking, and are probably PSOne caliber at best. The environments, on the other hand, look quite nice. Architecture sports good looking, sharp textures and you'll notice this during the game's cut-scenes. Gurumin also features a dose of environmental interactivity, which will allow you to destroy most of the objects planted around you - in turn, you'll pick up coins and other items. Frame rate is pretty consistent, and the game doesn't have any major visual issues. It looks a bit on the simple side, but it's got a lot of charm and gets the job done well.\n\nBelieve it or not, a standout category for Gurumin is actually its audio. The game delivers a fantastic soundtrack that is precisely the kind a traditional adventure game should have. Infectious melodies compose the soundtrack, and every one of the tunes is as good as the next. On top of that, the game comes complete with voiceovers done by a cast of voices that are no strangers to the role. If that doesn't sound convincing, Kris Zimmerman was the supervising director for the voice-acting...Mr. Zimmerman is also the voice director for the Metal Gear Solid series, Dead Rising, Socom, and God of War II. So let's just say this man knows his craft.\n\nEven though Gurumin borrows quite a bit from other notable adventure games like Zelda, it's still got a soul of its own and a unique charm that few games possess. It's heartwarming in every way, but also an incredibly satisfying experience that fans of the genre absolutely must look into. If you can get past the fact that your main character is a 12 year old girl, you'll find a splendid game in Gurumin. There's a lot to unlock and discover, and the adventure itself will run you around 10-15 hours. Despite being visually simple, Gurumin sounds wonderful with an ensemble cast of voice-overs and an infectious soundtrack. An adventure fan should pick up a copy of Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure, you'll be happy that you did.","November 24, 2015","true","11.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","31","37","2","0"

The game's environments and BGM are quite relaxing, as you wander about the town, helping characters solve their problems. The voice dub is competent, if goofy in a way, and the characters are very well-drawn and animated. The art is very well done. Almost all of the various headgear and costumes you acquire along the way fit Parin rather nicely.\n\nThere is a lot of attention to detail in this game. Stand Parin the protagonist next to a character dancing to his boombox and she will join right in. Characters go about their lives in town and might wander in and out of different buildings if you are looking for them. Parin in particular is full of personality, from the way she acts and how she responds to other characters.\n\nGameplay-wise, combat is smooth, and the invincibility frames you get are very generous. It's not nearly as difficult as Ys, but some opponents are notably tougher than the rest though, otherwise this is a very child-friendly game. There are plenty of secrets to find and things to unlock. Truly mastering a stage would mean getting S triple + rank, so there is plenty to do.\n\nCriticisms incude: keyboard key-binding options are not the best and camera control with a controller is non-existent. The option for Japanese audio would have been nice, but Mastiff (the localization company) is looking into both of these at time of writing. The higher difficulty levels also need to be unlocked first.\n\nGames with unadulterated charm like these are rare these days, so give it a whirl if you like the genre.","April 1, 2015","true","25.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

(i use an xbox controller.)\n\nThis is a puzzle game which is also ironically its most challenging aspect; there are parts where it doesn't tell you where exactly to go next and so you must scavanger hunt. This can be semi-frustrating having you pace around in levels at random --or worse-- when you're in the right level and you miss exactly 1 breakable pot, chest or monster which ruins your S Rank which you need to acquire gold medals and "master" the stage.   Forcing you to retry the stage later.  Its one of those kinds of games but I'm just glad its not always easy.\n\nFun Story: I got semi-trolled by this game early on when they had you guess a password and i guessed it right away but turns out the password was case sensitive which is why it said it was incorrect.\n\nAfter more playing; This game has all kinds of hats and costumes to unlock. Hats being very important as you will find yourself constantly switching them out while in the midst of your endeavor (one shows you where the ever-important loot is, one makes you immune to water damage, one makes you gain more coin, another hat for combat yadda yadda yadda..) I found myself switching to a hat to kill a monster then to another to pick up the coin then to another for the world traps but that's just me being nitpicky.\n\n\nIf you're okay with an innocent sense of humor then I'd definitely give this game a shot.\n\nMay your drill pierce the heavens; as Parin's cuteness has pierced my heart~","March 30, 2015","true","8.4"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/recommended/322290/","XavierCrow","FissionChip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/","213 products in account","TL;DR: Don't be fooled by first impressions. Gurumin gets better a couple of hours in, and is very nostalgic of N64 and PS1 era games, so a great one for sitting on the couch and devoting a weekend or more to!\n\nNOTE: If you don't like the English voices there's a zip of the Japanese voices here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/322290/discussions/0/611701999538422445/  The English main character is probably better than the Japanese, but both suffer from lack of enthusiasm compared to the animation.\n\nREVIEW:\nThis game does not present itself well in the beginning. The intro music is certainly an interesting choice in much the same way the unskippable movie it accompanies is - it reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon's attempt to appeal to "the youth", so it's just a bit cheesy. That sets the tone for the first little while of the game really, you just can't help but treat it with a skeptical:"am I actually going to enjoy this...?" after the intro. It's as though Gurumin saved all of its A-Game material for later, then realised it still had to actually start somehow, so just threw in a montage of characters you don't know, to music that you weren't prepared for, then pretended it couldn't hear you when you told it to stop.\n\nThat feeling dissipated over the next hour or so though as the game began to remember that it actually isn't bad (or maybe my hangover just eased...). The music gradually gets better throughout the game, comprising hints of RPGs from bygone eras intermingled with... well, bits of everything really! In fact some of the tracks are downright awesome despite being anything but the norm for this genre! The writing style begins to feel more familiar as it goes on, and for the most part delivers on the "sensible chuckle" humour; Though I do take issue with the more liberal translations, like adding "You stink!" where the original Japanese character just noisily pratfalled.\n\nThe combat is a mixed bag of genuine challenge (read: oh-god-where-did-my-health-go) as well as confusion (like hitting fish underwater). To keep it quick; it gets better as it goes on, and you get used to the lack of feedback compared to more mordern games. This could have been better handled, but it's easily forgiveable considering this was a PSP (it was in fact released on PC in 2004 as noted by Genki in the comments. Thanks!) title originally released in 2004, and it plays well enough to be mastered if you're bothered enough to pay attention to the timing. You gain more abilities, weapon elements and upgrades as you go, all of which are up to you, so there's a decent feeling of agency here. There's even a special "Beginner Mode" which in addition to reduced damage and penalities, also stops ice from being slippery, which is just a really thoughtful feature! Gurumin could be great for all ages and player skills as a result, though younger kids might still need some help with the puzzles.\n\nThere's also keyboard and mouse support which can be remapped before playing, and adding that to the high resolution capability makes this an example of a port done right!\n\nThe big of the smalls is this: Despite initial apprehension and a couple of hours of admitted "hrm...", something kept calling me back to the game and I actually had a lot of fun! Maybe it's just that it reminds me of games from the Nintendo 64 or original Playstion, like Croc or Mario 64 or even Ocarina of Time, but I just HAD to play this game sitting on my couch in front of my TV. And... that's all I've done pretty much for 2 days straight now! And hopefully many more to come! This is a stupidly cute, amazingly solid, retro-console styled game through-and-through. So make use of the Steam streaming function if you can, and play it on the couch on the biggest TV you can find!\n\nAdditional: Parin's animations are adorable.","November 21, 2015","true","20.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

You get a bunch of different headgear to serve as equipment, with some shared and some unique benefits, like the gas mask protects from poison gas, goggles from water damage, etc.  Headgear can be leveled up to improve their effects and add new ones like damage reduction and damage multipliers. You only have a drill as a weapon, with three exchangeable elemental parts but they all play the mostly the same aside from some enemies being weak to different elements.  There's a bunch of special moves you unlock through buying parts for your drill and they're all easy enough to perform.\n\nThe gameplay is separated into short dungeon crawls, with no area being any longer than twenty minutes or so.  Each area has two regular stages, then a boss, then two more "secret" stages that can be unlocked by solving some type of riddle.  There's enough stages to give the game a solid length and it ends before becoming tedious.\n\nBeing a 3D action/platformer, the camera control can be a bit finicky, especially since the game doesn't an option to map the right analog stick on the controller as camera control, instead defaulting to the shoulder bumpers.  You get used to it after a while though, and it's never too big of a problem.  The first platforming section with water is probably the worst in the game for various reasons, so don't fear if you flub it up a bunch.  There's not a ton of precise platforming here.  Otherwise, the game controls well.  Parin moves fast and attacks fast.  If you've played previous Falcom games, you already know they know how to do fast-paced action really well.  The music and sound effects are good, too, as you'd expect from a Falcom game.\n\nAs for the story/voice acting stuff, it's bleh and generic for the most part, but the lead character has a good dub and the game has a ton of little charming touches that overshadow the problems.  NPC dialogue is pretty fun and you can examine a bunch of stuff in-game and Parin will comment on it.  The game's artstlye has aged really well, so even though it's technically unimpressive, the game never really looks bad due to a strong stylistic foundation.\n\nFor those that like to replay/master rank games, there's a ton here, like multiple unlockable difficulties and extra headgear/costumes to find and even a secret playable character.  It you don't care about that kind of thing, it can be safely ignored without hurting your experience.\n\nAs for the port, it's a bit of a mixed bag at this point.  I'd played it 1080p, and there was a constant white line along the top of the screen, only really noticeable during the letterboxed cinematics but it's there.  There's also appears to be issues with new game+ stuff unlocking incorrectly, as I had one of the extras upon starting up a new game+, but it seemed to have disappeared forever after quitting the game and reloading.  I imagine these types of bugs will be fixed in the near future.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a fast-paced, light-hearted 3D action game, Gurumin is what you're looking for, especially considering how few likeminded games like this there are available on PC.","April 4, 2015","true","19.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

At $10 it's really hard not to; there are many games released nowadays without half the charm and without much of the same level content for a far higher price. Gurumin is not without its flaws, but I don't think the flaws are significant enough to outweigh the positives.\n\nWhile the game is classified here as an Action RPG, I would argue against the RPG part of that. Is an RPG a game where your choices as your character define the world and set you on different story paths? This game doesn't do that (there are two endings available, but it's based on percentage of completion and not any choices made throughout the story, because there are none). Is it being able to assign points to various attributes like Strength, Charisma, etc.? This game doesn't do that; in fact, the only direct statistical upgrades for your character are health point increases after bosses, similar to what you would find in a Legend of Zelda title. What the game DOES have is an impressive array of hats that alter various aspects of your character (more damaging attacks, less damage taken, show treasure chests on the minimap, etc.), but Team Fortress 2 has that and I wouldn't classify that as an RPG either. I can't see ANY mention of the musical side of this game ANYWHERE on the Steam page which is very strange; I'd classify this game as a Musical Action game, if that's even a genre that exists.\n\nThe game places a fairly high priority in platforming, especially later in the game, and that is I think Gurumin's greatest weakness. Parin's jumps are a little hard to control, and her shadow is often not pronounced enough to tell exactly where she is located over sometimes excessively small platforms. The spastic camera, which refuses to stay put and constantly tries to center itself behind Parin, certainly doesn't help matters. Why am I given a button to immediately center the camera behind Parin if the game does this automatically every time I start to move? If I move the camera, I want it in that position until I say otherwise; several of the game's tricky jumps would be made vastly more simple if only I could set the camera at Parin's side and leave it there until after the platforming section, but if this option is available then I never found it. In the end I usually resigned myself to platforming relying entirely on the minimap; at least with the minimap there was no ambiguity as to whether I was over a platform or not.\n\nCombat, however, is enjoyable, even if it is a bit easy (note that I have only beaten the game on Normal, and that higher difficulties might actually be...difficult). The next few sections are going to be talking about combat since it has some nuances. Parin has a standard neutral attack string and a variation if you hold in a direction while attacking, but you probably won't often be using those. Parin's dodge is extremely long and forgiving, and she gets three of them in a row; I never timed it but it has to be at least 3 full seconds of invincibility which is pretty insane in a game like this. Beyond that, one of the first special attacks you get is an attack after the dodge, and you're ALSO invincible during that attack animation, which at higher ranks adds another second and a half or so. There's little reason not to simply spam this one special technique over and over until everything in the room is dead considering that the attack itself is extremely damaging and reaches over a very wide area. Certain enemies have shields or armor on and are impervious to attack, so the armor needs to be removed by utilizing Parin's charged drill attack (this seems to be its only purpose, as the damage the charged drill attack does is pathetic even compared to normal attacks), but after that you're free to attack in whatever way you wish. The game does add in elemental effects (fire, lightning, and ice) that can be changed at a whim. Fire burns enemies and causes damage (a fairly small amount) over time, lightning slows and paralyzes enemies, and ice freezes them in place. There is also a system in place where certain enemies take more or less damage from certain elements, but at least on Normal mode this is easily ignored and the damage reduction for using the wrong element is fairly insignificant. Elemental attacks are also used in several of the game's puzzles. The only non-special attack that I used often is her homing jump attack, which is not only very useful for attacking flying enemies but is also extremely accurate (fittingly enough) and does fairly high damage. It is also, coincidentally, absolutely vital for some minigames.\n\nOne thing to note is that all special attacks in this game are performed the exact same way; rotate the character either clockwise or counterclockwise and then attack.  Doing it without dodging/jumping performs a 360 spin, doing it during a dodge performs a projectile attack (this is the room cleaner I mentioned above), and doing it during a jump performs a slam. I used a PS2-type controller, and the game is very forgiving with its detection of turns. It is, in fact, TOO forgiving, and I can't count the number of times I was jumping during platforming to attack an enemy and found myself plummeting straight into an abyss.\n\nThe last thing I have to talk about concerning combat is the drill meter. Parin uses a drill as her weapon. The drill has 4 levels (the game only counts 3 but I'll explain why I say it has 4). The higher the level of the drill, the more damage it does (some special attacks also change animations depending on its level). When the bar is filled to max you get a projectile attack every time you swing the drill; the game counts this as part of the 3rd drill level but since it's only actually available with a FILLED 3rd level and not just IN the 3rd level I count it as its own level. Now, how do you increase the drill level? The standard way is to get critical hits, and this is where the music minigame comes into play. It's actually so important a consideration in the game that I'm surprised Gurumin isn't called a Music Action game. At the top of the screen is a bar that acts as a metronome for the current music; if you time your strikes with the metronome you get critical hits, and every 100 critical hits gives you a drill level. There are also items and certain areas within stages you can use to increase your drill level, but both of these are fairly rare and for the most part you'll be relying on critical hits. This is why I say its strange the musical side of the game is so underplayed on the Steam store page.\n\nAs for music and sound...music is good. I can't think of a single song I disliked and there were several I would actually nod my head to as they played. As fits the game most of them are fast-paced and quite a few are cheery (sometimes a little overly cheery) but they didn't grate on my nerves. The sound effects are fairly simplistic, but it isn't as though this is a complicated, deep game or story so it fits the tone well. What I WILL complain about is the voice acting. It's sub-par to downright awful all across the board. I'm running out of space but suffice it to say that I didn't like anyone.\n\nThe story is cookie-cutter and saccharine (it involves giving monsters furniture to make them happy so that their happiness drives away the darkness. No, I am not oversimplifying it), and though I rolled my eyes during much of it I never hated it. Characterization is rather sparse, but then I don't think anyone came into this game expecting Catcher in the Rye.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time complaining during this review, but the main thing to take away from this is that while the combat was simple I enjoyed it. The VAST majority of the game focuses on the combat. I didn't like the platforming but in the end the platforming is little more than how you get from one combat arena to the other. Overall I really enjoyed the game, and I heartily recommend it. It's a good game.","April 20, 2015","true","18.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

From its adorable artstyle to quick vicious combat, Gurumin feels comfortable and approachable. The combat is based off rhythm, landing critical blows in a timed fashion. While dodging enemy attacks and traps. This makes the combat and combos dynamic and quick paced. The over all artstyle is extremely anime and cute. This may or may not throw some people off. At heart, Gurumin is a light-hearted game and never really takes itself seriously. That doesn't mean that the game is a casual experience. With five difficulties, mini-games and plenty of secrets to discover, there is plenty to satisfy those looking for a more deeper experience. With great voice acting, fantastic soundtrack.

The reason why I leave this game a negative review is because the description on the game's page is misleading. The game advertises itself as have 35+ hours of gameplay; however, this is incorrect. On average, it takes maybe 11 hours to beat the game. I looked up the game on the HowLongtoBeat website and it is listed as 9-11 hours and 17 hours for completionists, meaning that even for people who want to experience all of the content in the game, it only takes them 17 hours on average, which is half the amount of time that the game makers advertise. One of the reasons I originally purchased this game was because I believed I'd be getting a decent game length out of it, and I didn't. I don't have anything against shorter games, but it was a game I had been expecting to put more time into because of this advertisement.\n\nI will go over the game's pros and cons now.\n\nPros:\n-Decent platforming game with unique levels\n-Good for people who like to collect items or beat their own high scores/times\n-Cute character designs\n-Catchy music\n-Wearing items changes the costume on the character\n-Runs well even on non-gaming pcs and laptops\n\nCons:\n-Game can be beaten in 9-17 hours on average (not as advertised 35+)\n-Characters are not fleshed out enough\n-Unlocking areas or progressing the story is sometimes extremely obscure without a guide\n-There is an adult character that tries to go on dates with the little girls in the game and it is passed off like a silly joke. This part particularly irked me because the game is otherwise appropriate for kids to play and yet it normalizes a grown adult trying to pursue romantic relationships with prepubescent girls. This is another reason why I choose not to recommend the game, but the main reason is the false advertisement.","January 29","false","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

People who use controllers (myself included) may also find the analogue input to be overly sensitive as well, which just comes down to needing to adjust the deadzone of your controller.\n\nNow for the things that Mastiff did wrong:\nAs you get past the halfway point you'll soon notice several lines of dialogue being unacceptably incomplete.\n\nA couple of steam achievements do not unlock properly and requires you to beat the final boss and watch the whole ending TWICE per difficulty to unlock both, that is if you actually made a save before a certain point in the game, otherwise you'll have to replay the whole game to unlock the other achievement.\n\nThe unlockable Item List does not update properly and is showing a majority of blanks despite having beaten the game to 100% twice.\n\nThe PSP version (Also published by Mastiff) has content which this version does not, including:\nAt least 5 extra costumes.\nOriginal Japanese voice line option (Available on the PC version through manually downloading and overwriting audio files with original Jap audio, search Steam threads if you're interested)\nSkippable cutscenes.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI would've recommended this game outright simply because it's another great Falcom game, but this version is an example of publishing done wrong, Mastiff has put in minimal effort to properly bring a good product to Steam.\nIf this had been published by XSEED we would've had a version of the game with full uncensored content for sure and without any bugs.","October 9, 2015","false","44.2"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

Sadly, I am not a completionist and couldn't even be bothered to get S on all the maps. The soundtrack has some interesting songs. There are 4 or so minigames. All in all it's a good game.\n\nCons:\nSome soundtracks you hear too much and really get annoying. The map ranking is determined by if you killed all the monsters and broke all the jars so 60% of the time you're just breaking jars. The combat gets very stale (Charge attack to knock off armor then finish with normal attacks) swap goggles for swimming and gas mask for mushrooms but then spend most of your time with vampire hat for free heals (I couldn't be bothered to get the better ones than vamp.) I'd probably suggest getting native voices too since english ones aren't that great. Story is spread waaaaaay too thin, most of the time you just run maps to get the dark mist to go away, feels really unheroic to be collecting missing furnature for 80% of the game.","January 5","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of love put into this game and there's much to like, but conversely this was likely a B-team or frugal project.\n\nThe soundtrack as expected of a falcom game from the era is great (with the exception of one minigame track).  Visuals and story are pretty basic but serviceable.\n\nAlthough combat and the main mechanics/item management are additive and fun, in general the loose design, mediocre platforming control/camera and recycled levels are the game's main weakness.  You won't see much of it if you simply race to the end, but if you shoot to do all the levels pretty much everything's used twice- there's really more music than there are unique stages.  Still, the game's got decent replay value given how tricky it is to get everything.  It also has some nice little puzzles and minigames thrown into the mix to vary things up a smidge.\n\nIn summation, the game's value is decent for its cost, but unless the setting really appeals to you or you want something a little easier I'd play the Ys games that are on Steam first.","April 24","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It features an all-star voice cast featuring the voice talents of actors you may have heard from before! (ex. Pierre and Doug are voiced by Robin Atkin Downes, aka The Medic and Dee Bradley Baker, most known for voicing many Spongebob characters is in this too!)\n\n-A storyline that at times can be serious, but most of the time doesn't take itself seriously and has many light-hearted elements.\n\n-An absolutely awesome and always upbeat and rocking soundtrack!\n\n-Simple and intuitive controls (not to mention fluid)\n\n-Has RPG elements but for those who are new to games with RPG elements, this game simplifies them, saving you the stress of understanding them.\n\n-A ultra-simple equip mechanic, just put on a different piece of headgear on the fly to use its attributes to turn the tide in battle! (PLUS headgear can be further upgraded, gaining new perks and even strengthening its current attributes!)\n\n-LOTS of collectibles and extras, perfect for the gamers who like to collect everything and for completionists!\n\n-This game may have linear progression, but 100% of the time it encourages players to explore the areas (hidden areas, breakable walls) and are rewarded for their curiosity for going out of the beaten path.\n\n-A unique lineup of enemies that have the players think of which strategies and/or weaknesses to use on them.\n\n-Formidable boss battles that have patterns players must adapt to (it's more fun to experiment methods of defeating the bosses everytime in newer, faster, and more efficient ways!)\n\n-5 Difficulty levels to challenge the player (it's okay for newcomers to choose the Beginner difficulty, but once they get the hang of the game, they are free to tackle the higher difficulties and are awarded new items for clearing them, there's even a hidden playable character when special conditions are met!)\n\nAnd that should cover all the details about this game and if you should get it (I mean need I say more?). This game gets my highest recommendation and I cannot recommend this game enough.","October 7, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As Parin you will make many monster friends while being tasked with helping them fix their world by tracking down items in all sorts of interesting environments.  The story is heartwarming in a childlike way as both your monster friends and bad guys all have interesting personalities and the well written script and professional voice acting really helps bring them to life.  Along the way you will bash evil monsters with an array of combat moves that you can unlock with money you find in each level area.  The combat is a combination of joystick twirling and timed button pressing, nothing revolutionary but it works well.  There are also platforming elements that you will use to navigate the terrain and search for hidden treasure, healing items and head pieces (hats, ribbons, etc) that you can equip to power Parin up in different ways.    Graphically Gurumin is somewhat blocky and basic, but it’s very colorful and each area you explore is filled with interesting inhabitants that evolve as you explore further, helping to reduce the repetition that often accompanies action RPG’s.  Playing thru Gurumin is like exploring a new park as a child who has a vivid  imagination; discovering monsters, avoiding the lava and having a grand old time in an adventure that is light and fun with enough of a gaming challenge to feel satisfying.  Recommended for the young at heart, plays well with a game pad too.","August 16, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Fast forward a few months when I'm starting up my LP channel on Youtube, and this game's title stuck out to me like a sore thumb. I had no idea what it was going in.\n\nThe main character of this game is Parin, a young girl sent to live with her grandfather after her parents go out on an expedition. Tiese Town has no children to speak of and Parin has no one to be friends with.\n\nA few days later, Parin hears a scream and sees a weird little girl cornered by her neighbor's dog. Parin kicks the dog (poor puppy!) and saves the girl. Parin finds out that the girl, Pino, is a monster, and can only be seen by children. Parin is taken to Monster Village by Pino and quickly makes friends with all its inhabitants. The game then goes into a jazzy intro sequence with some awesome music!\n\nGAMEPLAY is very similar in style to the Legend of Zelda: the protagonist moves through dungeons filled with monsters to reach a prize at the end.  I would say it's most similar in style to Ocarina of Time, except all the "waiting" to fight enemies is taken out. The game has a ranking system based on how many monsters you killed in the dungeon, how many treasure chests you opened/how many pots you broke, and how long it took you to complete the dungeon. You unlock new areas by getting furniture from the ends of dungeon and giving it to the inhabitants of Monster Village.\n\nThe STORY is also very intriguing; things don't really come to a head until Eggplant Caverns is reached. A lot of things mentioned in passing come together, tying up loose strings that you thought didn't matter.\n\nThe GRAPHICS are kind of cartoony, which gives it a unique and charming look; this game was originally released in 2004, and brought to Steam in 2015. The graphics held up really well!\n\nThe MUSIC for this game is super jazzy, in a good way! All of the tracks are pleasant to listen to, and very memorable. I would say that it's almost on the same level of Jet Set Radio's soundtrack. (here's a link to my favorite song from the Gurumin OST:) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGmoyZNfnlQ\n\nAll in all, Gurumin is a very charming game and definitely one that should be part of your library. If you want to get an idea of what gameplay is like, I've linked the first episode of my LP at the top of this review. :)","April 29","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It starts off with a girl (you) moving into her grandfathers house in a new city. Whilst exploring you find out there are no other kids in town which is conveniany cause you meet some new friends which call themselves monsters and they can only be seen by children. You get invited to check out their little monster town which soon afterwards gets attacked and you must now stop the dark mist from engulfing the world. You do this by getting their ancient drill weapon which no one has ever been able to pull out of the stone until now.\n\nAll in all it's an unoriginal story, but it makes up for it with fun gameplay mechanics and a cute art style.\n\nThe only issue however is the camera. You don't control it directly instead it "tries" to circle around you when it needs to. Which can cause some trouble, but you quickly get used to it and figure out how it works.\n\nIf you enjoyed classic PS2/Xbox era Cute Action RPG's you will probably find some fun with this game as well. Though I would recommend checking out some gameplay videos before hand to see what I meant by the camera to see if it's something you can handle.","August 13, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is a unique action adventure RPG, that has fun and hilarious characters and a nice art style. I really enjoy the puzzles with the drill and various hats and costumes you can have your character wear. I highly recommend playing this with a controller however. I tried playing with the keyboard and mouse alone at first, but I quickly switched over to my Xbox 360 controller. The only issue I've had with the game is pretty minor. Just during cutscenes the lips don't sync up with the character's lips. I know this is a translation of the Japanese version of the game, but I found it kinda distracting sometimes. Other than that, great soundtrack, great characters, and great gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldtiger142003/recommended/322290/","goldtiger142003","Campaigner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldtiger142003/","72 products in account","I recently got this game through the promotion, so it was a free gift. I wanted to try this game out because I was tired of playing super serious games, and many reviews for the PSP version likened it to Zelda games. I'm interested in those, so I had a good outlook on this before it came out.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game is NOT friendly to keyboard users. The controls are very flighty, and you can't keybind with the normal WASD setup. You are given a tutorial at the start of the game that explains that you can use the right click to move (which is incredibly odd). The problem here is that the character likes to take wide turns. Jumping, something that many games includes, is fairly nice in this; except for that god awful sound effect. SPROING, SPROING, SPROING. Don't hold the space bar down, use X to jump. The camera controls don't work in some places, leading to a poor view at times. In the starter town, these controls are pretty annoying and almost off-putting.\n\nAudio quality is varying. I understand that this game is meant for younger audiences, so I will approach it as such. As said above, the jumping mechanic includes a very annoying sound effect. VERY annoying. I'm not far into the game, but I'm almost positive that jumping will be required, so I'll be subject to the torturous sound when I need to progress with jumping. I could go on and on about how bad the sound effect is, but I'll leave it there. Music is charming and enjoyable, but it's incredibly loud. I've got the volume set to its absolute lowest, and it's still very loud. I've had to lower my computer's max volume just to get it to a reasonable level. As for voice acting, I apologize to any of her fans, but the voice actress for Parin just sounds so bad. She's unenthusiastic, and her dialogue sounds like she's just reading the script and nothing more. The grandfather at the start sounds so lively and cheery, and then Parin talks and sounds boring. I've read elsewhere that the PSP version has optional Japanese audio, but the Steam release does not. Either way, the voice acting is pretty weak. As I was wandering around the starter town, I suddenly hear a LOUD not-dog barking. Really irritating sound, AND loud. I didn't expect to get spooked by a cartoony game.\n\nCharacters are pretty cut and dry in terms of tropes. Parin, the heroine, is the peppy young female who is always cheery. Her grandfather, Hyperbollic, is the flighty and forgetful old mayor who's fun to talk to. Then there's Cyllinder. HOW DID THIS GET APPROVED? He's practically a pedophile with how he talks to Parin. It's incredibly creepy. The first monster you meet, Pino, is the generic cutesy "mascot" kind of character in the sense that she shows up out of nowhere, gets into trouble with a simple animal, and is rescued by a girl who is the only one who can see her. The monsters, prior to obtaining the drill, are all goofy critters that you'd expect from a child-friendy series. Other than the pedophile, the characters are all alright.\n\nGameplay...First off, I skip cinematics. The dialogue mixed with the ridiculous volume and bad voice acting are enough to get annoyed with. Thankfully that can be turned off so I don't hear them. Luckily, there's boards that explain what to do. In the first dungeon, you learn how to attack, push objects, and dodge. You also learn a move where you can stay airborne for as long as you jump and attack enemies. That's pretty enjoyable. One thing that bothered me at the start was the meter up top with the moving stars, but that was explained as the method for getting critical hits. Now things die too easily since I'm good at rhythm games. Still, it's a nice mechanic, and probably the one thing I really like so far. After the first dungeon, you meet another character named Popon, who uses a sword rather than a drill. I couldn't stand her voice, so I didn't play as her for more than a minute (I didn't close the game to turn off voices at this point). The most hilariously bad aspect is that you can't equip the goggles you're given at the start of the game. This may be because I run around in one of the alternate costumes, but still.\n\nDisregarding all of the glaring flaws, the core game is enjoyable even if the controls are flighty. In my opinion, playing the game muted is best, but that's just me. The story isn't anything fantastic, and the characters aren't all that unique, but it's pretty fun for a time waster. I'd GREATLY suggest getting the PSP version instead, since this game was obviously made for controllers instead of keyboards. I'm only selecting "Yes" for recommending since there's no "Maybe" option.\n\nAlso, that wardrobe lets you wear a skimpy leopard costume. On a little girl. Thanks, Japan!","March 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The game is full of action, well designed dungeons and awesome music. The characters are silly and fun, including the antagonists (except the prince maybe). I think the difficulty was just right, although later levels can be a bit challenging/frustrating, not because of the enemies but rather the environment, like having to attack-jump to cross large distances and falling into water or open space easily. Boss fights shouldn't take more than a few tries, there's one optional super-boss available\nAs of today, the graphics are slightly dated, but in full-HD resolution it still looks nice. Key config is a bit lacking. I miss the original voice actors too, like "yaa" & "iryaaaa" attacks. But the dub is surprisingly fine, I was honestly prepared for much worse\nOverall highly positive and worth playing (again).

Having played it before on the PSP, I thought it really deserved a second chance to reach the masses.\n\nAs long as you don't expect too much from this game, you won't be disappointed. There's no real gimmick here like you'd see in most indie titles nowadays, keep in mind this did come out about a decade ago. It's very much a straight forward action-rpg, so what makes it worth picking up? The charm.\n\nYou might want to skip this one if you despise cutesy anime guff, unless your backlog of action titles is running dry. Everything, even the voice acting seems like it's straight out of a Saturday morning anime. Stylistaclly it reminds me of Mega Man Legends, or the Evolution series on Dreamcast and Gamecube. Graphically it also looks like a Dreamcast or Gamecube title, maybe an early PS2 game.\n\nIt seems like I'm bashing the gameplay itself but it's actually pretty solid, just don't expect anything you haven't seen before. There's a pretty basic (and therefore repetetive) combo system, but it's still pretty satisfying. At 10 bucks you could do much, MUCH worse.\n\nOh, and you can dress the main character up in a cute little monkey outfit.\n\n7.5/10 Would "aww" again.","March 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It is much more playable than it's PSP counterpart which Mastiff first brought overseas. The camera in that version was pushed in much too close to the player character, severely limiting your field of view. This update fixes that by not only going back to the PC original FOV, but also adds widescreen to the mix.\n\nWorks just fine on Windows 7 and XP. Theres an issue where the right-stick camera controls can't be mapped on directinput pads, but can be worked around by setting shoulder buttons to rotate the camera.  Another thing I noticed is the AA options either don't work at all or crash the game (@ 4x). I hardly noticed edge aliasing in-game anyway.\n\nSince posting this review, someone in the forums discovered that disabling certain options, like DOF, might allow AA to work.

Finding secrets, sure, something to entice exploration, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stop to poke every jar with my drill.\n\nThat's just a game killer right there, and that's not even mentioning the fact that the PC controls are abysmal.

The project was helmed by the same group who made Zwei but is about a girl who uses a drill to defeat enemies and dig through structures instead of using a partner to shoot magic and relies on eating to boost stats.   This title was also made when Nihon Falcom was sorta in a rut and didn't find financial success to run on until Sora no Kiseki Second Chapter.  This really shows now adays as Gurumin looks no better than a N64 game with improved textures to dabble with.\n\nThe game's still fun, albeit very very simple.   The music is kinda boring, the enemies are slow and easy, the map design is kinda rudamentary.  All and all this seems like a simple game whipped up by a studio and dev team to just clear some technical checkpoints.  This is a Banjo Kazooie/Mario 64/Ape Escape/Crash Bandicoot clone that while fun is just lacking in so many areas.\n\nIt's charming, cheap, and worth a try.   Give it a whirl if you like the team behind it, but I wouldn't really say get it if you're looking to revist the era where action platformers dominated the market because this is not the next Jet Force Gemini.","April 1, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smackymander/recommended/322290/","Smackymander","Salamander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smackymander/","318 products in account","A  NON-REVIEWER, REVIEW.\nI got this game for free - however, from what I rember from when I last played the game (not the steam release) the game was pretty darn fun. Now that I'm looking at it, there's 2 things so far that have slightly annoyed me - the controls. To put it bluntly, at the moment, when playing with a 360 controller, it kind of feels like your wrestling with it, on default controlls. However, that is my opinion, but remapping some of the controllers makes it a lot easier to play through - especialy helping, for me, with not pressing attack, when I meant to jump - and doing so, having to restart a platforming section. Aside from that, the next and final issue I've found is that the subtitles look out of place, as in, they look almost fuzzy. To put it bluntly the game looks good, but then the subs look wrong - almost out of place.\nEDIT: ONE MORE ISSUE;\nThe cutscenes. The cutscenes are jarring, in comparison to the rest of the game. In my opinion, they could recieve an update, however if you're not running this in 1920x1080, I can't comment on how they'd look. Despite this, the game is still over all pretty good. Though, it is only some - the consistensy on how the cutscenes/animations look isn't exactly there\nEDIT:  ANOTHER ISSUE;\nThe lips don't sync up. Yep. That's it. It's kind of like you're watching a realy badly dubbed anime. You know,  it's translated, it's animated nicely, but you can't quite keep yourself looking at it. You can't quite get a true grasp of how the game looks, preforms and operates, it's jarring. It's a small, but extremley noticable things - to the point, one character wasn't talking, but their lips were moving (insert a joke about the Meghan Trainor song here)\n\nAside from that, the graphics look pretty good - a cutesy cell shaded graphics style, the voices fit, the music is excelent, comedic timing is pretty good - and a few of teh jokes directed at characters made me chuckle a fair bit, an  Intresting  combat system - over all, it's pretty good. I'd give it a 7/10. Not the best game, but considering it's old, and a port, it's not too shabby. The problems could be improved, and the in game dialogue regarding controller inputs could be changed based upon what it detects as per the game pad  (y being refered to in game as z, being the most noticable one). If you want to see as to whether or not this game is for you - just look at a lets player, mute the person playing if you want, but judge it from how it looks.\n\nUPDATE 3;\nI've put in another hour or so of gameplay. The game's style changes, it appears as though it was only the opening animation to the "monster viliage" area of the game, which was so different compared to the rest. That being said, the voices dosn't get any better through out the game, furthermore, I've actualy noticed that bits of people are  translucent, like you can see the mane characters gloves and you can see her mouth, or other characters through them, almost as though the body parts are made of tissue paper. At the moment, I'd strongly reccomend this game, however if you don't like action rpgs, then this game will not be for you. You might get kicks out of the comedic aspect, but the gameplay - you probably won't like the combo - rythm system that the game takes, for it's fighting portions of the game.\n\nNOTES; I'm currently playing the game on an AMD FX8350 and an R9 270x, running the built in amd catylst vsync.","March 30, 2015","true","11.9"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","14","31","4","2"

The only thing I would like to point out is that ocasionally your character will move slowly in a direction. If that's the case, just push in the left joystick and it will stop for awhile.

I'll just leave the original review below for posterity.\n\nThe game might be good, but I'm not sure if it actually is, because this port is abysmal.\n\nFirst, control mapping. You can't map anything to a gamepad's triggers, the right stick doesn't work in-game, and there's no D-pad support. Movement with a stick is awkward, as 99% of the stick's range is for walking while only fully pressed out is for running. For the keyboard, you can only pick from a small selection of keys made available to you, for some bizarre reason. You can't even properly play the game with just a gamepad, as the opening menus require you to hit enter on the keyboard, as the gamepad won't work for them.\nThe AA option simply doesn't work. Even forcing AA through video card settings hasn't worked for some people.\nThere are very few resolution options.\nIt's currently dub-only (though easy enough to mod).\nTutorials all display mouse & keyboard controls, even if you're using a gamepad.\nHell, just look at the forums, there's plenty more issues listed, and there's no need for me to copy paste what other people have already pointed out.\n\nI've heard plenty of good things about Gurumin, and as a Falcom game I expect it to be quite good, but I can't possibly recommend it until the port is fixed.","March 31, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because of that, I can't complain too much, especially being that this is a very old title and therefore is bound to have issues here and there.\n\nThat being said, the framerate is rather choppy, and the game seems to crash in strange ways for me. For instance: Talking to the NPC in the starting town that gives you the goggles caused my video driver to crash (using AMD 7970HD GPU). Holding the spacebar caused my character to jump in place, or rather, cause the jumping animation to loop and the jumping sound effect to play rapidly without the character actually leaving the ground. I do wish there was a way to bring the game upto 60FPS proper; Applications such as fraps will report 60 FPS, but this doesn't seem to actually be the case (menus run at that framerate, but in-game animations do not, according to what I've read).\n\nSeems theres still a few bugs to work out. If you have the game already, there's generally no reason to be pessimistic; Its visually charming, and playthroughs seem to imply that its a rather fun time. But unfortunately, I wouldn't know as I can't get the goggles, as explained earlier in this post.\n\nTL;DR: If you have it already, great. If you're contemplating a purchase, dont; at least, not yet. Give them a little more time to debug and work things out.","April 11, 2015","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/322290/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A simple action-adventure (with a limited RPG elements) with okay graphics, decent animations/sound, and a story from a child's POV. Controls are usually fine, and the game engine physics allows you to kinda wallrun if you jump towards a wall, which looks pretty funny. You can manually resize the game window, which is pretty handy.\n\nDungeons are fun enough to run through, but don't expect too many innovations- it sticks to a very basic formula. You go room by room, killing all enemies, breaking all pots, opening all chests, and doing simple puzzles. At the end of a dungeon, you get one item to return to the monster village (which then unlocks more dungeons). You might even notice it reuses rooms a couple times in different dungeons with a little twist (like flipped).\n\nThere are several minigames of varying quality. The most annoying is the 3v3 football/soccer one in which you can't control/dribble the ball, only hit it with attacks. If you try to play it like a normal sports game you'll be frustrated since most likely you'll never score a goal yourself. Just do locked-on jump attacks on the ball and it'll automatically hit it towards the enemy goal instead of straight ahead. You can just play defense and your AI ally will eventually get enough goals in.\n\nEnemies aren't too hard, and you're free to switch between the three elements (for enemy weaknesses) and your head gear (for your resistances) in combat to finish them quickly. Bosses are pretty straightforward and in normal difficulty can be brute forced with healing items if you just want to run up and slash.\n\nIf you enjoy this basic formula, a childlike/innocent story, and the visuals this game might be for you. Otherwise, there are other action-RPGs that might be more tailored to your tastes.","April 14, 2015","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not realize they even planned a port for it. the PSP is starting to age and I am glad I still get to play classics (ish) like this on a more powerful system.\n\nFirst off, having played this to the bone on the PSP, I can address its content immediately and compare what I've experience in the PC port afterwards.\n\n+Solid action platformer\n+Engaging enemy variations (strategy cap must be on!)\n+RPG/level elements\n+Replayability\n+Decently lengthed game (especially for completionists)\n+Fun and memorable characters (most are some just add some spice to the setting)\n+Great voice acting for the time period of its deveopment (espesially since its in english)\n+Made by Falcom, the genius behind the Ys franchise and the early Legend of Heroes games\n\n-Simple camera mechanics sometimes lag behind gameplay\n-New Game + requires collecting items again (not necessarily a bad thing, it does add a "replayability" aspect than a God Mode)\n-Completing the game 100% will take a lot of effort, some skill and back tracking\n-Some progression aspects are vague (rarely)\n\nOverall, this game was one of the rare gems in the PSP treasure trove along the lines of Ys: Napishtim (which Xseed is porting to PC this month), or Ys: Felghana (already on Steam!) in regards to genre. It has a very straightforward story that engages you with plot twists--sometimes unnecessary--that let you keep going. The leveling and gear system here also works well, not to mention customization options with all the different costumes. Gear levels carry over to NG+ given that they need to be reacquired. The characters are memorable and all play a role in the game. One particularly elusive cat, will definitely pique most players interest. The enemies are given so much variety throughout the game that merit a different approach everytime a new foe is encountered. Some can even get a tiny bit frustrating(-ly fun).\n\nFor the PC port, I think they only really need to adjust their config menu. Add support to the d-pad and R analog stick, for example. (I prefer using d-pads for platmormers like this because I feel more in control of direction. hehe) Video options also show little difference to me, noted that I'm not too keen on major graphic settings other than fps, res and vsync. I think that this game is aged and simple enough that the settings they give do not entirely make the game too noticably different on medium settings or ultra. The PC port, specifically, feels odd with the PSP type camera system, but perhaps it is more a complex fix than I give it credit for.\n\nThe games negatives aren't exactly negatives, per se. Nothing that holds back from enjoying the game entirely, but clearly show how this game was really built for more simpler control inputs. Noting that I play this game, like most of mine, using a gamepad.\n\nIf you've played this before, pick it up! If you haven't, PICK IT UP!! Otherwise, pick it up anyway! :D","April 11, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From my point of view, everything about this game is great, with just a few minor complaints I have, which I will get to in this review.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 - The graphics remind me of early playstation games such as Brave Fencer Musashi.  They get the job done, vibrant, and great use of color.  You can also tell it makes great use of cell-shading, but the characters do tend to look a little too simplistic.  Overall, however, this game looks great.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10 - The game plays very well, and that's as much as I can say about it right now as I've only just started playing this game.  I will definitely update when the time comes, but one minor complaint: so far, I haven't really run into any boss fights. EDIT: Just ran into my first boss fight, and lemmie tell ya, they can really drill it to ya -pause again for laughs or groans-.  They're challenging, but fair.  It at least gives you time to use healing items and not have them clobber you as you do so.  Overall, the boss fights are great and vibrant.\n\nControls: 8/10 - Here's where I have to make a few complaints about controls here.  Some of the moves aren't very clear on what to do, especially if you're using a gamepad (or xbox 360/XBOne controller) for control.  The instructions are strictly PC oriented with no mention of what to do with the gamepad.  I would complain about it more, if it weren't for the fact that you learn pretty quickly what buttons do what move, so it's no big issue and the controls can be customized*.\nHowever, the controls do the job well, either way.  The jump controls are interesting, but can get a little frustrating, especially having to make platform jumps.  Fortunately, the shadow effects will help you, and you can angle the camera any way you please (right stick for xbox 360 controllers).  The inclusion of timed hits to the beat of the music with the beat bar displayed on screen is a wonderful addition.  If you've mastered Crypt of the Necrodancer, you'll definitely find that getting critical hits via the beat of the music to be very easy and fun.\n\nSound: 9/10 - The music, even though you can tell it's synthesizer, is VERY well done.  The english voice acting is a bit cheesy, but works anyways.  The music is upbeat and well composed, in my opinion.  You'll need to get that tempo down if you want to do critical hit damage, but the timing of each beat is precise and works very well.\n\nOverall: 9.25/10 - This game is definitely a title for platform gamers to really dig into -pause for groans or laughter-.  Hopefully, we'll see some patches released to fix some of the issues, but overall, I recommend this game for anyone who loves a good platform game.\n\n\n*At least the options to do that are up, but I've seen some forum posts about the game not running because options got changed.  Hopefully, this gets patched soon, as I did suffer the same thing when I tried to change around a few options.  Should you find your game not starting up, just hit the restore defaults button on the windows menu screen that comes up and it'll start normally again.  I have successfully changed a few options after having do to this, but kept it to just force feedback and maybe one other thing.","April 26, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattomaindo/recommended/322290/","mattomaindo","♀MattoMaindo♀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattomaindo/","154 products in account","This game is actually really cool. If you aren't super into rpg's, don't be discouraged to buy this game. A game that this plays very similar to would be (to a very small extent) Kingdom Hearts. But comparing this game to another doesn't do it justice. Some might complain that this is just a flatout port of the psp game. They would be right. But here's the thing. There was nothing wrong with the psp game to begin with, so what do you really need to change? Imagine this like a PS2 launch game that wasn't. It gives me the same vibe I got playing Ratchet and Clank or the aforementioned Kingdom Hearts. If you grew up with the PS2 (which sounds crazy to guys in their mid 20's), then I totally think you'll feel the same. Now this game is not neccesarily polished. There are some (kind of hilarious) graphical hiccups such as what looks like parkouring ever corner you see when not grabbing on a ledge. But this game has some wicked cool things about it. For example, you have a seperate currency system for upgrading equipment that you get from battling monsters. The game rewards you for searching around for money by giving you medals depending on how many jars and chests you get. You can even spend those medals on items that will help you out later on. There's also a pretty cool combat system. Although the controls can be a bit wonkey with my Xbox 360 controller, for the most part you can get the job done pretty well. The fact that your drill levels up instead of you kind of makes this game feel less and less like a traditional rpg (which I normally don't like). The voice acting is good. That is except the main character. You can obviously tell she's new and some points makes you want to cringe with her acting. She's not terrible though, just below average. The music is good but kind of repetitive. It didn't get on my nerves though, but if you showed me a song from the game and didn't say it was from the game I'd probably just think it was from some random rpg. Overall, I say get this game if you are a fan of non-traditional rpgs and games like Kingdom Hearts. Either way though, I'm not complaining. I got it for free because I met the requirements for the greenlight campaign.","April 4, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/322290/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure, developed by Nihon Falcom, is a HD re-release of the 2004 Japan-only PC game, with Gurumin last seeing English storefronts on the PSP in 2007.\n\nAs a result, as well as running on just about anything, Gurumin serves as a time-capsule of videogames before contemporary design trends. Aesthetically, it's an adorable adventure game that resembles games like Blinx the Time Sweeper, 40 Winks, Ape Escape or just about any simple platformer with action elements from the fifth generation that you can think of.\n\nLayout-wise, it's exactly what you'd think. There's about 25 levels, each 5-15 minutes long, several different minigames, a secret boss and more than enough regular bosses to keep you satiated. The plot is simple, charming, and ends on as sickening a saccharine note as you could possibly want, though not before a satisfying one-on-one beatdown to decide the world's fate. The game goes out of its way to avoid surprising you - it's a comforting, easing experience first and foremost, with enough enthusiasm and charisma for its own existence to keep you playing and wanting more.\n\nThere are other benefits from refusing to evolve into a world of DLC and microtransactions. From the secret unlockables (which I won't spoil, else they wouldn't be secrets) to the plethora of regular unlockables, to the surprising (and punishing!) extra difficulty modes - this is a game from before the era of DLC nickel and diming you on extra content that used to be a joy to unlock.\n\nCombat was designed by the creators behind the legendary Ys series (pronounced "Ees"). It's relatively simple compared to hack n slash giants like DMC or Ninja Gaiden, and the moveset discourages playing stylishly so much as playing efficiently, but it's far from boring - which doesn't do a great job of selling it, but there's enough possibilities, from specials to being able to launch an enemy and juggle them until they explode, to keep you interested indefinitely given the burst nature of the level design. And on higher difficulty modes you'll be finding yourself playing with it in ways you wouldn't have thought to.\n\nGurumin is a game that lives up to its legacy, a legacy of games that existed to entertain you, not to pillage your pockets. It's a static pocket of quality and quantity content to be content with you.\n\nIt's not perfect. There are some odd glitches - notably, that you need to avoid S-Ranking every single level in order to get the "S-Rank every single level" achievement. Which is odd. For a PC-original game, the control scheme is alien, and frightening. Not to say it's unplayable with the defaults, but I do heavily recommend using a gamepad.\n\nAnd then there's Hoccer. Hoccer is a minigame I needn't say much about. Hoccer is a minigame you will discover for yourself. Hoccer will destroy you, as it destroyed me, and legions of other players before us. Accept your defeat and move on. Let Motoro have his win, it's not worth it. The Horror of Hoccer.\n\nThere's also some content missing that the PSP version has - some costume unlockables and such. Keep that in mind. It's nothing major.\n\nGurumin is well worth your time and money, and doesn't pray on your nostalgia. It shows you why you had nostalgia for what it represented in the first place.\n\nAll it takes is a drill, and you're off on a monstrous adventure.","May 17, 2015","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/322290/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure, developed by Nihon Falcom, is a HD re-release of the 2004 Japan-only PC game, with Gurumin last seeing English storefronts on the PSP in 2007.\n\nAs a result, as well as running on just about anything, Gurumin serves as a time-capsule of videogames before contemporary design trends. Aesthetically, it's an adorable adventure game that resembles games like Blinx the Time Sweeper, 40 Winks, Ape Escape or just about any simple platformer with action elements from the fifth generation that you can think of.\n\nLayout-wise, it's exactly what you'd think. There's about 25 levels, each 5-15 minutes long, several different minigames, a secret boss and more than enough regular bosses to keep you satiated. The plot is simple, charming, and ends on as sickening a saccharine note as you could possibly want, though not before a satisfying one-on-one beatdown to decide the world's fate. The game goes out of its way to avoid surprising you - it's a comforting, easing experience first and foremost, with enough enthusiasm and charisma for its own existence to keep you playing and wanting more.\n\nThere are other benefits from refusing to evolve into a world of DLC and microtransactions. From the secret unlockables (which I won't spoil, else they wouldn't be secrets) to the plethora of regular unlockables, to the surprising (and punishing!) extra difficulty modes - this is a game from before the era of DLC nickel and diming you on extra content that used to be a joy to unlock.\n\nCombat was designed by the creators behind the legendary Ys series (pronounced "Ees"). It's relatively simple compared to hack n slash giants like DMC or Ninja Gaiden, and the moveset discourages playing stylishly so much as playing efficiently, but it's far from boring - which doesn't do a great job of selling it, but there's enough possibilities, from specials to being able to launch an enemy and juggle them until they explode, to keep you interested indefinitely given the burst nature of the level design. And on higher difficulty modes you'll be finding yourself playing with it in ways you wouldn't have thought to.\n\nGurumin is a game that lives up to its legacy, a legacy of games that existed to entertain you, not to pillage your pockets. It's a static pocket of quality and quantity content to be content with you.\n\nIt's not perfect. There are some odd glitches - notably, that you need to avoid S-Ranking every single level in order to get the "S-Rank every single level" achievement. Which is odd. For a PC-original game, the control scheme is alien, and frightening. Not to say it's unplayable with the defaults, but I do heavily recommend using a gamepad.\n\nAnd then there's Hoccer. Hoccer is a minigame I needn't say much about. Hoccer is a minigame you will discover for yourself. Hoccer will destroy you, as it destroyed me, and legions of other players before us. Accept your defeat and move on. Let Motoro have his win, it's not worth it. The Horror of Hoccer.\n\nThere's also some content missing that the PSP version has - some costume unlockables and such. Keep that in mind. It's nothing major.\n\nGurumin is well worth your time and money, and doesn't pray on your nostalgia. It shows you why you had nostalgia for what it represented in the first place.\n\nAll it takes is a drill, and you're off on a monstrous adventure.","May 17, 2015","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play Parin a spunky young girl who has come to stay with her grandfather while her parents are away. It quickly becomes apparent that there isn't much to do in the mining town where he lives, but Parin is soon sucked into an adventure to rescue a group of friendly monsters. The game is fairly light plotwise but its enough to drive things forward and the dialogue is often funny. The games real draw is the action packed game play that requires good use of your drill and special moves to beat the crap out of a variety of foes. It features an interesting critical hit system that is linked to the games music, get the timing right and you will do extra damage. There are also some light platforming and puzzle solving elements. This is an update of an older game and it shows in the textures which are sometimes muddy and lack detail, overall though the art design is very good and Parin herself is well animated with a variety of expressions and idle animations that bring her to life. Bear with the slightly rough start and you will be rewarded with a game that is deeper than it first appears.\n\nPros:\nCharm in spades\nAmusing dialogue\nFun action RPG-lite gameplay\nSome good music\nGood art design\n\nCons:\nDated textures\nCamera can be touchy in confined spaces\n\n7.5 out of 10 and well worth the $10 entry fee.","September 25, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After that, there are Iron bars on the wall near your house.  Stand next to them.  If a cutscene doesn't start, keep moving around it until it does.  If it still doesn't, you didn't talk to everyone.\n\nNow, that being said.\n\nThe game is interesting and a good adventure title, and the voice acting is fantastic.  The game is a little easy, but that's a personal thing, as the game was clearly designed with a younger audience in mind.  Excellent game.","August 17, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, if you are bored in level 1, try to stick with it. I do agree that Hard should come unlocked\n\nThis game is full of charm, and there's lots of cuteness. Characters look at each-other when present, the main character will do poses like Sonic would do when you are idle, but never punishes you for it. There are lots of animation flourishes, but they don't get in the way of gameplay. They are done right because they aren't something that is player-initiated. There's also victory dances. Not enough games have victory dances. I miss that about Final Fantasy\n\nThe combat control is excellent. I can't tell if the 3D platforming is good or not due to the nature of 3D platforming. That part is frustrating. You don't feel like you have as much control of the character as you do in combat. Still, there's more combat than platforming, and the game is very lenient on screw-ups when you do platforming\n\nAs a budget game, I give this game a definite yes. I even say that it's worth above the budget level, but people may not buy it at more than $20. This feels like a Playstation-era game, and plays like one of the good ones.\n\nThere's also something Charlie Brown-esque about the voices that I kind-of like. It's nicely different than dubbed anime characters almost always having either that WWE or Wonder Woman voice, especially children. The awkward voicing kind-of works in this game, even though they could have acted some lines better when the lead character makes certain facial expressions\n\nI also find the replay value of this game to be high.
