I love the lack of detail and clutter.\nBoss design and balance was well done for all of the bosses.\nNice amount of "juice" present - a fair amount of particles, neat jelly-like character effects, etc\nBad:\nVery short, but I'm hesitant to put this on the list. Can't really fault the game or devs for this, it's not a huge deal.\nLocked to 30fps. This is frankly disgusting.\nNo options - I'd at least like to be able to change the resolution in both fullscreen and windowed mode.\n(Most likely) No grace period when walking off a platform before losing your double jump. Some players may not notice this, but I felt it quite a bit as a frequent player of platforming games. If you're just one pixel off the edge of a platform, your first jump is gone, often before your brain registers you're about to fall off. Movement would feel a lot more solid if there were just a few frames after leaving the ground where the player can still use their first jump.\nAll things considered, good game. Definitely recommend to people who like platformers.","August 5, 2015","true","2.2"," 90 of 105 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","90","105","2","2"

The way that only double jumps  splat ink everywhere is a great choice making levels more difficult and interesting.\n- A good difficulty curve, as a good precision platformerer like myself you would not find anything in the first 2 world too difficult and the 3rd world will get challenging, for newer players the game eases in to the difficulty very well making sure that the first 15-20 levels won't be tough, neither will the first boss. The game DOES get difficult and you will die many MANY times in your playthrough(s). Each enemy is brought in at a good time so levels don't feel repetative and then once you know hoe they behave, they get diffucult again.\n- Enemies are very predictable and the fact that they leave ink trails just adds to pretty nature of the game. I do have a few issues with the basic enemies as seen below\n- The physics is very nice and floaty simular to Super Meat Boy, it feels a bit slippery as you'd expect and suits the game well.\n- Fantastic level design, some levels are repeated with extra difficulty and enemies and I can't fault any level!\n- It is a great speedrun for people who want to get into speedrunning or for experienced runners, it becomes a test of memory to complete it, very fun!\n\n\nMixed:\n- Bosses are well done although I do have a few problems, the 2nd boss took me a while to figure out what I needed to do, once I'd done that it wasn't too bad and also the final boss (quite rightfully) alot harder than the others making it an interesting fight, it is hard but once you know the attacks it becomes quite easy to manipulate to your advantage, otherwise the bosses are well made, the first one is a great introduction to how you damage them. All in all well designed!\n- When you kill enemies, your sometimes feel like you can't get away from triggers that crush you, this maybe because you didn't hold the other direction soon enough.\n- For experienced precision plateformerers, the game can feel a little bit short but with mensions of DLC with more levels AND potential steam workshop support (one of the developers said this may be a possability when I talked to them) it should get even more reasons to play.\n\nBad:\n- Ememies. I have 2 problems with the normal enemies in this game:\n1) The fact that you don't get your double jumo back after killing them (this is just personal preferance and is probably a design choice),\n2) Going into the side of enemies feels inconsistant whether or not they die, again there may or may not be something I do not understand about this.\n\n\nConclusion:\nVery well made, solid game with minimal faults, definatly worth playing! I are a few issues but PLEASE don't let that put you off because this game is truely fabulous. It's so different and so interesting that anyone that gets this far through reading this review NEEDS TO PLAY THIS GAME...\n\n\nNOW!!!","August 9, 2015","true","8.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/385710/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","For a long portion of last year every time I’d catch a glimpse of Zack Bell’s Ink I had to take a moment to pause and check that I wasn’t in fact looking at a more frantic DAGDROM. Perhaps it’s due to stumbling upon them both at nearly the same time (Ink may very well have nudged DAGDROM off the front page of itch.io only a week or two after I first played it), each sporting their own squiggly paint-flinging aesthetic, but on the surface I couldn’t help but find the two games near indistinguishable from one another. Which probably says more to my tendency toward snap judgements than it does to either game in question, as beyond a similar fascination with the messy possibility of flinging paint all over a level Ink and DAGDROM couldn’t be more dissimilar.\n\nIn far more ways that matter Ink actually shares a greater kinship with the brutal platforming classic, Super Meat Boy. You could almost speculate that Ink’s explosive paint mechanic was inspired directly by Super Meat Boy’s similar blood splatter effect, but where that served as little more than a macabre monument to your failures Ink turns it into a brilliant platforming meta game, dropping you into levels which are near entirely invisible and requiring you blast paint everywhere to reveal your way through. It’s a bit like the painting mechanics of the charming and underappreciated de Blob, albeit with fewer analogies to totalitarian governments and more jello squares finding their way through the darkness.\n\nInk’s concept really is dead simple in principle, but there is something wonderfully delightful about a game that is entirely about making as big of a mess of a given level as you can by means of so many gooey psychedelic colors. Ink’s look is minimal in the sense that it’s made up of little more than the most rudimentary of geometric shapes, but there is a liveliness to it all that is infectiously energetic. The way the little square protagonist jiggles with every move feels like far more than a flat stand-in for an actual character, overflowing with a joyful abundance of energy that is all but demanding you keep moving, always keep moving. Ink is often so understated that it verges upon ambivalence, but the little touches found in the way characters move or the way paint arcs just so give the game an enthusiastic personality, and look impeccable to boot.\n\nWhat’s most special about Ink though is how it uses its visual flair in tandem with its level design, intertwining the two to form a mechanical and graphical synergy. Paint is used to reveal hidden platforms, but it also serves as a helping hand when you begin to fail repeatedly, each death causing you to explode in a shower of paint revealing more of the level and making navigating it that much easier. It’s a small touch but it’s one of the most clever answers to the problem of static platformer difficulty I’ve seen without eating away at the challenge enough to cause it to feel cheap. Ink is ruthless in its attempts to keep you from completing a level, but it always balances its difficulty by giving you enough room to breathe, to find your way through levels and suss out how best to approach them before murdering your square with wild abandon. I still found myself exhausted and out of breath upon finally making it through to the end, but it’s a testament to Ink’s design that it never felt like as if that end was beyond my ability, no matter how many dozens of times I might die to the same bloody turret. Or spiked wall. Or bottomless pit of my existential despair.\n\nIt probably helped that I was able to complete Ink in just over a very speedy hour, but this brevity didn’t come at the price of substance. Ink might be short (by many people’s judgement, at least), but it feels very full, lasting just long enough to exhaust its clever hook without diluting it with filler. It’s all remarkably well considered, with even the levels that are near mirror images of one another feeling essential and just as creative as their original counterpart.\n\nThough it might have taken me too long to recognize Ink as its own game, it was a distinction worth making as Zack Bell’s mess obsessed creation is among the most enjoyable platformers I’ve played in quite some time. It’s as charming as it is infuriating, but it never dangles the carrot too far out of reach that you lose sight of it completely. Though it is likely hard to lose sight of a metaphorical carrot covered in as many different colors of florescent paint as this one surely is.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 14","true","3.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

The graphics are simple but oddly enjoyable. Level design is good; it starts pretty basic but as you work your way up the designs become more challenging and require some careful planning in order to survive. Enemy mobs add a little spice to the basic find-your-way-through-the-level format. The developer seems to be pretty active on the discussion board and responsive to bug reports and other game issues.\n\nThe bad: Controls are still a little wonky; sometimes the jump key goes straight to double jump, which kills me a lot. The music can get a little repetitive after long play sessions and so far there isn't a menu option to turn it down/off, or to remap the keys.\n\nGeneral info: This is a platformer in which you play as a little sponge that throws paint/ink splashes as you jump or impact surfaces. You discover more of your environment in each level the more you play. It's a fairly simple game, yet oddly addictive. I've only logged a few hours and I'm already enjoying myself immensely. There are hidden secrets in some of the levels, which does give you a bit of replay value.\n\nOverall: Definitely recommend.\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","August 9, 2015","true","6.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/385710/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","INK is a minimalist hardcore platformer where you paint levels as you play, by running and sliding along surfaces, and with the paint splatter of your many deaths. You're not forced to die to succeed though, since the colored enemies also paints the surfaces they touch, and your double-jumps fling sprays of paint on your surroundings, so you are never forced into a leap of faith.\n\nEach regular level has a goal portal you have to get to, but if there are enemies in the level, you first have to get rid of all of them by jumping on them to activate the exit. The most frequent obstacles are large gaps and spikes, but the later levels also have cannons, which shoot target seeking projectiles at you, and they're by far the most difficult hazard to avoid. If you want to collect all of the 20 coins hidden in the game, you're also forced to take some risks, since you won't actually see them until you paint them, so you have to explore each level thoroughly to reveal them.\n\nThe controls are responsive, and pulling off long and precise jumps is easy when you get a hang of the game. Landings feel a bit slippery though, and that caused me a fair bit of frustration before I learned to make small jumps directly after touching down to adjust my landings. In the more hectic levels you won't always have time for that luxury though, so it's possible that this is a design choice to force a faster play style. I also never got comfortable with the way you get forced into a wall jump and flung away if you stand too close to a wall while jumping. In contrast to the upwards wall slides of Super Meat Boy, this effect seems much less forgiving.\n\nIt took me about four hours to reach the end of the 75 levels, but I struggled with many of them, and the game can likely be finished in much less time by a more skilled player. There are some difficulty leaps marked by the bosses at the end of every 25 levels, but I found the bosses themselves to be easier than many of the levels leading up to them.\n\nThe game works well with my wired Xbox 360 controller on Linux, but as always with games like this, I much prefer to use keyboard controls. I haven't experienced any technical issues with the game itself, but unfortunately Steam's screenshot feature doesn't work on Linux. It's a shame since I quite like the look of the multicolored paint covered levels and would have loved to share them with my Steam friends.\n\nIf you like a difficult platformer with a unique gimmick that adds both style and challenge, you can't go wrong with INK.\n\nNOTE: This review was originally posted on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com].","October 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Making the player become the catalyst that reveals the platforms that are hidden adds a surprisingly non-obtrusive mechanic to the platforming in INK. The very bright contrasting colors your character (Of seemingly white light or something of the sort) shoots out colors across the spectrum when it double jumps, runs along the ground, or meets its early demise.\n\nDying almost becomes an additional tool to aid you in completeing a level, and for obvious purpose. The soundtrack is very ambient and calming, which complements the early levels of INK, but make no mistake, the difficulty does ramp up in time!\n\nControls feel tight and reminiscient of Super Meat Boy, I don't feel cheated if I fall to my death because its not typically because of a bugged jump or something of the sort.\n\nAll pros aside, there is one con I find that detracts enough that it is worth mentioning. This game seems to be capped at 30 FPS and it shows when the colored ink flies through the air, or when you move your character around. The bright and very contrasting colors can also be a factor if your prone to eye strain from numerous bright/saturated colors.\n\nI would say this game is definitely worth playing, but I truly hope the Devs make it so it runs at 60 FPS, and you can swap out the color pallete of the ink with different palletes, like monochromatic, split complementary, and other color schemes, rather than just super bright colors.\n\n8/10, I will be playing this more and more.","August 5, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Platformers aren't really my thing, but this game is a welcomed exception.\n\nI usually don't do reviews but this game does deserve one.  This is probably one of the more challenging platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  And I love a good challenging game.  Makes me think over just what it is that I have to do in order to advance to the next part of the level; how can I make this jump; how is this jump even possible; how do I even get that coin?!\nThis game forces you to think fast, something I'm not used to, but something I definitely appreciate.  The fast pace of the game only adds to the challenge, because you have to tap your keys just enough to make that landing or risk overshooting it.  Oh man, and the complexity of the jumps you have to make is just well thought out.  Kudos to the developer for putting complexity into simplicity.\nThe only thing that I am kind of frustrated with is...my tendency to hit the 'A' button when really I want to hit the 'D' button.  Damn me and my weak hand-eye coordination.\n\nBut overall, I give this game a 9/10.  Why?  Because sometimes a simple game can be just as good as a game like Skyrim.

Too bad you can't see the levels. Atleast when you first look at it. The idea is to paint the level so you can see where to stand and where you have to go by double jumping or killing yourself. This way you splatter paint everywhere around you which tags the invisible platforms.\n\nEvery level is going to take a few tries since you obviously are going to die alot if you don't know where the platforms are. You even get achievements for dying, so don't be ashamed of just killing yourself in places you haven't painted yet.\n\nThe game has 75 levels in total, with 3 bosses at 25, 50 and 75. Before 25 and 50 the levels are somewhat easy and shouldn't be too hard, but when you get to 50-75, you'll start to feel the pain the game is all about. Alot of that good old skill-based platforming with spikes, turrets and stuff like that. But it's gonna ♥♥♥♥ you off.\n\nAnd for the completionists out there, you're gonna enjoy this game. A lot.

INK focuses on the core idea of splatting paint/ink to uncover the way to progress. Simple yet effective use of this avoids overcomplicating the gameplay, and allows players to learn from mistakes and see what they learn applicable in later stages. This is effectual as the difficulty gradually increases each level. INK offers around 1-3 hours of gameplay in it's current state, depending on skill level. Visually, INK offers a pleasant, simplistic style filled with colour. Music-wise it's okay, nothing spectacular.\n\nINK is relatively cheap, and I'd recommend picking it up if you're a fan of platformers. Sure it hasn't reinvented the genre, but it is still an enjoyable and fun game. I do however sincerely hope the developer will do more updates, adding more content. Especially to add some options I expect to be in any PC game including; allowing for 60 FPS or above, setting your own resolution, and finally windowed mode.

With that in mind; I beat the game in one sitting in 94mins (my playtime may go up to farm cards). With 75 levels the game is broken into thirds with a boss marking each 25th level. The real challenge isn't found until the final third of the game. It takes the Super Meat Boy endless life approach with short levels, slidy controls, wall jumping, double jumping and blood stains left over from the last life. There is even a similar behaving key system and similar "smart" projectiles in that challenging final third of INK. The one unique thing it has going is that every level starts blind. And your "blood" is colorful ink that paints your surroundings and reveals the task at hand. Deaths as well as double jumping spews the colorful ink about. Its interesting in its own right but I wish the rest of the game was as original.\n\nWhile I had fun and enjoyed the challenge my recommendation is very reserved. Its too short and way too familiar to pay full price for even if that price is low.

Controls are tight and level desing is interesting enough to keep you playing throught the game. There are three bosses you have to defeat, but these boss fights aren't anything special or that memorable.\n\nThe world and atmosphere stays the same throughout the game. Calm ambient music and the same look of the world follows you the whole game. I would have loved to see a little more variance in music and atmosphere between the games three differrent worlds.\n\nInk doesn't have any kind of options or settings and is locked at 30fps, which is a shame, but the game is simple enough so there really isn't that big of a need for any of those. Developer is currently working on adding an option for keybindings and 60/30fps toggle so that is a big plus.\n\nOverall I liked this short charming game, although it had potential to be much better. It is not that memorable or super unique, but the core gameplay is solid enough and it is pretty cheap, so I would recommend this for those who like simple platformers and don't mind the short length of this game.","September 20, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

INK doesn't offer an explicit narrative. What INK has going for it is your ability to spray multi-coloured ink droplets around you (in random size) to reveal the landscape to you. Yes, every level starts out as invisible. Ink (either sprayed, or tracks left by the player and enemies) works as your guide through each of the 75 levels.\n\nHowever, that is it's only real "original" leg to stand on. You'll see a lot of industry standard mechanics (spikes, wall jumps, double jumps, moving platforms). Some levels also seem to be re-used but with different enemy placements. Speaking of enemies, they require one jump on before destruction (hello, Mario).\n\nDifficulty Curve and Fairness\nINK has a very gradual learning curve -- the first 5 or so levels acting as a tutorial, and gradually increasing in difficulty all the way to the end of the game. The final "level" is definitely the most difficult.\n\nINK does not contain checkpoints. You die, you start the level over. However, the level remains uncovered after each death (i.e. it doesn't become fully invisible again). This is pretty brutal coming to later levels, especially when the "secrets" hidden in each level require risk to reach, and they get reset if you die before completing the level.\n\nArt Style and Looks\nA minamalistic approach, INK isn't strong in its visuals, if that's what you consider important. The main character is literally a white square. Enemies are colour changing rectangles. Keys are key-shaped. Levels are chunky and cubic. Bosses - a triangle, a rectangle and a circle with a beam. Backgrounds - consistently black void.\n\nMusic and Soundtrack\nThere are seven tracks - title screen, tutorial levels, world 1, world 2, world 3, bosses, credits. Considering that each 'world' is about 20 levels, you'd better get used to looping 3-minute tracks if you sit and play in a long session, like I did. The music does suit the overall feel of the game however.\n\nStory\nIf it's there, I don't see it. Maybe the dev went for an "interpret this as you will" approach, but either way, there's no explicit storyline. If story is important to you, you'll feel lost in INK.\n\nBosses offer no explanation either. Enemies have no name or lore. The ending is nothing. You beat the last boss and credits roll.\n\nGlitches/Bugs\nSometimes, you can perform triple jumps if you land and jump on nearly the same frames.\nAs well as this, the game crashes at a consistent point every time in the credits roll. The music continues, a window pops up, and the game ends. Not great.\n\nFinal Notes\nINK is worth a go if you don't mind a lack of story, you want familiar concepts and solid platforming. The game did only offer me about 2 hours of gameplay before I finished it. I wasn't in awe playing it; there is no real reason for me ever to go back and revisit.\n\nI'd give INK a 5/10. Nothing spectacular, nothing abysmal; it's OK for what it is. It's a dislike because there's not enough in the game making me want to like it. Oh well. Hopefully this can be an experience to improve upon.","October 4, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The focus is that, the "blood" is colorful ink and is used to reveal the level which is otherwise hidden. The game starts out great and continues well until around level 60 where it becomes absurdly difficult and you'll end up dying like 200 times before completing a level. The game suffers from a lack of rebindable controls as well as the occasional hiccup in jump responsiveness. Also, the controls have a tendency to be inconsistent, a issue that becomes glarily obvious in the post 60 levels. Finally, the game is so short that even at 5 dollars its too expensive (its just 90 minutes long).

It is rather... colorful.\n\nINK is a really simple game but not necessarily easy. Some levels took long time to beat and rewarded me with lots of satisfaction. If you like platformers, go ahead and buy this one. This game may be annoying at times but it is not due to glitches or anything bad about it, it just takes some effort and patience to beat all the levels. I really enjoyed the way it was made, its graphics side is really appealing. Howerver, unlike most of the mid and end-game levels, the bosses are quite easy so don't expect epic boss fights.","March 25","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looks fantastic.\nThe paint gimmic is really cool too. When you die or double jump it paints the black screen and you see more of the map. Its a neat spin on things. The music fits the game nicely however Its a bit simple and gets samey after a while but not really an issue.\nIts locked to full screen and that upsets me a tad. It also auto sets its self to your screen size.\n\nComplaints aside. It controlls really really well. It feels like I'm playing meatboy again and thats a really good thing.\nIt also has a really good learning cerve. Its not torture off the bat and that was my fear. the first 30 - 50 levels are not to bad but then it gets a bit more hardcore. I intend to work my way to the end.

The game is super fun, and makes you think and die a couple times to get to know the level. What is even better, is that you uncover the level.\n\nThe levels in INK are invisible. It is your job to spurt ink, (hence the title), to uncover the level. The levels get harder and harder, until you end up dieing, like, 30 times per level, or more than 30. As you play through the game, you are introduced to new concepts, such as enemies, spikes, moving platforms, and bosses. Bosses in the game are similar to most platformer bosses: hit it 3 times, (In this game, you need to hit the bosses 4 times), and it dies. The game is sorta like Super Meat Boy, with bits of Mario in it.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game, and it's cheap: $4.99. If you like platformers, such as Mario, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda, then will love this game.","October 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Splat the walls with ink to see where you're going, and watch out for death spikes and projectiles. That's it. It's simple, but the concept is used properly and the stage design works well with it.\n\nAnyone who loves challenging platformers in general will have a lot of fun with INK. It won't take you very long to complete on your first run through (maybe about 2 hours) but there are plenty of achievements for those out there who have more patience than I do. However, I don't entirely think it's worth the $4.99 right now, simply due to how short it is. You might finish it too fast to justify your $5. So, overall, wait until it goes on sale, then have yourself a short, fun, rage-inducing time. =)","November 15, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/385710/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","INK is a very basic 2D platformer game whose central premise is that the entire level starts out invisible to the player. You play a square – some sort of ink sponge? I don’t really know – who can double jump and wall jump. Every time you touch any surface, you put ink on that surface, revealing it. Every time you double jump, you spurt out ink, revealing nearby surfaces. There are also some square enemies which slide around the level, revealing surfaces, and some things which shoot triangles or circles at you, which explode into bursts of ink when they strike surfaces. And if you die, you shoot out a bunch of ink, revealing the area around where you died.\n\nThe goal is to navigate through each level without dying, either by touching any of the edges of the screen (including the top and the sides) or by touching an enemy’s sides or a projectile. If there are enemies in the level, you must stomp on all of them to make the exit open up.\n\nInk is persistent in levels between deaths, meaning that successive attempts on each level get easier as the level gets increasingly revealed. While this is convenient, it also means that the exploration aspect of the game is lessened. This isn’t really a bad thing per se, but it means that the mechanic has less of an impact than it might seem at first glance.\n\nDeaths are, thankfully, extremely short, with the square respawning within a second or two at the start of the level. This is very convenient, and is a good feature for a game like this. The game is quite easy at the start, but gets progressively more difficult; it is never TOO hard, though, and always feels fair.\n\nThe game is extremely simplistic. The enemies all just slide along the ground, wandering back and forth like square goombas. The projectile things shoot rhythmically. Platforms are platforms. There are some moving platforms later in the game – some helpful, some of which try to crush you to death – as well as some spiked walls, which are instant death to touch. Some of the levels also have keys, which get rid of “lock blocks”, squares with keyholes on them which are instantly banished when you collect the appropriate key.\n\nThere are also 20 little circles with hearts in the middle of them hidden throughout the game; collecting one, then completing the level with it, collects it permanently.\n\nThere ae three bosses in the game as well, at levels 25, 50, and 75. Each has their own unique mechanic. None are particularly difficult, and I beat the final boss without dying while fighting it.\n\nAll the levels are very short, as is appropriate for a game like this. There are 75 levels in all, though, and I beat the game in 78 minutes – and collected 17 of the 20 collectables in that time, without any sort of guide at all. It took me another 5 minutes to collect the last 3 collectibles, giving me a total playtime of 83 minutes, during which not a single Steam trading card dropped.\n\nSome might think that the game being so short is a bad thing, but this is inaccurate; the game is as long as it should be. Frankly, the mechanics were pretty much exhausted by the end of the game, and the central mechanic of revealing the levels as you went through them with ink just didn’t lend itself to certain sorts of complicated puzzles. And indeed, in many of the later levels, the projectiles constant motion and spattering meant that the level was often largely revealed by the time I went through it anyway, sort of nullifying the central mechanic.\n\nIndeed, in the end, the central mechanic of revealing the levels with ink is really a visual gimmick to make the game look more visually interesting. It succeeds at that; despite the game’s very basic visuals, it never really felt like it was visually boring in the way of many cheap 2D indie games.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that it is simply utterly unexciting. Once you realize that the ink thing is just a visual gimmick, you’re down to basic 2D platformer gameplay with bog-standard mechanics. I’ve played lots of 2D platformer games which are fundamentally exactly the same as this game, and while this game isn’t terrible, it is generic and completely unremarkable.\n\nAll in all, I can’t recommend it, but not because it is bad. It is simply thoroughly mediocre. The only thing it has going for it is the ink gimmick, but after a while you stop even noticing it so much, and when you get to the end, you’re probably going to be left feeling like you did a thing, and that was that.\n\nIf you DO get this game for some reason, keep in mind its very short length while purchasing it; if you are looking for something which is going to last you a while, this is not the game for you.\n\nIf you already own this game, this is an hour-long 2D platformer with okay mechanics and level design, and is a very quick download; if you’re really itching for a quick 2D platformer scratch, this isn’t a terrible choice, though there are lots of better games in the genre. But if you’re looking for anything remarkable, you’d best look elsewhere.","February 18","false","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I like challenging games, I like platformers (provided they are at least somewhat innovative), and I'm always appreciative of cool art styles, especially when they are germane to the gameplay (which this one certainly is!). I think it's the fact that for every good thing I can say about INK, there's some kind of ugly caveat following it.\n\nThe paint splattered everywhere in the darkness is beautiful, BUT the game's art is otherwise rather boring. The platforms are just rectangles of varying dimensions (with no colour, as per the game's premise), that move at varying speeds, sometimes with spikes on them. There is never any curve or slope, beynond horizontal and vertical. It's a shame because using this mechanic of revealing platforms with colour should entail a joy of discovery, but it simply isn't there. All you find is rectangle, after rectangle, after rectangle. Even your character and your enemies are simple geometric shapes.\n\nINK is challenging, BUT not always in a satisfying way. Again, I'm struggling to pin down why this is. I think it's to do with the game mechanic all but requiring death as a means of progressing forward, since as you die, ink sprays out to your surroundings to illuminate how you died and how to do better next time. I like this in principle, but it cheapens death until it feels like it has no impact except maybe a slight semi-indifferent annoyance.\n\nThe game's concept is neat and original, BUT once the levels are illuminated after many pointless deaths, the game loses all of its originality, and the fact that it's a Super Meat Boy clone becomes painfully obvious. In fact, the painting of walls while wall jumping or dying was clearly inspired by Super Meat Boy. Your character even looks a little like Meat Boy, and the enemies all seem to be based on enemies or hazards found in Super Meat Boy. There are also secret pickups, much like the band-aids in Super Meat Boy (although the fact that they're invisible until your ink illuminates them is pure genius!).\n\n~~~\n\nI definitely think there's something to this idea, but I feel like there needs to be more. I would like to have seen a more interesting art style and level design, maybe with a 3D look? I like the idea of things in the background that get sprayed with ink and objects in levels being more concrete in theme (e.g. the platforms and background could take on an alleyway theme, or a construction site theme, etc). I also wouldn't object to a more open, metroidvania-style world structure, where your previously splattered ink could mark your way.\n\nEnemies could be more varied as well, and fit better into the theme. There could be an enemy that attacks you (rather quickly) if it gets covered in ink (but loses its ink upon death). Maybe, for a bit of puzzle-platforming flavour, there could be enemies that help you solve some kind of puzzle? I respect that this isn't a puzzle-platformer, but again I just feel like there needs to be something else to make this game memorable and something worthy of a recommendation.\n\nLook, I hate to do this to an independant developer. I always admire the innovative spirit, and I hope I've come up with some constructive criticism, but the question posed to me is "Do you recommend this game?", and the answer is simply "no".","February 18","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This story is about a man named Stanley, who was a fairly normal gamer who lived in apartment 427. One day, Stanley was staring at his copy of Splatoon, and Stanley realised he was tired of Splatoon's repetetive squid or kid nonsense and its rather relaxing third-person-shooter gameplay. Stanley wished from the bottom of his heart that he could play a game which was an infuriatingly difficult  indie action-adventure platformer akin to Super Meat Boy, with Steam trading cards and full controller support, but that this game was also just like Splatoon, with ink, lots and lots of ink, ink puns, and sick beats, but without all the kid squid stuff he despised. Stanley decided he would call this game INK. And at just that very moment, a man named Zack Bell, accompanied by a few other mysterious men, stepped forth from a bright light and presented Stanley with this game, the very game he had wished for, before disappearing back to Seattle, where he lived. And so Stanley sat and played this game night and day. Yes, he was sometimes angry at the game, but those moments were worth it, for the gameplay was so smooth and everything he had wished for. And so Stanley and his lovely little game lived happily ever after, never once caring about kids and squids again.","August 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are several ways to spread paint, such as simply moving, double jumping, defeating enemies and... Dying.\n\nYep. Dying.\n\nI absolutely adored INK for its very fast-paced gameplay and the whole concept of using paint to find the level. It is a very interestin ceoncept which was well made. Very, well made.\n\nThe game starts you off on very simple and easy levels but at a certain point, the difficulty of the levels suddenly shift and it becomes extremely hard to complete even a single level. You may spend possibly 30 seconds on one level, and then the next, you'll be stuck on it for about 15 minutes at the max. It does get a little frustrating, as after just being on a level for about 1 minute or so, the entire level is uncovered and it becomes a simple platformer, with just the colours of the area changing.\n\nThis needs to be pointed out, the soundtrack for the game is extremely well made and simply beautiful. It keeps in with the tone of the game but not when you're screaming your lungs out after dying for the 50th time on the same level. Still, lovely soundtrack.\n\nThe game is stuck at 30FPS which I honestly did not like very much, but that is just a matter of opinion and what you're used to.\n\nThe game is a little short, so be warned. It took me about 2 hours to finish all 75 levels, and that's it. You can go back to collect all the coins, and get 100% completion, but just the minimum of finishing the levels is approximately 2 hours. It does leave me wanting a bit more, but I can say I am very satisfied.\n\nOverall, the concept of using paint to find the level is well made, the levels are good as well (including the rage inducing ones), music is amazing, and, though short, it has left a very strong impression on me. I would easily place it up there with many other great platformers. I highly recommend buying it just for the concept itself.","August 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is one of those. I'm not hating on it just because it borrowed some elements which contributed to SMB's huge success, because INK is also a brilliant game on its own and did innovate, not just plain copy. The level discovery mechanic works really well, the double jumps work as expected, and generally the game is wonderful all around. The only slight complaint I'd like to add is that the background music (at least for me) seems to always be the same song, which also isn't particularly fitting to the game.

This story is about a man named Stanley, who was a fairly normal gamer who lived in apartment 427. One day, Stanley was staring at his copy of Splatoon, and Stanley realised he was tired of Splatoon's repetetive squid or kid nonsense and its rather relaxing third-person-shooter gameplay. Stanley wished from the bottom of his heart that he could play a game which was an infuriatingly difficult  indie action-adventure platformer akin to Super Meat Boy, with Steam trading cards and full controller support, but that this game was also just like Splatoon, with ink, lots and lots of ink, ink puns, and sick beats, but without all the kid squid stuff he despised. Stanley decided he would call this game INK. And at just that very moment, a man named Zack Bell, accompanied by a few other mysterious men, stepped forth from a bright light and presented Stanley with this game, the very game he had wished for, before disappearing back to Seattle, where he lived. And so Stanley sat and played this game night and day. Yes, he was sometimes angry at the game, but those moments were worth it, for the gameplay was so smooth and everything he had wished for. And so Stanley and his lovely little game lived happily ever after, never once caring about kids and squids again.","August 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is one of those. I'm not hating on it just because it borrowed some elements which contributed to SMB's huge success, because INK is also a brilliant game on its own and did innovate, not just plain copy. The level discovery mechanic works really well, the double jumps work as expected, and generally the game is wonderful all around. The only slight complaint I'd like to add is that the background music (at least for me) seems to always be the same song, which also isn't particularly fitting to the game.

You must get to the end of the level, and more requirements are necessary to get there as the levels progress from defeating enemies and unlocking areas. More mechanics are gradually introduced, often shocking you at first but nearly immediately becoming easy to understand so no tutorials are necessary. The mechanic of revealing the platforms around you is done as well as I'd like it to be done, and as the main gimmick I feel it was a strong point, however....\n\nAfter the first boss the difficulty increases dramatically. This however is a nice change from the fairly easy preceeding levels. After the second boss, the difficulty changes for the worse, making most levels just a matter of memorizing the exact second to jump, trying to ignore the constant screen shaking from enemies and ink splattering, and trying your hardest to do everything frame perfect. Combined with the inertia and sloppy controls, it makes it more frustrating than fun. Combined with heat seeking missles that are faster than you, it becomes a real chore. The final boss was a good design, however how to damage it seemed inconsistent - what would hurt it one time kills you another with no discernable reason as to why. There is some replay value as there's a hidden item in (seemingly) each level, however I would not be inclined to play through again to collect them.","February 21","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The tracking missile gimmick was one of the worst un-fun things I ever had the displeasure of playing.  I can't imagine the developer actually enjoys playing those levels, but he left them in because they can be considered difficult when in reality they are just tedious.  The bosses were waaaaay too easy I beat all 3 my first try and the final boss was a complete joke.  That had to be the most poorly designed boss I've ever played and I've played hundreds of horrible "I wanna be the guy" fangame bosses.  During the game there is multiple levels that are just pure copy/pastes of previous levels with very slight difficulty added.  This is a terrible design choice because you are rewarding the player with the same level after they just beat it moments ago.  The game took 1 hour to beat blind and I think it could have been fun with a few better design choices, but as it stands it's too short and definetly not worth 5$.","February 22","false","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

My intention wasn't to even play this game but saw a couple videos of game play and actually got really excited to play it. I am now on level 24 at the time of writing this review and I have a few things to say.\nI know the whole, you haven't even got to a good level, you are mad because you are just bad, you need to play a game before making a review. I don't care as I am taking the view of someone who is new to the game and here a couple flaws i have found.\n\nI'll start with some positives, the game looks ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Its like the pixel gods have blessed the creators. The idea behind it I really like the sound and look of. The game is colourful and this is something that can be hard to find as the colours are used in the right way.\nI can see how this game would be really fun - and I was enjoying myself at the start of the game - but then I ran into a couple problems.\n\nRight from the start, handling yourself in the air is hard. It is a massive struggle to change directions whilst in the air. I feel like sometimes you move really quickly and sometimes you don't. When jumping up a wall, sometimes you shoot off the top of it at a really quick speed, this then leads to dying most of the time because I can't turn around to get back to the platform I was on. Killing enemies is also quite hard as when you land on them you slide straight off. This becomes extremely frustrating at times. In regards to in air movement, its like going over to a friends house who has the same mouse sensitivity but they have mouse acceleration on and you just can't control it.\n\nI had very high hopes for this game but I was fairly disappointed. The game needs to have adjusted in air movements so that it is a bit easier. I will make a new review if I begin to 'master' the game because I feel that with this game, you are either good or bad and there is no in between. I don't recommend this game as it is very hard to get started and the in air controls need to be fixed. Other than that, the game is pretty good. And yes i have the badge lv 5 and foil badge, I personally think that the badges and backgrounds look pretty good.","February 24","false","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Not perfect, but it is very fun. :)\n\nPROS\n------\n\n- Great clean aesthetic. Reminds me of '140' (not in terms of its music, but it's 'abstract platformer' design).\n- Excellent controls. This is a big one. If a game like this didn't control well, that'd be a deal-breaker from the start.\n- Pleasant background music.\n- Fun boss fights and just a great 'chill and play' vibe. I dig it a lot.\n\nCONS\n------\n\n- Lack of rebindable controls. This doesn't bother me much (since I prefer playing on a controller - and the only button you use is 'A' to jump), but I can see how this would be a hindrance to some.\n- Lack of an 'Options' menu of any kind. You either play the game or you don't play the game - that's it. Volume, Resolution, Screen Size - none of that can change. This is a bummer because...\n- I suffered from horrendous lag/slow-down - especially on the later levels. Maybe there were too many paint particles on the screen at one time. I dunno. The fact is - the game became so slow that it was unplayable. I reached level 74 of 75...so I may stop there. With such a clean, simple aesthetic this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nGranted, I don't have the most powerful computer in the world, but games like 'Shovel Knight', 'Oniken', 'Shantae and the Pirate's Curse' - and virtually every other 2D game I own - play perfectly fine. So, such laggy performance is a bit of a shock. Perhaps this can be addressed in a future update.\n\n- Also, the pacing is a little weird. After introducing a few gameplay mechanics, there's level after level after level where nothing seems to change - and then projectiles are introduced, which was appreciated. Good ideas are here, but I think it would have been better to see more of them. Thus, the game does not play as smoothly as it could. Also, the boss levels seemed too few and far between. Just my opinion. >_<\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n-------------------\n- Overall, it's a really fun game. Except for some technical issues, it really plays quite well. No story or characters to speak of, but great arcade-like platforming action. A great way to spend an afternoon if you ask me. :)\n\nFinal Score: 7.5 out of 10","August 6, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And while INK may not have the ultra-polished controls and level design of Super Meat Boy, it's still a fun game that's worth playing.\n\nI did have a bit of trouble with the double jump mechanic - if I jumped off of a ledge at the last moment, it would often count me as having already left the platform, and I'd only get the second jump of my double jump.\n\nSmall issues aside, I thought the whole ink gimmick was pretty cool, and it's a surprisingly pretty game for being so lo-fi.

Its a game that you can"t beat the first time, you have to die to be ables to see the room better.  (similar to the blood spray in super pig only more colorfull) also they need to have a mute button for the sound and music, so hard to make steam calls with the backround noise.

There is one problem however that makes it diffficult to complete this simple and awesome concept, in order to add a difficulty, once you have painted the entire stage, they added a momentum based movement. seeing that there are small platforms to land on, preforming a wall jump and then landing on said platform it is common to go flying off of it. This momentum will also continue if you land on an enemy, if you land on an enemy that is close to the edge of the stage you will be forced to continue your momentum to your death. Though it has an awesome concept, dying, due to flying farther than you want, is a bit too common. I cannot say if the evel design helps this mechanic once reaching farther levels due to not wanting to play a frustrating game.","May 4","false","0.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ionic/recommended/385710/","Ionic","Spore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ionic/","854 products in account","Alright, bought it and beat it in a comfortable single sitting. The game is very short. It will probably take an hour and a half to beat even with finding most of the collectibles. The game controls fairly close to Super Meat Boy with double jumps and wall clinging, except in this game your character has a bit less inertia/accelerates quicker and ungrips walls faster if you hold off of them. The jumping is also a bit quicker. Meat Boy gets lots of air time but ink-square falls pretty quickly. Ink also has a double jump which allows you to change your velocity much more than just holding a direction. It's all a bit less easy to control than Meat Boy, but it is serviceable. The visuals were nice. All very clean and colorful, and it is fun to see layers and layers of ink cover the environment. All the characters are basic geometric shapes such as square, triangles, and circles, but they fit the aesthetic fine. The sound is super basic, and the soundtrack wasn't memorable, but I didn't tire of it (or notice it at all really).\n\nFor me the biggest issue of the game is that the whole paint the level mechanic really doesn't matter very much. Every double jump makes Ink-square "spit" ink drops all around him, blotting bits of obstacles all around him. I feel this mechanic is supposed to be more interesting than it actually is. Each level you can't see any ground except what you're standing on and areas with enemies (which also leak ink onto the environment), but after a few double jumps your path is clear. When I got to a new level I would just try to complete it blind which do to the predictable placement of ground isn't very difficult to do. As I went through I'd cover large swaths of the stage in one life so by the time I died it pretty much became just another platformer. Your paint stays after each death (in fact, dying makes a huge splatter all around you to cover objects) so just throwing yourself around a few lives will almost completely paint the level. Sadly, by the third act of the game, the developer also started running out of ideas it seemed. Most levels at that point put the whole challenge on dodging little homing projectiles like those annoying homing monsters in the Hell part of Super Meat Boy. They weren't fun in that game either. All stages are relatively small, either confined to a small square space or presented in a line. I think this is what made the ink mechanic fall apart a bit. Even without being able to see anything you know where you're supposed to go. Being able to grip walls makes it even easier to blindly barrel through levels since if you don't make a jump (because you can't see it!) you'll probably just stick to the wall of the platform anyway.\n\nThere's also collectibles you can find by squirting ink in inconspicuous and out of the way portions of some levels. I got around 12 out of 20 on my first run, so they are at least decently hidden and some require you to go off the main path to find them. The other part of the game were the 3 boss fights. They kind of reminded me of Super Mario Brothers boss fights where they basically amount to dodging an attack and jumping on its head a few times, but they were at least well designed. They are all kind of pretty looking and the last one was particularly cool (he's in the trailer if you look).\n\nOverall, it was okay. It's a platformer and it's cheap. I had fun.","August 7, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the way the game plays and feels. It manages to introduce you to little obstacles one at a time and then throw various other challenges at you to see how well you can deal with them; this is the kind of game design I feel should be implemented into any game. The controls feel slippery at first, but you eventually get used to it. While the boss battles aren't especially hard, they give you that "ah ha" moment when you figure out the boss' pattern. My only complaint about this game is that it felt too short. It's $4.99, but I wanted so much more. Perhaps a level editor could have alleviated this. Otherwise, it's a darn good game and deserves your attention.\n\n8/10","September 8, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would not say its worth 5$. maybe $1.99\n\nI would do a TLDR but this is a simple game thats getting a short review. Basically you are a white block trying to go through a rainbow gate. The paths are quite challenging. It is abstract in nature, with no story line. Gameplay is akin to games like Super Meat Boy, however the one thing that seperates this game from other games is that the inital level has no colour. The walls only get colour when either your block or a "enemy" block either slides on it or splashes on it by some means, or dies. I said "enemy" because the foes in this game are as aggressive as Mario Gumbas, they are peaceful, but will kill at the touch. There seems to be a extremely large amount of levels, but edventually it does get boring, as every level has the same goal, kill the foes, doudge arrows, find out the level, get through the gate.","September 8, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

INK plays a lot like SMB, and although I don't feel it's quite as tight to control as that game it certainly has more than enough nuance to pull off some of the tougher levels. The artstyle is a joy - splattering the world with ink as you bounce around is very satisfying.\n\nVideo:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498551347\n\nGets pretty challenging towards the end in particular - I spent 20+ minutes on some of the later levels (a successful runthrough being maybe 10-25 seconds). There's a lot of trial and error to learning the levels - not helped by the paint mechanic, honestly - but there is a lot of skill required too.\n\nHoming turrets in particular can feel very tough to avoid until you work out how to manoeuvre around each individual one. There's one particular level, and the final boss fight also, which almost certainly required a fair chunk of luck on my part coinciding with some good play. Very satisfying though, short but sweet.\n\nThe levels being invisible to start with should make for some interesting speedruns, too. Just going back through the first few sections I was able to clear some mostly from memory - so I'm certain a practised speedrunner could play through the whole game like that, which would be pretty fun to watch.","August 14, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I'm afraid I will probably finish the whole thing in a little more than an hour I do like the concept. I will just use the standard con/pro list to explain.\n\nPRO:\n-Unique concept\n-Pretty game pretty music\n-Controls well (with a controller)\n-I just love these kind of platformers\n-Fun (but slightly too easy) Bossfights\n\nCON\n-Seems too short for the full price (glad I got it on sale)\n-A bit too much inspired by Super Meatboy (controls like meatboy without a run button and almost every obstacle like spikes, Character seeking missiles, keys to open up locked blocks and more is close to the same.\n-Level design is repetetive\n-Jumping on enemies feels uncontrollable and buggy\n-Menu is missing basic options\n\nCONCLUSION\nSo first of all get Super meatboy first. It is just a better game! But if you finished that and want some more fun levels with a slightly unique feel get this game when it's atleast 50% off. under those circumstances I recommend it. But DONT get it if you don't love platformers because the INK mechanic will get boring quickly.","December 29, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are reasonable, execpt when it comes to jumping on the enemy/checkpoint things.  Instead of simply breaking through them like a checkpoint or bouncing off them like an enemy the player does a half-hearted bounce off their tops.  This seems like a good idea, but it means you're always in air-control mode for a little bit longer than you should be, with momentum you can't manage and a double jump that doesn't reset.  Oh and they can kill you and force a restart if you land next to them instead of on them, a feat which is surprisingly possible on even the smallest of platforms.\n\nI'm sure that with more practice I could get used to the strange controls and get good at it, but I don't think it's worth the effort.","March 4","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

INK plays a lot like SMB, and although I don't feel it's quite as tight to control as that game it certainly has more than enough nuance to pull off some of the tougher levels. The artstyle is a joy - splattering the world with ink as you bounce around is very satisfying.\n\nVideo:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498551347\n\nGets pretty challenging towards the end in particular - I spent 20+ minutes on some of the later levels (a successful runthrough being maybe 10-25 seconds). There's a lot of trial and error to learning the levels - not helped by the paint mechanic, honestly - but there is a lot of skill required too.\n\nHoming turrets in particular can feel very tough to avoid until you work out how to manoeuvre around each individual one. There's one particular level, and the final boss fight also, which almost certainly required a fair chunk of luck on my part coinciding with some good play. Very satisfying though, short but sweet.\n\nThe levels being invisible to start with should make for some interesting speedruns, too. Just going back through the first few sections I was able to clear some mostly from memory - so I'm certain a practised speedrunner could play through the whole game like that, which would be pretty fun to watch.","August 14, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is like Meatboy.  Survive the level.  If there are no enemies go straight to the door.  If there are enemies you have to kill them first.  Some objectives are locked behind familiar blocks until you get a key.\n\nSections of the game start to feel like they're dragging on, I will admit.  However, the game is paced well enough that if you start feeling this way then something new is about to pop up around the corner to liven things up.\n\nTwo personal downsides:\n* The controls feel a bit "floaty" at times.  Once you get used to them it doesn't matter too much though.\n* There is something odd about collision boxes and enemies that is made worse by trying to double jump off of the kill bounce.\n\nDespite those two things I was able to beat the game in about 2 hours.  For those that care, it looks to me the game may be capped at  30 FPS.","August 9, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is like Meatboy.  Survive the level.  If there are no enemies go straight to the door.  If there are enemies you have to kill them first.  Some objectives are locked behind familiar blocks until you get a key.\n\nSections of the game start to feel like they're dragging on, I will admit.  However, the game is paced well enough that if you start feeling this way then something new is about to pop up around the corner to liven things up.\n\nTwo personal downsides:\n* The controls feel a bit "floaty" at times.  Once you get used to them it doesn't matter too much though.\n* There is something odd about collision boxes and enemies that is made worse by trying to double jump off of the kill bounce.\n\nDespite those two things I was able to beat the game in about 2 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ionic/recommended/385710/","Ionic","Spore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ionic/","854 products in account","Alright, bought it and beat it in a comfortable single sitting. The game is very short. It will probably take an hour and a half to beat even with finding most of the collectibles. The game controls fairly close to Super Meat Boy with double jumps and wall clinging, except in this game your character has a bit less inertia/accelerates quicker and ungrips walls faster if you hold off of them. The jumping is also a bit quicker. Meat Boy gets lots of air time but ink-square falls pretty quickly. Ink also has a double jump which allows you to change your velocity much more than just holding a direction. It's all a bit less easy to control than Meat Boy, but it is serviceable. The visuals were nice. All very clean and colorful, and it is fun to see layers and layers of ink cover the environment. All the characters are basic geometric shapes such as square, triangles, and circles, but they fit the aesthetic fine. The sound is super basic, and the soundtrack wasn't memorable, but I didn't tire of it (or notice it at all really).\n\nFor me the biggest issue of the game is that the whole paint the level mechanic really doesn't matter very much. Every double jump makes Ink-square "spit" ink drops all around him, blotting bits of obstacles all around him. I feel this mechanic is supposed to be more interesting than it actually is. Each level you can't see any ground except what you're standing on and areas with enemies (which also leak ink onto the environment), but after a few double jumps your path is clear. When I got to a new level I would just try to complete it blind which do to the predictable placement of ground isn't very difficult to do. As I went through I'd cover large swaths of the stage in one life so by the time I died it pretty much became just another platformer. Your paint stays after each death (in fact, dying makes a huge splatter all around you to cover objects) so just throwing yourself around a few lives will almost completely paint the level. Sadly, by the third act of the game, the developer also started running out of ideas it seemed. Most levels at that point put the whole challenge on dodging little homing projectiles like those annoying homing monsters in the Hell part of Super Meat Boy. They weren't fun in that game either. All stages are relatively small, either confined to a small square space or presented in a line. I think this is what made the ink mechanic fall apart a bit. Even without being able to see anything you know where you're supposed to go. Being able to grip walls makes it even easier to blindly barrel through levels since if you don't make a jump (because you can't see it!) you'll probably just stick to the wall of the platform anyway.\n\nThere's also collectibles you can find by squirting ink in inconspicuous and out of the way portions of some levels. I got around 12 out of 20 on my first run, so they are at least decently hidden and some require you to go off the main path to find them. The other part of the game were the 3 boss fights. They kind of reminded me of Super Mario Brothers boss fights where they basically amount to dodging an attack and jumping on its head a few times, but they were at least well designed. They are all kind of pretty looking and the last one was particularly cool (he's in the trailer if you look).\n\nOverall, it was okay. It's a platformer and it's cheap. I had fun.","August 7, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are reasonable, execpt when it comes to jumping on the enemy/checkpoint things.  Instead of simply breaking through them like a checkpoint or bouncing off them like an enemy the player does a half-hearted bounce off their tops.  This seems like a good idea, but it means you're always in air-control mode for a little bit longer than you should be, with momentum you can't manage and a double jump that doesn't reset.  Oh and they can kill you and force a restart if you land next to them instead of on them, a feat which is surprisingly possible on even the smallest of platforms.\n\nI'm sure that with more practice I could get used to the strange controls and get good at it, but I don't think it's worth the effort.","March 4","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it as a part of a bundle and was curious. 5 minutes in I was thinking about the neat visual style and ambient music and how death is actually helpful in a way as it covers new hidden platforms. In fact, even running around covering platforms with ink was fun and I felt a bit of a Splatoon-ish satisfaction for covering as many surfaces as I could. You sort of swapped between scouting out platforms in a level and moving towards the level’s exit. Dying meant little other than a bit more ink near that platform you’ve been struggling on, making it a bit more visible. Finally, I thought, a nice stress-less, enjoyable platformer.\n\nOops. It was Super Meat Boy in disguise. I mean, I should’ve guessed. Slippery, momentum-based platforming where moving creates a color to show where you have been and where you have died. I don’t know what I was excepting.  I guess I was really just hoping for something a bit more relaxing after finishing some homework, buying the bundle containing and then giving it a play before bed.\n\nThere was one level that got me frustrated that was pretty early on. I had to do with having to jump from one side of the more longitudinal map to the other killing enemies to unlock the exit. I won’t get into too much detail but there were two enemies place on the far left/right, very close to the edge. When you touch the edge, you die. When you bounce off an enemy, you keep your momentum. So I tried and tried to make a huge jump up to the next platform and then jump on the enemy while also moving a little to the left to avoid hitting the edge but not too far to avoid falling or having the enemy run into me. And it gets weirder because the next level was a breeze. For some reason the game just really wanted me to experience this learning curve and really drive how a kind of minor scenario that could’ve been show through a much less frustrating experience. Heck, in the next handful of levels you don’t even really get close to the walls of the level.\n\nThis game, based off the little I’ve played, does this a lot. It has a just rude level that interrupts the occasional string of neutral or fun stages. Plus it’s hard to ‘hate’ at times as the visuals and music are very, can I say…relaxing? Interesting? Whatever it is, they kept me playing.\n\nMeat Boy is a hard game. And I’m the sort of person who isn’t a fan of difficult games despite their more rewarding pay off for beating a level. Completing a level begins to feel more like a chore than a challenge especially when it comes to a scenario where you see yourself die every 15 seconds only to give another shot at preforming perfectly in the same seemingly endless level where you spend 10 minutes dying on the same part only to move forward a little bit but still have to go through and die to the previous part a few more times. That’s kind of what Meat Boy is for me.\n\nIt’s only really when you’ve died plenty of times and the bit of ink that is flung up from your death stops helping you that thinks get frustrating. The ‘exploration phase’ is over and now it’s back to the grind stone to perfect your jumps in order to get past the level.\n\nI probably won’t finish it. I know it’s gonna become even more difficult and, well, if I want more stress I can just do Honor’s Bio homework.\n\nLike Meat Boy and colors? It’s a pretty cheap game, give a buy. It certainly got me thinking even if that wasn’t its intension. Oops.\n\nI’ll be honest though: I kinda just feel like someone played a ton of Meat Boy and found themselves trying to paint all the surfaces of each level for fun. XD\n\n[Wait. Did I just play a game for 20 minutes and then basically right an essay on it that compares it to Super Meat Boy while also analyzing what really seems to be the root of why I didn’t like that game too much either?

I got it as a part of a bundle and was curious. 5 minutes in I was thinking about the neat visual style and ambient music and how death is actually helpful in a way as it covers new hidden platforms. In fact, even running around covering platforms with ink was fun and I felt a bit of a Splatoon-ish satisfaction for covering as many surfaces as I could. You sort of swapped between scouting out platforms in a level and moving towards the level’s exit. Dying meant little other than a bit more ink near that platform you’ve been struggling on, making it a bit more visible. Finally, I thought, a nice stress-less, enjoyable platformer.\n\nOops. It was Super Meat Boy in disguise. I mean, I should’ve guessed. Slippery, momentum-based platforming where moving creates a color to show where you have been and where you have died. I don’t know what I was excepting.  I guess I was really just hoping for something a bit more relaxing after finishing some homework, buying the bundle containing and then giving it a play before bed.\n\nThere was one level that got me frustrated that was pretty early on. I had to do with having to jump from one side of the more longitudinal map to the other killing enemies to unlock the exit. I won’t get into too much detail but there were two enemies place on the far left/right, very close to the edge. When you touch the edge, you die. When you bounce off an enemy, you keep your momentum. So I tried and tried to make a huge jump up to the next platform and then jump on the enemy while also moving a little to the left to avoid hitting the edge but not too far to avoid falling or having the enemy run into me. And it gets weirder because the next level was a breeze. For some reason the game just really wanted me to experience this learning curve and really drive how a kind of minor scenario that could’ve been show through a much less frustrating experience. Heck, in the next handful of levels you don’t even really get close to the walls of the level.\n\nThis game, based off the little I’ve played, does this a lot. It has a just rude level that interrupts the occasional string of neutral or fun stages. Plus it’s hard to ‘hate’ at times as the visuals and music are very, can I say…relaxing? Interesting? Whatever it is, they kept me playing.\n\nMeat Boy is a hard game. And I’m the sort of person who isn’t a fan of difficult games despite their more rewarding pay off for beating a level. Completing a level begins to feel more like a chore than a challenge especially when it comes to a scenario where you see yourself die every 15 seconds only to give another shot at preforming perfectly in the same seemingly endless level where you spend 10 minutes dying on the same part only to move forward a little bit but still have to go through and die to the previous part a few more times. That’s kind of what Meat Boy is for me.\n\nIt’s only really when you’ve died plenty of times and the bit of ink that is flung up from your death stops helping you that thinks get frustrating. The ‘exploration phase’ is over and now it’s back to the grind stone to perfect your jumps in order to get past the level.\n\nI probably won’t finish it. I know it’s gonna become even more difficult and, well, if I want more stress I can just do Honor’s Bio homework.\n\nLike Meat Boy and colors? It’s a pretty cheap game, give a buy. It certainly got me thinking even if that wasn’t its intension. Oops.\n\nI’ll be honest though: I kinda just feel like someone played a ton of Meat Boy and found themselves trying to paint all the surfaces of each level for fun. XD\n\n[Wait. Did I just play a game for 20 minutes and then basically right an essay on it that compares it to Super Meat Boy while also analyzing what really seems to be the root of why I didn’t like that game too much either?
