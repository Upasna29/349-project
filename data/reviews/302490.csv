Each of the 30 levels contains 2 or 3 timed sub-levels. The story was typical, but well-written. The game is not very difficult, so don't expect brain-bending challenges. There isn't much replayability unless you're going for all gold stars. It took me approximately 5 hours to complete the game, but that included pauses. If you really enjoy casual games like I do, it's worth the full price. Otherwise you might want to wait for a sale.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

Usually such games are just boring, but in Ballad of Solar, if you play on Hard and trying to get all gold stars, you need to think and react really fast and there is just no time to be bored. Well designed, lack of bugs, really good piece of code.\nBut also one thing is missing here: achievements.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you a fan of time management games, this is for sure one of the best! You can buy and play it, it won't disappoint you.\nIf you a hard core gamer, but you're in the mood to play something easy, just set Hard difficulty and have fun for couple of hours.\n\nLike this review?

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Adventure and Heroic. Adventure mode is untimed and Heroic mode is timed.\n\nThere are total of thirty levels in total but in each of these levels has sub-levels within them. Some of them has at least two to three sub-levels.\n\nThe objective of this game is to complete given set of tasks before the time on the timer runs out. However, some tasks do require resources (food and/or woods) before they can be completed. Also, there're certain tasks that requires the help from certain characters in the game. All levels in the game can be replayed for better score.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent. I don't recommend getting this game at full price.","December 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

There is just enough strategy involved to make even the easy difficulty require some planning to succeed instead of just clicking as often as you can.  The levels are also short enough to serve a nice distraction if you are just after something quick to casually goof around with.  The graphics are mostly still images, but well designed.  The plot is amusing and hits almost every cliche possible for the genre.  While I was hoping for a more sandbox style town builder, I enjoyed the game enough to not regret the purchase.","July 21, 2014","true","5.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Ballad of Solar is an epic of a pampered prince who is trying to save his girl from the evil's of a wizard. The gameplay consists of 2 or 3 maps per level. Each map is a static board that has roads leading to objectives. Each objective is blocked by trees and rocks and holes. You need to manage resources to preform the task of clearing each object. More simply put, you click stuff on the map to clear it, then you move on to the next map. It's nearly imposible to lose a level, the storyline is all but annoying, and the voice acting is horrendous. However, the game has just enough fun to keep you ocupied. I am an achievement hound; I don't normally play games unless there's some achievements to unlock. I played this game to the end despite that fact. I picked this title up for $2 and at that price it's well worth it. I definately recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for a casual playthrough that requires little to no effort.","August 3, 2014","true","5.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/recommended/302490/","MuirDragonne","Muir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/","1290 products in account","Brief Synopsis\n\nBallad of Solar is an extremely casual "click everything until the level is finished" game. It's labelled as a strategy game, but really there is little in the way of strategy here.\n\nIn a nut shell, you travel from one level to the next. Each level has different goals to reach; once you've reached those goals you move on to the next level.\n\nLong Review\n\nStory: An evil sorceror has overthrown the kingdom and taken the princess captive. It's up to Solar (the princess's fiance) to restore the kingdom to its former glory and save the princess.\n\nGraphics: Each character is drawn really well in this game, with loads of personality attached to them.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The music and sound effects are pretty good, though the voice acting is hilariously terrible. I'd almost recommend the game just because of the horrible voice acting (it's a great source of laughs), but I won't.\n\nLength: I've played this game for just over two hours and have reached level 19 in that length of time. It should be apparent that this is an extremely easy game, based on this information. However, I do not know how many levels there are in the game as I can not finish it due to a bug which keeps me from moving on to level 20.\n\nReplayability: Each level is scored by giving you stars. If you're a perfectionist (and aren't hit by the bug I've run into), then the game is replayable only to get full stars for each level. Other than that, it really isn't worth replaying.\n\nIf it wasn't for the bug I managed to find, I would recommend this game to those of you who enjoy casual games. Because of this bug however, I'm going to have to give this game a thumbs down.\n\nIf you want to take your chances, then wait until the game is at an extremely cheap price.\n","December 7, 2014","false","2.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

And when they face something even they cannot handle, then one of Solar’s fairy tale friends (a peaceful ogre, sassy elf girl, wise wizard, grumpy dwarf smith) lends them a hand.\nThe trick is to do these tasks in a fast and efficient manner. As expected from the genre, the stages are on a timer, but there is a twist: each is divided into sub-stages with their own separate maps, so players always have to plan ahead.\n\nAll this work is for a noble cause, naturally, in our case saving the princess and the kingdom from the dark wizard who holds both in his clutches. Clichéd as hell, but the writing is really fun and tries to be as adventurous as a time management game can be, adding a lot to that final score you can see on top.","April 20","true","6.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

They also say BUT finishing every level perfectly takes some time, not true. The game is pretty nice and I personally decided to put the harder difficult on after finishing the first level. There were exactly 2 levels which I wasn't able to finish in time to get perfect result on first try.\n\nThe game also repeats itself pretty hard and bringing some new character into the game now and then won't really do much difference. It's more or less hovering mouse over your screen and clicking stuff now and then without much planning.\n\nI would still recommend this game for right price because it's nicely implemented even though it's short and repeats itself. Graphics are nice and game runs smoothly without any problems. The current 7€ is maybe little too much for the game that you finish in couple hours and which have little or none replay value. But still, if you are less than casual player this game can be lot of fun.","November 5, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is NOT click everything in sight - you do need some planning to get the gold stars.\n\n2. It does NOT require super speed reactions/clicks - there is a reasonable rhythm to the play, that is very pleasent.\n\n3. The game play doesn't seem to get harder, simply variations on different idea themes.  It is very nice to just play the game and not be continually challenged.\n\nIt is a CASUAL game (not really for hard-core) and suitable for anyone just wanting to relax and have fun.  That means that it should work well for children as well as older folks - not just teenagers.","December 20, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each level's score can be improved by taking less time to finish the tasks. The design is gorgeous and atractive and the story is cute but very common. I took around 5 hours to finish the game. It's worth.","September 19, 2014","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
