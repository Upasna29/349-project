The problem is, the back chunk of the game is atrocious. You're suddenly going from what I referred to a couple of friends as "Hard-Mode Portal" (same 'solve the puzzle room' gameplay, with two-button controls, even if it's opposing magnetic polarities rather than holes in time/space) into a terrible action title.\n\nI was going to recommend this with a caveat of "By the end, some puzzles become irritating due to the checkpoint system, where you may have to restart chunks of stage if you mistime a polarity swap or make a slight field mistake on some items", but no, when you suddenly have to begin juggling explosives to kill massive sahaguin and all sorts of tentacled beasties* whereas you were previously free to take time and puzzle things out? Ick. The final stages are the worst: one involves distracting and repeatedly-bombing a behemoth to reach an entrance within sight, and then the finale is an irritation because it combines waiting for enemy patterns with dodging instadeath and making precarious platforming leaps.\n\nIf you wanted an unpolished puzzle game, the first half or so is solid with little to no hand-holding (so it's got some brain-teasers for some of us). The latter bits, though? No. Nope no good no siree.\n\n* I only mention this because while I was blind to the latter half of the game going all Cthulhu, I'm told the marketing heavily sold it as such? Either way, multiple people assured me it wasn't the spoiler I assumed.","August 23, 2014","false","12.4"," 62 of 88 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","62","88","0","0"

But it's a good game that deserved more recognition because it's in many ways similar to Portal and Q.U.B.E.\nBut instead of using portals or cubes you'll be solving puzzles using your Magtech glove, a glove that allows you to magnetize stuff. The puzzles are creative and challenging (most of the times) but there are just too many of them. About 6-7 hours in I got bored. Some of the puzzles just take too long to solve, which, as a result, made me lose interest.\nBefore that happened I actually had a great time with it.

The magnetic aspect works reasonably well most of the time, but there are several instances where it is easy to get frustrated. During some of the later levels, the game starts to throw monsters at you in which you either have to kill or evade. The puzzle difficulty seemed to ramp up pretty well. Some of the final puzzles were indeed very tricky including many platforms with rotational paths that made them feel roller coaster like.\n\nCalling the story weird is an understatement. I think it comes close to the lines of Zeno Clash weirdness. But it comes off as very entertaining and keeps the suspense going throughout. The unfortunate aspect is that the story does not bring closure to a lot of things and the ending is basically up to the player to interpret.\n\nThere are many elevator sequences that seemed a bit excessive basically moving you from one level to the next. That seemed to be the primary method they chose to inject a lot of the narrative. The atmosphere during the final chapter is pretty amazing including Cthulhu himself.\n\nIf you are a fan of the first person puzzle genre, Magrunner: Dark Pulse is definitely a title worth picking up.","July 8, 2015","true","14.6"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","2"

Maybe!\nIt took me 10 hours to finish the game, a third of that is playing, another third is thinking, and the last third is dying.\nThis game is a « portal » copycat, with magnetism as game engine, but the physics are often imprecise.\nIt remembers me another game, bad rats, when you think the solution correctly, you build the solution correctly, but it may fail just because of some pixels offset, or even worse, won't do the same result between two identical simulation!\nA puzzle game can be hard and challenging, it's not the problem, but it shall not be « hard » to build the solution, it's just annoying and not enjoyable.\nI give three situations you will encounter in the game:\n- Sometimes you need many tries ( deaths ) just because the timing of platforms or cubes ( how hard is it to detect the peak altitude of a cube when you are riding it and then perform the correct imprecise jump!).\n- Often (very often), and despite of the zoom feature, you will send your « newton » (a castable magnetic point) instead of setting the magnetism of a device, because we are talking about pixel aiming here...\n- Sometimes, with the exact same configuration between two tries and when 3 or more magnetic points are involved, the result will differ, making you think your solution was bad at first. It's even worse when it happens on « catapults » because the cubes are snapped to the same precise position, so it's not even a targetting problem.\n\nWhen i play a puzzle game, i don't wan't to be blocked because a piece don't fit well, i don't call that a hard puzzle but a glitched puzzle.\n\nAnyway, the physics are also almost realist, it means when you expect to « capture » a charged object by using another object in vinicity, it will or not work depending of the momentum and the distance of the moving object, wich means some situations are complex but previsible, and added to the pre-existing points, you will be able and will need to place your own point (one at time) on almost any surface . In term of complexity, it worth the speed and direction conservation you have to master in portal when you use big falls to make big or long jumps ^^ This was the feature that made me go on to see what challenging puzzle was waiting for me in the next level, despite of the « glitches » i mentioned before.\n\nThe graphims are okay, and clear enough to focus on activable objects.\n\nThe story is a joke and the Cthulhu background is just a pretext to glue the puzzles together, don't expect epic fights ( there are only 2 kind of monsters, and they basically just walk towards you and you die on contact... the screenshoot are kind of lying btw. i suspect in early versions they just planned to use a countdown to add some stress) or deep story, everything is incoherent and not fun ( opposite to portal story), and the cutscenes are unskippable! ( remember i said you will die often not because you are not clever, but because of the unfair difficulty to build the solution, expect to see the same cutscenes often ). You will feel alone till the end.\n\nThere is a decent chance you won't finish the game because you won't enjoy it till the end, or even because it's too hard.\nYou may enjoy it if you don't mind loosing half of your play time because of the game and not because of you, the other half will show you how clever you are.\n\n","August 18, 2014","true","10.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

In fact, that's precisely what you pay for, and that doesn't disappoint in that regard.\n\nMagrunner: Dark Pulse is an interesting first person puzzle platformer. If you've played Portal or Quantum Conundrum, this is the style of gameplay but instead of portals or changing the dimension the room is in, you harness the power of magnetism. The gameplay is centered around using a Mag Glove to manipulate platforms, cubes and stationary objects to finish a level. This allows a level of thinking similar to other puzzle platformers, but the method was not explored until now.\n\nHow Does it Play?\n\nThe game is a real mind bender and has the player execute platforming skills while solving the puzzle on the fly. Not only are you switching the magnetism of something(attract/repel) but you're usually jumping along something at the same time. It usually works. However, the limits of the physics that the Unreal Engine has means now and then there will be moments where the physics will go hay wire and make you redo part of a puzzle again or kill you if you're dealing with explosive cubes or pit falls. Each puzzle takes about the time of what you would expect, about the same as a Portal puzzle room if you try it the first time. The difficulty curve is gradual and does not erratically change back and forth when progressing.\n\nOne feature of the game you recieve mid way through the game is Newton, a robotic dog you can attach to most surfaces that has his own magnetic pull(or repel depending on how you want to use him), I found this an interesting way to make the puzzles more interesting, changing the entire thought process on beating a level. However, I found Newton to be really hit or miss. Sometimes his magnetic pull and radius of it to be too small in some instances, when you have to guide along a cube on  wall to get it to the other side of a pit, sometimes the angle on which you're looking to move Newton will mean the cube is just barely out of reach of the "New" Newton, and you have to redo that part of the puzzle again(as in the cube respawns at a set point, not restarting from a checkpoint) Another point of dismay with Newt is you might end up spawning him when you don't want to, which can destroy progress on certain puzzles, which can be frustrating.\n\nThe Mag Glove itself, I must add, is responsive and easy to use, especially with the zoom feature that makes sure you're hitting the right thing when you're in larger areas, you can even hold down one of the mouse buttons to have it paint a laser over where you want to shoot, making sure you're always landing your charge changing shot where you want it.\n\nDespite Newton helping you along and the precision and reliability of your Mag Glove, the physics do not feel right in this game. While puzzles work as intended, it feels like the pulling strength is weaker than the repelling strength, which can throw off a players timing and how they are going about solving a puzzle. It also sometimes flat out doesn't work, sometimes you must ride a cube up a shaft or sling accross a chasm on one, and sometimes it just fails with no fault on the players end. Why this has yet to be fixed, I have no idea. Explosive cubes also sometimes blow up in the players hand for no reason, especially on the final boss fight.\n\nSpeaking of, (spoiler free!) the final boss/puzzle is, interesting. It's not bad, but because of a flaw with saving, it can become impossible. Explosive cubes are thrown at you if you're not fast enough stunning the one who's throwing them at you, and right when you die, you can pass through a save "gate" on the platform(s). If this happens, the level must be restarted. This segment of the final area feels tacked on as if they forgot they needed to make a final boss. The save system in general is wonky, you cannot save manual, and it only saves once you reach certain parts of the map, but since the levels do not progress in a set pattern or line, you may find yourself activating a save gate when you didn't want to, meaning, when you do more of the puzzle and die, you go back further than normal, as the gate does not activate again with the exception of a couple levels.\n\nAll in all, it is perfectly playable, but rough around the edges. If you're a fan of puzzles and platformers, and of course, Portal, then the game is for you. Now, onto the other bits of what the game offers.\n\nHow's the Story?\n\nBluntly, not good. It feels extremely cobbled together, as if the only thought of the entire development was "Portal x Cthulhu!" While an interesting premise, the execution falls flat on its face. None of the characters are likable, the dialogue feels wooden and unconvincing (especially form the antagonist) most if not all character interactions are done from holochat, basically the characters are projected above your mag glove, which is cool, and talk to you, nice idea but it doesn't help much with the story, especially when you die and have to listen and look at them over and over again.\n\nThe concept of a utopian, globally linked world with Cthulhu Mythos is interesting all the way through, but usually only through the imagery you actually see as you play through the game, later levels have a giant vision/hallucination of cthulhu, in a dark backround while you solve puzzles, it looks utterly incredible and scary. But it does not help the plot, the plot feels extremely shallow and cobbled together, as stated before. I can't emphasis that enough, the game really feels disjointed because of the story.\n\nHow Does it Look?\n\nGreat! The game runs on Unreal Engine 3, while aged, still manages to look great with this game, the texture work is fantastic. The latter levels that take place in space are awe inspiring, the nebulae, galaxies and planets swirl around you, the petrified/statues of hidious eldritch nightmares(and the living ones, too!) have real texture and a sense of slime to them. I admit however, the character models aren't that great, they seem modeled well with a good poly count, but they aren't animated very well, including all the people who holo chat with you and the Deep One monsters you encounter(the fish people), are not animated very well and are pretty unconvincing in their movement.\n\nThe game is fairly easy to run and should run fine on low end computers too. However, if you're playing at a high resolution(1080 p or higher) you will experience some incredible screen tearing, whcih can detract from the set pieces and overall look and flow of the game. Interestingly, vsync can be turned on to mitigate this, but you must do so through the config files, as well as AA, ambient occlusion and motion blur. Why these graphic options are not in the menu, I have no idea.\n\nHow Does it Sound?\n\nDecent. While not the best audio work i've heard, the music is fitting to the level at hand and the eerie and strange tone of the game, while keeping that futuristic, techy feel. The sound effects are great, the clank of a falling cube, the destruction of a wall, the sound of platforms sliding/being activated, the impact of the player as he lands on the ground.\n\nSadly, as mentioned before, the voicework is poor. Not only is it poorly acted, it feels very static when played and not mixed well into the overall sound of the game. For example, when you fall, Dax makes a yell/scream, but it's mastered so low you probably won't hear it unless you have headphones.\n\nGood game but flawed, needs work in quite a few areas. You'll get about 10 hours of gameplay your first run, and is enjoyable if just for the first time. However, wait for it to be on sale, $20 USD is a bit too much for this game, $12 feels more fair to the quality, content and length. Take it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it :)","January 4, 2014","true","11.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

It's fun in theory, but in execution it's just a more physics heavy Portal with less cleverly designed/more tedious puzzles.\n\nFirst off, the story. Is way too instrusive. In acts 1 and 2 you have elevator segments between a large portion of the levels that takes up a loading screen for essentially a cutscene... that is the same every time, just with a different person talking to you. The plot actually affects the gameplay very little in the first two acts, other than to make things take longer. All characters communicate via a hologram popping up over the magnet gun, but don't actually do anything. Sure, the scenery gradually degrades more and more, but that's about all that happens plotwise that is the slightest bit relevant to gameplay. Well until the third act when monsters start appearing.\n\nAnother issue is the tedium in the puzzles; there's a lot of waiting around for things to be in the right place and making mistakes can sometimes set you back quite a bit even if you don't die. On top of that there's a lot of trial and error involved (far far more than Portal) because of the physics engine, which is unfortunately not perfect enough for this kind of game. There's inconsistencies in how objects behave on occasion and it's often hard to predict what will happen until you test it. Some of the puzzle rooms are pretty big as well while also lacking in direction, leading to confusion not even part of the puzzle. The game also doesn't have a large enough variety in obstacles to keep things fresh; at some point things stop evolving (aside from the monster segments) and the puzzles start to get rather repetitious. Maybe digging deeper into a concept explored previously but it's not fresh enough to hold the interest. The game probably could've benefitted from being shorter, especially in the second act; that segment of the game took up probably 60-70% of my initial run playtime on its own.\n\nThe monster segments are also entirely out of place; they're alright when you know what to do but until you do they're largely trial and error, often almost expecting you to know what to do if you want to survive at all. There's not a large number of them and they're all confined to the end of the game, but they still really aren't a good fit for the formula. The final boss especially, since it is entirely possible to have the game autosave mere fractions of a second before you die, forcing a level restart. Plus there's a needlessly difficult platform hop involved. I thought we agreed that first person games and intense platforming are a combination that really has to be fine-tuned or excluded period. It's only a single hop done twice but it's a pretty fast moving platform and failure means death, soooo.\n\nThe game's on the whole not terrible, it's an interesting concept and there are some good puzzle designs here but there are far more bad puzzles than good and I wouldn't recommend it over its peers.","September 20, 2014","false","10.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

The Cthuluesque theme really didn't come into play until near the end of the game. It felt tacked on for 2/3, and then in the final 1/3, finally actually became a little more relevant as monsters were introduced.

Then this might be just the game for you.\n\nFirst off it’s a puzzle platformer that’s very similar to portal but instead of wormholes it uses magnets to propel you around each stage. It takes a little getting used to but after a couple tries you’ll be an expert at it. The levels range from super easy to figure out to hair pullingly tricky, and with the addition of timed achievements there is a lot of replay value if you get stuck and miss the deadline. The gameplay is simple and fun allowing you to traverse the environment with ease and making you feel pretty clever when you figure things out.\n\nThe characters are not the most developed but I enjoyed their interaction, as Spartan as they are. The world in which the game is set on the other hand is pretty interesting. A super corporation run by philanthropist billionaire who hopes to save the planet and explore deep space using magnets and his own version of Facebook, sure I’ll bite. And wouldn’t you know it; Cthulu gets summoned and crashes the party.\n\nThe stage design is pretty awesome as well. It starts out in a giant clean and efficient facility specifically designed to test magnets, just as it should be before it all goes wrong and everything descends into chaos and disrepair. Then when you finally get settled with the creepy underbelly of the facility the game jumps the shark by teleporting you into space and surrounding you with monsters both petrified and living. All the while aforementioned Cthulu is ever present watching your every step along the way.\n\nOver all it’s not a perfect game but it is well worth buying if on sale or at full price if you love the genre.

I would like to recommend the game, since a lot of work apparently went to it. Alas, I can not.\n\nAfter finishing, most of my memories of the game are of frustration and annoyance. I rarely do not finish a game I've started, and in the end I finished even this one, however not without a need of walkthroughs and a few day cool-down break from playing.\n\nGameplay:\nThe main gameplay mechanic is nice and easy to comprehend. There is almost no relation to how magnetims works in real world, buy that would hardly make for a fun game, so no problem there. The problem is that the the mechanics are quite apparently hacked on top of some physics engine, quite often don't make sense beyond the basic scenario (e.g. if you're catapulted on a top of a cube, and pick the cube mid-flight, you immediatelly lose all your momentum), or are downright broken (e.g. if you put two cubes on top of a catapult and leave the top one without a charge, the whole thing does not work). You're often reduced to trying all combinatorial options, because there is no telling how the components will interact without trying.\n\nStory:\nTaken as a Cthulhu mythos story, it's the worst I've seen, and, foremost, is not a horror. The high-tech sci-fi does not mix well with the eldritch. Also once the plot is revealed, there's not anything in the story to wait for.\n\nThe story progresses by the main character shouting at some other characters via a hologram here and then, is ridicullously cheesy ("I've never told you the truth about what happend to your parents"), annoying and the game would be better without it in my opinion. The voice-over and the lines are so annoying that I was muting the sound in the later stages of the game to avoid it. There's one exception, and that's the narrator of the story. If the story was only third-person narrated, it would be also better off I think.\n\nDesign:\nThe worst problem of the game. First, there's no logic to the design and it shows fast---at one point you escape "test rooms" by exiting through a hole since the door are blocked by rubble. However, if the rubble was not there, the test would be pointless---you could have just easily leaved it. It's not a big problem but illustrates the bad design.\nThere is no mental challenge to the puzzles. "Wait, what, you said you needed a walkthrough". Indeed, there are three other challenges:\na) As already said, more complicated interactions do not make much sense (e.g. elevator field works only on the elevator platform, but the platform interacts with a cube) and suggest a lot of "if-then" programming. Then there are buttons, which are pretty much a joker element. You have no idea what they do until you press them. It could be anything. It could literally summon Cthlulhu in this game for what it's worth.\nb) Pixel-hunt. Some of the levels are easily 10000 square meters big or more. You know what is necessary for the level, but you can't do it, because there's some field emmiter hidden in the hole in the corner and you only see it if you stand at the right spot and look in the right direction. And you can't FRIGGIN' RUN.\nc) Jumps. Often you need to jump on small, sometimes tiny, moving objects and if you miss you have to walk from bottom back up. And you can't FRIGGIN' RUN.\nd) "You said three challenges". Yes, but I was really annoyed about running. Most of the gameplay time I had was uselles walking. SLOW. Don't tell me that did not come up in the playtest. Hardly there was a feedback like  "You know what I liked about your game? All the walking back from the start after missing a jump."\n\nGraphics:\nNice visual effects and nice models. The levels were build up from components, there's no "soul" to the individual levels or sense of progression on a small scale. On a big scale you have three completelly different environments, and they are nice. Shame that the game does not support selecting a GPU so I had to play it on the lowest setting since it auto-decided to render on the integrated co-processor of my CPU instead of my NVIDIA 660 GTX, but that's the least of the problems.\n\nOverall I can't shake the feeling that this game was created by some guy with money, who had all these *great ideas* and wanted all the *cool stuff* and totally had to be the lead designer, and got some skilled people people for that, who were "if you wanna get you're wage, then shut up" at any time they tried to point out that some things do not really work.","February 24","false","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are much better Lovecraftian games than this and there are much better puzzle games than this. I am a big Lovecraft fan and I love all games Lovecraft. But this game just seems to ride on the Lovecraftian genre instead of adding anything to it. The story is underwhelming, however I must admit that it is really cool when ♥♥♥♥ starts to hit the fan and you hear some weird voices talk about Cthulhu. But other than that, the nouance dies out pretty quickly and becomes lackluster. Like I said prior, it doesn't add anything to the genre, it just abuses Lovecraftian fans to sell more copies.\n\nBut this game is not bad, it is just nothing special. It mashes together lovecraft and magnetic puzzle game mechanics. The puzzles are hard at times which is nice but they get kind of boring and that is the whole gameplay, if your entire gameplay gets boring and your story is lackluster, then you don't have a very good game.\n\nThere are also a few stupid things about the game. In case you did not know, magnets work by opposite polarities attracting. OPPOSITE! This game has the same (color) polarities attracting and the opposite (color) polarites repelling. That may be picky, but it is just really dumb and I cannot get over it. Also, at a certain point in the game (minor spoiler) you get to put the magnetic polarities anywhere you want to (rather than just changing the polarities of found objects) but the object it gives you when you shoot an area to put a polarity object there, is a ♥♥♥♥ing robot dog. It is so stupid. They ruined any horror aspect they had right there by putting a stupid ♥♥♥ robot dog WHERE EVER YOU SHOOT AT! The game Portal gave you a cool portal when you shot a wall, Magrunner gives you a robot dog. It is so dumb. Who's idea was it? "Hey I know! lets make it so instead of something cool when they shoot their magblaster, lets have a ♥♥♥♥ing DOG appear every time they shoot at anything! haha it is soo ♥♥♥♥ing LOVECRAFTIAN!"\n\nPutting my rant about the stupid dog aside, this game is just all around disappointing. Get it if you really like puzzle games similar to portal. But do NOT get it if you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan, It is simply not worth your time nor money.","December 18, 2015","false","11.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

The puzzles are interesting because of the novel "magnetic fields" (but weirdly work the opposite way of real world magnets) - unfortunately sometimes the puzzles do tend to cross the thin "unfair" line  (eg. puzzle pieces are usually subtely hidden) - then again some puzzle fanatics love that ( i don't until i solve the puzzle and then I might).\n\nThis one is for people who can't get enough of Portal or who simply love interesting FPS puzzle games.","October 3, 2013","true","0.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunTyranny/recommended/209630/","FunTyranny","Tyranny of Fun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FunTyranny/","646 products in account","Magrunner is ♥♥♥♥ing garbage that tries to ride Portal's "physics are cool, right?" with generous helping of Cthulhu mythos' "Old ones and tentacles are scary!" and then proceeds to ♥♥♥♥ the bed by being terrible with both.\n\nNow, take a look at those screenshots. Artstyle looks colorful, yet clear perhaps? Level design seems to have it's own distinct style while still managing to hint where you are supposed to go maybe? Well enjoy it for about 15 minutes it lasts, then it's sewer levels all the way down. If you spent money on this game, hopefully you thought that Bloodlines' sewer level was pinnacle of level design because oh boy, do we got linear sewer tunnels for you to walk and carry boxes around in.\n\nAfter a short jog through the sewer tunnels, you'll emerge into massive rooms, still in sewers and wish you could go back to the tunnels because for all their faults, at least it was clear where you had to go. Not so in sewer rooms where any given rotting catwalk or brown smudge can be the ledge towards which you must hop.\n\nThe game also doesn't bother teaching you mechanics at all. While Portal would present a mechanic, let you familiarize yourself with it, show it again in puzzle or two and so on until you have mastered it and are flying across the gaps at mach 1, Magrunner on other hand just drops you in front of a puzzle and lets you wander around in confusion. Now before you fly off screaming "Finally! A game designed for a thinking man instead of a tiny baby!", take note that the solution is usually shooting up anything that looks new to see what it does and/or spotting the hidden box/button/brown smudge behind the dark ledge. More than physics puzzle, Magrunner is hidden object game.\n\nOnly place where the game bothers to explain anything is the loading screen tips. Thankfully, there's plenty of these as the game is apparently incapable of loading more than a single room at the time.\n\nBut certainly what a game like this needs, is good physics engine. Magrunner seems to draw it's inspiration from other highly popular games for it's physics modelling. Namely, Bad Rats and Transformice. Fifth time in row when you try to use the moveable platforms to guide a box into place you need and instead cause it to rocket around the room at mach 1 when you activate the magnets, chant 'Eye of the Tiger' and draw strength from your Bad Rats King achievement. Perhaps all this could be avoided if you could throw the boxes or at least jump with them but that probably would have resulted a puzzle where you have to throw them across the room and have them stay on a ledge so perhaps it's for the best. This also ties wonderfully into the horror part of the game, as when you realize that you have to jump all the way down to the start to pick up the box and then realize that not only you have to climb the whole puzzle again, you first have to walk around the room pulling all the platforms into place because nothing resets on it's own, you will understand the futility of it all and welcome the return of the Great Old Ones. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn, please eat the people responsible for the sewer puzzles last.\n\nAlso, when the game advertizes itself as "game in which technology confronts the Cthulhu Mythos, as imagined by author, H. P. Lovecraft.", I personally imagined that the horror would be slow to reveal itself, manifesting as subtle changes in the world, haunting whispers from seemingly nowhere, impossible environments. Things that at first make you question your memory, then your eyes and finally your sanity. Mad, horror filled run to desperately escape the maze that is the Cube and you are the rat, only for that last mind shattering revelation that getting out is escape from nothing and all you have managed in getting back to society is to find slightly bigger trap to die in. Instead, what we get is *static*CTHULHU FHTAGN*static* from radio almost as soon as we are past front doors and then a Deep One runs in and punches you into ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo overall, bad game, ♥♥♥♥ me for wasting 10$ on this ♥♥♥♥","September 15, 2013","false","8.8"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","14","30","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krimhorn/recommended/209630/","krimhorn","krimhorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krimhorn/","420 products in account","In a world where everyday physics puzzlers are commonplace, Magrunner tries to fit in.\n\nAs you might be able to tell from the title, Magrunner is a game about Magnetism. A funky, everything-works-opposite-of-reality magnetism, but magnetism nonetheless. Much like Portal has two different portals (an in and an out) Magrunner has two polarities (Red and Green). Like polarities attract and opposites repel. There are also two different SHAPES of charges. Most items have a spherical charge but a couple of items have a cylindrical charge. By manipulating the items' charge you move around the environment trying to get to the end. Fairly simple, right?\n\nWell, not exactly. The puzzles, for the most part, fall into three categories: blindingly obvious and boringly simple, frustratingly obtuse, and frustratingly obtuse until you've solved it and realized that it's actually quite remarkably elegant (you just solved it in the hardest way possible).\n\nThe last two I lay entirely on the feet of the developers. Where Portal taught the player each mechanic in a multi-step process, where it would be hard to fail to notice the specific technique they were teaching you. Magrunner doesn't. In fact the puzzles often throw several new concepts at you within a single puzzle with absolutely no indication of what's supposed to be done. Sure, if you watched the trailer you'd recognize the cube whose sides are independent of each other and can thus be "opened". But the one time you see it in-game before being tasked to use it in a puzzle is from the INSIDE. In a location where you cannot see the cube together or even, really, the sides at all. This is but ONE mechanic and ALL of the mechanics are equally poorly communicated.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't fun. When the puzzles come together and you manage to see the steps to solve it they can be great fun. There's a lot of potential here; it's just up to the developers to learn how to educate the player as clearly and effectively as Valve did with Portal.\n\nIf I have any other complaints it's that it's just too long. The game overstays its welcome by about a third of its length. There are 36 puzzles, many of which can be quite involved and take some time to figure out. If the game were 20-25 puzzles long it would be a perfect length (about as long as Portal was). As it is I had to push myself to finish the final ten(ish) levels.\n\nI'd also like to call out one of the later levels: this game has the best "running" level since Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth's second level. Seriously, get in a groove in that level and go.","September 20, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is strongly inspired by Portal 2, and to me that is a big difference.  In Portal one it was a puzzle game that gave you flexability to solve the room puzzles creatively, with some solutions being better, faster, or more fun.  In one case the devs even purposely left in a clever shortcut to practically skip one room through a very clever trick.  In Portal 2 the puzzles are set with one solution, sometimes letting you do parts of that solution in a diffrent order, but essentially only one solution will pass the room.  This is the puzzle design in Magrunner.  It doesn't make it bad, but in my opinion, like Portal 2, it scores lower than it would.\n\nUnlike Portal, which has AMAZING voice acting and writing, MagRunner has Good or OK Voice Acting and Writing.  The script could have used allot of work, but is not bad or terrible.  If you can suspend your disbelief it is still entertaining.\n\nThe Art style is sometimes very unique and at other times looks like a mod to turn another game into Portal 2.  Soem examples of content inspired by other things is the "Mag Glove" your character uses, which is inspired by the demon summoning glove Rasputin wielded in the first Hellboy Movie.  Another is the catpults from Portal 2.\n\nThe puzzle design, a bit poor in some places, was fun and diffrent enogh from "Thinking with Portals" that at my  first sitting I was finding myself wanting to do room after room.\n\nThere will be solutions that will make you groan, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.\n\nI like this kind of game and the beautymarks cancel out the warts enough that I can just go by the quality of the actual gameplay, which is pretty good, so I recoment this","July 30, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basic gameplay is magnetism, though this is is slightly unerring at first as the principle is that opposites repel raher than attract (though it is inferred as a technological reason in game). This does help in the later stages, where there is a lot of stuff going on, but if you want "realistic magnet physics" from your futuristic cthulhu-centric platformer look elsewhere. If you can get over that, this is an absolute gem.\n\nStory/voice acting is pretty average, but it's not bad by any means.\n\nThe levels are absolutely fantastic. You have the polished, immaculate rooms; the broken down, disused training rooms; underground/old facility rooms, and the final 8 or so levels are set in (potential spoiler) space! Cthulhu is there, watching you. It's awesome.\n\nAs for the actual platforming, the onus is on you to not mess up. There is one particular quirk the game gives you about halfway through that got a little annoying sometimes, but other than that and a few "pixel perfect" moments I have no qualms. A lot of the puzzle-solving seems easy at first, but the latter half of the game ramps the difficulty pretty heftily. There's ways of doing things that are never hinted at that you need to do to finish certain levels, which I found quite refreshing, if a little confusing. A few levels add extra elements of danger that I can see being a problem for people who prefer to do stuff at their own pace, but I enjoyed the added constraint as a test of skill.\n\nOnly issue I had (bug-wise) was that cutscenes seemed corrupted to hell, stuttering and freezing every ~10 seconds, although alt+tabbing and waiting a few seconds fixed this. Not sure what caused it. Either way, actual gameplay wasn't affected.\n\nOverall, more mind bending than Portal in my opinion.

This is strongly inspired by Portal 2, and to me that is a big difference.  In Portal one it was a puzzle game that gave you flexability to solve the room puzzles creatively, with some solutions being better, faster, or more fun.  In one case the devs even purposely left in a clever shortcut to practically skip one room through a very clever trick.  In Portal 2 the puzzles are set with one solution, sometimes letting you do parts of that solution in a diffrent order, but essentially only one solution will pass the room.  This is the puzzle design in Magrunner.  It doesn't make it bad, but in my opinion, like Portal 2, it scores lower than it would.\n\nUnlike Portal, which has AMAZING voice acting and writing, MagRunner has Good or OK Voice Acting and Writing.  The script could have used allot of work, but is not bad or terrible.  If you can suspend your disbelief it is still entertaining.\n\nThe Art style is sometimes very unique and at other times looks like a mod to turn another game into Portal 2.  Soem examples of content inspired by other things is the "Mag Glove" your character uses, which is inspired by the demon summoning glove Rasputin wielded in the first Hellboy Movie.  Another is the catpults from Portal 2.\n\nThe puzzle design, a bit poor in some places, was fun and diffrent enogh from "Thinking with Portals" that at my  first sitting I was finding myself wanting to do room after room.\n\nThere will be solutions that will make you groan, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.\n\nI like this kind of game and the beautymarks cancel out the warts enough that I can just go by the quality of the actual gameplay, which is pretty good, so I recoment this","July 30, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Are you looking for a Lovecraftian game or looking for a mind-bending puzzle game? The appeal of Magrunner will depend upon what you want from it. Above all else, this is a puzzle game in the same category as Portal whereby you progress from 'chamber to chamber' with a bit of narrative thrown in. Do not be fooled, the Lovecraftian storyline is a backdrop but thankfully one that gives you extra enticement to see what happens next. Would Magrunner have been as enjoyable without it? Probably not, but the same could be said of Portal. The narrative enhances the experience without detracting from the true focus of the game.\n\nDifficulty? It varies far too much. There is no clear curve and one truely mind bending puzzle can be followed by something completely obvious. As for the degree of the hardest puzzles? Certainly up there along with Portal 2's calibre, some of these will have you nearly at the point of giving up but then you have that 'ah ha!' moment and you're moving again.\n\nIf there was one downside to the game is that there is a scene near the start which is needlessly gory. I know it was intended to give a sense of terror but in reality what made Lovecraftian storytelling so great was what the mind suggested but the eyes could not see. Magrunner doesn't do that and there isn't any element to the game related to the usual insanity associated with the Cthulhu mythos. There is a wierd screen effect which occurs from time to time, which I won't go into in order to avoid spoilers, but it has no impact upon gameplay.\n\nRecommended? For sure. But be aware that the replay value here is absolutely zero, once it's done there is nothing to bring you back. For me, it took around 10 hours but for some it may be less or more. In either case, it's one for a rainy weekend. It would be nice to see the developers make a sequel to this though.","September 4, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A funky, everything-works-opposite-of-reality magnetism, but magnetism nonetheless. Much like Portal has two different portals (an in and an out) Magrunner has two polarities (Red and Green). Like polarities attract and opposites repel. There are also two different SHAPES of charges. Most items have a spherical charge but a couple of items have a cylindrical charge. By manipulating the items' charge you move around the environment trying to get to the end. Fairly simple, right?\n\nWell, not exactly. The puzzles, for the most part, fall into three categories: blindingly obvious and boringly simple, frustratingly obtuse, and frustratingly obtuse until you've solved it and realized that it's actually quite remarkably elegant (you just solved it in the hardest way possible).\n\nThe last two I lay entirely on the feet of the developers. Where Portal taught the player each mechanic in a multi-step process, where it would be hard to fail to notice the specific technique they were teaching you. Magrunner doesn't. In fact the puzzles often throw several new concepts at you within a single puzzle with absolutely no indication of what's supposed to be done. Sure, if you watched the trailer you'd recognize the cube whose sides are independent of each other and can thus be "opened". But the one time you see it in-game before being tasked to use it in a puzzle is from the INSIDE. In a location where you cannot see the cube together or even, really, the sides at all. This is but ONE mechanic and ALL of the mechanics are equally poorly communicated.\n\nThat's not to say the game isn't fun. When the puzzles come together and you manage to see the steps to solve it they can be great fun. There's a lot of potential here; it's just up to the developers to learn how to educate the player as clearly and effectively as Valve did with Portal.\n\nIf I have any other complaints it's that it's just too long. The game overstays its welcome by about a third of its length. There are 36 puzzles, many of which can be quite involved and take some time to figure out. If the game were 20-25 puzzles long it would be a perfect length (about as long as Portal was). As it is I had to push myself to finish the final ten(ish) levels.\n\nI'd also like to call out one of the later levels: this game has the best "running" level since Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth's second level. Seriously, get in a groove in that level and go.","September 20, 2013","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PERIOD.\nWith that said, here is my first impression (as I have not played it all the way yet). Magrunner is a genre of first person puzzle games, similar to PORTAL.\n\nLike most of you, I was/am a PORTAL junkie. Preferred the 2nd one, but both were great. Then I played them again. Went looking for a clone, could not find one, then played some more. You know the song - sing along! LOL One of the clones I played and was instantly hooked (until I saw the end) was QUANTUM CONUNDRUM. Tough puzzles, very long game, very satisfying - at least until the end - I will alway hate the dev for doing that (no spoilers). So back to PORTAL i went :-), Then tried THE BALL - never finished it - did not have that - "gotta move on" motivation - so, back to another game of PORTAL (see, I'm a junkie).\n\nThe first time I saw MAGRUNNER, I put it on NOT INTERESTED and moved on. It was the cover art that made it look stupid (IMO). And never looked back. Recent I was looking for a time-waster puzzle game - and would you know - MAGRUNNER came up! So as not to spoil the game, I only watched a few levels (2 to be exact) and just had to get the game.\n\nOnce I got it, I knew I was hooked. Just like QC and PORTAL, it uses devices to solve puzzles. MAGRUNNER is more akin to PORTAL in that it only uses a binary mechanism, in this case a polarity gun. Using the gun you magnitize platforms and cubes to either attact, or repel or neutral.   This is what gives it that PORTAL feel. But that is as far as the PORTAL goes.\n\nThe puzzles are "weird". I mean that in a good way. Farther you go, the more diabolical they get with no clues, and to make things worse, they put objects and hints that are wrong. So you REALLY have to use your noggin to figure them out. The weird part is, that when you do figure it out - they are "kick-yourself-in-the-♥♥♥" simple. Like DUH! simple. But one thing is for sure, these puzzles can be so hard, that there is a great sense of accomplishment when you do figure them out.\n\nGraphic wise is a mutt. While the eniroment is amazing, the biologicals just look stupid (to me).  The faceless (robot image not withstanding) GLADOS, made the character seem somewhat real, while in MAGRUNNER the people made me want to run and hide - they were just hideious. I would much rather prefer a loud speaker or intercome with "voices" speaking to you instead of those holigrams.  But thats just me, and it didnt really deter me from the game.\n\nI would say if your a PORTAL junkie (and who isnt), MAGRUNNER is a MUST HAVE! When you play it, it feels more like a compliment to PORTAL. All the while I was playing, I did not once feel like I was playing a PORTAL CLONE. It was natural.\n\nAs far as the story, it feels forced to me. While GLADOS (and WHEATLY) got off on testers, and that was pretty much the premise, and QC you were just trying to find your uncle,  MAGRUNNER has a bizzare story. And it always felt like they were making the player "feel" what wasnt there. Rushed. To me, all the surprises were NOT. They were expected, or popped up for no reason, as you didnt know the history to understand the punchline.  There was no character devlopment. So I really didnt give too hoots about anyone, I had become a GLADOS - with a HURRY THE HELL UP AND GIMME THE NEXT CHALLENGE.  But thats OK, as I know they will fix that in the next release\n\nThere will be one right?\n\nAnywyas, regardless of the price - you like QC and PORTAL - GET THIS! You wont be disappointed.","December 19, 2015","true","85.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that, it's basically Portal with a different gimmick. Not much replay value, but good for a playthrough.","November 30, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then it like vanished from my radar. I didn't even know it came out. I thought it got lost in dev hell. To the guys that made this, great job. Love the game and it was well wroth the wait for me. I just wish it had better launch advertisment. I missed the launch window by almost 2 years because I never saw i advertised once on the steam pages anywhere. I would of paid far more for the game instead of the sale price i snagged it at. That being said. Best 3 bucks I ever spent. :)","December 2, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Are you looking for a Lovecraftian game or looking for a mind-bending puzzle game? The appeal of Magrunner will depend upon what you want from it. Above all else, this is a puzzle game in the same category as Portal whereby you progress from 'chamber to chamber' with a bit of narrative thrown in. Do not be fooled, the Lovecraftian storyline is a backdrop but thankfully one that gives you extra enticement to see what happens next. Would Magrunner have been as enjoyable without it? Probably not, but the same could be said of Portal. The narrative enhances the experience without detracting from the true focus of the game.\n\nDifficulty? It varies far too much. There is no clear curve and one truely mind bending puzzle can be followed by something completely obvious. As for the degree of the hardest puzzles? Certainly up there along with Portal 2's calibre, some of these will have you nearly at the point of giving up but then you have that 'ah ha!' moment and you're moving again.\n\nIf there was one downside to the game is that there is a scene near the start which is needlessly gory. I know it was intended to give a sense of terror but in reality what made Lovecraftian storytelling so great was what the mind suggested but the eyes could not see. Magrunner doesn't do that and there isn't any element to the game related to the usual insanity associated with the Cthulhu mythos. There is a wierd screen effect which occurs from time to time, which I won't go into in order to avoid spoilers, but it has no impact upon gameplay.\n\nRecommended? For sure. But be aware that the replay value here is absolutely zero, once it's done there is nothing to bring you back. For me, it took around 10 hours but for some it may be less or more. In either case, it's one for a rainy weekend. It would be nice to see the developers make a sequel to this though.","September 4, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players enjoying first person plat forming and puzzles should swipe right.  With few faults and a sale price of $2.50 I was definitely pleased and should community tools ever appear I would expect to revisit magrunner often.\n\nI spent about 8 hours within the campaign, which opts for a discovery based introduction to mechanics in place of a formal tutorial.  The story isn’t the strongest but its clear the developers put a lot of work into fleshing out an alternate future worthy of interest and steeped in well modeled Lovecraft figures like dagon, shub-niggurath, and of course Cthulhu.  While the story starts strong and finishes resolved, at some rare plot points in the center narrative felt a little jerky. Players might find the characters making snap conclusions without proper pretext or delivered from danger without cause. These bumps aside I often felt compelled to push on into the night far more often then I felt I needed a break. Magrunner is also well voiced.  Every member voice cast does a great job of conveying the emotion and urgency core to the plot.  However, the performances at times feel slightly disconnected from each other giving the impression that the cast may have recorded independently.\n\nMagrunner is often a good looking game, making proper use of some of Unreal’s strongest tools to great effect.  The graphics are scaled surprisingly well and players running on high and low settings alike can expect pleasing experience.  It’s not to say the settings are indistinct, only that the texture masking and engine optimization is done so well that players scraping the minimum requirements need not fear.  Only in few rare sections were the game tries to convey aged and dilapidated environment did some of the textures and geometry feel a little rushed.\n\nI really enjoyed magrunner’s simple yet rewarding mechanics.  Magrunner uses a combination of point physics and scripted objects like cube stacks, catapults, and conveyors, to generate puzzle solutions. The added utility of using any object as ether an attractor or repulser generates addition diverse game play, often with multiple solution paths.  I understand some people might feel more rewarded solving puzzles with distinct and singular solutions.  However, I felt the addition of sometimes rigged solutions via flexible game play elements, intended or otherwise, were a welcome addition to the genre.  There were definitely times we felt we stumbled across rigged solutions, and couldn’t be happier.\n\nI also might have enjoyed more horror driven elements.  While I understand that outright combat would have betrayed the genre a few scripted jump scares and more threatening wards would have felt right at home.  In terms of design I could only find a few things I could do without.  For one magrunner’s polar projectiles move way to slow for my taste and adds an extra layer of execution to game play that I found more frustrating than rewarding.  Why they didn’t use hit scan I’ll never know.  For the most part though the game play is easy to execute and navigate.  In terms of visuals the disembodied platforms were the only thing that ever felt consistently cheap, and stylistically independent of most other game assets.  While I understand sometimes tough visual sacrifices have to be made, I found said platforms to the only glairing visuals blemish on an otherwise spotless title.\n\nMagrunner is mostly designed for a single pass.  There are a few speed running achievements to draw you into a second, much shorter, go.  But we doubt this will be reason enough for most players to make a second pass  We completed the campaign in a little under eight hours and don’t expect that grabbing those last few loose achievements will push us much past 10.  However, should a level editor or community workshop be added….\n\nOddly enough we have to note one last thing. Some of the marketing elements on the store page may not be accurate.  I was only able to play 39 levels, not the video advertised 41.  Unless I missed a few hidden levels, and even if I did, most players should expect a 39 level play through.  Secondly store page screenshots appear to have been rendered out of game using in game assets.  There is no third person perspective and I was unable to recreate some of the lighting effects as seen in the screenshots.  These variations while small give the sense that the game is slightly more intense and more widely animated than it is.  Though I doubt any misleading was intentional, and surprising given how good the game actually looks. We suggest you watch game play first before buying.\n\nPros and cons weighed I suggest grabbing Magrunner next time you see it on sale.  For the achievement gamer however we think this game is a fairly priced at $10.  Thank you for reading and I hope this review helps you find a game you’ll enjoy.\n\n-Bandersunke","February 13","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally you'd expect magnetic fields to attract fields of opposite polarity, but not here - here opposites repel, it seems. I guess that when we're talking about alien horrors that drive you insane, this is what we mean now.\n\nAll things said and done, though, this is a competently executed puzzle game. I'm not great at puzzle games and I got stuck a few times, and some of the puzzles rely less on planning and more on timing than I'd like, but overall I found the difficulty fitting for a casual puzzle player. The story is fine overall, though some of the voice acting is a bit wooden, and the ending is actually kind of interesting, though it also features some fashionable criticism of social media that feels unnecessary and disconnected from the rest of the game. Cthulhu likes to sit on the edge of certain maps and growl his name at you over and over again, which is cool the first time but quickly gets kinda weird. Seriously, Cthulhu, we get it. Calm down.\n\nOverall, a decent game though not really outstanding by any measure. Give it a shot if you like first-person puzzle games!","March 13","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spits in the face of lovecraft and his works.\n\nGameplay - Like portal if you stripped out all fun and creativity. The puzzles are a slow chore. The mechanics are awkward and tend to be either overly simple or frustratingly finicky. The majoritfy of gameplay revolves around slow moving platforms. It's like someone designed the magnet mechanics and realized you couldn't make any interesting puzzles with them after the fact.\n\nStory -  Fails to deliver on every count. Terrible acting. It attempts to work in the cthulhu mythos and fails to capture what makes lovecrafts' work interesting. Easily the most underwhelming portrayal of cthulhu and his related themes I've ever seen. South park did a better job. All information is given as exposition dumps. Characters seem to change personalities at random.\n\nVisuals - This is really dissapointing because the game starts strong. The bright, colorful aesthetic of the first thirty minutes is very appealing, with cool lighting and reflections. It tries to do the same trick as portal though, and the rest of the game has the "behind the scenes plumbing" look. This means a lot of drab for the majority. The outer space stuff at the end looks good in screenshots but is ugly and stiff in practice.","January 17","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
