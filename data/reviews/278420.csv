Excellently polished.\n\nFull Review:\n\nI've been playing this great little game since the beta.\n\nIt's a fun game that's a bit difficult to categorize. You play as a spider, you make webs, and, for the most part, these webs catch bugs that you in turn eat. Move from level to level, rinse, wash, repeat. Yet it's a lot better than that, and a lot more interesting. The lovely backgrounds --- which likely look better on the small screen than on the large screen --- are for the attentive suggestive of a story, and the story is told this way without dialogue or, indeed, a plot. Intrigue is in the background, and entirely in the mind of the player. Your little spider avatar is just busy eating bugs.\n\nI want to say that this is a puzzler, and it is in a way, but its points-and-combos scoring system is about all it has in common with one. Is it a platformer when it isn't run-and-jump from left to right? Playing the part of a spider means that you're only nominally susceptible to gravity, and so the feeling of being a platformer is lost entirely. I spend most of the game upside-down or sideways on walls or, what's more interesting, on a web I've carefully planned at the nexus of the flight paths of several bugs.\n\nNot only this, but each level has four different versions --- while the landscape is the same, the number of and kinds of bugs are different, and this radically changes the best approach for the level. It's like four games in one this way. In-game weather is based on your actual IRL local precipitation, though you can change the weather in the game options.\n\nBeefs: My favorite parts of the game are the calm bits, where I can strategize where to wait and what to do and do it at my own pace. I can easily place webs because the landscape doesn't move and the threads which make up my webs are stable. That is, until the middle to the end of the game when several levels begin to have moving landscape. When some stable bit of the level itself moves, a thread connecting that moving piece of scenery to anywhere else will break. Suddenly, a game I enjoyed for being relaxed became very tense instead. In these levels, I now have to rely on quick movement to chain the combo from bug to bug.\n\nSecondly, during the beta --- I don't know about the finished game, so I hope this changes --- the weather machine has a limited number of uses and it refreshes based pn the phases of the moon, (see title.) IRL interaction is a fun little feature for mobile gaming --- think Pokemon Gold/Silver, when nighttime was based on real-world time --- but in PC gaming that kind of real-world interaction is more a hassle and less interesting. I hope they change it so that the PC user has complete control over the in-game weather.\n\nThough I disagree with these two minor design decisions, they are still not bad design decisions! I can't emphasize this enough. With all the crap on Steam these days, it's wonderful to see an indie dev hit every note they mean to play just right.\n\nBottom line: A fun strategic spider game that I am incapable of griping too much about, and I'm a real complainer. Excellently polished.","August 6, 2015","true","28.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","28","31","4","0"

This was the standout game of that event for me. I had a lot of fun playing it with the arcade controls setup. It's just as fun for the PC thankfully. The controls are easy to use and you find yourself quickly trying to make more interesting webs and jumps and tricks.\n\nThe artwork in this game feels like you are playing a puzzle inside of a classic book. I really like that you can allow the game to use your I.P to find out where you are and it adjusts the game to your area. If it's night/day... what weather you have going on, it will all reflect exactly the same in the game (which affects what kind of insects appear and how the level ambience is)\n\nThis game is not only a fun puzzler but has clues for you to find along the way which unravel the story of the setting around you. I never thought playing a game about being a spider catching bugs would be fun but it's pretty addictive. Check out some footage on youtube if you are considering getting this game. If brain teasers are your thing, I recommend this game.\n\n10/10 - you can shish kabob insects as you jump around like spiderman","August 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

And fun.\nOn the surface, you can just enjoy trying to collect the insects on each level. But then you find the subtle mystery underneath.\nAnd you can re-play a level to try different strategies to aim for the leaderboard, if you're into that sort of thing.\nAnd there's achievements to help encourage you to try things you may not normally try.\n\nI love it all.\n\nSpider leaves me feeling very satisfied.\nI want so desperately to see more games that perfects this level of subtle satisfaction.","August 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/278420/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","A really cool little game I learned about on r/spiders of reddit. Basically, you play a cute little jumping spider with leaping abilities to put Jordan to shame and the ability to make webs once a geometric pattern of criss crossing silk has been made. You use these webs to catch wandering bugs (many with different AI patterns), such as flies and crickets, while other techniques, such as tackling, are needed to take down hornets. Similarly, these insects give you more silk to work with as your supply is finite. You make use of the web's design and the insects you eat to get points as you clear your way to the next area. Meanwhile, there's secrets to be found throughout the stages as you try to uncover the background story of the manor you're hunting in.\n\nThe game is one of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' sorts. You have to plan out the best way to keep your point modifiers high (leaping web from web, instead of touching the ground) and you need to strategize how to make your approach, which is made harder with obstacles, finite resources, and bugs that don't necessarily stay where you want them to. All of this adds up to a surprisingly cerebral game.\n\nSure, people who don't like spiders or bugs to point of burning their house down and screaming like a little girl miiiight not like the imagery used, but nothing is terribly graphic. The imagery is realistic, but don't expect to see more macabre stuff for the most part. There's really a damn good title to be had here that I don't think will squeam out the nervous crowd too much.\n\nThere's a lot to do in this game, from the planning, to figuring out the web physics, finding secrets, unlocking new spider skins(!), and even getting a bestiary of sorts of the insects you've defeated on a small board, where you can see a little information about them. Btw, this game utilizes an option to mirror the local weather and time of day of your ISP's location (assuming you allow it), so you might play in Spider's world during a night time rain storm or on a clear sunny day, given your location. How cool!\n\nI have nothing but good things to say about this title, honestly. I wish the developers the best and hope they make more content for Spider. I think the only thing I can give as constructive criticism is I would have preferred a slightly more involved tutorial for the various mechanics of the game. It can be fine to figure out things on your own but some bugs don't get special descriptions concerning what needs to be done versus others, for example.","August 8, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Not an easy beast to descibe; it's a puzzle game, but not in the traditional, Tetris/Portal sense; it's a platformer where you have to plan out your actions; it has environmental storytelling comparable to Gone Home and Bioshock, and it's much more than the sum of its parts. If you're writing this game off as 'casual' or 'simplistic' I'd strongly advise you to look up a gameplay video and think it over--it's a testament to the strengths of Tiger Style that they've managed to make such a deep game while keeping the experience as streamlined as possible.","August 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I just love being a spider and crawling through places that you would never notice as a human. Eating all the bugs is very satisfying, especially when you get a bunch of them into one web and then eat them all at once. I just hope they add more levels or something because I feel acomplished now that I've eaten all the insects and gotten the highest score I could on each level. I also solved all the mysteries, and I really enjoy being able to play as different kinds of spders. I'd give it a 7/10 if steam had a good review system. But they dont so I'll recommend it. However, I just hope that they aadd more content soon because I just breezed through all the levels with ease. If they end up adding DLC or more levels or something.

I mean, love, like I want to take it home and snuggle it.  The first release of Spider (The Secret of Bryce Manor) is one of my favorites to date, and the changes they've made in the newest release are amazing.\n\nThis is a much beefier game than the first.  Bryce Manor was more exploratory, and hints of story were revealed as your spider progressed through each section of the house.  However, this game has puzzles, levels that can be replayed for different results (and bugs) depending on the time of day and weather.  That it uses your local time and weather in the game is, well, nifty.  :-)  Some of the levels are a real challenge, too. I'm not a hardcore gamer and am making my way through.  So, don't be scared.\n\nAbout the weather, there's also a weather/time machine that you can use periodically.  I'm glad they included this because it's not likely to rain in Central Texas anytime soon, and that would mean I'd have to wait weeks to play some of the levels.\n\nAs of now, I've already played nearly 8 hours, and I would have played more if it weren't for that pesky job.  :-D  This game will keep me busy for awhile, and I'm enjoying every minute.
