The gameplay is solid with no bugs and so different from any other game out there to date. If I had to compare it to something I would say it is similar to the later Mysts but with music and synths and neon like Tron.\n\n\nThe sound is very well incorporated into the game world and is a (if not the) key feature in the game. It is a great game and a good introduction on using synths to someone who is not that musically inclined but would like to produce some music for personal pleasure, this is due to the game teaching you how to use the synths in the in game open world which is very pretty and gives a solid feeling of being inside a synth machine or computer but it is also abstract enough that I spent a number of hours just wondering around the world looking at it.\n\n\nThe tools that the Devs give you in game in the studio are simplistic but can provide a massive array of sounds and beats. There is also the option once you have completed the game to change the studio area to a more complex almost akin to a number of programs out there. The Devs have done an outstanding job with it all the puzzles are of good difficulty and any that have been troublesome to many of the beta testers they have improved (without making them straightforward) to the feedback given to them by the community and I have an honest feeling they will continue to do this once the game is released.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/243220/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The marvel of Fract OSC struck me to the point of immobility.\n\nStanding within its world of organic sound and breathing architecture, I often found myself unconsciously freezing in place as a dormant level stirred at my approach, erupting into an awe-inspiring display or neon lights and blaring synths that sent goosebumps down my neck. I’d drift into obscure corners and onto meaningless ledges just to see what was there, being astonished at even the smallest piece of a world that seemed impossibly connected and alive.\n\nPlaying Fract made me feel alive in a way I haven’t experienced in a very long time. There’s so much energy in the air, twisting its way through structures and along the ground to create a world that feels as if it’s constantly in motion, adjusting and changing as so many wondrous sound bellow through the caverns. Fract isn’t just a giant synthesizer, it’s raw emotion flowing through bass lines and echoing synths that shakes the very floor you’re walking on. Every structure is its own sound, adding notes to the beautifully coordinated melody that grew with every step I took and machine I set in motion.\n\nFract provides almost zero assistance in helping you solve its humongous musical contraptions, but the way in which each puzzle builds off the last creates a persistent logic that grows with you as you begin to understand it more. Each object is introduced slowly enough to allow you to learn how to interact with it, but Fract never wastes time repeating itself. Instead it seamlessly folds areas and elements into each other so I was always learning something new even when I didn’t realize it, each puzzle pushing me just enough to feel stimulating but never overwhelming. You can almost feel Fract diligently holding itself back, clearly capable of so much more but always hyper aware of what constitutes “enough” as it cleanly bypasses the excess of many puzzle games with its extraordinarily tight pacing.\n\nBeing at the center of all this noise, attempting to conduct instruments I had barely begun to understand, I was struck by how small and powerless I was when compared to the monstrous amplifiers all around me. Even as I was helping to revive a world which had gone to sleep, I couldn’t shake how immensely alone I felt. All around me were unbelievable sights moving to a soundtrack that was itself alive within these walls, but there was no one to share it with; not a single soul anywhere to be found in this isolating cavern.\n\nThe feelings Fract created in me were powerful and complicated. The wonders of its design contrasted with the crushing emptiness I found growing within me the more I played. It filled me with amazement and yet all I wanted to do was cry. What was the point of any of this if it meant spending an eternity in solitude?\n\nFract OSC is everything I expected it to be: clever, gorgeous, innovative, inspired. But I wasn’t prepared for how it would affect me on a deeper level. Without even meaning to I was suddenly examining parts of me I couldn’t make sense of; things I didn’t want to acknowledge or feel comfortable sharing here. It’s an incredible game for so many reasons I’ve sold short here, yet somehow it’s the things I couldn’t see or hear that meant the most.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","38","40","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/243220/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","Static washes out your vision, slowly fading away to reveal large and impossible geometric objects reaching up and out as far as you can see. Dead machinery jutting out from pastel colored ground and rock. You don’t know how exactly you got here nor how any of these strange constructs were built. Your legs carry you across the land, poking your head into enclosed buildings that might as well be giant tombs. At last, you come across an object that emits a strange hum. You touch it and the hum changes pitch slightly in reaction. You move it around and it changes tempo and pitch respective to where it was before. You don’t know what is going on but you sure as hell are nodding your head.\n\nFRACT OSC is like a Fantasia for the dance-minded music fans. IDisneylandM, if we were to give it a genre tag in our music player. Much like the Aggro-crag, every area on the map is color coded according to the theme of the sounds you’ll expect to hear. Pink acts as your bubbling leads, blue as your bass and green as the airy pads. Each instrument has its own dedicated area in the mountain area FRACT takes place in. The leads come from such towering heights, the pads sit in the middle and the bass rumbles on from down below. There are other, smaller details which show themselves to musician and non-musician alike which key you in to each place’s role in the overall scheme of what is going on.\n\nExploration is only one part of what makes FRACT tick. The tock of the metronome comes from the game’s puzzles. Each instrument has a specific puzzle type which increases in difficulty as you progress through them. The block movement and pad rotation puzzles were fine, but the last laser puzzle in the bass area had me tearing at my hair a while. Overall though I didn’t find any of them prohibitively difficult (though the ease of a majority of them may disappoint hardcore puzzle game fans) and FRACT always allowed me the freedom to leave any given puzzle to explore at my leisure. I would have to come back to it eventually if I wished to see the end, but the lack of pressure really goes a long way towards making even the hardest puzzles easier to forgive. I’m glad to see games like FRACT and Ether One taking this stance.\n\nThe way the sound design is so keenly and closely tied together with the puzzles was enough to make me smile as every solution came together. Starting off in an area, the puzzles were very basic and the sounds those areas produced once fully activated reflected that. By the time you’ve hit the end of the series of puzzles for a given color/instrument, the puzzles have added new mechanics over time and the resulting sounds that blast forth have additional layers of complexity. It really builds up a feeling of progression. Instead of a simple pat on the back for completion and shoving the player towards the next goal, you’re allowed to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\nAs you complete puzzles which slowly teach you vital elements of constructing tunes you unlock various tools to use in the in-game Studio room. The further into the game you get, the more you’re allowed to add and tweak into the track as you work. It starts off small with only a single loop sequencer and bare minimum controls over the tone of the digital instrument. By the time you’ve completed the entire game, you’re handed an impressively beefy DAW that looks as awesome as the sounds you’re able to make with it. While it is still limited and won’t replace your Reason, ACID or even your old copy of Fruityloops burned to a CD from a decade ago, it serves as an excellent introduction into the world of digital audio production. FRACT OSC is really a musical instruction tool masquerading as a videogame. To make things even better, the game has a built in export function and the dev is totally cool with users making commercial tracks so long as the loop work done with FRACT’s samples were all done in-game. A tutorial to mod in your own beats has been promised as well.\n\nBy the time I reached the end of my musical journey my ears were ringing and I felt similar to those nights after a gig. I’d emerged from the 8 hour rave session that I conducted for myself and myself alone, nary another ear to hear what reverberated through the cavernous area but my own. With every box aligned, switch flipped and cogs rotated I had brought life to these dead hills. As though Holy Mountain had been redone as a living Demoscene file, I had seen the secrets of this strange land from the very tip of its highest cliff to the very bottom of its deepest trench. I overlooked all that I had conquered and felt that it wasn’t quite enough. I retreated back to my lair, dark and still, slaving away for hours on what was to be my next song. I’d earned the right to control this giant machine and make it bend to my will. If only because I demonstrated that I understood what it wanted.\n\nIt wanted to make you move.","October 11, 2014","true","11.6"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/243220/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","In FRACT OSC, you explore a desolate alien landscape littered with derelict machinery, beautifully realized by simple untextured polygons shot through with neon and displayed using a graphical filter reminiscent of CRT interlacing.  Rods of light, pulsating liquid columns, and crystal lattices respond to your proximity with bursts of sound, the stuff of music flowing forth from the ground beneath your feet, waiting to be harnessed and organized.\n\nAs you wander, you make inferences about the structure of the world and the function of its technology.  You notice visual cues that prompt you to engage your interact mode in specific places, and you discover various pieces of information or interface superimposed upon objects around you.  Before long, you begin figuring out how to get things working again, and this abandoned place pumps and glows with activity and color.\n\nIn the course of solving the world's puzzles and restoring its infrastructure, you construct bits of music through devices that teach you the basics of music programming while incorporating your solutions into the soundtrack that results from the reactivation of key facilities.  Sound is all generated on the fly using a unique music engine that is constantly working in the background, and, as if the game itself wasn't enough, FRACT OSC doubles as a robust synth sequencer with exporting and automated YouTube sharing functionality.\n\nPlaying FRACT OSC has been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my life.  I have felt so much wonder and joy while discovering its intricately crafted and interconnected world.

FRACT does not go out of its way to tell you what you're meant to be doing or how you're meant to do it, and indeed my first hour was spent utterly lost and wandering around the (admittedly very pretty) landscape, accomplishing absolutely nothing. That frustration led me to put it aside for a few months. But if you stick with it, you'll eventually begin to figure out this game's secrets. By the end of my playtime with FRACT I could start it up knowing exactly what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go, and how I was going to do it.\n\nIn FRACT, you're plunged into the trippy, Tron-like world of a gigantic yet dormant synthesizer. As you progress further and further, you'll gradually begin to bring the beast online, unlocking more and more of its features that can ultimately be put to use in an actual sequencer (your studio, as the game calls it) which you can visit at any time. This is a game where completing all the puzzles presents you with an actual reward - a fully functional digital audio workstation that is simple to play with, yet deceptively powerful under the hood.\n\nIf you liked Portal's method of first-person-puzzling, and in particular if you enjoyed the dynamic nature of Portal 2's music which adapted to your progression through the puzzles, you'll likely enjoy this game. It does require a bit of initial time and patience, but it pays off in spades.","October 31, 2014","true","6.8"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

You control your surrounding as you would an audio creation sofwate; only with a few keys and a mouse. No tricky controls or ninja reflexes requiered. The musical enviromenent make you feel like living in a "boards of canada" album.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itselix/recommended/243220/","itselix","elix ¦ вlϊтz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itselix/","497 products in account","You're dropped in a barren, alien world with no real idea of what's going on, but as you explore and interact with the strange world around you, you begin to return music and colour to the world and bring it back to life. The soundscape builds around you, taking your own solutions and weaving them into the music of the world.\n\nFRACT is a game that gives you a brief starting tutorial that is completely free of explanatory text. Not only that, the environment is altogether alien and bewildering, and suddenly animated at unpredictable times. Once you've completed the tutorial, the game throws you headfirst into the world without any further hand-holding.\n\nAnd this is what's so fantastic about FRACT: It's full of secrets and amazing places and things for you to discover. But half the fun of unwrapping a gift is the surprise of opening it, and FRACT doesn't try and unwrap the player's gift for them like an excited younger sibling, it lets you pull every strip apart, revealing the glowing, pulsating melody beneath. It lets you piece together an understanding of how the world comes together and what makes it tick. The puzzles themselves are of increasing difficulty, but they shouldn't pose too much of a challenge once you understand how the game and the world works. And that's where the other half of unwrapping the gift comes in: You get the gift itself.\n\nSolving a puzzle in FRACT after you've worked out the underlying system is satisfying, but it's made even more satisfying by the immediate increase in the layers of sound in the soundscape around you, as the tones you've been making the world make suddenly snap into tune and a swell of harmonies follows right behind. Feeling smart and being rewarded with the music becoming more awesome is a very pleasing reward mechanism, and the game continues it throughout. The world itself is surprisingly large, deliberate, and cohesive. There's a story here, waiting to be told in the silent (and musical) ruins. There are little nooks and corners that seem to serve no good purpose except to be a neat little place for you to find. There are side music puzzles that have no bearing on the game progression, and are merely musical toys for you to discover and play with.\n\nNo game is perfect, and FRACT is no different. Some of the puzzles require you to notice and intuit the relationship between things that are not the most obvious even with time and exposure to the puzzle. However, in a game that relies on understanding the subtle environmental clues to solve puzzles, if someone is stuck, it's as likely that in their haste to jump into solving the puzzle they've missed some small but important detail needed to guide themselves towards the solution. A moment's pause and a step back is often the kick that breaks the log jam. Failure in experimentation is inconsequential; at worst, you fall off a platform or have to backtrack slightly, and it's not long before you're right back to where you were, able to progress.\n\nFRACT contains one final gift, even after you've solved the last puzzle, enjoyed the victory spectacle, and seen the credits, and that's the Studio. As you progress through the game, all the way up to the last puzzle, you unlock portions of the very real synthesizers in the player composition facility in a separate, quieter portion of the world. For the impatient, there's the ability to unlock the whole Studio immediately, without needing to finish the game. The synthesizer modulation settings work exactly like they do in-game (not counting the advanced synthesizer options that unlock last), so FRACT in effect teaches the player how to make music.\n\nIt's too early to tell still, but FRACT OSC may be my favourite game of 2014. It's going to take something pretty special to beat the high standard FRACT's set.","April 22, 2014","true","50.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","4"

I love Flower on the PS3 and Journey as well (though that's less chillout, more heartrending/warming adventure, though it is beautiful). I also have a fondness for exploration games, hence why I really enjoyed Gone Home and I quite liked Proteus. It's part of why I like ARK Survival Evolved and also why I liked Minecraft too. There was this great exploration element, as you discovered cool little neat things and such.\n\nThe problem I find though is if there's nothing else but exploration, it gets really, really dull, really really fast. Proteus has this problem. It's beautiful and relaxing and charming but there's ♥♥♥♥all to DO whilst you explore. You might as well load up some ambient music and put on a few random visualisations on Winamp or WMP or something. Much the same experience.\n\nHere's where FRACT OSC gets it right though. IT GIVES YOU ♥♥♥♥ TO DO. Oh my god it gives you ♥♥♥♥ to do. It's an exploration game at heart, and a music game. It's both, and its married perfectly together. The world is made up of, controlled by, and explored through music. The music the game creates for you, the music YOU can later create with the synthesiser part of the game. But here's the thing, you can't DO that until you get some instruments. How do you get instruments? you unlock them in game. How? by rebuilding the broken down and out of order sound based tech in these ruins you find yourself in.\n\nHow do you do that? by SOLVING PUZZLES WITH YOUR AWESOME INTERACTO-PUZZLEVISION :D\n\nThere's no enemies, no real threats. You can "die" but that boots you immediately back to the nearest checkpoint you got to. Handy, convenient, and if you don't "die" when you fall off something, chances are you are meant to get there or there's a way back out of it. Fall damage doesn't seem to exist, there doesn't appear to be a way to get irreversably trapped (and if there is you can always press ESC and boot back to last station again, always possible), you can fast travel between stations...\n\nEverything is done through symbols and holographic screens, no words, no voiceover expositing things to you. You gotta work it out yourself, and that's where the game truly shines, not just through the beautiful soundscapes that unlock as you solve puzzles, but because this is at once a fiendish and rewarding first person puzzler, but also a fantastic way to relax and chill out.\n\nI have worked out puzzles and whilst I would be fist pumping and cheering about how I feel like a genius, I'm too chilled the hell out to do so. I merely smile to myself, nod in time to the awesome music, and get started on FINDING the next puzzle, which in itself could be a puzzle!\n\nThis is the perfect exploration/ "walking simulator" -puzzle game combination. You won't regret it. It's challenging, it's difficult, it's often obtuse, it is however both super relaxing, super fun, and super cunning.

You are given a toy that is 100x more complex than a Rubik's Cube™.  With no instructions and no idea what the winning conditions are.

The lack of communication (e.g., score, progress, direction) with the player is terrible.\n\nUnfortunately, while the game scores great originality points with me, there was far too much else that I found lacking or frustrating so I cannot recommend it.

I expected some really obtuse puzzles and I was afraid that after The Fall and Kairo, this will be another game that may be ruined by this aspect. Other than that, 3D Exploration games have really bad reputation recently. Fract OST shows that this genre can have some pretty nice games.\n\nFirstly, the world of Fract OST is very immersive. Ambient atmosphere is really strong in this open-world hub that you are challenged to explore and solve. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but after a bit getting used to, the exploration of this strange world was a pure joy. it's obvious that devs really tried to win you over with this part of the game. You get achievements for discovering some particularly interesting and optional spots in on the map, which feels really rewarding and it's sign of the far greater design choices that constructed this strange world of synthesized music.\n\nPuzzles are not all that great, but they for the most part very straight-forward. They rarely vary in types, but this lets you  focus more on exploration that searching thought Steam Guides which is all great by my book. Those still are good enough for enforcing that feel of reanimating an ancient machinery that was broken for hundreds of years. In conclusion, puzzles are not amazing, but they don't break an immersion by any means.\n\nOverall, Fract OST is a solid proposition for players loving exploration. There isn't any grand backstory, plot or anything like that to discover and yet it was a pleasure to be there in this place. If you don't like Walking Simulators, then I'm not sure if it will change your opinion about the genre, but it's worth a shot. Fract OST, in opposition to other "famous" similar games, have a genuine challenge and you won't be handholded.","March 17, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's an adventure/puzzle game (sort of like Myst) with great visuals and music. The music is the central element of this game. Each puzzle creates music that builds up as progress is made, creating the soundtrack for that area. There's very little direction or instruction in the game, but it's usually not a problem. The puzzles are satisfying to solve, but aren't too difficult.\n\nThere's also a studio mode that gradually opens up if you want to use the synths and sequencers to make music or mess around. It's fairly limited, but pretty easy to use and songs can be exported (as WAV) or uploaded to youtube.\n\nFRACT OSC is great and I definitely recommend it if you like the graphics & music. It's not a very complex or long (~4 hours, maybe) game, but it's a unique experience that's well worth it.","December 17, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'm stunned at how amazing this game is. I can see that it's not for everyone, but if you are at all musically inclined, enjoy logic puzzles, and don't mind it if a game leaves you to figure things out for yourself rather than telling you where to go and what to do, I cannot recommend this enough. I'm absolutely in love.\n\nGameplay is similar to Kairo: You're dumped in the middle of a strange world full of broken machines, and you have to figure out how to turn them all back on. But with music, and with much nicer visuals. And also, as you solve the puzzles, you unlock tools in your very own sequencer for you to use to make your own music.\n\n+Totally original game concept\n+Simple but beautiful visuals\n+Large "world" to explore\n+Great puzzles - others have said they felt lost and didn't know how to solve the puzzles, but I haven't had any problems; I think that if you're musically and/or logically inclined you shouldn't have any trouble knowing what to do\n+Stellar music - the environment makes its own dynamic music, and you make music; even solving the puzzles is a process of creating music\n+Contains an actual sequencer for making your own music\n\n-Possible to fall off of terrain and get stuck, so you have to start the game over (be careful!)\n-Not suitable for anyone who likes a lot of guidance in a game; easy to get lost/confused, requires patience\n-Probably not a good game for anyone who isn't into music","January 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

There is no comparison. This game is about synthesizers. You interact with a world at your own pace, and music follows your footsteps.\n\nIf you have any interest in this kind of music (watch the trailer), and have a little bit of understanding of rhythm, you can play this game and enjoy it. I only played about 8 hours before solving the final puzzle, but it was easily one of my favorite games I have played in recent times. This game made me happier than any game I have played all year.\n\nIt is short and minimalistic. There are few instructions, no directions, and no words. You solve puzzles, and get very little from it. But what you do get is everything that you need, perfected. There's a wonderful feeling when the bass suddenly kicks in, because you solved a puzzle, with an added kick of enjoyment from hearing *your* music incorporated into it. Exploration is rewarded by finding little crystals that sing when you get near them, or the faint sound of a puzzle in the distance as you look over a world constructed with little more than basic blocks yet is still beautiful and intriguing.\n\nThe puzzles are impressive. The first puzzles you will encounter for each area are simple, preparing you for future puzzles without obvious tutorials, building to the final puzzles which can be incredibly complicated. Each puzzle is two parts - an approach puzzle, and then an ostensibly musical puzzle - yet despite what many on the internet think, each one can be solved with only logic, no brute forcing needed. There are not nearly enough puzzle games in the world that hit the right balance of solvable and difficult.\n\ntl;dr: You like music? You like puzzles? You like creating instead of destroying?

The world starts cold and grey, not dead but dormant. You explore the geometric caverns & bizarre, daunting structures, figuring out what the world wants you to do, solving its puzzles bit by bit, slowly bringing music and colour and life back into it.\n\nWhen I say music, I MEAN music. While each puzzle has a logical solution (with some creative wiggle room), that solution also turns out to be a musical phrase, coarsing through the pulsing neon around you.\n\nAnd the puzzles themselves all come together. First in sections, as you complete each of the three themed sections, and then finally in one huge, elaborate chamber, you compose your own conclusion. Unique to your play and your aesthetic, but also carefully curated by the games puzzles to be coherent and beautiful. The world it turns out, is nothing less than an enormous, powerful synthesizer.\n\nTo say this game is orginal and unusual would be an understatement: I've never known a game do anything even remotely like this, before or since.\nThis game is also very well-designed, carefully walking the line between guiding you to an understanding as the puzzles increase in complexity, and leaving you to explore and figure things out on your own.\n\nBut more than anything else, this game is utterly, sublimely beautiful. The aesthetic is simple - textureless polygons and bold neon primaries are pretty much the only graphics - but the way it gently coaxes you towards creating something beautiful and unique, until the world around you erupts into an ecstatic epiphany, an explosion of life and light and music...\n\nI will never forget this game, as long as I live.","March 20","true","11.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s hard to articulate how FRACT can make you feel. It’s most certainly an unconventional experience and arguably a one-of-a-kind art form so I’ll try to spoil as little as I can.\n\nFRACT OSC is reminiscent of atmospheric adventure games like Myst. After a very brief introduction to the simple controls, you find yourself immersed in a dark and hauntingly silent underground world. You are given no clue as to where you are or what you’re supposed to do. This may sound overwhelming at first but once you take the first steps you realize there’s a fairly guided and intuitive way of navigating this world.\n\nThe Tron-esque and awe-inspiring open-world of FRACT is filled with massive structures, glowing towers and dormant devices you attempt to restore. But despite its mechanical and desolate appearance, the world feels oddly organic. As you approach its objects they react to your presence by expanding themselves and/or giving off delicate melodies.\n\nThe exquisite post-processing filters and radiant geometric structures produce a vivid yet dark ambiance. I found the landscape and architecture so jaw-dropping I couldn’t help but taking dozens of screenshots throughout my play-through.\n\nThe puzzles are especially appealing because as you interact with them you shape the soundscape around you, the puzzle structures emit different tunes which ultimately burst into a full-blown symphony and explosion of light upon completion. This incredibly cool way of rewarding players makes solving puzzles feel more like a creative process rather than a hassle.\n\nPhosfiend’s work is so remarkable because they managed to create an incredibly rich and immersive experience in a completely unique setting without using a single word or any sort of narrative. It’s just fantastic to see everything gradually come together and rise to a beautiful climax.\n\nOn a side note, I recommend using a controller for a more cinematic experience that can only be achieved with subtle movements of the analog sticks; You can still use the mouse for faster puzzle solving.","July 8, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you were a big fan of the MYST series, like I was, then this is perfect for you.\n\nThere is no real story behind this game, and it invites you to use your imagination, to explain why everything is what it is. From the visual and aural feasts you are given, you draw your own conclusions as to what the civilization was like. There is virtually no text within the actual game, instead relying on pictures and diagrams to relay information. Music is heavily used for artistic effect, though many of the puzzles  do not require music to solve. Instead, having an iPod or Phone handy to take quick pictures of diagrams is useful. This game requires an awful lot of backtracking, so be prepared.\n\nBeware, to run this at a constant framerate you need a decent rig, or to turn down the view distance. However, your mileage may vary. The options menu is rather sparse, lacking even a rebind keys option, which forces you to use the default bindings.\n\nThis game uses flat textures and polygonal shapes to create the terrain and buildings, and personally, I think it pulls off the look quite well. For such a simple design, it is quite beautiful.\nThe music creation tool is not something I have experimented with, but if you have any experience with music editing programs, you may find use in some of its synths. Again, your mileage may vary.\n\nIn my opinion, this game does not neccesarily warrant more than one playthrough, but if you have the patience to finish the game, you should have the patience to find and collect the achievements. I'm going to be searching for them myself, as I haven't perfected the game yet.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is beautiful. The art style is wonderful, but the puzzles are not for the impatient. Many of them require fine tuning and experimentation, and some of the later ones require backtracking. The options menu could do with more, but it is forgivable by a game so pretty.","November 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Getting onto the beta test program was a joy, as I was very interested in the game beforehand; it was lovely seeing the game make strides towards completion, and here it is.\n\nFract is one of the most original and ambitious indie titles of the last coupla years in my opinion: it marries music and first person puzzle gameplay relatively successfully and it manages to give the player the feeling of being utterly lost in a pulsating, cold yet oddly comforting machine.\nSome of the puzzles are slightly fiddly but most of them are decent - nothing too complex, really, though some of them require the player to fully explore an area and take mental notes.\nIt looks very nice, though I have to say it might not run very well on low-end systems (the devs have done a lot of optimization though); the audio and music fit the atmosphere perfectly, and completing a puzzle feels very rewarding because of the interaction between sound and world.\n\nThe studio mode might be slightly simplistic but it's a ton of fun and you can create mighty beats with it - it's a great bonus and I wish the devs will expand on this either with updates or a whole new game.\nRecommended if you like toying with music and unconventional games.","October 10, 2014","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The music and visuals are really atmospheric but aren't really necessary for the puzzles; This is not a music-puzzle game.\n\nYou start out in a virtual synth studio where you can lay down tracks using the basic instruments: Synth lead, bass and pad. Most of the controls are locked at first, and there's a door leading to what appears to be the tron-like insides of the synth. As you delve deeper into the synth world and solve puzzles, more and more controls unlock. This is a clever way of avoiding the paralysis of being in front of a full-advanced-synth control panel.\n\nThe music and visual are amazing if you don't hate synth music and abstract neon visuals. I loved it. The puzzles are simple and get progressively harder. Nothing is really explained and you're left to discover and experiment and explore.\n\nThis is also actual synth software, meaning you can (irreversibly) skip the puzzle-solving-and-unlocking and just unlock everything from the get-go. You'd be missing out though. The game's originality and atmosphere comes from being inside the synthesizer.\n\nThis is a really unique game that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nHighly recommended if you're into synth music.","May 4, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

To be honest, I thought the puzzles were a bit too easy. I never really got stuck; the most stuck I got was trying to find the next station or something. Despite the puzzles not being challenging, they were still extremely satisfying to solve, because the music gradually builds up as you're solving it, and once the final piece clicks into place, it all comes together and sounds amazing.\n\nThe visual style was very cool. The materials were bland, but the glowing lights made up for that.\n\nAnd of course the sound design was excellent. My only complaint would be not giving the player more freedom with the music on game, but that would probably ruin the atmosphere if the player doesn't know music. Keeping everything in the same scale/chord was a good idea.\n\nOverall I'd give it an 8/10.

That isn't to say this game isn't challenging, as some of the puzzles, especially the later ones, will likely have you scratching your head and pushing you closer and closer to the temptation of steam guides. Rather, the puzzles of the game are overshadowed by the overall atmosphere. This is a game that really does deserve to be played with the lights down, the volume up and no distractions. The world and the art style is simply beautiful which, coupled with the superb analog-sounding synths provides both a relaxing and an empowering experience. Each puzzle solved reastores areas of the world back to life, turning a cold, lifeless wasteland into a thing of beauty.\n\nHow much you enjoy FRACT OSC will depend on how much you enjoy synthesizers. If you're the kind of person who can tell your VCO from your VCA, use an envelope for things besides posting letters and consider a delay to be a desirable thing, the puzzles will only be part of the attraction. FRACT also provides a feature-rich studio that produces some amazingly warm sounds which will keep you busy for some time. And if you're not a synthesizer fan? Well, perhaps the easy to use interface (which can be toggled between basic, abstract controls to something that wouldn't look out of place in the Death Star's control room) will convince you otherwise.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game with a beautiful art style, brilliant sound and a fantastic atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orix/recommended/243220/","Orix","Orix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orix/","1168 products in account","FRACT OSC is an unabashed love letter to TRON, you know, that wonderfully imaginative Disney film where Jeff Bridges is digitised into a computer world where everything is basically black with a neon trim and not much makes sense, but its a feast for the eyes, so it's ok. It also seems to have a sequel that nobody talks about on pain of death.\n\nThe world of FRACT OSC is a blocky pseudo-natural landscape littered with abstract buildings and machines all presented from the first person perspective in a TRON-esque style. The hills are alive with the sound of music (thank you, Julie Andrews), literally, much of it moves and reacts to your presence, initially producing simple synthy tones and dull lit paths, often they build into tunes upon paths of neon, and in progress layer into crescendos and brilliant firework displays of light.\n\nIts hard to explain without a video. But, I feel that this is something you should experience for yourself.\n\nStory\n\nThere is no story.\n\nYou're just unceremoniously dropped into FRACT OSC's world with no narrative whatsoever. This is one of those games where you could assume that there is a narrative behind the world, and you're there to discover/progress it. But you don't have to. It needs no reason to exist beyond having fun. There are no enemies, or characters. You are the only presence here, and your actions alone affect the world, but I can't really explain that without going into the...\n\nMechanics\n\nSo, without a narrative, or antagonist, what do you do? Explore. Solve puzzles. Make music.\n\nThe world doesn't always give you a clear idea on where to go, or what to do, but that makes it more interesting. You can often inadvertently start on a puzzle that is a few ahead of the intended order, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThe eventual goal is to bring life (represented by light and music) back each of three large areas. They're based on different layers of synth music (Bass, Pad and Lead), each with their own signature flavour and architecture. The Lead area is strawberry pink with large buildings acting as gateways to vertigo-inducing platforms, uneven crystalline formations litter the land. In Bass you direct luminescent beams of energy between industrial columns, toxic pools drown its central citadel. The world oozes detail and you have free reign over its geography. You can fall to your doom, but the penalty is reappearing at the last checkpoint with no progress loss. The puzzles are varied within and between areas, none of them outlive their welcome, they can be a little tricky, but again, you play with them, figure 'em out, and move on forward.\n\nOnce you have completely reinvigorated the three primary areas, you ascend into a final area wherein you gain and exact control over the structure itself. Everything culminates together in one big arresting performance that you yourself created in just playing the game.\n\nAnd then?\n\nThen you are left with a synth music creation tool, free to toy with to produce surprisingly varied and complex compositions with relative ease. Granted this part does not hold my interest. FRACT OSC is a game I can love and leave feeling satisfied.\n\nRound up\n\nI'm gonna avoid doing the whole what is good/bad/ugly about this game blurb. I don't think it is necessary here.\n\nFRACT OSC is unique. It's short (about 6 hours) and beautiful. A feast for the eyes and ears alike, fun to explore and a competent cognitive challenge.

As you walk through beautiful environments of this game, you will receive little direct guidance. There are no glowing arrows or pop-ups with instructions. You really have to pay attention and experiment to figure out how things work: the colors, the symbols, the audio cues. The process of exploration and discovery feels very rewarding.\n\nThe main adventure is not particularly long (I've beaten a third of the game in about 2.5 hours), but I've enjoyed every second of it. My advice to anyone who gets stuck: do try to experiment and look around before looking up FAQs and walkthroughs. A little temporary frustration is worth it for the great satisfaction when you figure it out.

It allowed me to calmly explore, enjoying beautiful sounds and images with occasional challenges that felt really satisfying to overcome. I loved the pace of most of it, too. It's completely free of a lot of the more common annoyances I have to deal with as a feminist gamer and while I didn't feel pressured or scared at any point I did feel encouraged to explore and I was really motivated by the structure of the game, in that I did feel like I was making discernable progress. The gameplay in some ways reminded me of Myst, but with a complete stylistic overhaul and the removal of much of Myst's software limitations.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not all that interested in composing my own music, but that aspect is completely separate from the gameplay, and the parts when the sounds I chose came together as a whole composition were cleverly designed so I would end up choosing chords and progressions that meshed together naturally. A brilliant bit of subtle design work.\n\nConsidering the good it did for my mental health, allowing me to process my stress while I was lulled by the environment of the game, FRACT OSC is worth way more than $15.

FRACT OSC is a puzzle/adventure game set in a world based on sound, entirely available to explore at your own pace and it executes its ideas extremely well. Having said that, you need to be interested in music to enjoy this game as a large portion of the puzzles are based on step sequencing and other musical/compositional concepts. This even extends to the rewards for solving each puzzle being new tools in a "music studio" that allows you to create your own songs. It's on the shorter side (I beat it in 7 hours but there is a lot of additional hidden stuff to explore and you'll probably spend some time in the music studio too) and the "world" is appropriately sized for the game, though it transforms over the course of the game in a way that feels extremely involving. I'm trying to be as vague as possible because discovering things for yourself is what makes this game great and I don't want to ruin that for anyone interested in playing it, though I will tell you that a small portion of the puzzles can be reasonably obtuse. In summary, if you like music, making music, neon, puzzles, open worlds and Com Truise then this is the game for you.","June 18, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of them are so cleverly made that I was more that surprised, but I won't spoil it for anybody. Let's just say that solving puzzles never felt this rewarding before.\n\nAs a musician, this has become one of my favourite games. The fact that all of the sounds are live rendered in the game (it is a bit heavy on your computer, and unless you have a good CPU, it might crackle a bit), makes it so much better. I won't even begin about the inclusion of a usable studio for music production. It might not be as powerful as some DAWs, but it is insanely fun to play around with the same synths you already had to use to solve all the puzzles.\n\nMore than recommended, especially if you love electronic music and adventure games.","April 26, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I will say that while playing this game, you will spend a considerable amount of time scratching your head. It will often fool you into thinking you've solved the puzzle before you realize you're trapped and you have to disassemble the entire thing to escape or move on to the next level. This is good though, because it forces you to rethink everything so that you can separate yourself from the obstacles and move on to the next task.\n\nIf you're a "first-person adventure" fan, the first thing that you will find troubling is the fact that you cannot jump. I don't know why they didn't add the feature, but in a world with various shapes and horizontal planes sitting at different levels, you'll find yourself wanting to skip walking around everything and hit spacebar to jump -- only to find it isn't working. I'm kinda hoping they'll include it in a later patch. ;)\n\nThere's also various (already obvious) bugs that will probably be fixed later on. You will notice yourself falling through platforms, sometimes at random. Luckily you'll respawn back at the puzzle you were last at or pathway you were last exploring, but I think it has something to do with the mis-interaction with different solid planes. You can also accidentally stumble upon further levels while exploring, but you can't interact with them until you advance far enough with the ones before it.\n\nAll in all, it's a stunning addition to the adventure game collection and I can't wait to get further into it, perhaps playing around the the music studio feature more.","April 22, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an often, harsh mistress that teaches you almost nothing (beyond the standard controls).\n\nAs you progress through 1 of 3 different puzzle trees, you unlock music creation tools for your hub world that allow you to chill out away from the puzzles and create a tune that is characteristically you.\n\nThe game, while a fantastic voyage via puzzles does a great job of explaining nothing, it also hits you with so much colour that the next step that you could or should be going isn't always clear. While this is clearly to allow you the freedom to explore wherever you want to go, it is at times more overwhelming instead of the freedom of exploration. As you're limited to very few actions that you can perform beyond simple movement.\n\nIt's well worth a look in for people that are interested in a colourful, egaging and challenging journey that is incredibly distinctive from the gritty palettes of war and death that we've come to expect from most games. I know I'll be playing more of this title, to better understand and uncover more of what FRACT has to offer.","April 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You're dropped into a very large open world, with no instruction or guidance.  I don't need my hand held when I'm playing a game, but I couldn't even tell when I was looking at a puzzle, or scenery.  The openness of the world means it's impossible to have any kind of meaningful puzzle difficulty curve, which makes it very hard to learn the "language" of the game, and understand what it is you're trying to do.  The reviews indicate that there's probably a pretty decent experience to be had here.

Pay attention: I didn't play the game long because it got me bored and frustrated very quickly (and I am a classical musician with perfect pitch, I was intrigued by this game).\n\nWorld built on sound: it is not built on sound. You hear sounds, exclusively electronic/synthetic. How the world is built on sound I don't know. No, it is not as interesting as it "sounds".\n\nSolving puzzles: that's not solving, that's messing around with something until it triggers something else. In no way the game tells you what to do (I don't say it should), and the puzzles have no way of getting your interest. Also the interaction system is quite confusing and you have to constantly stand in the right spot or you won't see the things you can interact with (rapid transport is an example).\n\nAbstract landscape: it does not look as nice as in the screenshots. The colors are not as vivid, the lighting is not as good, everything looks quite plain. Plus, your character (even while sprinting) is so slow that getting from one place to the other (even though there are rapid transports) is a pain.\n\nI will give it a second chance I hope, but really, don't make my same mistake, know more about the game, I was just intrigued by the description and the screenshots, I should have known better.","February 24","false","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I wanted, so badly, to like this game.\nAn entire strange world to explore? Based around music? With loads of puzzles and mysteries to solve? Count me in.\nAnd, yeah, for the first two hours, I was amazed.\nBut it quickly came apparant to me that this game is lacking lots of substance. Each level in each area is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzle with slight variation. And there are only 3 areas in the entire game! One of the core puzzles the game is a pipe puzzle where you turn pipes to direct the flow of lasers! I mean what kind of bland, unoriginal idea for a puzzle is that?\nThe gameplay basically boils down to this:\n-enter new area\n-solve puzzle\n-compose song to open doors/power lasers\n-rinse and repeat until all completely identical puzzles are complete\n-go back to first part of the area\n-realise you have to go back to each and every puzzle to find a combination code for the final puzzle\n-get out some ♥♥♥♥ing paper\n-fly back to all the previous puzzles and write down the code\n-go back to the first part again\n-input the code\nYeey area done. Just do that two more times, and then the game is over.\nThe visuals and sound are gorgeous, I can't deny that. But what's the point in exploring and sucking up the atmosphere of this strange landscape when everything looks the same?\nNot worth your time or your money, even on sale.\nThe in-game sythesiser is pretty nice and suprisingly complex, but it's just an extra feature and doesn't save the game at all.\nKeep in mind that I don't just say this because I want to be a funny little troll and hate on a game just because lots of other people like it.

The puzzles felt fun and original and it neither felt like I was reusing old solutions nor was the main core mechanic of each set being under-used (i.e. being introduced then taken away for another mechanic).\n\nThe exploration is really nicely done, it felt like Dark Souls level of "do it yourself, we're not giving you a map or anything", and while it was confusing at first until you realise how pathing works, it made me feel a lot more free and immersed within the game.\n\nThe artstyle is something I was a big fan of, very Tron like yet it wasn't sickening with neon. The colours stood out and made key areas and visuals clear, as the rest of the game is rather dark in shading.\n\nThe music was absolutely beautiful and probably the game's highlight. Every little part of the game, from the puzzles (which I noticed changed either modulations or notes on the main synthesizer) to the little expanding platforms changes the music in some way and makes the world feel magical and mysterious. The atmosphere it creates is one that enchanted me from the beginning to the end.\n\nThe little unlockables at the end that unlock parts of the synth to use are probably one of the most desirable unlockables I've ever come across in any game. Unlike Crackdown's orbs or Meat Boy's bandages (both games I enjoyed but did not feel invested in the collectables, even though they changed the game in some way), this game goes for short but sweet collectables that add modulations and functions to the additional synthesizer which can be used to make pretty tracks without needing too much experience in music design itself. In fact, the game sort of teaches you about certain aspects of music design and effect through its puzzles, like one for instance which works on timing decay.\n\nIf I had to say there was something lacking, it would be the loss of (at least I don't think there is) a story or underlying message. This could however just be me unable to observe or notice it, though. Also, there isn't much replayability outside of the synth, but the synth does kind of make up for that by itself.\n\nAll in all I had a great time playing this game and I continue to play around with the synth. I would absolutely recommend buying this game if you can, it's well worth your time and money.","January 5, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's overall style makes me feel like I'm in Tron, the first movie, but with a few minor twists which also give it an odd Myst-feel to it (maybe the obscurity of some of the solutions and the amount of exploration available). It's actually surprisingly rewarding, because as you solve more puzzles, you have more control over your studio, which motivates you to complete all the puzzles, so you have full control over that part of the machine. By the end of the game, you have a much cooler, and more advanced machine to work with, and then you can refine your beats even moreso.\n\n(Un)fortunately, there's an unlock for it too. Un-, because you can cheat to the end and spoil yourself, like the brat you are; more about the destination, and avoiding a good trip. Fortunately, in case you accidentally delete your old save, or lose your progress, or are just overall frustrated with the game, and want to skip the hassle (Hint: awareness and critical thinking are your firiends with these kinds of games. Explore a bit, think outside the box for a moment, grow a pair and do something risky for the hell of it, or if you feel desperate, or to freefall off a part of the environment for fun of it), and have some fun making your own music.\n\nBeating it is it's own reward, and freaking beautiful while at it.\nThe final puzzle makes your own ending theme tune. Mind you, you can adjust at any time as you make progress, and don't need to backtrack; they also contribute to the beats you can use to make your tune too.

Some I'd call adequate at best, some I'd call great, some I'd call worthwhile. This title in particular breaks the mold in a way, but to simplify: I tried "Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery" some time ago and loved it for the music, the scope, the narrative which was only told in frames and tiny sections. It is the closest thing I can think of to compare to FRACT OSC. However... unlike Sword and Sworcery, this game bypasses pesky things like conflict and resolution, and tells a story that cannot be told with plain words. It is not long, or passionate about things like character building, or a good example of combat with many -isms that make it stand out, and yet it is special and thus deserves attention.\nIt is not perfect, but FRACT OSC utilizes what is special about the medium of video games with more finesse and more beauty than anything else I have seen.

This game, with it's focus on exploration, sounds, and visuals, is a rather breath of fresh care amongst the army of first person puzzle games the indie market has churned out. There's something eerie, yet comfortable about traveling through the dark, neon worlds of Fract OSC. Solving puzzles at your lesure with only a few audiable cues leaves you with a challenge that's not overbearing, but at the same time still asking to be completed. I think the main reason why that is, is because nothing is telling you to complete it. The game drops you right in the Fract world, where exploration is the draw, and the puzzles locking you away from exploring more.\n\nThe droning, yet not harsh soundtrack adds even more to the relaxing atmosphere. My only gripe is that while the sound is there, it's a rather silent game, in which either more ambience or an actual musical soundtrack is needed at times.\n\nFract OSC isn't an exploration game with a goal or story to tell, nor is it a puzzle game seeking to challenge you. It's a game that keeps your brain active enough to explore it's digital tunnels without pressing you to do so. It's a game that can put you to sleep, and that's not a bad thing.","August 17, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like the world from Reboot except 15 times more mysterious, massive, and dark. and a lot like Myst except the puzzles are even more enjoyable, awarding, and unique. But my favorite part of the game is that the massive world around you changes as you fix and connect all sorts of titanic machinery. It's awesome to see turbines, generators and beams of energy moving, flowint, working, and connecting together as you repair this sleeping dimension. (and nothing in the game is behind the safety of invisible walls where the player may only assume that other things are out there. Every single thing that exists in the dimension from start to finish, for anyone who loves to explore). And I find that the minimalistic graphics help improve the immersion of trying to figure out what this world is and why you are in it. "Am I standing on oddly shapped soil or 100% pure crystal? Are these temples or factories you're exploring, or titanic hand held tools built by alien gods??? If you have an imagination, you would love every second this game reveals to you. (and lots of exploration and secret areas. LOOOOTS of exploration and secret areas). my only regret is that I want a FRACT 2, which I'm almost positive will never happen :'(\n","October 10, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player lands on an alien world, populated only by a flora of luminescent polygons and strange contraptions. Tron comes to mind when thinking about what this whole world looks like, but there isn't a lot of well-known examples that rely heavily on neon lighting and simple geometric shapes. The trailer gives a good idea of what the game looks like.\n\nSimilar to Myst's level design, each contraption is located on a seperate section of the map (islands, in Myst's case). So in a sense, it's non-linear. The player gets to choose where he heads out first, and the order in which the contraptions are tackled don't really affect how the game turns out.\n\nWhat's interesting about this game is that solving the puzzles creates music "tracks". One of the machines spits out a drum loop, another one some chords, and due to the nature of the puzzles, there are usually a few possible solutions for each one. At the end, you get to play around with your creation, remix it, put in some effects... it's actually a lot fun !\n\nThere's even a surprisingly apt step-sequencer located at the map's main hub (your spawning spot, basically). Each puzzle solved unlocks a module in the step-sequencer (bass-line, lead synths, pad sounds, etc.), so one you've finished the game, you can give it a go and try to create your very own electronic jingle. Don't get me wrong, it's not a professional studio tool, but it's still a very nice way to finish off the game.\n\nPros\nVery cool visuals\nA nice twist on the Myst-genre (if there is such a thing)\nNice soundtrack\nCool synthesizer and step-sequencer at the end that rewards you for your hard work playing the game :P\n\nCons\nPuzzles are a little too simple, would have liked a larger arc that spans accross the entire map\nPlaythrough is a little short","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to venture out from my hotel and explore the city of Erbil. But instead I mostly stuck close to our Peshmerga guards and my friends in our medical service team as we shuttled from location to location. Still, our group braved the communication divide a few times, usually in marketplace situations where Iraqui Dinar could do all the talking. The question lingered in the back of my mind each time we stepped out, “How well are we going to be able to read our environment?” Some navigational anxiety was sated by the fact that I still had familiar objects to read and relate to – things like trees, buildings, cars, and friends. Our group stuck together in this setting, leaning on one another to make sense of our alien surroundings.\n\nIn FRACT OSC, I had no language, objects, or friends to relate to. It was just me, exploring an alien world made of abstract shapes and synthesizers.\n\nI needed my music-literate buddy, Max, to help make sense of the world.\n\nFRACT OSC invites me into extreme illiteracy. It’s like landing in a country I’m even less prepared for than Kurdish Iraq. My FRACT illiteracy reminds me of my own privileges. And just how hard it must for people to understand the world with limited access to friends and family. FRACT OSC got rather unpleasant at times, but I also think it’s brilliant. It drew discomfort out of my own inability to read the world. It drew me into reliance on somebody other than myself. And reminded me that understanding often comes from community.\n\nFor the record, I haven’t completed the game. But you can be sure I’m saving it for the next time Max comes over.\n\nRead more: http://gamechurch.com/feeling-foreign-in-fract-osc/","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's overall style makes me feel like I'm in Tron, the first movie, but with a few minor twists which also give it an odd Myst-feel to it (maybe the obscurity of some of the solutions and the amount of exploration available). It's actually surprisingly rewarding, because as you solve more puzzles, you have more control over your studio, which motivates you to complete all the puzzles, so you have full control over that part of the machine. By the end of the game, you have a much cooler, and more advanced machine to work with, and then you can refine your beats even moreso.\n\n(Un)fortunately, there's an unlock for it too. Un-, because you can cheat to the end and spoil yourself, like the brat you are; more about the destination, and avoiding a good trip. Fortunately, in case you accidentally delete your old save, or lose your progress, or are just overall frustrated with the game, and want to skip the hassle (Hint: awareness and critical thinking are your firiends with these kinds of games. Explore a bit, think outside the box for a moment, grow a pair and do something risky for the hell of it, or if you feel desperate, or to freefall off a part of the environment for fun of it), and have some fun making your own music.\n\nBeating it is it's own reward, and freaking beautiful while at it.\nThe final puzzle makes your own ending theme tune. Mind you, you can adjust at any time as you make progress, and don't need to backtrack; they also contribute to the beats you can use to make your tune too.

It is the closest thing I can think of to compare to FRACT OSC. However... unlike Sword and Sworcery, this game bypasses pesky things like conflict and resolution, and tells a story that cannot be told with plain words. It is not long, or passionate about things like character building, or a good example of combat with many -isms that make it stand out, and yet it is special and thus deserves attention.\nIt is not perfect, but FRACT OSC utilizes what is special about the medium of video games with more finesse and more beauty than anything else I have seen.

This game, with it's focus on exploration, sounds, and visuals, is a rather breath of fresh care amongst the army of first person puzzle games the indie market has churned out. There's something eerie, yet comfortable about traveling through the dark, neon worlds of Fract OSC. Solving puzzles at your lesure with only a few audiable cues leaves you with a challenge that's not overbearing, but at the same time still asking to be completed. I think the main reason why that is, is because nothing is telling you to complete it. The game drops you right in the Fract world, where exploration is the draw, and the puzzles locking you away from exploring more.\n\nThe droning, yet not harsh soundtrack adds even more to the relaxing atmosphere. My only gripe is that while the sound is there, it's a rather silent game, in which either more ambience or an actual musical soundtrack is needed at times.\n\nFract OSC isn't an exploration game with a goal or story to tell, nor is it a puzzle game seeking to challenge you. It's a game that keeps your brain active enough to explore it's digital tunnels without pressing you to do so. It's a game that can put you to sleep, and that's not a bad thing.","August 17, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the abstract nature and lack of handholding, and I especially recommend this game to my programming cohort ;).\n\nI grabbed this game in a bundle- and this game single-handedly influenced my decision to go ahead and get the bundle. This game is at first glance, sheer EYE-CANDY! Although, as I will go on to explain, it is much more than that. As a person who loves point-and-click games- this game is a 3D adventure/exploration with puzzles and P&C without the inventory.\n\nI want to quote the developer here, "Fract is not just about exploring a world or solving its puzzles, but it's about taking a journey of musical discovery". I feel this statement is so true. As a self-proclaimed music and puzzle aficionado, I thought the combination of lights and sound was an excellent foundation, and the abstract nature of this game did not slow me down at all. Some people may feel the game begs the question "what do I do?” to which I pose the answer- try stuff. The game has a good feedback loop- you will realize the game is not linear and it is not a sandbox. The game will respond to "correct actions" by lighting stuff up, which should naturally incline you to try more of that stuff. The finale of the game culminates into a musical puzzle symphony experience.\n\nThe game has some replay value- (in fact, I’m feeling the urge to go and replay after posting this review-  keep in mind it’s been a few months since I played last). You can also go into your “studio” and make your own beats and loops- even though that’s not my “thing” that’s still a pretty cool feature .

In order to discuss it, you have to explain how you've interacted with a series of interconnected, interrelated musical art installations in a virtual space ─ fairly abstract installations, at that.\n\nGetting blunt about it, the game/experience essentially is teaching you fundamentals [and a few finer points] of step sequenced electronic music. Imagine if the makers of the Roland MC 505 built an ancient city driven by this kind of sequential input to make stuff work.\n\nFor me, there is a truly soothing quality to the game. It's also one of the very few puzzle games I'm willing to play.\nIf you enjoy things like ambient electronica, I can't recommend this game enough.","July 10, 2014","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Admittedly not played too much but it feels like its not going to last particularly long. I would like to say that there are indeed tutorials for this game, to all those who say its confusing/too vague in its execution but personally I couldnt be bothered to watch them. The handful of puzzles I've done thus far seem a bit obscure but if youre familiar to puzzle games, I dont think you should have too much trouble deducing the logical steps necessary to solve them. So far, I dont hate it. I am wondering to what end this game leads but I dont know if thats the point; I expect a finale indicative of Antichamber in that it will be bold and eventful and thats really how im playing this; as a game similar to antichamber.\n\nDespite this, I am not really the most interested in music "production" so im at a loss for some of its features and the sounds I can play with thus far arent exactly the kind of thing I would go for anyway. Its quite horrible in places if im being honest, its a bit sharp if that makes sense. Thats just preference though; reminds me of wearing a cheap pair of headphones on max volume. HOWEVER this is not actually the case in-game (thus far). This is me talking about the production in the "studio".\n\nIf you liked Antichamber (I did but god that game ♥♥♥♥ed with my eyes) then I dont think you will be disappointed by this. It lacks some of the finesse of the former but its entertaining nonetheless. I also like playing a game with no hand-holding what-so-ever, every once in a while as I feel games seem to be getting easier and its just refreshing to actually feel like youve acomplished something.\n\nWould I buy it for £10.99 knowing what i know, probably not but in the region of £7, probably. Saying that, I've read its about 8hrs in length which really isnt too bad considering Antichamber cost the same?? and was far less than that; you can get through that in something like 10mins?","May 3, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game avoids that nonsense entirely and gives you direct control over a little DAW piece by piece, teaching you to use it without ever saying a word and then using your first faltering steps at the sequencers to light up the world with tunes.  Its a fun game- a rare breed where you can say that the gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack are all good- but here, all those words mean exactly the same thing.\n\nThat's not to say its perfect: it doesn't break out of any genres or define a new one.  Almost all of the challenges you'll encounter in Fract are classic video game puzzlers (I won't describe any of them at the risk of spoiling how they work with music), and although they sometimes combine creatively with platforming in the world, its mostly just creative falling onto the next platform or stage.  Exploring the world is a big draw, but it also gets extremely frustrating when some of the icons don't match up meaningwise or there's absolutely no indication of where to go.\n\nBut overall, FRACT is a game worth even the full price.  Its one of the first indie games in a long time that sucked me in from beginning to end; even without a story, the world compells you to see just how it all might end.","May 26, 2014","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But my favorite part of the game is that the massive world around you changes as you fix and connect all sorts of titanic machinery. It's awesome to see turbines, generators and beams of energy moving, flowint, working, and connecting together as you repair this sleeping dimension. (and nothing in the game is behind the safety of invisible walls where the player may only assume that other things are out there. Every single thing that exists in the dimension from start to finish, for anyone who loves to explore).

Tron comes to mind when thinking about what this whole world looks like, but there isn't a lot of well-known examples that rely heavily on neon lighting and simple geometric shapes. The trailer gives a good idea of what the game looks like.\n\nSimilar to Myst's level design, each contraption is located on a seperate section of the map (islands, in Myst's case). So in a sense, it's non-linear. The player gets to choose where he heads out first, and the order in which the contraptions are tackled don't really affect how the game turns out.\n\nWhat's interesting about this game is that solving the puzzles creates music "tracks". One of the machines spits out a drum loop, another one some chords, and due to the nature of the puzzles, there are usually a few possible solutions for each one. At the end, you get to play around with your creation, remix it, put in some effects... it's actually a lot fun !\n\nThere's even a surprisingly apt step-sequencer located at the map's main hub (your spawning spot, basically). Each puzzle solved unlocks a module in the step-sequencer (bass-line, lead synths, pad sounds, etc.), so one you've finished the game, you can give it a go and try to create your very own electronic jingle. Don't get me wrong, it's not a professional studio tool, but it's still a very nice way to finish off the game.\n\nPros\nVery cool visuals\nA nice twist on the Myst-genre (if there is such a thing)\nNice soundtrack\nCool synthesizer and step-sequencer at the end that rewards you for your hard work playing the game :P\n\nCons\nPuzzles are a little too simple, would have liked a larger arc that spans accross the entire map\nPlaythrough is a little short","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to venture out from my hotel and explore the city of Erbil. But instead I mostly stuck close to our Peshmerga guards and my friends in our medical service team as we shuttled from location to location. Still, our group braved the communication divide a few times, usually in marketplace situations where Iraqui Dinar could do all the talking. The question lingered in the back of my mind each time we stepped out, “How well are we going to be able to read our environment?” Some navigational anxiety was sated by the fact that I still had familiar objects to read and relate to – things like trees, buildings, cars, and friends. Our group stuck together in this setting, leaning on one another to make sense of our alien surroundings.\n\nIn FRACT OSC, I had no language, objects, or friends to relate to. It was just me, exploring an alien world made of abstract shapes and synthesizers.\n\nI needed my music-literate buddy, Max, to help make sense of the world.\n\nFRACT OSC invites me into extreme illiteracy. It’s like landing in a country I’m even less prepared for than Kurdish Iraq. My FRACT illiteracy reminds me of my own privileges. And just how hard it must for people to understand the world with limited access to friends and family. FRACT OSC got rather unpleasant at times, but I also think it’s brilliant. It drew discomfort out of my own inability to read the world. It drew me into reliance on somebody other than myself. And reminded me that understanding often comes from community.\n\nFor the record, I haven’t completed the game. But you can be sure I’m saving it for the next time Max comes over.\n\nRead more: http://gamechurch.com/feeling-foreign-in-fract-osc/","September 24, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No violence, no worries - totally family friendly. Lots of needing to figure things out on your own and interpreting abstract events as they come.\n\nGameplay: The game has a very unique and well executed blend of music, puzzles, and exploration. This is not found in any other game I have played. The environment oozes with music and custom tones that are affected by what you do to the environment. The game is not super easy, which is very good, because I like a challenge. The only thing I would have liked to see more is a bit more variance in the puzzle mechanics - many of them are represented as synth / equalizer adjustments to get the right combination. But overall, the game did still boast a good variety of puzzles.\n\nVisuals and Audio: Superb. Game is beautiful in both regards. ESPECIALLY audio (of course!). There are loads of environments and the music and abstract visuals actually blend together in harmony - very nice!\n\nNote: my review doesn't even consider the aspects of the custom synthesizer aspect of the game in which you can compose your own works of music.

How much you will enjoy it depends on how well your personal axis' lines up with these two realities (so, results may vary).\n\nI am, personally, a bit of an electronic musician.  Rebirth, Cubase, Korgs, an 808 and Ableton Live are things I like to just pull out to play with.  The fact that some insane geniuses took elements from all of these (and much much more) and turned them into a puzzle game is, frankly, just too amazing for my fragile phsyche to fully explain in a way that doesn't involve my labido exploding into neon flavored goo.  The fact that they then made this wet dream of mine look like a Tron redux...ooooohhh....the words, where are my words?

The puzzles and layout of the world are seperated into three main areas; blue/cyan, green, and red/pink. They vary wildy from block puzzles that test spatial awareness, to connecting conduits ala Pipe Dream. At the end of each main puzzle is a step synth music puzzle. the main puzzles were really well thought out, and the final puzzzles in each section involve interesting clues and solutions.\n\nThe visual astetic of the game is wonderful and reminds me of Tron. Neon colored lights, mostly monotone base colors make it look very 90's cyberpunkesce. The music is not as present as I thought it would be. The music that is there though, it is really immersive and does come to life because of your actions. That is really cool.\n\nThe step synth puzzles were a little annoying, because they required a bit too much trial and error. Outside of the main areas there is not much to do. The game is also a bit on the short side. It does'nt have much replayability other than to mess with the in game music maker. I would recommend this game if you like point and click adventure games or something like Antichamber.

It's a first-person puzzle game with somewhat nonlinear progression and some extra stuff hidden away if you search for it. I'm fine with that being the case, since it's really quite good, but it's a bit misleading to really call this an exploration game.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of three main zones each focusing on two puzzle types. One puzzle type tends to be involving both movement and problem solving, while the other type is a sequencer-type thing about trying to get all nodes activated at the same time or in a certain order. For the first type, the closer you get to solving the puzzle, the louder the music swells. The second type, your puzzle solution creates a melody of its own (though there's probably a very finite amount of solutions, but there's definitely some degree of freedom present regardless.) There's also some code-type objects hidden away that you need to be on the lookout for.\n\nI don't want to describe too much the gameplay because there is a good bit of figuring out how stuff works and there's enjoyment to be had in that, tinkering with new puzzle objects until you understand what the puzzle is, and each branch of the main zone adds complexity and challenge to the puzzles along its sequence, although there's nothing really too tough here.\n\nAlso, I should say that the game is -beautiful-, aesthetically, just, perfect, I love it. The music is pretty nice too though perhaps a bit homogenous, but there's not an excess of it and the silence is used to great effect as well. Presentation-wise this game knows exactly what it's doing and does it well.\n\nI think the game is a bit short for the asking price (though I got it 75% off, so, can't complain) and it's not quite as deep of an experience as I was expecting but I would certainly say it's a good game and definitely worth checking out.","February 18, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of them have felt appropriate enough; the best I can say for them is that they were not wrong, just not right enough.\nBut, that's both the trick and the beauty behind FRACT OSC! In order to discuss it, you have to explain how you've interacted with a series of interconnected, interrelated musical art installations in a virtual space ─ fairly abstract installations, at that.\n\nGetting blunt about it, the game/experience essentially is teaching you fundamentals [and a few finer points] of step sequenced electronic music. Imagine if the makers of the Roland MC 505 built an ancient city driven by this kind of sequential input to make stuff work.\n\nFor me, there is a truly soothing quality to the game.

The devs told people who experienced it to go into the options menu in-game and uncheck a box, and that got rid of about 70% of crackling for me, but 30% is still a lot for a sound based game.\n\nThe devs told us that people with low end sound cards would experience the crackling, but even some people with high end setups also said they had audio problems. I would guess about 20% of players reported this audio issue.\n\nTo my knowledge, the devs still haven't been able to pinpoint a commonality for why so many users across the spectrum have had crackles. and as a result, no patch has ever been released.\n\nBut the game is very pleasing to the ear(when there's no crackling, of course), and it's puzzles are challenging. As you solve puzzles, you unlock elements of a synthesizer. Once you unlock everything, you can use it to make your own music in the game.\n\nIf you get the game, I would buy the game on a sale and just hope that you're not one of the unlucky ones who experience the audio crackles.","June 27, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the abstract nature and lack of handholding, and I especially recommend this game to my programming cohort ;).\n\nI grabbed this game in a bundle- and this game single-handedly influenced my decision to go ahead and get the bundle. This game is at first glance, sheer EYE-CANDY! Although, as I will go on to explain, it is much more than that. As a person who loves point-and-click games- this game is a 3D adventure/exploration with puzzles and P&C without the inventory.\n\nI want to quote the developer here, "Fract is not just about exploring a world or solving its puzzles, but it's about taking a journey of musical discovery". I feel this statement is so true. As a self-proclaimed music and puzzle aficionado, I thought the combination of lights and sound was an excellent foundation, and the abstract nature of this game did not slow me down at all. Some people may feel the game begs the question "what do I do?” to which I pose the answer- try stuff. The game has a good feedback loop- you will realize the game is not linear and it is not a sandbox. The game will respond to "correct actions" by lighting stuff up, which should naturally incline you to try more of that stuff. The finale of the game culminates into a musical puzzle symphony experience.\n\nThe game has some replay value- (in fact, I’m feeling the urge to go and replay after posting this review-  keep in mind it’s been a few months since I played last). You can also go into your “studio” and make your own beats and loops- even though that’s not my “thing” that’s still a pretty cool feature . All in all a great game, and I recommend you give it a try.\n","October 28, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't really tell you much of anything at all which is likely a major detractor for many, but you're basically repairing destroyed instruments through puzzles and things. Because the game doesn't explain how to do anything, it can be a pain just to figure out what's going on, but once you do and the instrument starts working there's this awesome feeling of success.

Throughout the course of the game, the player completes a variety of puzzles, sculpts the soundtrack, and slowly deciphers a symbology highly resonant of electronic music synthesis and sequencing. I found the greatest reward of the game to be exploring beautiful neon clad low-poly environment, which was a great experience in and of itself.\n\nI thought the puzzles were decent - nothing amazing, but well crafted, and they ocasionally had me stumped. I wish there were more "ah-ha" moments, and some instances felt repetetive, or draged due to the necessity of repeatedly traversing its physical strucutre. On the whole they were enjoyable, but I did not find them to be the strong suit of the game.\n\nThe music elements are quite nice. The soundtrack is frequently derived from the actual solution to various music puzzles, yeilding a personilized experience. The only "downside" to this connection between solution and soundtrack, was that often working solutions did not yeild the most musical results (noting that this opinion is solely due to my own subjective musical tastes). Overall, I found this to be a very minor detail, and almost a moot point next to the highly polished sound design and music production.\n\nThe "studio" is a nice feature -  allowing you to compose your own music using various sequencer and parameter modules unlocked through completing puzzles. As someone used to writing electronic music outside of the gaming experience provided by FRACT OSC, I did personally not find it to be a particularly useful tool. Especially using an xbox controller, the system is time consuming to navigate and somewhat limited in its parameters. That said, I could see the Studio being enjoyable to someone new to the experience. To me it was primarily novel for its existence, rather than its functionality.\n\nI definitely suggest checking out FRACT OSC, especially if you like electronic music, puzzle games such as Antichamber, and exploring open audio/visual worlds.

Every single part of the game has had obvious work put into it, and the world reacts to your presence in increasingly surprising ways.  As you explore through the game and solve more puzzles, the areas around you evolve increasingly, giving a sense of progress and satisfaction that kept me motivated to continue.  The music builds gradually as you solve a puzzle and seeing the area that you just traversed light up and make a great song continues to be rewarding every time.\n\nI was afraid to buy this game for a while due to my computer not meeting the minimum system requirements, but it somehow ran the game just fine with only a few problems.  Even if the audio was interrupted in several places, Fract OSC was a wonderful experience regardless.\n\nUnfortunately because of how intricate the game is, it is also extremely confusing in certain places.  You will likely be spending a long time trying to find the correct path, and may need to watch video walkthroughs at certain points, as some of the paths are darker and less noticeable than the scenery, causing me to wander very far in the wrong direction.  This is especially inconvenient when backtracking through each level once the end has been reached.  The teleportation hubs mitigate this a bit, but they were sometimes located relatively out of the way and made travelling a bit inconvenient. The solutions to certain puzzles were also placed in very strange locations, and were sometimes presented in ways that were difficult to decipher.  The vibrant design of Fract OSC can be disorienting, but it still proves to be enjoyable for its mind-blowing architecture.\n\nAside from that, there will likely be more than a few instances where you are so amazed by what's happening around you that you walk straight off ledges and fall to your death.  This is an unavoidable side effect of such a beautiful game.\n\nUltimately, I'm very happy with what I got for my money, and if you like exploration games with maximum freedom, then I highly recommend that you buy this one.","March 17","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
