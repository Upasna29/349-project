"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/412730/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Days Under Custody is a horror adventure and a one man project; developed, programmed and produced by Abraham Carreola. Aside containing a certain charm with atmosphere, it fails to deliver any story twist or originality - or a proper narrative build up with decent enough English language; and somewhat odd control scheme doesn't come to be feasible either.\n\nAs our brief experience takes a start, we take on the role of Duc Parkings, a man that we know nothing about - aside him living in an apartment complex and getting stalked by a creepy ghostly guy without a definite identity. As Duc, we walk around, solve a series of quite basic puzzles, dodge some stalkers by hiding in closets or running through stairs, doors etc. at the right moment and collect some notes around to get a clue on the nature of events. The ending revelation is nothing miraculous though.\n\nThe story - or what could be deemed as a story from odd, short notes and uninspired monologues with badly broken English - isn't anything imaginative, interesting or consistently satisfactory. There is no build up, no narrative implication, no cleverly arranged symbolism. 2 puzzles (one narrative, one mathematical), 3-4 monster avoiding encounters and a couple of item usages; and bam! You are at the end of the game within half an hour. Depending on the number of notes you’ve managed to collect throughout your gameplay, you either get the good ending or the bad ending. Neither of those story revelations are satisfactory or fitting. The game plays on ideas like identity complication, mania, commitment etc. but neither the narrative nor the symbolic display are successful enough to present you a decent plotline.\n\nTalking about the gameplay, controls are needlessly disunited. On a side scrolling environment; you move through A/D, interact with E, lead dialogue with F, search with mouse and use space + direction keys for puzzle combinations and to use the menu. Saving system badly glitches, leaving your saved games corrupted with the main character not being able to move whatever key you'd press and only 4 saving spaces are given to begin with. Graphics are decent for a pixel art horror adventure, with not much diversity in display to enhance the setting though.\n\nThere has been a bad misunderstanding between the producer and Valve during game's launch, that made legitimate game keys bought from indie gala to be revoked from people's accounts, and that mostly left everyone sour about this game aside the content itself. That has been corrected, and people got compensated. There has also been some updates to improve game play. But playing the game myself, I could sadly vouch that no one was missing anything wondrous here by not being able to play anyhow.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","April 1","false","3.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","5"

Solve some riddles, crack some codes, find all the notes and escape the house of horror. 2 different endings await you. The sound effects are brillant and the graphics are oldschool. You control over A= left  D=right and E=interact and F=close/read dialogues. Also you search all furniture and pictures  for keys and notes over mouse pointer.\nThe game was famous for the first bundle revoked keys on Steam after there was a misunderstanding with Indiegala.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/recommended/412730/","adam1224","adam1224","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/","1546 products in account","Honestly, I can't recommed this game - it's content has the potential to be good, but it's ridden so many problems, that it turns the okay experience to the unpleasant one. It's a promising step, but strictly based on price and value this game is far behind a lot of other games in the store.\nThe positive things first:\n- It has a nice pixel asthetics to the game, as seen on the screenhots\n- Mystery stories are good by default, at least in my book. There's just something rewarding uncovering the hidden past.\n\nThe negatives are sadly part of a way, way longer list.\n- The art style is nice, but uses extremely low-frame animations, and lots of recurring objects. Hiding in wardrobes done in 1 frame, turning also 1 frame, and I'm sure even the protagonist's walking has less than 5 different frames to it.\n- The story does make no sense at some points.  Weird sounds from the outside? Better get a key from the second floor to close the front door (why is every other door closed but not the front one?). Then break the key in the lock. Worry not, spare key in the computer (????) - and when you're an arm's reach from it, sounds from the kitchen. So, we don't take the key, go to check the kitchen, but we have to hide from someone/something. What happens afterwards? Do we get the key, or check the kitchen? No, just go around, stuff will happen and continue in that direction. Kitchen, closing of the front door is forgotten forever.    The game is a nightmare-ish sequence, but it's so inconsistent it's impossible to tell if deliberately confusing or badly written\n-The controls are a huge clusterf**k. A-D to move left and right, E to interact, F to progress in text during descriptions (why not E?). When you need to enter a combination, or save, then you can't use wasd to move though the options, you need to use arrow keys and space. You have mouse support for clicking on environment (only to look for items, not for actual interaction... why?) and in the save menu, but not at the combination part. Also, you need to click on your notes menu by mouse, pick a note by mouse (you can't use keyboard here afaik), and then close them by mouse - or use C to close note and E to close menu.  Why the hell does this game use a-d-e-f-c + 4 arrows and space = TEN different buttons + mouse when  a-d-e-c + mouse would be enough for all the functions, and multiple buttons used in one situation solely? I don't know if this was a port from a console-written first version or not, this is one of the most non-intuitive system I've seen recently.\n- Tried to make a screenshot, chrome developer tools opened up.\n- If you escape the game to the main menu, the game repeatedly freezes. I tried to restart the game to get the bad ending after collecting twenty-few notes (and getting the achievement for 27 notes, I have no idea how) and it repeatedly froze as well when I wanted to start a new one. Options worked with arrow keys and spacebar, new game made the game stop working.  Additionally, the game needs to be terminated from Task Manager every single time because it keeps running even after closing the window.\n\nAfterall, I got the game from a bundle, so it cost me a really small amount. The game is pretty easy to 100% because it's really short (can be completed in an hour or such), but considering how short, and lacking it is in several ways, there's no way I can recommend this for the asking price of 5$ - on a sale about 1$ seems pretty reasonable.\nAnd I wanted to add this to the end: it's not a *bad* game. It works, it just have a relatively low quality, which can be improved, especially if the developer is willing to look into the problems, and either fixes it with patches, or avoids making the mistakes in the upcoming game(s). While the game is not the best, don't give up on the developer!","April 23","false","11.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Your name is Duc. I could hardly believe it either), who’s been taunted by horrible nightmares. One late night, after another fit of bad dreaming, Duc falls under a sinister impression; his inner demons are manifesting themselves into reality, and their trying to break into his apartment. It’s the player’s job to escape whatever madness peruses them, and to uncover the truth behind Duc’s murky history.\n\nWe’ll start things off with the graphics. The quality isn’t terrible, but it’s pixel art at its simplest. There’s nothing in the design department that’ll keep you hooked, and character models and animations are very stiff and barebones. There were some moments when the game looked aesthetically pleasing, like the dancing of dust specs beneath the grimy light of a sewer lamp, but those moments were few and far between.\n\nAs for gameplay, it’s what you’d expect. Puzzles with some survival mechanics thrown into the mix, with a side of item collecting. Duc’s movement speed is terribly slow, and walking down one long hallway to the next, only to realize that you missed something down the previous hallway is not a fun experience. Occasionally, an axe-wielding killer will appear at scripted moments, and you’ll have to hide yourself inside dressers to evade him. But these scenarios can be very cheap. The killer’s appearances are so random and misplaced that (unless you’ve played the game before) a first-time player will have to learn from his/her mistake on the next go. This is why I highly recommend you save game as frequently as possible, lest you have to trek all the way back from your last save point.\n\nLastly, the story…\n\nEh… It’s a stunted mess of scatterbrained mystery pieces and untapped potential. I won’t spoil anything for you, but the twist ending is so cliché that I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. The story can be uncovered by finding notes, which are hidden all over the game. But the dev must’ve used Google as his main source of translation. I’ve seen bad grammar before, but sheesh. A word of advice to all indie devs: If English isn’t your first language, it is VITAL that you hire a professional translator, if possible.\n\nWhat makes me sad is… Days Under Custody has the heart and soul of something great, but it lives in the body of a mediocre product. Some real effort was put in, but there are so many better games you could buy for 5 bucks or less. But I’m confident that this developer will make something great.","December 12, 2015","false","1.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It doesn't really have any unique or special mechanics when it comes to hiding from the 'mysterious man' or any unique scares that really make this game stand out. The characters itself are okay I guess, some of them feel a bit stiff in the sense of the animations. Not really much else to talk about in the Overview.\n\nGame PlaySo let's start off with some good things that I found while playing this game. Firstly, I like the story very much. It is basically a game in the perspective of a guy called Duc who you play as, you wake up and find out that his neighbours where killed by a psycho. Throughout the game you find random notes in places of the house, while trying to avoid the psycho that killed your neighbours. I would suggest for the best possible experience of the game is to use headphones throughout your gaming experience of the game. Even though the story isn't very well presented I still like the whole concept of the story line that the game tells. To me it's really intriguing the way that the story played out throughout the game, but sometimes is slowed paced because of the game play. You may sometimes find yourself wandering around the house unsure of what to do. This really slows the pace of the game, also the hints that are displayed in the bottom left of the screen are somewhat annoying. They are either really obscure or really obvious. It's from one extreme to the other, not really well designed. The point and click on cupboards is nicely done, but there's no point of telling me and the using that if there's nothing to find in the cupboards where the game just explained that small mechanic... The grammar and wording of this game isn't 100% accurate for English speakers. A example of this is: That came from outside, I can't remember where is house key, I must found front key and close the door. Not really that much of a complaint but still something to work on. Some of the puzzles are nice, again nothing new or unique about them. Just the same as every other horror game, there are always going to be puzzles for you to complete to progress through the story of the game. Another thing is that the game is fairly short.\nScore (Out Of 10): 5 - Story isn't very well presented, kinda slow paced, hints are either too obscure or too obvious and the English isn't 100% accurate.\n\nGraphics/Art StyleThe graphics are simple and well polished for a pixelated game. I feel like some of the characters needed to be worked on some more, for example the blond lady that appears every now and then looks kinda weird with her arms. Would be nice if you could fix that a bit. I also feel like the animations are sometimes a bit lazy, making a simple animation of getting out of bed at the start of the game would've been good. But no you get teleported there, to me that's just kinda lazy the way that they did that. It makes it seem that this game was kind of rushed when it came to releasing the game fully. Another thing that bugs me is that the game sometimes doesn't shut me down properly, meaning that you have to force shutdown the game through Task Manager. This is yet more proof to me that this game seemed to be rushed when it came to the release time for the game.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Some characters don't look right, lazy animations at times and the game sometimes doesn't close properly meaning you have to close it through Task Manager every time.\n\nMusic & SoundsNot much to say about the music and sounds of the game, the music really sets the atmosphere of the game and doesn't get irritating or annoying as you play through the game. The sounds are just average, what you might expect from any pixelted horror game.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Decent music and some general sounds from the horror genre.\n\nConclusionI would recommend this game to people who like exploring in a horror game. It has alright pixel graphics, the music really sets the atmosphere of the game. It's not really scary but that's to be expected from a pixelated horror game. Sometimes feels tense but most of the time it just feels like a casual game.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 15","true","4.0"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumpsplays/recommended/412730/","lumpsplays","LumpsPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumpsplays/","45 products in account","After some much needed updates, Days Under Custody is a pretty good short horror adventure title. Initially, a lot of the mechanics were confusing and worked in wonky ways, but much of that has been addressed and fixed in updates.\n\nGraphics: The game is meant to look like a classic pixelated title, so the visuals are simple, yet effective if you are a fan of such a style. If you are picky about realistic graphics however, you will not be impressed. But that should go without saying.\n\nSound: The music, like the art style, is simple yet effective. The score isn't brilliant by any means, but it sets the tone acceptably and never gets irritating to listen to, even if playing for more than 20 or so minutes at a time.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles aren't going to be anything you haven't seen before if you are an experienced adventure game player, so don't expect much innovation in terms of puzzles. The puzzles that are there are mostly inventory or code based, with the final one being a little more tricky and of a different variety (I won't spoil it). The puzzles are not central to the plot, and mostly serve as filler gameplay between the main plot "events" that happen with the spooks in the house.\n\nStory/Plot: Frankly, I'm not entirely sure what exactly happened or why any of the details presented mattered, but for a game that lasts around about an hour, I wasn't expecting anything either deep or profound.\n\nValue: The game is only a few bucks which is not free, but there are much worse games available for 15 or more dollars here on Steam. From that perspective, the hour+ of gameplay you'll get from Days Under Custody is well worth the money, especially considering the entire game was produced by one guy (apart from the music apparently).\n\nOverall Score: 6.7/10, I really look forward to future titles from this developer!\n\nP.s. I am a new Let's Player who uses Pop-up commentary, if you'd like to check out my playthrough of this video game, look me up on youtube!","November 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

I am not an experienced player. However, I enjoyed playing this game a lot (even though I did not get all the achievements).\nThe story behind this game is very interesting. It is about a guy named Duc, who wakes up to find out that his wife and neighbors were killed by some psycho. Throughout the game you look for notes to make sense out of it all. Meanwhile there is a guy who dressed just like you and is trying to kill you.\nI would recommend to play this game in headphones. First of all, music will help to distinguish when it is time to hide. Second it creates an atmosphere of suspense. I actually really liked sound effects in this game.\nI saw a lot of complaints about the controls. I did not experience any inconvenience. There are control buttons to move (W, A, S, D) as in any game these days. E to open and pick up stuff. F to skip and move on. Nothing super complicated, considering that there is not a lot going on.\nOverall I would recommend playing it. Especially if you are into indie games.\n\nP.S. I am planning to play this game again someday and get all the achievements. I will try to post an update :D\n","January 25","true","5.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

But they still look neat.\n\nI don't like the inconsistent controls: you activate some items by walking up to them (with A & D) and pressing E, but some have to be clicked with the mouse. Speach/text windows are closed with F, but some windows/menus close with E or C. It wasn't that bad, actually, until I got to type in a code and it turned out to be navigated with arrows... and space. It's just so overcomplicated for such a simple game.\n\nThese are all minor inconveniances because they don't make you lose the game. What does make you fail, is the weird mechanic which spawns a killer upon finding some notes. The problem is, you can get the notes by CLICKING on an item so you don't have to be close to that place, just have it on screen is enough. If you happen to be on the other side of the room, with the killer separating you from the only hiding place around, you get killed. Sometimes it's not a big deal, but sometimes it makes you redo a lot of stuff, involving some backtracking. With that slow-♥♥♥ character who can't even run. I gave up after one of these situations.\n\n4/10: it's not appealping enough to keep playing. Quite generic, with broken English. Would be good if went through some beta testing.","March 30","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
