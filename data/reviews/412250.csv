"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pavepode/recommended/412250/","pavepode","PashaMonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pavepode/","1313 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEmpires of Creation is a 2D space shooter where you should be able to build a colony of your own, gain some resources and build yourself a humongous fleet.\n\nHere's how you play the game:\n1. Download the game.\n2. Finish the tutorial.\n3. Uninstall the game.\n\nSeriously, this game is stated being in Beta while nothing really works (at least in Windows 10). Since this is not really a game review but more of a bug report to the developers, let me start by numbering problems I found inside the game while "playing" (testing if anything really works) for an hour:\n\n1. Very incomprehensibly short tutorial that didn't really teach me anything useful about the gameplay.\n2. What is it with this font size 6, make it 10 so I don't have to use my magnifying glass while playing with my right foot and left hand.\n3. Control keys <> aren't working and you can't change them even if you wanted to.\n4. Pressing ESC while in dialogue will freeze the dialogue on screen and getting out of the game safely becomes impossible because the ESC will stop working.\n5. Closing mission tab causes ship to fire when in ship controlling mode.\n6. Game crashed while generating background stars for small singleplayer map.\n7. In Arena, I get constantly bumped by enemy fleet. Small little ships that are 1/4 of a size of my giant USS Enterprise are able to push my ship. Physics still apply even when in space!\n8. If for some reason you don't start with the tutorial it is impossible to find any habitable planet.\n9. Wasn't able to buy any ships from capital planet while had 6000 currency.\n\nJudgment\nIf you speed up the fights fast enough this becomes a Pinball simulator with spaceships. Waiting to see the updates.\nPLUSSES AND MINUSES:\n- nothing working inside the game\n- can't change controls\n- stated "Beta" not working properly with Windows 10\n+ nice concept\n\nGRAPHICS5GAMEPLAY2CONTROLS7SOUND EFFECTS5STORY1\nOVERALL RATE: 4","February 23","false","4.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","13","14","5","0"

There hasn't been any updates for 2 months either, just makes me think they've given up on it. However, there is potential and I look forward to when it comes, if it comes.","February 13","false","0.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Right click in space, a ship icon representing the fleet flies there, nothing to interact with. If you stumble upon a non-orange ship icon, the game loads into a fight like on the video, but you don't have any way to interact with anything.\n\nI wouldn't even call it a screen saver.","November 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","17","33","6","2"

So if all you want to do is fly about on a starry background fighting pirates, using a range of ships then this is a solid game for you. Although I imagine Empires of creation has the capabilities of becoming a well-rounded game in the future, however some changes are required. These could include game objectives, a helper guide for new players and the fixing of some bugs (bugs include game saving/ may be just my pc). Most importantly it would be good if there was a way to win/complete the game (if there is then I have no knowledge of it). I would definitely recommend this game, or at the very least keep an eye on upcoming updates","December 17, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone interested in ambient space genre games, but I would also have to advise you wait for a sale.\nI truly support the development of this game, and I hope that in the near future this game will come to fulfill its potential.","January 15","true","0.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I would really like to see more dragons in the ginger bread house mission as currently the few I have encountered put my skills to the test as far as this RPG goes. The only bad part about this game is the screen saver like feel I get (rarely!). The other players I've engaged the have shunned me however, no responses as of yet, but as in my social life I will patiently wait for acceptance. Mind you this is the beta and I'm sure more improvements are coming (more dragons, a more expansive hair style selection, and bigger ammunition magazine for potatoe guns), can't wait to see this game at the next MLG event.","January 13","true","0.2"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","4","16","4","0"
