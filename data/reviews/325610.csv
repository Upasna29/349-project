There are not only not enough units in each roster, but not enough localised faction rosters either. The Picts and Irish use generic Norse rosters (why give them content when we can sell them content) while whatever powers manage to survive until turn 60 in England or Western Europe are either using cookie cutter WRE or Germanic sets of units. I have spent 20 hours beating down dozens of stacks of the same 4 units as the AI never seems to research anything better than levies.\nThe AI constantly razes or abandons settlements and resettling is prohibitively expensive, leaving vast amounts of the map barren.\nThe fertility penalties are ludicrous. It's a cold snap, not the apocalypse. By 430, every single province will have a -4 fertility rating meaning that the highest possible fertility rating will be 1. According to CA, the entire Northern Hemisphere lost 80% of its yield in 35 years. Mesopotamia and the Levant should never become meagre land.\nImperium is not only still a thing but is horribly implemented, leading to the player faction having -80 diplomacy penalties just for having research, even if they only have one province with no armies.\nThe AI will not accept peace ever, even if you have a doomstack sieging their last city. Client states will also attack you even if there is no motive and they have no hope of winning.\nThe multiplayer is unbalanced to the level that it is effectively unplayable in any serious way. Tagmata OP, attacking testudo doesn't even work and shieldwall glitching dominates melee. Cookie cutter 6 melee cav, 4 inf, 2 crossbow, 2 archer builds dominate with any decent faction.\nCA will sell you the fixes to all this in $8 increments.","March 8, 2015","false","40.0"," 2,492 of 2,812 people (89%) found this review helpful 380 people found this review funny","89","492","2","380","72"

I have played since the pixellated Shogun first showed us what turnbased combined with real time strategy was all about. I have fought on medieval battlefields, napoleonic battlefields and many others.\nI dont think i have any more playtime on a single gaming series and now to the bad part.\n\nEver since Napoleon the DLC trend has angered me, i appreciate other series do it aswell but bare with me. I got more content with Darth mod on napoleon then with the DLC packs/game itself. Why would i pay £30 for a brand new game and then two weeks later a DLC comes out? At least be more subtle CA, anyone with half a brain cell can see that the content was ready/very nearly ready when the whole game was released, so know I am expected to shell out another £6 for a few more (very similar) factions that the AI have already been playing as? Basically proving the content was in the game when it was released.\n\nSo im prepared to pay a little bit more as i know CA are a small PC only company.............Oh wait they just made Alien Isolation which was also on consoles, got great reviews and most importantly sold really well. So i am now not prepared to pay any more money until CA start to treat us with respect. Furthermore i logon to steam today and low and behold £1.99 for the "blood and burning" pack. So now i am expected to shell out more of my very hard earned cash to have blood in the game and enhanced fire effects? Could they not be added in a free update like pretty much any other decent PC gaming series? I just recieved alot more content for Men Of War Assault Squad 2 which is made by a very small developer all for free, just to be loyal to the players that bought that game.\n\nSeriously CA I appreciate the cost of game making is astronomical these days and I genuinely am a lot more forgiving then most 15 year olds trolls on the forums/steam but c'mon now you are just taking us all for a ride.\n\nKnowone at CA will probably read this but if you do realise that im not a troll, im a very loyal Total war fan and all im doing is echoing the sentiments of the entire Total War community.

Take these points as a general critique of the series direction in general, while still being a review of the game.\nSo, Attila Total War; the title says it all really. It's the year 395AD, and the Roman Empire, now divided between Eastern and Western rule, is on the very edge of collapsing after centuries of corruption and economic turmoil. As a result of this, many Germanic and Nomadic barbarian tribes have decided to take a stab at the world superpower, due to its apparent and alarming signs of weakning it's grip on the known world.\nYou can either choose to try and save Rome from its fate by taking command of either the Eastern or Western Roman Empires, or become the arbiter of its downfall by taking control of the numerous Barbarian tribes and Eastern Kingdoms that wish to see Rome gone.\nBut is it good?\nWell, Yes and No.\nPositives are that:\n-Despite the disastrous attempt in Rome 2, The politics game mechanic now has actual weight and impact upon your game. It's no longer simply making sure your party is on top, now you have to make sure that faction members remain loyal, Governors are assigned to provinces that need them, and that your general dominion over your faction is kept in a careful balance. Failure to complete these tasks can lead to civil unrest, disloyalty from generals and governors, and even a separatist movement erupting to cause a civil war.\n-The sanitation systems that have been updated from Rome 2 now make actual sense, and aren't nearly useless. Now there's a real need for proper sanitation within one's settlement; lack of such sanitation can cause local disease outbreaks, which can spread across your entire empire if you're not careful.\n-After their measly display in Rome 2, both cavalry units and ranged units in Attila have regained some of their former tactical worth. Cavalry are now faster and seem to have a greater impact when charging, and ranged units now do much more damage and have increased accuracy, so both of these unit types are now worth the investment again.\nBut of course, to every ying, there is a yang. For the good points, there are also bad:\n-The sacking and razing options that can be chosen when a settlement is conquered are used way too much by the AI factions, even the civilised ones. I can understand nomadic factions burning a settlement to the ground, but it begins to become unreal when the Persians don't take territory from you; they simply burn your towns and cities. This means, that you will frequently find that you are the only faction in the game actually expanding your borders; everyone else is too busy burning things.\n-Although a new and interesting mechanic that has given some historical accuracy to the game, the city Razing mechanic (Destroying an entire city and it's buildings and leaving the region neutral) is a massive pain in the backside. Yes, it might be accurate when a Hunnic horde burns the city of Salona to the ground, but reclaiming that land takes a massive amount of money, population and time to rebuild, and it just becomes a massive waste of time.\nThese next two are more of a gripe against Both Rome 2 and Attila, but bear with me here (They're essentially the same game anyway)\n-In Rome 2, the system of building armies changed quite drastically from previous games in the series. Now, Armies themselves now act as independent characters with traits to improve their effectiveness and morale in the field of battle, rather than simply being a collection of units. Trouble is, they always require a general to manage them; no general - no army. This means that the use of tactical raid parties made up of half an army stack and skirmish groups made of even less are a thing of the past, and you can't leave armies under the command of a captain any more. No longer can you whittle down large armies with the use of clever hit and run tactics. Gone are the days where you fought skirmish after skirmish to get to the larger armies and cities of your enemy. Now, every battle you fight is either a pivotal battle that you must fight or lose  because the auto resolve is about as thick as an asphalt milkshake, (I mean, Legionaries losing to levy spearmen, really?) Or it's a pushover city fight that isn't worth your time or skill.\nThis means that wars against other factions become a huge chore, and all of the pacing is slowly squeezed out of the game. What does this mean? It means that the game becomes really, REALLY, boring after about half an hour. Unfortunately, Attila suffers this very same problem.\n-Also in Rome 2 and Attila, the factions have become more balanced and even, for reasons that are unknown to me; perhaps to facilitate more rounded and player-preference faction choice on the multiplayer section. Now there's two things wrong with this. Firstly, It isn't historically accurate, as with the previously mentioned Legionary-Levy debacle, and it means that even if you win a pitched battle against another enemy army, you'll end up taking so many casualties that the victory really isn't worth it in the long run. Not only does this mean that victory now depends more on numbers, as opposed to the actual skill you needed in previous games of the series, but wars become nothing more than large scale meat-grinders with the winner being whoever can field the largest army. This pile-drives the pace out of the game, as you're always having to wait for more men to back up your depleted units, even after small garrison battles.\nOnce again, it makes the game slow and really boring.\nSo, Attila Total War, is it good or is it not?\nIn my eyes, this is what Rome 2 should have been on launch, not the disaster that it was.\nHowever, being someone who's played almost every Total War to date, this game, and Rome 2, are massive disappointments because they just aren't fun anymore. Wars and combat are now too balanced  to be fun, as with the afformentioned meat-grinders, and the game feels more like a chore now than an actual fun experience, which you know, is what a Video Game shouls be.\nI'm not sure why the Creative Assembly have made these changes, but they just don't fit the series and it's mentality. They remove the one thing that makes Total War so unique; the one thing that gave it it's legendary position as one of the most accurate strategy game francises out there; Realism. I know there's an allure to arcade-style combat, but that goes in shooter games and basic strategy games like Halo Wars and Half Life; not a game of this calibre and the reputation the series has.\nSo, if you simply want an expansion of Rome 2, go right ahead, buy it, because that's all it really is.\nIf not, I STRONGLY recommend holding back your wallet, and buying the Rome Total War 1 collection instead; it's more realistic and enjoyable as a result. To me, It's a much better investment. Attila, and by extension Rome 2, are good in their own right, but they just aren't good enough to be called Total Wars, if that name still means anything anymore.","July 30, 2015","false","248.3"," 1,825 of 2,097 people (87%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","87","825","2","63","130"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendofTotalWar/recommended/325610/","LegendofTotalWar","LegendofTotalWar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendofTotalWar/","128 products in account","This game get's a thumbs down from me. However, this is not a bad game. I'll try go into detail as to why I HATE this title.\n\nThis game represents everything I hate about the direction the Total War franchise is going. Streamlining things and taking away out strategic and tactical options is something I protest heavily against. Medieval 2 remains the best Total War in my opinion. This is one of the worst.\n\nCons:\n- The building system: Limiting each region to only build between 3-5 buildings is rubbish. In the past we could build dozens of buildings. Cities used to have population and now they don't. It's just population surplus which is a vastly inferior system. No longer to people cause squalor, but it's buildings that cause problems. It makes no sense. They got it right in the past and have turned away from it. Revert back to the old system! Libraries consuming food? Last time I checked books don't need to eat. They don't really need anything except not to be put on fire or dropped in the sewer. Which in this game will probably happen multiple times.\n\n- Politics: Uninteresting waste of time. The political offices seem neither here nor there and provide nothing interesting in regard to bonuses. You can leave all of the titles blank the entire game and be no worse off for it.\n\n- The AI "cheats" worse than anything we've ever seen before. They do not play by the same rules the player is forced to abide by which is insanely frustrating. There is no point even trying to affect the AI's income with agents because the AI doesn't appear to pay for anything. It's all just handed to them on a silver plate. Don't bother trying to inflict winter attrition on them because eastern factions can run all day in the snow and take no attrition whereas the player can't even take the road through snow to avoid losing half their army. When winter comes you fortify and don't move. The AI will continue to dance around.\n\n- The AI is dumber than ever. They appear to be designed to annoy you more than anything else, which they very much succeed in doing that. None of the AI factions have any interest in self preservation or establishing an empire (with the exception of perhaps the Sassanids. They have no strategic thought in their head. They will sack regions that are already ruined and then wander around aimlessly looking for something else to raid. They will raid desolate and even their own territory (raid by the way does not decrease the wealth of a region so you can do it too). They will send an army half way across the map and attack one of your least defended settlements and sack it. Of course in doing so you'll probably destroy half their army, so the rest of them will wonder around aimlessly until you can be bothered to send one of your armies to finish it off. I don't really expect the Battle AI to be as smart as a human, so I'm not unhappy with that. Only the Campaign AI is really dumb.\n\n- Corruption. It is determined mostly by how many regions you have and there is little you can do to reduce it. Only once you've researched all civic tech will Corruption be not a huge problem any more. Corruption also reduces the tax rate as well, so don't think you can just jump from medium tax rate to high like in Rome 2. I think the top limit of corruption is 95%.\n\n- Imperium and the limitation of armies. In previous titles before Rome 2, the amount of armies you wanted or could field was determined by how much you could afford. NO MORE. Now, it doesn't matter if you're really rich. If you're on a low tier of imperium then you're only allowed 2 armies. Even if you're at the maximum Imperium your maximum amount is 14. In the past we could have as many as we wanted and I think that should come back. I also really hate that you can't just tell your full stack to split into 2 groups to hunt down lots of smaller armies raiding you area. NO, the army must stay together - just because.\n\n- The victory conditions are tedious. There is no short campaign in Total War Attila. All of the victory conditions require that you "survive" until a certain date and have arbitrary conditions like build an imperial library. What I don't want or need one? No too bad, you need to get one. OH, and if you're the Romans and you research certain techs before actually building an imperial library, then you can never achieve divine victory conditions. The game forces you to tiptoe around every little pointless decision because one wrong move and NO VICTORY FOR YOU. Even if you own the whole map...\n\n- The techs. Whilst adding technology and philosophy has been a welcome addition to Total War since Empire, in Total War Attila this has been implemented badly. There are now techs that are so bad they could cripple you if you research them too early. BE VERY CAREFUL when researching techs that "upgrade" certain units. Those upgraded units might cost 3x as much in upkeep and be hardly any better. You won't be able to recruit the old units after the tech is done. As I mentioned above with the Romans, be careful when researching the religious civic techs as they will disable some of your most useful buildings.\n\n- ATTILA. King of the Huns. The invincible idiot. This will frustrate you to no end. Depending on the difficulty you have chosen Attila will show up with many stacks of his best units. Every time you kill a stack, it revives in full. So basically - don't kill the whole stack. They won't stop coming until Attila is dead. So how do you kill Attila? Well, you just have to beat him and wound him many, many times (at least on Legendary difficulty). However, do not kill his whole stack. If you wound him in battle he will won't even go away to heal. Just keep wounding him and eventually he will die. The Huns pay no upkeep on their armies (AI only) which is good for them because they're terrible at making money. Raiding desolate areas and establishing no tributary states lead me to believe they would have otherwise gone broke.\n\n- Christianity. Christianity in this was super handicapped. If you are a Roman faction you should make it your urgent mission to return to paganism. Christianity is the worst religion in this game, Arian, Latin, and Greek. All bad. The buildings are unbelievable expensive to maintain and provide hardly anything useful. I think it's good that they put the 5 Pentarchy Sees in the game, but you'll never make use of them. Building a Pentarchy See will cost you thousands in upkeep per turn. Also you'll get a -10 morale penalty against Huns.\n\n- Graphics. Annoying that they make graphics so high end that you have to wait until the next gen equipment comes out. I don't play Total War because of the graphics anyway. I couldn't care less. I'd rather not play at 10fps so most of my settings are on low.\n\nPros:\n- Fire. Buildings burning is good. They had this in Rome 1 though, so don't expect a huge round of applause from me. I don't think that burning the town should reduce melee attack or defence because that makes no sense. Only morale. I've had units reduced to 0 attack because of devastation.\n- Big campaign map. There are more settlements in this than any other Total War.\n- Lots of factions.\n- Battles can be pretty good.\n- 4 turns per year so your characters live a good long while\n- Family tree - meh\n- Historical battles were pretty good\n\nOverall I think this is a ok game and I do recommend you give it a go if you're a veteran of Total War. Do not buy if you've never played Total War before. Start with Rome Total War - the first one - the one with 95% positive reviews. There is a reason for that.\n\nHowever, I hugely protest the direction Total War has been heading in this title. I support CA in making experiments with their games, which is what I am writing off Attila to. I gave this a thumbs down because this is currently my least favourite total War title to date. It just is not much fun.","May 29, 2015","false","408.7"," 737 of 825 people (89%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","89","737","825","47","26"

If you want detailed information about the actual game, you should probably go read other reviews because I will be very straight forward on this.\n\n\n"Should Attila be my first Total War game?"\nMy simple and clear answer would be no. Attila is a playable (I have not had any crashes of any sort, so I will not go into the account of being unable to play determining if you should buy the game or not) game, but it would not be the best Total War title IN MY OPINION. My list would be tied in Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 being first, Rome 1 second, and Attila third.\n\n\n"I have the two Total war titles you have listed (Or all Total war titles exept Attila), and I want to play another"\nThe answer depends on how much you want the experience and how much you like money. I would give Attilas price at around 30 dollars, but the game is still able to enjoy. So I would actually lean towards yes.\n\n\n"I love the Roman era, should I buy it?"\nIn my opinion, I felt that Rome had different stages of its lifetime (Not including Byzantine). If you want a game in the fall of Rome's empire/ a "challenge" in playing Rome, than go ahead. If you want the stage of Rome's actual glory, go to Rome 1 or 2.\n\n\n"I love the Byzantine era, should I buy it?"\nThough not exactly the Byzantine era, this is the closest you are currently going to get. But I'd still say no because CA has a full chance of making a Total War title on the subject\n\n\n"I love the an era about Attila or Ghengis Khan"\nNow I'm not saying that this game is about Ghengis Khan, because it's not at all, but the units for the Huns is the closest you are going to get to Mongols currently. So the answer would be yes.\n\n\n"I don't want a buggy game. I want a fun, solid, stable, and NEW stategy game."\nAnswer would be to buy Shogun 2 (Graphics are basically the same unless you are picky) because it is the best Total war game of those standards. Now to just go into the catagory of strategy games, I'd lean away from total war titles, and that's up to you to decide after that.\n\n\n"I want Attila but I am also excited for Total War: Warhammer."\nThe answer would be to wait and see reviews for Warhammer. Compare them and than it's up to the other answers. I for one am excited for Warhammer (Which I can't say I'm proud of).\n\n\n"Graphics are my priority and I have all past Total War titles."\nGo ahead but if I were you, I'd save the money. The graphics are barely different from the past two Total War titles itself.\n\n\n"I want to play with the new units and against variety of different units, should I buy it?"\nThe unit rosters for everysingle barbarian/north of Rome are SO  ♥♥♥♥ING  SIMULAR. You will be playing against countless of the same unit, because the AI is loyal to it's rank-one levy and has no thought of disbanding them for better, keep-you-the-♥♥♥♥-alive units. It won't be untill you play as a whole different civilization to fight a different unit.\n\n\n"I am interested in the game overall, but I have heard about strict bugs, should I buy it?"\nMOST of the bugs about the game have been true. But you yourself must answer if those individual bugs are something you can live with or not.\n\n\n"I want a challenge in the AI, would this be the Total War game for that?"\nUhm, no. Stay away from this game. AI is not a challenge at all, in my opinion.\n\n\n"The DLC's have a faction I want to play as, is Attila worth buying just for the DLC?"\nWell, if you want to play as the Viking or Longbeards factions, I'd say buy the game, BUT don't buy either of those two DLCs. The three Viking rosters are basically the same for the Saxon/s/Frank's rosters. The Longbeard's rosters are the same of the migrators, the only difference being that they're not migrators. Celts are a different situation. They are a decent DLC, so buy the game and Celt DLC if that's the situation.\n\n\n"I'm a old/huge fan of Total War, but after Rome 2, I don't know if I can support CA anymore. Does this game live to potential of being a Total War game?"\nThis is a question that I should have asked myself. At first, I enjoyed Attila. It was fun at the time but after CA's following decision (Day 1 DLC, More DLC, DLC for blood, DLC for vomit, DLC for being able to DLC, DLC THE FUC-), I was done with CA, for now. No, do not buy the game, for CA has another title coming and will soon, if not already, ditch the development of the game. This game does not have a promising future.\n\n\n"What is your full out, actual grand answer of 'should buy this game or not?' ?"\nIf I could take back my purchase of this game, I would. That's not an easy and clear answer but there are two reasons for that answer; the fact that TW: Warhammer is coming and that the game is not impressive at all. I'll say it, I'm looking forward to Warhammer after Rome 2 and Attila, but I've looked at interviews and photos, and it looks promising. The main interview that made me excited for it was AngryJoe's review with one of the developers. The video shows how much the developer is excited for the making of the game. That's something the past Total Wargames did not have: A devoted crew of the making of the game.\n\nI really hope this helps you, and if you have anymore questions of the game or you think there should be more question catagories on here, please tell me.\n\nIf anyone disagrees with this review, also please tell me, for it can help others on the decision of buying the game or not.","April 16, 2015","false","159.6"," 2,630 of 3,055 people (86%) found this review helpful 638 people found this review funny","86","630","3","638","66"

Join in a few wars with them and you may win their favor…\n--Incredible graphics on high end machines\n\n\n\n\nProblems; The old, the new, and the frustrating:\n[EDIT: some of these can be fixed with mods]\n\n-Military alliances are great for maintaining a good relationship with factions you are trading with, but worthless when someone actually declares war on YOU. If you call your allies in to join you in war, 90% will say “No. ♥♥♥♥ you”, and your alliances are all severed. This means you will have to either reload, or spend 10-20000 gold trying to reestablish military alliances you had previously had with them in order to keep them from breaking trade agreements, and eventually coming after you. This means that whenever someone declares war on you, you are alone, regardless.\n-Satrapy states are free to rebel against you the second someone else declares war on you. This means subjugating a faction (when taking their last settlement) is all but pointless if they can rebel the next turn when some ♥♥♥♥-ant faction comes after you.\n-Diplomacy only happens through grotesque amounts of gold and/or with the maxim “Let me join in this war alongside the faction I want to like me, and yes he likes me more eventually, then make a trade agreement, then make an alliance. ” While it can be fun, it gets old fast as it becomes clear that this is the only way to make allies.\n-Food surplus means nothing, other than that food is getting to your armies and minor “growth” modifiers around your empire.\n-Food is province based now, and by turn 100 all hell breaks loose with food shortage modifiers hardcoded to the game (apparently their take on history…). This means you really have to build a wheat farm and a cattle farm in all your minor settlements, and both Fish ports and food emporiums in your major cities to counteract the worldwide “shortage” of food. Even as Rome, soon you have a 2000 surplus of food even in winter, but sure as heck certain regions without such buildings are not getting any of it. This leaves very few spots for trade based/economy based buildings in all settlements, which is a shame because it leaves little room for open ended city building.\n-Sanitation is cool, but it can get out of hand:  destroying entire armies if stationed in the affected city. This means another spot of your city is used up with the aqueduct.\n-Another location in your major cities will be used up by building coliseums and theaters trying to keep the people from rebelling, when playing as Rome.\n-Immigration becomes a problem, and eventually goes to about a -9 modifier for all regions. Some have said upping the tax rate gets the immigrants to leave, but I haven’t seen that work.\n-When playing as Western Rome, all the hardcoded events/modifiers that decrease public order (at worst, -20 for food, -9 for immigrants, and so on) means that little can be done but build food based buildings and   hope your religion can pull you through. That wouldn’t be bad, if it were possible to convert to Paganism easily (and let your theaters and coliseums do the work). This means the game pushes you to try and be Christian.\n-War is sometimes declared in very odd ways. 3 factions in the British Isles and Ireland were my trade partners, as Rome, and I was on good terms with them. One minor settlement faction suddenly declared war on me while it was being sieged by the other two. Immediately after that, the siegers (two other factions I was trading with) themselves declared war on me as well. And yet they continued to siege the original minor faction to declare war on me, and destroyed it. All this despite the fact that I was trading with all three of them. Very, very odd.\n-Second tier units now take 2 turns to muster (which can be crippling, if an enemy is bearing down on you), and said units are barely better than the 1st tier and so on.\n-All units are outdone by the overwhelming power of artillery. The Artillery is now so accurate it can hit cavalry units at full gallop as they bear down on said artillery unit (to try and kill it off). Often they never make it!\n-A player may not want to bother researching any military improvements when considering how expensive the units are (and time needed to muster them), and so may only research economy techs to try and make some money. Early game economies are so fragile you are counting down to the last 10 gold pieces sometimes. A total war game perhaps should not be that unforgiving towards being warlike…..\n-Christian buildings are immensely expensive, so you won’t be able to afford them (and their public ordering abilities) for a long time, but Rome is Christian, and spreading your religion is paramount, but no, you can’t do it…\n-Faction politics, and gaining office for loyal subjects seems interesting at first but eventually becomes frustrating; every event usually means you either lose influence or control, and your power slowly ebbs away. Not that it matters that much…\n-Generals eventually rebel against you if they live long enough, and so upgrading them as they gain experience loses its charm since you are constantly thinking “When will I need to kill him?” Getting promotions for them does not seem to work either, in the long run. Creative assembly really needs to play some crusader kings, and learn how to balance their political in-game systems so that players have options, rather than feeling like they are simply a sad witness to history through a lackluster historical simulation of Roman politics (where the general always makes a move for power).","December 12, 2015","true","118.3"," 1,040 of 1,205 people (86%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","86","040","1","47","33"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/325610/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","I grew up with the Total War games. I remember as a kid playing Shogun 1 and loving every second of it. Then years later, I discovered Medieval 2. It was the best Total War game I had ever played, heightened because of my interest in the Crusades during history, the power of the Papal States and the Pope, and the whole ideology behind Chivalry. The faction selection was SO incredibly diverse. The Aztecs played nothing at all like The Holy Roman Empire with no similar unit whatsoever, for example. Further I used to always play The Papal States online with Religious Fanatics with a Great Cross to back them up. It made them unshakable, retreat only in death. That type of stuff was so cool, because each faction had unique gameplay experiences.\n\nTotal War has fallen quite a bit since then. Their quality of games are still stellar mechanically, and barring optimization and bug issues each release undeniably faces, they all are fairly fun in terms of gameplay. However, to see the series this milked is sad and frustrating. I want to purchase a Total War game and get right into it from "unboxing" it. I don't want to wait 2 years later, for all the DLC to be out and on sale, to get the complete experience. I don't want to wait months from now to get that diverse, unique faction through a paywall that would have been already included in previous titles(like Medieval 2 as mentioned).\n\nI always told my buddies, when Medieval 3: Total War comes out, it's going to be an instant buy for me. Now I'd rather save my money. Just wait until it's on sale, including all the bits and pieces of the experience.\n\nRome 2: Total War had/has $85.90 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\nShogun 2: Total War has/had $38.52 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\nFall of the Samurai has/had $11.96 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\nNapoleon Total War has/had $18.96 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\nEmpire: Total War has/had $21.95 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\nTotal War: Atilla ALREADY has $41.95 worth of DLC, not including the game itself.\n\nOver $200 worth of DLC, again, not including the game(s) themselves.\n\nEDIT: Changed the prices. Atilla just got more DLC. \o/\n\nEDIT 2: After playing it with all the DLC(I got it on sale to get the "complete experience" as mentioned before), I have to say all the new factions and additions are welcome and awesome. So many diverse and different factions here, as opposed to say Rome II: Emperor Edition where it was essentially "do you want to play Rome or some one-off tribal faction?"\n\nPeople will likely cite numerous problems in this game, and I've read people having issues with mechanics such as squalor, sanitation, etc. But this type of stuff has to be taken in stride with the pros. Rome II had a serious issue with Agents for example wiping out entire armies. The big problem that needs to be mentioned, in my opinion, however, is that CA completely broke Auto-Resolve in this game. They've added some arbitrary RNG element to it, where they explain it as "Your General estimating your odds of success/failure", which wouldn't be so bad if they kept the percentages being shown for the 3 different stances you can take during an auto-resolve.\n\nIn Rome II there was Protective, Balanced, and Aggressive stances that could affect your chances based on unit make up. However, in this iteration, it doesn't show you what it can do for you whatsoever on top of the mentioned RNG General "estimation" chance. I've lost countless battles I didn't wish to play in because of this. Fights that were seemingly in my favor turn into hard fought ♥♥♥♥ing losses for me. Personally I don't wish to fight EVERY single encounter in a Total War game, and this absolutely destroys the experience for me. Having to fight 30+ minute battles each time I wish to take a poorly defended town/settlement is just artificially lengthening the game, making it a chore.","March 25, 2015","false","9.2"," 1,448 of 1,734 people (84%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","84","448","1","61","42"

However, that's exactly what I'm going to do.\n\nYou see, TW gamers really want these games to be good. They NEED them to be good and for a while will suspend disbelief to believe they are good.\n\nBut is TW Attila actually a good game?  Well, it's better than Rome 2 and has the features that should have been included in that release like family trees, progression for your general and a political system. The atrocious UI has also been replaced with more realistic models and the overall atmosphere is much better than the overly colorful Rome 2.\n\nSo what's wrong with it?\n\nWell first of all the game just isn't very well balanced and players will typically experience campaigns that are either mind numbingly easy or unfairly difficult. The AI will spawn endless stacks even when losing territory while the player is saddled with an untenable corruption mechanic. In Shogun 2 the AI cheating was annoying but tolerable as there were lots of bottlenecks on the map to strategically place your armies and the overall economy felt fair. In this game you can look forward to playing whack a mole while struggling to maintain your own armies. Now some may disagree and say this is appropriate to the period but the bottom line is it becomes a chore.\n\nAnother constant irritant is the neverending rebellions because of high corruption and unhappiness. While rebellions were very common in this period they occur so often as to be a hinderance to decent gameplay. When playing as the ERE a HUGE amount of your time will be spent fighting identical city battles due to this mechanic. The buildings don't seem to do a good job mitigating this and the agents are expensive and in short supply.\n\nAgain, Shogun 2 handled this better by having rebellions be conducted primarily by renegade generals rather than regions. Provinces would only revolt if the castle was destroyed or there wasn't a sufficient garrison. You could always suppress dissent through agents and armies but in Attila it seems like the rebellions occur almost randomly. I want to fight the enemies of ROME not an endless parade of my own generals in very similar settings.\n\nThe sieges and AI are much improved from Rome 2 but most of your encounters will be on smaller city maps. Essentially every battle you fight will be in a small city and they all more or less look the same. There is a fort in the middle that doesn't have a gate and pathways to it from the city streets that you can sometimes barricade. Eventually there will be a scrum at the entrances or fort and now we rinse and repeat.\n\nCA could have made these battles more interesting by featuring upgradable city walls and fortifications which of course would have been characteristic and appropriate to the period. Instead we have repetitive, arcade style maps that are clearly designed to compensate for the lack of a dynamic siege AI. The battles are too quick overall and the goofy unit icons are not a welcome addition IMO either.\n\nMagic fleets were a disaster in Rome 2 and they still are here. You can count on seeing AI stacks stuck in the middle of Mare Nostrum that will defeat your regular navies but oftentime sit and do nothing.  Since armies can embark and attack in one turn you will also pull your hair out when settlements are sacked in massive amphibious assaults that can't be defended or reasonably predicted.\n\nThis game also has bugs and seems to be poorly optimized for modding which is a big issue for a title with so many balancing issues. In my last game I was being forced to sack a city for the second time because I couldn't move an army the following turn out of the city radius without doing so. Apparently this was an issue that was fixed but not if you are using certain mods so I guess vanilla is the only option for a bug free experience. Certainly not ideal if you're playing TW game.\n\nAnyway, save your money and buy Shogun 2 or get this game when it's $15. The new features in this game should have just been patched to Rome 2.\n\nIt's a very similar type of release to NTW which CA put out to redeem itself after Empire TW's disastrous launch.\n\nOh and one more thing, you still can't build roads. Since the Rome 2 debacle started I've found that very amusing since it was one of things Rome was most famous for.","September 16, 2015","false","239.7"," 331 of 395 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","331","395","15","5"

The Creative Assembly added just enough to make me want it, just enough to make me forget it's numerous limitations.\n\nLittle things drive me nuts in this game. The artificial space limitations. I can't build a smithy because I need that spot for a well. A well I could just dig next to my new smithy. A pity.\n\nI can only field two armies. Four. Or six. Whatever. I can't arbitrarily promote a man, have half the army stand ten feet away and call it two armies. Apparently Generals are an endangered species. This isn't a problem early on, but eventually you find yourself with thousands of people in dozens of provinces completely unprotected because some invisible metric said you can't promote another general, and soldiers can't march around without one. Yes, I understand there are garrisons, but lets be honest how often have you lost an invasion to a garrison if you planned at all beforehand?\n\nI also became a great power and people hated me. Hated. Even allies of decades. Alliances, marriages, unbroken treaties, trade agreements and friendly borders ruined by arbitrairily becoming a great power. With one province. Yep, Those dastardly Danes and their little island. An ever-increasing diplomatic penalty means you eventually have to fight everyone. Always.\n\nOh, and never let a general become disloyal and rebel. It starts a cascade of rebellions and civil war that can rip your empire in half. Even from as early as a few turns into the game. You have to use influence to give someone a gift. Or tell them, "hey, man, nice job being a general, I value your service." Nope, instant murder-time. "Et tu, Brute?"\n\nHaving such limited technology, so few units and very little difference between them, the endless stream of tribes flowing randomly around the map, burning provinces to the point that half of Europe is empty, and more than a few crash-to-desktop bugs have crushed my enjoyment of this franchise.\n\nI miss being able to build walls around a settlement. To build a larger number of buildings allowing better variety of troops, and specilization. I'd love some streamlining of family dynamics (unweildy family tree and finding characters), and clearer understanding of who's a subordinate of whom before giving promotions that crush people's morale.\n\nI still wish for any sort of depth to diplomacy.\n\nThe strategic map, my favorite area (while a huge number of people live for tactic battles, and who can blame them it's the strong-point of the game) is an unmitigated bore. Watch armies wander randomly back and forth for decades, marching ceaselessly to and fro along the same road until their capital is destroyed and they vanish. See hugely developed nations randomly uproot, burn down their homeland and wander until they are destroyed leaving huge swaths of uncontested territory. Often you'll find massive fertile but empty lands. One example being all of what would one day be France and Germany sitting completely desolate in a particular campaign.\n\nEven with no pressure from marauders or lack of resources, these states just up and move, leaving their ancestral dead in the ground, their homes and farms behind and walk around until extinction.\n\nI do, however, love the polish in some areas. I can even see what a lot of the goals for the game were, but everything feels done half way (excepting tactical battles, which were exceptionally done.)\n\nI don't want to dump on the game. I paid money for it because I loved its predecessors, and I enjoyed this game, but it feels hollow. It distinctly feels like my last one. Not for glaring reasons, but because it's become a stale cracker, left sitting overnight, that used to be salty and crisp, and has only a damp, limp bland texture left after it's time has passed.\n\nI loved Total War. I did. I'll think of it fondly and tell my friends about Shogun and Medieval and the weeks I poured into them. I will not, however, have grand tales from this franchise in the future.\n\nI await it's successor, something upstart and brave to come along and renew the Grand Strategy genre.\n\nGood Bye, Total War.","February 24, 2015","false","17.5"," 838 of 1,064 people (79%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","79","838","1","58","40"

I notice a good portion of the bad reviews are focusing on marketing schemes and first-month DLC shenanigans, so I'll stay clear of that.\n\nThe Good:\n\nCA listened to the community. It's the little things that add to the improvement from Rome II: you can "draw" lines to path the units; the unit cards make battles easier to command; and the Family Tree adds a political aspect (though linear) that wasn't seen in Rome II. It's not simply a game of "who do I conquer next?" No longer are you the lawnmower of Europe.\n\nTo illustrate, in my game as the Franks, I found myself strategically forging alliances and razing settlements along my borders of little interest. I sacked for needed cash and to impede the enemy. That said, I also don't think this is a "strategic survival game," as it's currently being marketed.  Once you reach mid-game and you have a decent sized empire, survival is no longer on the table. The game tends to revert back to firing up the lawnmower as you push East, West, or South. North if you're really crazy.\n\nAll in all, gameplay mechanics are a step forward.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIn one word: performance. While it's the small things that make the game good, it's the big things that hold the game back. Attilla is poorly optimized.  My rig is well above the recommended specs. Yes, I've read the articles indicating that the game is "designed for the next series of GPUs." I personally believe this is a cop out. A game like this should be designed for current high-end systems on the highest settings. If you're designing a game for systems that people won't have until two, three or five years down the road, you need to understand that that few will likely have interest in this title two, three of five years down the road. We'll probably have two more Total War titles by then. Will these also be designed for the next generation of GPUs? Make today's games for today's systems, tiered to appropriate levels of specs.\n\nI may be the lone wolf believer on this, but I honestly think Rome II *looks* better than this game. The fact that the former runs better than the latter on my rig is disconcerting.  While we've taken a step forward in gameplay mechanics, we've taken two leaps backward in performance and graphics. The "playability" of the game is utterly diminished by the lack of smoothness in the battles and campaign map.\n\nIn another word: Rhogun. Imagine a world where Rome II's battle mechanics did the no-pants-dance with Shogun 2's campaign interface. That lovechild would be Attila. It's almost as if CA wrote on the whiteboard everything that was praised in Shogun 2 and lamented in Rome II. Net the positives and the negatives, this gives you Attila. So why is this a "bad" thing, you ask? Because there's very little new stuff here. Factor in Barbarian Invasion, there is essentially no new stuff here. Not that you're expecting a Total War game to redfine a genre - it does what it's supposed to do - but for a desinger that has the name "Creative" in its title, there is an utter dearth of that present in this product. Shogun II was able to expand on the fundamentals of the Total War franchise. We should keep the ball moving, not just dribbling between our legs.\n\nThe Hungly:\n\nAttila is a step forward in gameplay mechanics, a slide to the right in creativity, and a leap backward in performance. I'd define this as a thinking man's Rome II. I don't love it, but I can't hate it. I wish there was a button between "Yes" and "No" on the "Do you recommend this game" option. Maybe a picture of a hand just doing the so-so wave.","March 9, 2015","false","465.5"," 462 of 572 people (81%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","81","462","572","41","3"

I am in no way attacking you should you love the game, I just want to let others know the good AND the bad of this game before they purchase it. And if they like some of the things that I have listed in the bad? Then it's all good, at least they are informed.\n\ntl;dr - Great launch, graphically pleasing, better AI response from units. Badly designed Horde mode, Limited choice of factions that all boil down to three types that generally look the same, jacked diplomacy system, all the illegitimate children of the world come from one of your general's loins, campaign AI are all led by the Joker. They just want to watch the world burn.\n\nEDIT: So I've finally found a way to make Attila enjoyable, download and play with Terminus mods and Radious mods from the workshop. Please note that you can only use one of the unit mods, whether it be Radious or Terminus Unit mod. Terminus completely changes how the map is setup as well as changes personalities around and what have you (you can play as Arthur in the Brittanic Kingdom!). The Tuetons are a fabulous addition and are well worth their initial challenge. Best of luck to all of you and anyone is interested in coop with those mods let me know, I'm always up for more now!\n\nLet's start with the Good:\n\n1. The game engine has had vast improvements over Rome II which has allowed for better loading times and some nice visual flare.\n\n2. Attila's launch went extraordinarily smooth, though I never had any issues with Rome II there were hundreds if not thousands of videos and posts that showed how dissjointed and terrible it was. Attila's was the exact opposite with only minor bugs/ctd's in some cases.\n\n3. The AI response time in Attila is a Godsend in comparison to the previous TW iterations, cavalry actually act like shock troops rather than a suicidal waste of recourses. Units get in/out of combat as quickly as possible which is a huge plus in my book.\n\n4. Family Trees are back so you no longer have to deal with constant...annoyin....dissjointed politics, at least not as much as in Rome II. Hell you can even have children again, though there is a downside to that that I'll list in a bit.\n\n5.  Multiplayer syncronization is handled a lot better, there is even a new re-sync option if the multiplayer game fails to load both players during your game.\n\nAnd now for the Bad:\n\n1. The new Horde mode. I looked forward to it when CA showed it off in the various game interviews and live stream events. But Gods do I hate it now. The concept is interesting, if you are getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by tougher opponents, you can drop everything and move on with life as a nomadic faction. Cool yeah? Well there are some downsides to it. First and foremost, as a horde faction your armies can go into a "camp" mode and build structures just like a city, but for some reason they cost just as much as city buildings do and take just as long. Why? It makes no sense, these structures are supposed to be cheap and easy to setup/tear down on the fly. And if you lose an army, all of the structures go with them, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't as costly and time consuming as a city was.\n\n2. Horde Mode Continued. The second part of the Horde mode that gets annoying is the fact that the AI abuse the system. Hell, they flat out cheat with it. When you go from Horde -> City owner you lose all of your horde buildings, thus losing all of your economic and food bonuses, which makes sense. That also means that it takes you a few turns to balance out the new needs and costs of your newly founded empire, yet enemy AI don't have to deal with that. They can literally go from Horde -> City -> Horde within a span of a few turns, all while being able to field multiple high level armies. Remember in Rome and Shogun II where enemy armies suffered attrition until they balanced out their food/economy? Yeah, doesn't happen here, at least not for the AI. Also, it should be noted that if the last stack an enemy AI has is a navy, they will literally...never...♥♥♥♥ing...die from attrition. It makes no sense, they are a Hordic faction with NO WAY TO BUILD OR SUPPORT THEIR TROOPS, but they will stay alive until someone finally finds and destroys them.\n\n3. Limited Roster and Factions. I'm sure you've already heard of this, but Attila launched light on content. I mean, real light. Like Total War: Attila Lite. Let me break it down for your, there are three real distinct factions, ERE/WRE (Roman), Sassanid Empire (Eastern), and Barbarian (EVERYTHING ELSE). That's it. Folks can sugar coat it all they want, but at the end of the day every single barbarian factions plays and looks the same. There was no effor put into even making distinct units or varying color schemes. Sure there will eventually be mods for it, but it screams laziness.\n\n4. AI Satallite Support and indefinite grudges. Alright, I'm over-exagerrating a little here, but either way this gets pretty annoying. The enemy AI will field everything they have at you when you two are at war, now this makes sense when they're next to you or near you. Less so when they are halfway across the freaking globe and you've never even met on the campaign map. Yet, within a few turns you'll find that they've sent ever single army they have at you. And good luck escaping, these little ♥♥♥♥♥ will chase you wherever you go, even if they can't see you due to fog of war, and even if they have their own wars going on back home.\n\n5. The Diplomacy System. It's jacked, there's just no other way of putting it. The "Great Power" debuff you receive after taking a city, or upgrading an army makes absolutely no sense. You can lose major allies due to this, but the other faction AI's don't suffer from this. CA at least tried to include a better AI personality system, where AI faction leaders have various traits such as "Holds Grudges" or "Admires Power", unfortunately this gets stale pretty quickly due to there being maybe five to ten tribes around you, and it's always the same tribes.\n\n6. Units, always the same units. I touched on this above, where I stated that there is no real unit diversity between factions. Well it gets a little more mind-boggling when you get down to Rome. You'll notice that Spain, Africa, and even Europe begin to form due to rebellions on the WRE side. If you're creative you can also bring back Macedon and various other factions that were assimilated during Rome's expansion. While this sounds pretty awesome in concept, there is just one MAJOR problem. THEY ALL USE ROMAN UNITS/BUILDINGS. At first it's uderstandable, but after thirty to fourty turns you quickly realize that they are using the exact same unit/building roster and research tree, basically these supposed "new" factions are just re-skinned Romans. Go for creativity. At least give them a new paint job to show off the new governments....\n\n7. Children. Specifically illegitamite children. I'm sure you've read this, but illegitamite children in Attila happen all the time, and take up the majority of the faction tree. This wouldn't be so bad until you consider that you'll eventually have to comb your family tree to find the right politician/governor who just leveled up, or find the right person you want to engage in a political action. Good luck with managing that on turn seventy and up.\n\n8. Razing. This was cool at first, but quickly got old when EVERY SINGLE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FACTION DID IT. Within twenty turns in one of my campaigns I noticed that the AI had razed all of Europe. I don't mean to say that the Huns did it, I mean that regular factions such as the Saxons did it. It made absolutely no sense, these were city owning factions that were just destroying provinces left and right. Why? Because....reasons I guess...because CA says ♥♥♥♥ logic.\n\nEnding notes - Not worth full price, purchase on a sale such as 50% off.","March 17, 2015","false","536.8"," 242 of 291 people (83%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","83","242","291","22","5"

DLC is overpriced and honestly not worth buying unless in a HUGE discounted sale (considering it shoulda been included on launch or as a free update...).\n\nGreat job with dynamic fires and enemy AI, but honestly, I just reboot Shogun 2 FotS or Medieval 2 if I want a good Total War game experience... sad, but true considering how different the gameplay is compared to previous titles.\n\nCA, please stop trying to make the game with the best graphics and make us a really fun game to play that's complete and intricate. Honestly, you'll make more money and less enemies that way... jussayin.\n\nI played the game for a while (of course as the Danes, go Vikings!!), but honestly if I want a medieval game that is polished, has huge level of replayability, and has insane amounts of depth... Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 take the prize. Love Total War to death and will continue buying the games, but if it keeps being rehashes with nothing substantially different or interesting, my support is gonna leave, which makes me sad considering I have spent literal months in game time playing these games.\n\nTo finish, Attila is worth buying, but at an insane discount. I feel guilty that I bought it at %50 off; shoulda waited till %75 to be entirely honest. Fun game with lots of good features and a lot of things done right, but when the pros and cons of this game equal out swaying negatively... It makes it incredibly difficult to defend. Again, there are a lot of cool things about the game, and I had fun playing it, but I just ended up playing the older titles more, which makes me wonder why I even bought it besides being peer pressured by the league of generals inside my mind that thirst for MOAR TOHTAL WAHRRRR. When I got Shogun 2, I played it just as much as I played the old titles and had a lot of fun and had to relearn how to fight as a daiymo as compared to a medieval king, so it was immensely fun playing a totally different game, but with Attila, it's a reskinned Rome, albeit a more fun and exciting Rome. Attila feels more like an expansion of Rome 2 rather than a standalone entity. Compare it with Fall of the Samurai, and honestly, it doesn't quite meet the level of expectations with the new level of gameplay presented by an expansion that COULD be a standalone game...\n\nSoooo this gets a thumbs down.

The new siege damage is immensely immersive, the new family tree system is fun and intriguing, though a little confusing at times. The game has released in a much better state than Rome 2 did.\n\nHowever, the game as it stands, has poor unit variety, most factions units are clones of one another. Sure the romans are vastly different from the nomads and barbarians. But they all feel the same. Whats more, the game isn't balanced. Roman cav is somehow utterly undefeatable. As are dogs, elephants can be decimiated with a single barbarian unit that those spears or axes. Battles are over in seconds.\n\nBut like many people who own this game, I'm furious at the audacity of SEGA for their marketing scheme with the DLC, clearly features that should have been in the game at release are being withheld and being released not even a month after the game has come out.

Where is the MEAT??\n\nI wanted to love it....\nI wanted to give this a big thumbs up....\n\n\nThere are two main problems why I can't despite all the improvements such as the family tree:\n\n1. Sega and CA clearly intend to bleed me dry of my funds over a sustained period by drip feeding me, what appears to be basic content which should be in vanilla, and unfortunatly they are starting to take the ♥♥♥♥ with the prices. Remember Vanilla is a flavour Sega it doesnt have to be tasteless... I want delicious madagascan vanilla flakes in my total war!!\n\nWhich leads me on to my next point; Just like my taste in women this game is like a supermodel who has got an eating dissorder. She is hot and im totally in to her BUT I need to wait until she starts eating again and gets her self esteem back before I can get "excited".\n\n2. Limited number of units / construction options (no AOR), where if you upgrade your military you are forced to have only elite units and can no longer recruit the basic version, leaving you spending a fortune on a small army. There seem to be only a few map models for towns in the north (where I am playing) so every village seems to be a replica of the last one. I am sure the models vary as you move between cultures but it seems a bit bland. The overall feel and graphics of the game are however more polished.\n\n\nHowever, the skeleton for something amazing has been provided and I am thankful for that. If I knew I would not have to give them further money to unlock factions I should be a really happy chap. I will now go back to playing the DEL mod of Rome 2 which is currently a hugely superior game than Attilla (Vanilla) and wait for the modders to be allowed to "put the meat on the bones" so to speak.\n\nI have no doubt that given 6 months of development the likes of Radious and Del will actually turn this into something superb. But I feel like I want to give the community the credit rather than sega. because their marketing strategy is leaving a very bitter taste in my mouth!\n\n\nMy Advice - wait for the workshop to be opened and or a deal on the game. You will enjoy the game more then. So I am not recomendin the game at this precise moment until the player content makes it worthwhile... Then I will swap to a thumbs up but I will be picking and choosing my DLC's (if i buy any) very carefully later on.\n\n.....\n\nUpdate! - Well Attila i am afraid has still not won me over and kicked my ♥♥♥ into giving him a thumbs up. I am fairly sure all CA's time is now going into warhammer and possibly rightly so.\n\nI have pondered and pondered as to what this game lost from Rome 2 (yes i still think its better sorry). In reality as before I am really comparing modded Attila to modded Rome 2.\n\nits hard to put your finger on exactly what the problem is and despite the new family tree the game actually feels less RPG and more Arcade and I just cant get into it.. simply put i find it a bit boring. I think this is mainly down to the only decent game changing mod being radious which is pretty much what he goes for, thats being more arcade style with loads of unit stacks. I am not saying Radious is boring because its not, that man puts in serious effort in his mods and should be saluted but its just not for me. So if you always loved Radious you will probably love Attila - Radious\n\nI think its the old school players who cant settle here  as there is no: Rome total realism, Stainless Steel or Divide et Impera style mod (yet). There is one on the horizon though called ageless empires which I have high hopes for. So for the moment I will stick to Rome 2 and it seems I am not alone.\n\nGoing back to my original analogy of Attila needing some Meat, Radious has done this and my Attila sexy supermodel seems to have eaten too many pies now. certainly fleshed out but Im looking for something a bit more toned and athletic... yes i know im picky... but I want Attila Del style damnit... :D","March 1, 2015","false","205.7"," 598 of 779 people (77%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","77","598","779","58","32"

All this should've been in Rome 2\n2. CA trying to squeese every little penny outta the players by cutting the content from the game (aka Forefathers and Longbeard DLC) and *providing* it for extra money. Really, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, is 1k rubles not enought for you so u charge another 40% (0.4k total) for 6 factions on the RELEASE DAY? WTF?\n\nPS\nAfter playing this game for a while i found that the AI is really foolish and to compensate that, it cheats. First off, some factions (Eatern Roman Separatist in one of my campaings) has too many armies with hight quality units (Separatist got 3 full stacks while having only TWO cities, i got the same amount of troops, 0 income and  3 full regions of 3k+ income, and 2 cities in different regions), and if AI loose em, he replenish em super fast in 2-3 turns (had to demolish 3 waves of ♥♥♥♥ers to get to em from my borders to their cities).\nThe declaracion of war by AI is pretty ridiculous too, in multiplayer i played as visigoth and my parter as alans. I settle in Greece, my associate lost one of his two armies by some remote AI. Partner rushes to my lands for defence, and the AI stood on my borders for a while. Moreover, one of his enemies from the start, located in the far right of the map goes across HALF OF THE MAP with one army for my friend, and i kill im for crossing my borders. Now for the juicy part: while all of this happened, one of my armies was sacking roman cities in th asia region, freeing Asia and Pontus. And after i defeated strangles on my lands, Asia, my military ally, DECLARES WAR ON MY PARTER, ALSO MY MILITARY ALLY!. Naturally, i kill him, but he manages to kill my friend's main army and left him with newly recruted one with a couple of units. But there's more! When my friend settles near me, my SECOND military ally, Pontus, also declares war on my partner and kills him in 2 turn.\n\nOn the good side, the land battles became more fun, in Rome 2 u just spawned 4-6 units of artillery and a strong melee units to defend em, shooters sucked as hell, as well as any horsemen beside heavy ones. Now, the arty is significantly weaker, but the shooters and horsemen became more powerfull, wich allows for more tactical choices. I like how u can troll oponnent with hunn horse archers, or how u can shoot an entire squad of shieldmen with 2-3 volleys by positioning shooters behind enemy lines. AI still suck balls thought.\n\nOh, and dont forget about perfomance. It horrible. My hight-end pc is choking trying to calculate AI turns, framerate drops for about 5 for the duration of the AI turn, wich takes about of 2 minutes. Apparently, 6 cores with 3.7 GHz is not enought for such a sophisticated game.

I've tried mods: DeI and Radious, but nothing can fix this mess. I can handle my own mistakes in strategy and tactics, but when I lose battles or important units because of flaws in the game, it stops being fun. If I order my cavalry to retreat, they shouldn't get halfway out and then turn around on their own accord to re-engage their hard-counter. Battles can be fun when you're maneuvering with 5-10 units, but anything involving a full army or more will bring the flaws front and center. I want to simulate powerful armies of grand empires, but in every campaign where I've gotten to that point I get bogged down and frustrated by mechanics. I haven't finished a campaign in Rome 2 or Attila, which is fine - that's how I play lots of games, but I no longer have the desire to start any new games because I know what waits.\n\nThe city building is alright and improved in Attila, but there are better games out there where that's the focus.\n\nIf any of the developers or publishers read this, here's my advice: slow down, get the mechanics right, and release a polished game. Warhammer looks cool, but I'm not interested if it's beset by these same problems. The best thing you can do for this franchise long-term is to get the engine right. You haven't done that yet.\n\nEdit: update: from me OP:\n\nI don't know what it means that I have 1000+ hours logged. I'm guilty of leaving games open for idle hours; I have a computer that handles games minimized and I don't reboot often. I've played a handful of campaigns and one real long one that I've continued to play every once in a while since writing this review. (I'm dominating as WRome by the by, but only in 412 AD). I admit that I probably overstated my playtime's importance by leading with it, but you read the review didn't you?\n\nI stand by that review. I want to like these games; I really do.\n\nI've played a lot of Total War, including technically 881 hours in Rome 2. Same caveat applies, of course. But once Attila came out, why play Rome 2? It was released in 2013; Attila was two and a half years later in 2015. The Rome 2 campaign starts in 272 BC; the Attila campaign starts in 395 AD. It's the same region of the world and basically the same map with a different historical context but mostly the same gameplay. Attila has some mechanical improvements because of technology's march, but nothing revolutionary or worth writing about.\n\nCertainly there are things this game does well. Other people have written about them. But the unique premise of Attila is based on cavalry. Regardless of whether you're playing them or fighting against them, the tactical cavalry gameplay experience is awful. It's frequently frustrating and those moments weigh heavy.\n\nCan you imagine the game we'd have if they spent time on making one great thing instead of two mediocre things? Everyone can read about the issues Rome 2 had at launch. They fixed some of them with patches, sure -- but that's time taken away from developing Attila and it showed. What if they'd just extended the Rome 2 timeline to include Attila improvements? Wouldn't that be a better, more exciting game than either of the two that we have?\n\nWhen you release two games intead of one you fracture the modding community, which has to adapt the same ideas to different code bases. The Divide et Impera, Radious and Darthmod communities are unbelievable resources for Total War games but volunteers can't keep up with the demands of so many games so fast. It fractures the users and developers. I would again invite you to a fantasy in which the modding community developed around a game that accomplished Rome 2 and Attila at the same time.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why I still can't recommend Attila to anyone. I'll still play this ongoing campaign every once in a while because I don't play many games these days and fall sucker to sunk costs, but if someone stole it from me I wouldn't buy it again. I won't start another campaign and I'm 100% done with Rome 2.\n\nI still want to look forward to stuff like TW:Warhammer, but I'm going to wait a while and see. No pre-orders from me. But if CA gets enough time to figure out the tactical combat sim aspect of all this, these games will go on to greatness.","August 23, 2015","false","058.8"," 682 of 909 people (75%) found this review helpful 74 people found this review funny","75","682","909","74","34"

Spent 50 hours total playtime, and overall I will say there is a lot more positive to say than negative.  My campaign is with the Saxons, and besides the prologue with the visigoths they are the only factions I have played with so far.\n\nThe prologue did a fairly decent job of explaining new features, and I think the new features are what are attracting a lot of players to Attila. The biggest (not new but finally returning) feature is the family tree. Best variety and options of any Total War game so far.  Lots of actions that can be taken, you can once again chose your heir, marry, divorce, adopt, assassinate and more. The down side is that the pace of the game means you may only have a few kings during your playthrough if you are cautious/lucky with your kings. My second king is 75 years old at 453 A.D. and still going.\n\nThe units are tiered, which is an interesting change to things. The biggest downside is that as you research and upgrade tiers, you can no longer recruit lower, cheaper tiers in all cases. Now, by the time you have have access to those higher tiers you should be making a higher turn income but other issues compound the frustration of the late game.\n\nIf you get too big you become everyones target. Diplomacy is futile and you have to be ready to fight on multiple fronts agaisnt multiple enemies. This is the problem I ran into at least. I took all of britain with the exception of ireland, and had frisia and gothskandia under my control along with part of belgica. and was at war with nearly all surviving factions in europe with the exception of Eastern Roman Empire.  At this point, I was having to fight off two and three armies at a time, stuck in cities due to the threats of looting (I couldn't afford to lose income per turn and repair) and basically had to keep my armies static to defend rather then expand.\n\nExpansion slows down as the game goes on (at least in this playthrough) over 60% of the map was desolate by 453 AD. and the price to recolonize was extreme. Add to that the fact that by 453 AD the fertility across 80% of the map was at the lowest point (a few southerly provines were meager, the second lowest fertility).  Even though by this time my building tiers and bonuses for tech levels had increased my income, higher unit upkeep and longer winter attrition periods meant I was still only looking at an average of 1500-2000 income per turn.\n\nI never migrated, or abandoned any settlements so I don't have much to say about horde mechanics at this point but i plan the next play through to be the visigoths or alans.\n\nI think in general both commander abilities and agent actions have been nerfed. No longer can you expect a half dozen abilities per general, nor can you plan on destroying enemy armies through a blitz of spies poisoning every cup, goatskin,  dewdrop of water in the vicinity.  But Frank-ly (har har) that's an improvement in regard to realism over Rome II.\n\nThe biggest negatives i found with Attila are with the endgame. You're provinces will be infertile, raging with epidemics, and if you're large enough, assaulted on all sides. But obviously that was CA's goal. War, Death, Famine, and Pestilence (did I miss someone? Groucho, or perhaps Shemp?)  And while it is all in the spirit of apocolpyse, it makes for an extremely frustrating situation. Even achieving the minor victory condition is 14 settlements away. There aren't even 14 undesolate settlements in europe (not counting the ones I own). So I have two options. Hoard wealth at a meager rate and colonize or haphazardly capture the settlements that remain.\n\nIn hindsight i would have to say I should have abandoned the mainland, captured all of britain, then slowly recolonized and conquer, either through gaul or skandinavia to use the geography to help keep from overextending my territory. I would say I should have expanded faster but Im not sure that is wise given the fact of the major diplomatic penalities and inevitable war with every other damn faction in spitting distance (and then some. Minding my own business with no settlement south of my starting saxon capital and Hispania and Africa join in the fight against me)\n\nI'm looking forwards to mods, especially unit additions and an increase in turns per year.  Also, some changes to make raiding armies more feasible (less attrition, increase to the bonus of adding warriors after victory)\n\nAttila is definitely more satisfying at its start than Rome II.  Inevitable DLC will add more units, factions, blood (yeah, seriously,it is ridiculous they are going to make us pay for it again)\n\nMy deepest desire? Take a note from paradox, give me an extension of the timeline, add events with it. Attila should see a "rise of islam" expansion, take us into the crowning of Charlemagne, and pave the way for Medieval III (or whatever the heck they are going to call it)","February 21, 2015","true","279.0"," 375 of 488 people (77%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","77","375","488","20","7"

Don't support the rubbish that this game thinks it can get away with.\n\nContent wise, its clear from the start that its been released with hugely reserved content.

If you're a fan of the series either wait a few months until a big sale or don't buy it (unless you like seeing your favourite games sh*t on).\n\nHaving owned every TW game from the start, this game feels like a massive middle finger to all of their fans who bought it at full price.

Most of it is exactly the same as total rome 2 except they've brought back control of your family and also unit upgrades.... Which IMO were one of the best features of the early series and they were stupid to ever remove.  Most of the factions are really boring to play and give you barely any battles to fight.  Apart from the odd couple included the only factions that look like fun are, surprise surprise, included in DLC.\n\nOverall: 6/10.

It´s quite playable from the release date and it´s fun too.\nI´m way more in to this game then the last 2 TW´s. I played TW from the beginning and i have played them all.\nSo actually i can really write a review about what´s good/bad, better/worse.\n\nFirst of all: The core mechanics of the game are quite similar to those of medieval 2, which is awesom to me because i loved that game so much.... especially modded with the famous mod called DIV (Deus io vult)\nI have played ATTILA now for about 30 hours and had a lot of fun. Sadly atm i don´t have enough time to really dive into it!\nBut as soon as i´m on vacation i will get myself addicted to it :D\n\nGraphics are really nice in this game -> but the fact that CA sets up a recommended PC setting to run it on max which is not even near to the setting you would actually need ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. My Pc is way better then the recommended settings needed, but it wont go over 20fps on max settings! Ridicolous! So i actually cant enjoy the awesom graphics ... I feel scamed here!\n\nNext thing what is a bit wierd: The AI in this game is almost as stupid as it was in TW Rome 2! Not only the campaign AI also the battle AI does really stupid things an acts totally scripted! (for example: The Huns always do the same thing AND I MEAN ALWAYS - I started 3 great campaigns and they always did the same! WTF???) I´m sure a lot of people came across this issue and the CA team will improve the AI ... or some modders maybe?\nAnother example are some battle situations: The AI really messes up with their units sending them into certain death!\nEven on highest AI settings it feels like there is no challange at all ... PLS make this game more challenging... it has so much potential.\n\nNow the sad news which gets me to write a bad  review for ATTILA.\nThe fact: Game gets released and with release there allready is a payable DLC for the game WTF???\nOK i thought for the people who preordered it as a bonus and purchasable for thoose who didnt preorder. Sounds quite fair to me.\n2nd fact: One week after release there is allready a seconfd payable DLC for the game WTF???\nAnd this time i didnt say, it´s OK!!! I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell! because i asked a friend a few days before (a friend who knows about software and game stuff) and this friend told me afterwards that thoose DLC´s were in the game from the beginning! So why dont release them with the core game? AND then it hit me: MONEYHUNGER!!!!\n\nDear CA... you were known for making great games, and still doing so. But the fact that you are getting more greedy form TW to TW pisses me of... I beg you read the commentary to your DLC release on the steam forums and you will only find hate! Do you really want to mess with the community who pay your bills?\nLook back to Rome 2: There were more DLC packs for this game then actual factions on release!!! WTF???\n\nRipping people of is not the way of getting more to play it!\n\nI´m not sure if it´s the fault of CA or the damn puplisher SEGA (who is known for a greedy ♥♥♥)\n\nBut the only thing I have to say to end my review is: Stop beeing MONEYHUNGRY A-holes or there wont be another 15 years for your Studio! (happened to a lot of other studios)\n\nPS: Happy 15th anniversary, a sad TW gamer/fan\n\nEDIT 19.03.2015\nAnother payable DLC just was announced ... 3 weeks after release!\nSorry guys now you really lost me ... this was totally the las TW game i´ve bought!\nTell me dear developers: How shall this continue? A payable DLC every week?\nI can´t tell you all how mad i am! YOU totally deserve this bad review and many more!\n\nEDIT 25.03.2015\nAnother payable DLC just was released! Now we have to pay for graphical settings which should have been in the game from the beginning, and probably allready were.\nIt´s pretty obvious that this content is a DLC so that the RATING for appropriate age could have been set down to 12 years ... so that more people can buy it! It´s a shame...\n(as I said: every week, there will be payable content)\n\nI SPEAK TO ALL TW FANS OUT THERE: STOP supporting their RIP-OFF tactics!\nOr we will never get a quality game from them again!\n\nRegards\nBoudewijn IJzenarm","March 12, 2015","false","53.4"," 254 of 326 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","254","326","10","41"

I massacre their armies and the britainian armies, one faction loses 4 armies to me and still doesn't want peace they don't want my land they JUST WANNA SACK IT.Do the britainians fight each other?No they have no problem sharing that land i left them.Almost every barbarian HATES you just for been a empire and will fight you  even if another faction stands between you and them just so they can sack you,this alone makes trade and maintaining relations IMPOSSIBLE.My lands keep revolting forcing me to either exclude them from tax or sending troops to put them down.THANK ****** God the HUNS haven't moved in they been terrorize the eastern rome empire in turkey.Ive destroy so many armies i can't remember the last time i did manual battle. The enemy never learns even after losing so much and beinging defeated they still keep coming back gaining nothing but my frustration you'de think their people would rebel from having lost so many sons and husbands but NO.Like SUN TZU once said "neither side benefits from prolonged war" but the AI doesn't understand that,CA just decide to send zombie hordes after hordes to take you out so it would look like its a hard and satisfying campaign and that the western rome empire is in an apocalyptic state.Only thing you'll seen is a bunch of stupid AI charging you over and over again until you can take no more.So after 85 turns this is what i have just pure frustration and rage....i can't remember the last time i was this mad at a game... And If you defend this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Campaign AI then you don't understand how Wars are really fought.\n\nIts clear to me now that CA has lost its talent to make great strategy games that require tactics,strategy,planning and thought to play.Shame.....that this is the best CA has to come up with......Shame\n\nI will mourn for Rome as i watch it burn...\n\n","February 27, 2015","false","47.5"," 364 of 482 people (76%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","76","364","482","35","16"

Just finished playing Attila over the free weekend here, and as an experienced Total War player (yay original Medieval on Steam!) that as of yet has not bought any titles from the Rome II series thought I would add my review to the many here.\n\nThe Good:\n1)- Horde mechanic.  Ever since Barbarian Invasion was released a decade ago I have loved the idea of this feature and Attila's development of this to include buildings is promising.  I could see future TW releases that take advantage of this.\n2)- Factions everywhere!  Love to see all the major cultures represented even if the historical accuracy is, um, well, in line with inflammable pigs.\n\nThe Bad:\n3)- Lack of unique units.  Somehow we have stepped back into the realm of Empire's original release, where the board is covered mostly with generic units spiked by a few faction specific units.  AoE II did that style 15 years ago.\n4)- Diplomacy.  Although it is far, far better than the original Rome, the Imperium feature largely makes maintaining vassals and peaceful relations with factions impossible.  Just burn it all!  :P\n\nThe Ugly:\n5)- Tactical simulation engine.  Ironically the strength of the original Rome, Rome II's battles are still a mess and not a challenge to anyone who has played a TW game.  The AI left its generals unguarded in most battles and seemed to be better at randomly swerving back and forth more than anything else.  I did not even play or read any tutorials and beat an enemy army that outnumbered me 2 to 1 in my first battle (only on normal difficulty though).  Call me crazy, but the battle animations still look beter on my low powered laptop in Medieval II than they do in Attila.\n6)- Historical accuracy.  I am not sure what is worse: Scythians with Roman onagers, or the fact that every unit can sprout a boat out of nowhere and float around the world.  Must we have Huns in boats?\n\nSummary: As a historian I am always cheering for the success of all titles such as this, but I cannot give my approval based on what CA has released in the past.  This title featues a combination of some of the difficulties faced by the original Rome game engine (mainly bad diplomacy) and Empire's engine (generic units, bad tactical game engine, numerous CTD bugs) to create thoroughly underwhelming title that overall seems like a step back from Shogun II.  Better luck next time CA.","June 27, 2015","false","14.1"," 355 of 476 people (75%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","75","355","476","17","9"

The battles are not as blobby as Rome 2, but still are less enjoyable to watch than Medieval 2's tense battles. They kept some fundamental Rome 2 changes that are really bad. I will tell you them.\n\nThe system of Shogun 2 towns was perfect. There were physical representations of your farms on the map that your foes could raid. In Rome/Attila there are only settlements. So you must needs put your army in "raid stance", which aside from being ♥♥♥♥ing lame, is almost completely useless.  I want my vikings to raid the enemies resources not just set them in a stance. They decided to make overall food numbers higher which IMO was a mistake. The building system has way too many hidden menus. The raze mechanic really isnt that cool. Ive never even seen an AI faction restore a town. The "Zeal, Cunning, and Authority" skills for characters are so lame. In Shogun I loved leveling up my generals because of the awesome skill tree and retainer system. And generals actually had stars in different areas like "infantry/cav command", "besieger/defender" etc marking what they were good at. Thats all gone. Lastly, the politics minigame is dreadful and really needs to be rethought completely.","April 15, 2015","false","154.5"," 117 of 138 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","117","138","5","0"

Let me say, WOW. I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, "why couldn't ROME 2 be like this"\n\nPROS\n-------------------------------\n\n-- Character management-- It reminds me of how the older Total War games did characters but couldn't quite make it work. Now it feels right and works better. Now you can equip your generals with specific items, even attach other characters to more notable ones adding more depth to "building" your characters.\n\n-- City Governors --  I can't tell you how annoyed I was that if I wanted to have a character manage a city, I had to waste one of my valuable army slots for it. Now you can just assign a character as a governor and they'll manage it, earn XP, all the goodies, all without having to use up an army slot.\n\n-- Beach Assault --  A great idea in Rome 2, a perfected dream in Attila. I was playing one of the Norse factions and was like, "I don't care if beach assaults suck, I'm a freaking Viking, I'm attacking from the sea". When I got to the map I was amazed at how much beach I had to land on. No longer was I hard up for good landing zones. Also the beaches look amazing, very realistic.\n\n-- RTS Gameplay -- I can't quite put my finger on it, it just feels better, in almost every way. It’s almost like I traded in my terrycloth bathrobe for a velvet one. They both worked, it’s just the velvet one feels nicer.\n\n-- Settlement battles --  The buildings look SO MUCH better, the settlements look like what you'd expect from people who have been living there improving on them for years. On top of that, they're more intuitive to defend, and there is more of a variety. So when you take the variety, the look, and how more realistic they feel, I actually enjoy sacking/defending settlements.\n\n-- Occupying Settlements-- When I took my first town the game presented me with a nice list of options. No longer am I stuck with just "occupy/raze/the other one" There was like 6 options I could choose from, each had its own distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n\n-- Family/Political Management --  Where to begin, I find myself spending more time managing my family than ever before. I actually feel like I'm "grooming" certain characters now. As they gain ranks they can be given positions in the government/tribe/gang. Each position brings its own bonuses to the character. Marriage is now more interesting, I suddenly now understand why all those high society folks in Jane Austin books where so obsessed with marrying the right person. The right marriage can bring a lot of bonuses to your family.\n\n-- The Interface -- It took me a little bit to get used to the new set up (not really that much different), but you can tell CA took great care to make everything flow better. Some screens can be toggled a bit more than they were in Rome 2.\n\n-- Unit Cards --  Really, I wasn't all that butt hurt about the unit cards in Rome 2, at first I was like, "what????" but it didn't take me long to get used to them. I bounced back and forth between all the mods for unit cards, and ultimately I just stuck with the CA ones. Now the new unit cards are more in line with how so many people wanted.\n\n-- Performance -- I have had zero issues with performance. My settings are on as high as they can the game will let me and I have not had any issues.\n\n-- Not a Rome 2 clone -- This isn't really an issue for me, but may be for some. Attila is not Rome 2 reskinned or a glorified expansion pack. There is enough of a different to tell these two games are different. Attila feels very different from Rome 2, and even though I LOVE Rome 2, I am very much enjoying Attila.\n\n\n\nCONS\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n-- Unit Banners -- I know I can turn them off, even set them to "mouse over", but they just feel weird to me. Note I am talking purely about aesthetics. I think they're a nice improvment as far as functionality (they display a bit more info for those quick glances when in the heat of battle)\n\n-- Unit marker/indicator Arrow thingy -- When you move a unit or hold down the space bar it'll show you where the unit is supposed to go, well, they look kind of ugly, and distracting for some reason. Not a deal breaker, just something I wish I could change in the settings.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUTION\n___________________________________________\n\nThis is a much more polished game when compared to Rome 2. Its launch has been very smooth and has been nowhere near as rocky as Rome 2 was. Don't get me wrong, I love me some Rome 2, but I could totally understand people’s frustrations’ during its launch.\n\nWhen people say "this is what Rome 2 should've been", I go back and forth on my reaction. While I totally find myself wishing Rome 2 had all new features Attila does, I realize that they are two different games. To say this is what Rome 2 should've been would be like saying "Rome 2 is what Rome 1 should've been". There is enough of a gap to differentiate the two.\n\nMost importantly, seeing the equipment features for characters, as well as many other improvements, I can begin feel better about Warhammer Total War. With each Total War game everything gets better and better. Attila is just one more step closer to a perfected Grand Strategy game.\n\n\n\n\n**** OLD REVIEW *****\nJust from the Prologue the game runs very smooth. I have no frame rate issues, very pretty. No issues like Rome 2.\n\nThe units feel more medieval, at one point I was like "Medieval 3 is going to be amazing" (after Warhammer!!!!!!! *crosses fingers*)\n\nThe city management is MUCH better. I wasn't too butt hurt how Rome 2 did it, but this feels better.\n\nThe game grabs you for sure, more imerssive.\n\nAlso, I can see little hints of how Warhammer Total War is going to play, I'm very happy with this.","February 17, 2015","true","66.1"," 260 of 342 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","260","342","7","11"

( you'll end up in the end game with 35 cousins you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about, which is kinda annoying because you have to ensure the loyalty of everysing one of them)\n-Even if they start with an already built empire, the romans are really enjoyable to play and gives a good challenge\n-The destruction you can inflict on a town is REALLY awesome, I just love to burn absolutely everything to the ground\n- the AI is competent in battle. Not incredible but it will give a certain challenge.\n\nAnd now, what really sucks about this game\n-It should've been an expansion, plain and simple, just like FOTS. Not enough difference with rome 2 to justify a standalone game\n- The turrets are fricking machine guns. Forget trying to capture it with cavalry you'll lose half of it by the time you're done.\n- Burning a city to the ground is fun but as soon as you stop babysitting your troops they get caught in the burning buildings and killed.\n- You're fighting a battle on a port village and you wish to bring your marines on the ground to fight inside your city. You try to disembark your troops but guess what? Enemy boats have some sort of ''reserved parking slots'' on the closest beaches, so you can't disembark them because the AI has already ordered its troops there, resulting in you having to send your boats across the map to find a free spot\n- Vassals are useless, since they're gonna betray you whatever happens. As soon as their leaders gets the trait ''rebellious'' or ''hate that empire trait'' they are just ticking time bombs. Traits that, by the way, they always end up getting.\n-Almost 0 variety between barbarians nations,  be that in their buildings or in their troops. Like 5 unique units and the rest are common to everyone.\n-Painfully annoying AI on the campaign map. A hunnic army in Norway will get chased through the map by the sassanids if they are at war\n-The horde system is a fake good idea. Losing an horde means permanently losing a city, which is extremely time consuming to rebuild if it was a well develloped one. Attacking cities with more than 1 horde will get you the ''rivalry'' trait to all the horde present, which mean less food and less money (somehow) in your coffers.\n-The hunnic horde in the late game is basicly just the huns with 9 armies fully stacked with tier 3 units and infinite upkeep. Those hordes get respawned after 3-4 turns if you destroy them and the Huns as a whole are unkillable. You just never feel that you've accomplished something. You can't kill Attila, (sometimes he disappears for no reason tough, and his avatar on the diplomacy screen is some random eastern dude) and you can't destroy the hunnic hordes. The only available option is to buff your cities defenses to the maximum and let the huns attack them or beat each individual hunnic army with 4 of yours and hope the rest of the armies are too far away to reinforce.\n- Raiding as a horde is completely useless, since you make more money with an encampment\n- The tons of DLC, which add NOTHING to the game itself. A bunch of new units and a different starting region. Trust me, you want to play as the viking? Take a faction that start has a horde and capture their starting region. Easily saved 10$\n- Finally, the game itself, which is basicly what FOTS was to shogun 2. Except that FOTS costed 20$, added regions, was almost an entirely different game, the map didn't feel recycled AND was all around 10 times more enjoyable.\n\nDon't waste your money on this.\n","May 11, 2015","false","113.4"," 113 of 133 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","113","133","6","3"

Things go pretty well for the first several hundred turns.  I was able to move my horde to the Italian peninsula and boot the WRE out of Rome, while also distancing myself from the Huns for a time (more on the Huns later).  So far, so good.  I build up my power, capture all of the peninsula and northern Italy, and start my push for the final victory conditions.  And here is where it all goes south.  At the start of turn 279, i click on the faction button to assign some titles and poof, game crashes.  I think to myself, hmmm, that's odd.  So i restart, load my last save and the same thing happens, as soon as i click on the faction button, the game crashes.  No bug report, no nothing, just ctd and restarts.  After a quick google search, apparently this is a known bug that hasn't been fixed, even after 3 months.  Here's the link to the forum thread.  http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/150281-Silent-crash-when-clicking-faction-icon-%28family-tree%29\n\n2.  Not sure what to do after reading the above linked thread, as it appears to be a totally random occurrence, but having just bought the game, i figure I'll give it another go, this time as the ERE.  This game goes very well from the start, capture or subjugate all of the middle east and arabia, working my way through the balkans and the Italian peninsula and about to complete all the major military victory conditions by turn 213, all i have to do is build 4 "Veteran Garrison Quarters".  Yeah, slight problem with that.  Ere can't build garrison quarters, only the WRE can.  Crap, guess i have to work on the cultural victory conditions, not my style, but meh, at least i'll complete it.  WRONG!  Guess what, because i researched certain techs earlier in the game, I am now unable to build the particular buildings for the cultural victory either.  Here's the link to THAT bug as well.\nhttp://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/151731-ERE-military-victory-impossible?s=5aec6e3540fd1efe625eff9e6b8017ea\n\n3.  Back to the Huns (or, what appears to be any AI faction with numerous full army stacks).  As I mentioned before, I was able to take my horde to Italy and take the whole peninsula, figuring i'd let the huns run amok in the Balkans and central Europe while i built up my power base. After about 80 turns, i figured i had built up enough to push northward, and to my surprise, there were the Huns, just sitting north of the alps, basically loitering about. They made no effort to attack me, but neither did they move to another location (even though they had desolated the entire province). This lasted for another 40-50 turns, at which point i was able to spread out to the east and west and gain enough to build some rather large armies. I then attacked them, which proved costly since Attila had not died yet, so they just kept spawning, at a rate i couldn't keep up with, so i went on the defensive, at which point they again just sat at all the major passes in the Alps and did nothing, not even bothering to attack any of my northern settlements which were poorly defended.  They literally camped out just north of my position for over 100 turns, hemming me in, but making no attempt to attack any position, no matter how weakly it was defended.  The worst part is, they hung out in the mountain passes, making it impossible to get more than a couple armies to attack their position at one time.  http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/149060-AI-being-super-passive-when-in-large-numbers?s=5aec6e3540fd1efe625eff9e6b8017ea\n\nOverall, this game is one giant turd and wasn't even worth the price i got it at on sale.  I am through with all TW games.  Between the numerous DLC's and the numerous game breaking bugs, it is apparent that the developers are either incompetent or more interested in taking people's money than developing a decent game, and more likely than not, both apply.\n\nUPDATE:  After deciding to give this game another shot, i began a campaign as the Saxons.  As you may have noticed in the comments section, I WAS having a good time...Until today.  Once again, i completed a turn and tried to open the faction window and poof, CTD.  This game, at least for me, is completely unplayable as it is.  I even tried, as suggested in the comments, an uninstall and reinstall to no avail.  I can not, in any way, recommend this game, no matter how fun the game play may be, as it has too many MAJOR game breaking bugs.\n\nUPDATE II:  Game still crashes when clicking the faction tab, almost 8 months since launch and they still have no idea what's causing it, let alone how to fix it.","May 14, 2015","false","861.8"," 96 of 120 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","96","120","11","21"

At its core, this game is just a slightly more refined version of Rome 2 with all the variety and stability years of modding and bugfixes have given it wrenched out. The biggest rankles for me personally are:\n\n1) The basic game features 56 factions, only 10 of which are playable. This might seem like a bit of variety, but because same culture factions are almost (bar a few units) completely identical to eachother and geographically tend to be neighbours or near eachother on the map, there are really very few different ways to play the game unless you buy more factions to GET those different ways. To make this worse Creative seem to have gone out of their way to make it harder than ever to mod in factions or edit the game, while ramping up the price of faction purchases - a disturbing and disheartening twin-pronged approach I find very disappointing from SEGA and Creative. The base game factions feel like they get very old, very quickly because there is such a lack of variety not just in the units available to the player, but also in the AI composition and behaviour in both the strategy map and battles. It feels empty and lacking, intentionally, to be padded by DLC factions and DLC unit packs later.\n\n2) The AI appears suffer many of the same problems it has suffered in almost every single Total War game (at release) in the series history. Its not as often or as painful as has sometimes been the case in previous games. But to see units getting stuck on corners or faffing around on top of walls instead of going where they're told in cities, failing to mount siege equipment properly in battles on the battlefield can always hurt your feel for the game. On the grand campaign map the AI again builds extemely poorly balanced armies that are trivial to crush, while also using those armies with seemingly no purpose or goal other than total suicide. Also as ever, the AI continues to act with no logic or depth in diplomacy and wider/long term strategy in the world. Because of this, you can only experience truly vast, epic battles by specifically setting up those situations yourself in custom mode or painstakingly herding the AI (like cats) into extremely specific situations. The AI rarely if ever steps up for a major confrontation because its always managing what it has so poorly in a spread of ill conceived small-scale raids, or when threatened just sits hanging just (perfectly so) outside range of being able to be attacked on the campaign map doing nothing, which can be frustrating to see over and over for years on end while their homeland burns.\n\n3) For those who because of the above find the AI totally uninteresting and prefer players or want to experience Total War multiplayer before Total War: Arena comes out, you're no better off. The lack of variety in factions and their rosters becomes even more pronounced here, and the sheer lack of basic testing and oversight becomes obvious (e.g. Tagmata medium Cavalry who can crush elephants and elites, Uar Infantry who wreck anything that is not Tagmata cavalry, elite units that break in seconds when fighting peasants). Its bad enough that there are commonly accepted gentlemens agreements not to use specific units or setups in multiplayer, just to provide a modicum of balance to multiplayer games. Pray that Arena is better tuned for this purpose.\n\n4) The load and turn times are now mind-bogglingly long. Despite the apparent lack of thought the AI puts into everything it does, postal chess is the nearest comparison that comes to mind in terms of how long turns take. The actual feel of the game itself between loads is a seamless, smooth and polished experience when going about the business of ruling, but as soon as you push that end turn button or attempt to take your disagreements with your peers to the battlefield you're going to have potentially several minutes to kill.\n\nOverall I feel like its just a well polished... shell. A recepticle of a game whose creator has intentionally forgone making the base game a truly rich, interesting, varied and engrossing experience or pushing the genre to new heights. Instead we have a shopping cart into which piles of future DLC will need to be inserted. To compound this gouging approach, Attila has failed to include even basic Steam workshop and modding support, the lifeblood of virtually every Total War games longevity since man first began balancing units on Creative's behalf in Medieval 1 (2002). The Day 1 DLC should be an obvious indicator as to what this game really is, and how it has been designed. The real hammerblow is that not only is the game intended to be empty without DLC, Sega appear to have done everything reasonably possible short of outright sabotage of the game to prevent players and modders from filling the glaring voids in its content themselves. Its a coincidence that is hard to overlook given the increasing price and reducing content of the DLC we see at the same time.\n\nIn summary its terribly disappointing to see such huge effort go into this game's mechanics and polish by its creators for it to end up feeling intentionally mediocre and untested - an experience destined to be rounded out and completed by future DLC and bug-fixes. Which unfortunate past experience tells us will happen only in that 'DLC before bugfixes' order and only after many, many DLC. I only hope that someone see's the same opportunity with Total War that was recently seen in the city builder genre's crown being passed on. The straighforward execution of a similar game concept with community/mod support and without appearing so desperately greedy could likely dethrone this 15 year king too out of sheer goodwill. Unless SEGA/Creative take a serious step back in the now weekly demand for more money to complete the game with DLC and the long-term alienation of its players, competition may be the only way to finally see the genre progress again, or let us lay the atrophied but often well remembered Creative Assembly to rest.","March 28, 2015","false","75.4"," 72 of 85 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","72","85","0","0"

This is very bad CA, you have stopped your support of this game for your work on Warhammer and it is inexcusible. I'm not going to change my recommendation because this game is still better in many areas than Rome 2. For people wanting to buy this game please be aware that CA has STOPPED supporting this game. They only want to churn out DLC and not fixes, optimization etc...This is very poor CA.\n\n\n\nThis game is what Rome 2 should have been. Deeper politics, better diplomacy, a family tree, refined graphics, better ui and design, shock cav deliciously deadly, better camera as well as zooming in/out of the campaign map to see your empire, horde mechanics for barbarian tribes, less buggy naval combat compared to the atriocious rome 2 naval combat, fire/burning whole cities to the ground (SO FUN), civilians walking in your city during battle...and soo much more.\n\nAlso it wasnt a optimizing mess at release compared to rome 2. CA redeemed themselves in my eyes, a few more things need to be fixed like celtic factions NEEDING CELTIC UNITS, the nifty dragging of units feature is missing, and some other bug fixes, also it should be noted the MP is exactly the same as in Rome 2 which is kinda disappointing, i would really like to see Shogun 2 esque multiplayer but i guess Total War Arena will give us that.

These challenges were made to simulate real problems facing the world at this point, and to be honest, the way they are depicted in this game is very annoying. Asia and europe will be a wasteland by the time you get there, burned to the ground by marauding hordes. As long as Attilla is alive, hordes magically sprout from the ground in Crimea. Corruption is rampant and crippling. the economy is very hard to manage, and the farmland returns diminish as the game progresses. Dont get me wrong, Ive figured the way they want me to combat these problems. I just find them annoying and would rather not deal with them. These are not fun additions.\n\nMidieval 2 and Rome 2 were my personal favorites of this series. Id even deal with the black plague again if they would do a midieval 3 with the current engine.

This really alters the way you can play.\nNaturally also the graphics improved and since i have a kind of powerful rig, i also have not much problems with running the game.  It´s also interesting that CA implemented the highest graphic level with future graphic cards in mind.\n\nThe bad things are mostly in the detail, for example the diplomacy section is vastly unimproved (they even used many of the boring old voices again). A feature to trade towns for example, which would be really helpful, is still missing. Also the experience trees seem to me streamlined into too similiar ways.\nBattlewise, the trails of arrows and co. are a bit too much, but i doubt this will be a problem for long, regarding to mods.\nLikewise with the troop types, which are for many barbarian tribes a bit too similiar. This could be related to the last of my negative points the dlc handling of CA and how they cut up their games.

The blood and gore DLC I would have happily paid for, but the factions are all already in the game and simply locked away from the player to milk the fans dry.

Factions can also choose to abandon and burn down their own settlement or they can even choose to burn all of ther settlements and become a migrating faction.\n\nThe problem with desolated regions is:\nThey are never ever repopulated by the AI (even though they can settle there for free).\nRepopulation costs a lot of money for the player. Just taking a desolate region costs more than making a full stack army and after that you still have to reconstruct the buildings (for tons of money).\nEven if you got the money, it's not worth the time. When you take a desolate land you have to start rebuilding it, but in order to rebuild you first have to wait for the population to grow, so it takes 30-40 turns to make it a normal settlement again.\nFrom my Saxon campaigns: I built my little empire then Attila's horde arrived, I beat them back so they decided to turn against the rest of the world resulting in pretty much every region east of Poland and north of the Black Sea to become desolate. That's a lot of barren regions... never to be repopulated.\n\nMy allies The Gates owned skandinavia, with 4 regions and 5-6 full stack armies. One day they got bored (or maybe winter was coming) so they burned down all their settlements and became a migrant faction. Then they sailed down to the beaches of Spain but they never landed. For the rest of the game they were roaming the sea with 5 full stack armies.\n\n- The conquered: remember when you conquered all the settlements of a faction but they still had an army roaming around (and annoying you) for a short time before it withered away. Well in Attila they don't wither away, instead they become a migrant faction and run to the other corner of the world to roam around there doing nothing. This is pointless and from that moment on the faciton is just taking up loading time.\n\n- The enemy: In one of my campaigns the Celtic factions became allies and counquered Spain (they did this quite often actually). I figured it's time to take their homeland so I went to war with the four factions there, I landed in Britain with 4 armies and started taking their regions.\nTo my surprise they reacted quite fast and I noticed 13 full stack armies (of the 4 enemy factions) heading up from Spain by boat.\nI was glad, this will be total war and I'm probably going to get my ♥♥♥ kicked in glorious battles. Unfortunately after 3 turns two of the factions just stopped near the French coast and started roaming the seas there. The rest arrived to Britain with 7 armies but they didn't land. They waited there for atleast 10 turns and after that only one started attacking me.\n\nThe Ai\nA lot of times the Ai doesn't attack when he should, he just camps near the enemy settlements doing nothing.\nThe way the Ai conqueres regions or starts wars is beyond any reason. Factions at two different corners of the map start a war with each other.\nAi is reluctant to attack other Ai regions when they are at war. Even if he has wastly superior numbers (I'm talking about 3 full stacks vs an undefended settlement, the stacks just camped in the region for 20+ turns and then go away)\nA lot of armies just roam around pointlessly. Often they go to the sea and just sail around doing nothing and never landing aigan.\nThe desolate regions is abused by the Ai.\nSmall factions that should have just died out roam around pointlessly as migrant faction.  Thes are just the Campaign ai things, the battle ai is pretty much the same as in Rome 2.\n\nAll in all Attila is a bit like Napoleon was to ETW, a "should have been" expansion.  Except while in Napoleon the engine was really improved compared to ETW, in Attila there are only insignificant changes compared to Rome 2.\nThe only thing worth mentioning is the family tree but since time goes slowly in the game (4 tpy) you can dominate the world before your get a large family :)","June 29, 2015","false","144.4"," 139 of 194 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","139","194","11","2"

Optimization is poor, many of the animations and voiceacting have simply been copy-pasted from Rome, and with only a handful of factions to play in the base game, it's clear that SEGA has taken an EA, DLC-style approach to their games. Unless you're willing to drop an extra $15 apiece for every slightly differently coloured faction you want to play, you'd be better off playing Rome II, Medieval II, or Shogun.","December 11, 2015","false","59.8"," 144 of 202 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","144","202","7","0"

It has everything Rome II lacks and more.\nThe new city razing mechanics is awesome, you literally destroy the city and the region becomes desolate. On this point I will say it seems the AI uses it too much. On my campaign map I have tons of regions desolated. You can resettle those but it cost money and food, and it seems the AI considers it too expensive because I have not seen them settle one. But that's just some tweaking stuff, no big deal.\n\nFaction politics is much better than before, not only thanks to the family tree, but you also have much more options available with characters. Choose wife, embezle money, raise support, assassinate (of course), choose your heir, and plenty more. The offices system is more visual and intuitive, governor mechanics is very useful (saved me from starving more than once), and the blend between dominion and control resulting in faction power is a nice expansion on the simpler Rome II system.\n\nI don't if it's just me but the game feels more balanced, battles feel better and more dinamic. Units rout to come back later if not totally obliterated, in Rome II once they routed you pretty much lost them. Here you have more second chances if you play your strategy well. It really matters how you engage the enemy and the AI seems more responsive.\nBattle maps are also much more detailed, really beautiful to look at, and have more strategic values.\nI still miss having more landing points for navies. It can be a pain to fight mixed battles because of that.\n\nNaval battles feel pretty much the same, no big improvement as far as I know.\n\nOverall the game is very good. If you come from Rome you will notice the difference. Especially with loading time, Attila is much faster. Not with the turns though, ending turn is still a pain, but when faction numbers start to drop (even by just 4 or 5) speed increases a lot.\n\nI've been playing with the Jutes and it's a lot of fun. They have some powerful units and traits. I'm playing on normal difficulty and the campaign seems harder than rome's normal difficulty, AI is not afraid to declare war just when I'm weaker on their side, catching me completely unaware, while they cooperate with my other enemies to take me down. It is much easier to get people angry at you in attila, as soon as you get big, everybody will hate you for it.\n\nI was reluctant to buy this game considering Rome II was a fail (still a very good game though, just not what people expected) but I have no regrets, this is a well done Total War successor and I hope it's the perfect test ground for Medieval 3 (fingers crossed).","February 18, 2015","true","35.3"," 86 of 113 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","86","113","4","0"

But, if you're buying this hoping they've released a finished game for once, they haven't. Example, Christian factions will always "praise the gods". noticed that about 30 seconds into the thing and this is indicitave of how little proper testing went into the rest of the game. They added a ton of features ripped from other titles and downright begged for after the release of Rome II but just slapped them on to what they call a new game,. This isn't a new game, it's a patch and expansion for ROME II. Its marginally better than ROME II in its current form and LOOKS GORGEOUS but really that's it.\n\nCA have really stagnated, like they think all their games are perfect simply by virtue of basic premise alone. Instead of creating more strategic depth and building on what they've had for decades, they've asked what we can do without and give us the bare minumum to minimise effort and maximise profit and it really shows. People don't play Total War for flashy graphics, they play for authentic battles and the battle mechanics have not gotten better over the years, they have gotten worse. The worst being the fact that cavalry dont work as they should, able to be withdrawn and sent in for consecutive charges. That's an issue that has basically always been there, how lazy do you need to be not to fix that? In this game you are encouraged to make use of your allies and combined armies but you have no control over the stance of allies (this was in medieval II, again, they're going backwards) and NO CONTROL OVER WHERE REINFOCEMENTS WILL COME FROM. You will find a lot of the time that your army is decimated by the enemy before your reniforcements, placed right next to the attacked army beofre the battle. This is idiotic and in this day and age, with all the total wars before them, totally unnaceptable. One nice addition that people dont mention is guerrilla deployment (it may have been in other titles, i'm not sure). Now, certain units can be placed outside of the box that you are usually given but without the rest of the game changing on any fundamental level to make good use of this mechanic, it's utterly useless except to get a cheap victory by placing a ton of cavalry on the enemies flank and sniping their general.\n\nAnd, you will need to win a lot of cheap victories becasue the enmy will go to any lengths to destroy you, even if it means destroying their own tactical position with other factions. On legendary difficulty, The Eastern Roman Empire  will crumble while it sends endless teams of two full stack armeis against you, even if you havent attacked them in ages. giving away the rest of theier empire to other factions. That's plain lazy, artificial, difficulty. Oh, and the ineptitude of your allies!! dont bother making allegences with AI. A super strong faction will just cease any activity once they are your ally and you will spend all your resources defending them if you relly want to keep them, say, if they're your largest tributary as the huns. and doing this doesn't help your relations with them, I spent like 7 turns saving one tributary from rebellion before they declared war on me, which by the way, the game failed to notify me of. perhaps because I forgot to uncheck the box asking them to help me in a new war of mine but seriously, just becasue you wont help me (you weren't going to help me anyway) you automatically declare war on me? what?\n\nYou get the impression that CA/SEGA simply want to mass produce these games and its killing the franchise long term. It's so sad becasue they seem so close to being amasing games but they're so rushed that what they end up being is totally unacceptable. Single player is pointless and unrewarding but in multi-player its good fun and better than Rome","January 1","false","167.6"," 127 of 182 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","127","182","8","6"

Which I guess is made on purpose for the sake of DLC's.\n\n•  Furthermore, a huge let down in Attila is nothing more than the diplomacy. I honestly had gotten my hopes up for a polished and perhaps a more realistic diplomacy with even more strategic options and what not, nevertheless I was quickly displeased with what I saw.\n\n•  Lastly, I strongly believe that one(at least) or two new animations should have been added in battles as in its current state the battlefield reminds me a lot of Rome II; Perhaps I'm asking for too much, but hey isn't it a brand new game after all? Why it somehow looks incredibly contiguous to Rome II? That's something that kinda irritates me.\n\nCurrently, I really am enjoying the game as well as any TW game that I've played(Started with TW Alexander fyi) though I am neither willing nor able to recommend it at this very moment; I'd say that it's going to need several updates first.\n","February 28, 2015","false","51.6"," 148 of 216 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","148","216","5","0"

It seems discouraging as other factions start to hate you for having a large empire and the Huns always being a nuisance attacking you with full armies every other turn even if you kill all of them.\n\nFun game mostly, but it definitely has a different playstyle that the last few installments.\n\nRunning around the map trying to avoid Attila is not very fun at all. The huns are broken, they cheat, and cannot be killed from what it looks like, and they hunt you to the ends of the earth unless you migrate all the way across the map away from them.\n\nHonestly, if you are new to the series and looking to start up, go to ♥♥♥ and buy the emperors edition of Rome 2 and you might have a alot better of an expierience. Because I may end up switching back if they do not fix this ridiculous Huns AI cheating.","February 24, 2015","false","48.3"," 75 of 102 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","75","102","6","0"

The launch of Attila is not without its hiccups, but it is hundreds of times smoother than Rome 2. CA has learned from the mistakes and reintroduced features that were missed in Rome 2, as well as expanding even more: the family tree is back and politics is more in depth than ever, whilst still being easier to manage than older games such as Medieval 2. Traits and retainers are organized neatly, and it's easy and enjoyable to connect with your characters and your faction. Rosters at the moment are varied and interesting, with some strange mechanics in the tech tree with upgrades. I dislike that cheap units that you might use as a meatshield are eventually upgraded to elite, expensive units, and the cheaper units can no longer be used. The unit upgrading system is interesting, but it needs some work in its current state. Battles now feel more fluid and faster paced than Rome 2, though they will still often take the same amount of time. Axe units now have their own animations, and are even their own subtype of unit. The battle maps as well as the campaign map have an interesting dark tone to fit with the apocalyptic theme that the game is going for. Other than the unit upgrading, the only other thing I find bothersome with the game at the moment is the lack of proper optimization for some AMD hardware. I'm hoping hardware issues will be fixed with patches to be better optimized.","February 19, 2015","true","68.0"," 86 of 120 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","86","120","0","0"

As the name says it is focused more on the military, while the historicity is sacrificed on the altar of playability.\n\nPros 	  many languages ​​available\nmod support and Steam Workshop\none step ahead of rome II\nsuccessful atmosphere\nsteam cards, cloud and achievement\nreplayable\ngood sound sector\ncalamities and fire\ngood UI\nhistorical events\nmechanical horde and destruction of settlements\ngood tutorial\npleasant encyclopedia\ncomprehensive options\nunified launcherCons   too many dlc, and expensive\nmultiyplayer undertone\nwith no mod and dlc loses appeal\nheavy graphics\ndownload and significant space occupied on hard disk\nsome mechanical underused\nia and diplomacy is not exceptional\nlong turns\nnaval battles not so exciting\nno demo\nNotes   Sporadic problems starting the game and when introducing new updates (check the cache)\nIn conclusion, total war attila is a nice play with emotions and great atmosphere.

That being said this is an accurate review of the game as we have seen it so far.\n\nI found myself noticing for at least a while now lower frames per-second than previously in Rome II, now this isn't neccessarily a bad thing because this is a very brand new non-patched game so fixes are coming but one thing I did notice overall is that this game is Rome II on Steroids.\n\nI began my first campaign playing as the Western Roman Empire and almost immediately on my second turn I was sacked, raided and in some cases even threatened by both the migrating factions including the Visigoths and the Celtic factions to the northern parts of Britannia. In short - This game was incredibly difficult playing on normal difficulties, each turn I was either raided or in most cases the plague struck individual towns and regions.\nAi in this game isn't to shabby, though it has it's moments in which it does something very unprofessional the ai seemed to be working very well. Regarding these migratory factions, they seem to be foes of nearly everyone. The Huns were not interested in negotiating at all and the Visigoths already wanted my blood because on my third turn they came for me.\n\nTOTAL WAR: ATTILA -\nGAMEPLAY - 7.9  GOOD  | Gameplay is incredibly similar to that of the original Rome II, however I noticed that the barbarian/hunic factions are more so overpowered in regards to not just calvalry but all units.\n\nCAMPAIGN - 8.7  GREAT  | This campaign map is absolutely stunning, almost like a much darker version of ROME II, this campaign features a fully new integrated faction family tree system as well as a new system very much similar to Crusader King II.\n\nCREATIVITY - 6.7  GOOD  | This game has added a lot of new features but the idea of adding GIF's instead of actual cutscenes is more so a letdown, every campaign action in this game will feature an animated GIF that is around 3 seconds long. The team has also added the migration system which I personally think is fantastic it gives the player or ai a bit of mobility around the campaign map. There is also the feature to now raze or destroy the land around a settlement effectively burning out the populace and causing starvation. Overall the creators added numerous amounts of new creative designs but not enough to really give this a high score. I understand that they may have added in the governor systems, the fact you can now demolish your own settlements to save currency and the fact that you can now select puppet states to work for you, but there is still something missing... For example in the cutscene of the WRE (Western Roman Empire) - It showed a gladiatorial battle, however there is no cutscene in regards to such an event in the game. It's nice to look at via a single cutscene but I would have liked creativity like what Shogun II had been given.\n\nMULTIPLAYER - 6.0  GOOD  | Multiplayer for Attila is very much the same as generic Rome II, only the added features as the same in custom battle. You can now select the latitudes and longitudes of the province in which you wish to fight on.\n\nREPLAY VALUE - 8.4  GREAT  | Total War: Attila is a game that some may enjoy and some will still enjoy, it adds a new campaign placed near the pre-dark ages during the beginning of the falter of the Western Roman Empire. There are plenty of new things to work with in regards to the campaign and the custom battles, multiplayer and let's not forget the always fun to play with historical battles!\nThat being said in its currentl state Attila is based for expert players of the Total War series and those who know the true arts of war, the base difficulty is around the same as Legendary would be for Rome II and unless you wish to become infuriated at the fact your cities are getting sacked constantly I would choose to play on easy or at the most normal difficulties.\n\nI must say I had my doubt and I was like many unable to actually fix the dreaded logo screen crash, however using the CMD Prompt I was able to successfully fix my issue. I was still a bit cautious about this game because of the previous launch of ROME II however one things we all forgot to realize is that this engine is still run off the same one as ROME II and the mechanics are all the same with newly added features.\n\nThat being said I =  HIGHLY  Recommend this game.\n\n\n~ SF, Director of the VillianSyndicate, Owner of Total War Community (TWC), Developer of Dinosaur:BattleGrounds & LIFE OF ROME.","February 20, 2015","true","98.8"," 111 of 162 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","111","162","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/recommended/325610/","lummeck","John Lummeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lummeck/","22 products in account","During Steam's Black Friday sale, I decided to pick up some games by looking through my discovery queue and found... A Total War game! I was delighted, since I enjoyed Total War not too long ago, and so I bought Total War: ATTILA.\n\nI would soon be disappointed, as this is not in fact a proper Total War game. Set during the fall of Rome, when the Huns sweep across Europe from the East, it seems like the perfect era to be dramatised by Sega. It feels very different to other Total War games, thanks to the new GUI - which is actually quite nice when you get used to it. You view "Provinces", collections of cities, instead of just one city at a time. You gather influence within your faction by sneaking your cronies and family members into important positions. The graphics are great (if on a high-end computer) and instead of every soldier being an identical clone, there's a few appearances that really make a difference to immersion. The male-female ratio in armies is a bit unrealistic (while some barbarian cultures such as the Celts did allow women to fight, most didn't unless they were defending the village so an army wouldn't be quite the 50-50 gender ratio that this game portrays), but that's fine because it's just a game.\n\nWhen making a computer battle, you can tell it to fight in an offensive, defensive, or neutral manner which really helps when you're not in the mood for a battle. When you're in a battle, though, the units don't carry banners, just little floaty icons over their heads. I actually liked the banners, since it felt more immersive than "floaty icons".\n\nThe game however has one major fault - DLC. While some DLC is fine, like buying an extra campaign or maybe a bonus faction, there are limits. Sega has not only crossed the line but has attacked it wearing nothing but a pink clown wig and wielding a rusty chainsaw covered in obscene graffiti. You see, at least half the factions in the game are locked behind DLC, a situation termed by some "a bit much". You can purchase "culture packs" for seven euro, and get three or four factions with a similar culture. This is a lot of money for just unlocking content already in the game, and seriously most of the good factions are in culture packs. I love the Celts, because who doesn't love charging at the enemy butt naked and covered in blue paint, but in order to play as one Celtic faction I have to buy three.\n\nWhat's also ridiculous is that one of the DLC packs is a "Blood pack", or DLC to make your game gorier. The game has no blood without it and with it, or so I hear, people's heads explode when poked with spears. This is commonly referred to as "a scam", as a blood pack is something any semi-competent modder can achieve.\n\nBuying this game is not buying a full game but rather the skeleton of a game, which must be added to with precious, precious dosh.\n\nIn conclusion - play an older Total War game, even if the graphics are worse. Interestingly, the game was on sale for a "Make War, Not Love" event on Valentine's Day. Ladies/gents/hermaphrodites (delete as appropriate) if your boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other of indeterminate gender (delete as appropriate) buys you this game, you may want to reconsider your relationship.","February 28","false","7.4"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","55","71","8","0"

There's also the similarity of in Empire there were more scattered countries but in Napoleon there were more just main targets (Like France Britain I and Russia) with a few hard to get small countries. The same change between Rome and Atilla, Rome is a bunch of scattered countries while atilla really has as few big targets (The Huns and the Western/Eastern Romans). And in both game transitions they seem to focus one Faction or faction leader, Like France/Napoleon and the Huns/Atilla.

I've got 20 hours playing the game now; I've done several of the historical and custom battles and I'm on my first campaign as the Gaeti. The campaign is some of the most intense fun I've had with a Total War game to date. Unlike Rome II Total War, there's always something happening in the Attila Grand Campaign that holds my interest and nothing ever becomes boring or chore. The AI is improved and I've lost several battles already. I played one battle four times before I cracked it. The enemy entrenched himself on a forested hilltop, wouldn't come down and I was forced to storm up there with some really intense fighting as a result.\n\nThere are always new challenges. All of a sudden as you're fighting some minor neighbour, one of the great hordes close in on your borders and start burning neighbouring provinces (it's very visual!); you're forced to react quickly as you might be the next target, end the war with the minor and march in force to where the horde was last reported. It's really exciting and really atmoshperic! They've done an awesome job on the gloomy, apocalyptic atmosphere. You really feel like you're trying to guide and protect your people through some really dangerous times as disaster lurks behind every corner. Also, this game takes my mind back to the real Total War classics, like Rome 1 and Medieval 2; it also has clear references to and inspirations from another favourite game of mine, Crusader Kings II (which is a really good thing!).

I was super hyped to get it and actually had to struggle with Steam Support for one week due to my payment method screwing up. When I was finally able to play I was totally stoked. I didn't buy Rome II due to people complaining about it being unfinished and an unworthy sequel. When Attila was released, many reviews said it might not be worth the full price because it is very similar to Rome II, but it being the improved, more fluent version with a different setting. Since I didn't buy Rome II, I felt like I was on the good side buying this.\n\nWell... Apart from the game being too slow, needing a lot of turns to achieve something (especially economically), the  campaign AI is what makes my stomach turn and my heart hurt. I loved Medieval II and the AI was obviously far from perfect, but this? This is a disaster!\nEnemies that declare war on you don't show up in any way sometimes - leaving you stocking up your defences for no reason. Then again friendly states or trade partners trespass your borders without any notice, although the human player is so neatly informed that such an action might have diplomatic consequences. In this way, military access is basically worth nothing. Then, when they do not have a clear destination for some reason, they either end up marching to and fro on the campaign map until the cycle is broken through some outside force. If that's not what's happening, get used to the army doing the same sh*t for forever. When they do not move around, they simply raid any region they find themselves in; it is literally just as normal as trespassing without notice! No matter whether you are friend or foe, the right to raid seems impeccable. So get used to your allies or even vassals to raid your ♥♥♥ and cause economic and civic demise.\nThe other side to this is that enemies that DO actually invade you get stuck in that same action for years, leaving a fully stacked army for minimal effect.\n\nWhat's more is that the coding for sea travel or landing on shore is completely messed up as well. I had two enemy factions from the British isle trying to invade me with two fully stacked armies each, both lead by their high king -  too bad their admirals were too intellectually challenged to get to a coast line where the army can actually leave the ships. And that did not end, they remained on sea until I was done playing this alpha version of a game.\nMoreover, despite the fact that I love factions to be able to become a horde, abandon home and seek shelter in far away, possibly more fertile lands, everything described above concerning army movement on the campaign map also applies for hordes.\n\nAnd yet, a special place in hell be reserved for the people making the AI raze EVERY F♥CKING SETTLEMENT THEY CONQUER. Literally, I have not seen more than maybe five times that a nearby enemy would actually take over a city. They either sack it, meaning looting goods and getting immediate pay off for their victory, which is the best thing for you to happen since you can keep the settlement and simply repair damaged buildings; or they turn to their favorite habit of razing and thus destroying everything you have raised and invested in in so many weary turns. After a while, you will find that half of all the settlements were razed, leaving them desolate, which in turn requires a ridiculously high amount of money to re-establish - not to mention all the money needed for more advanced buildings. Thus, re-settling in a desolate region is actually incredibly unrewarding and strategically silly.\n\nI hope I could give you an idea as to how it feels playing this game right now. These are just the major flaws that drove me really mad, not mentioning the missing diversity between factions' units, buildings or simply their representatives (Western Roman Empire, Gauls, Brits, Roman and Western Roman Separatists have equally looking leaders; same goes for Eastern Roman Empire, Macedonia, Eastern Roman Separatists, Judea and possibly more, only played one campaign)...","March 6, 2015","false","25.3"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","44","55","5","2"

While it definitely shares mechanical similarities to Rome 2, it honestly feels like a completely different game. Both games should be played independantly, and for different reasons.\n\nRome 2 was very much an empire builder where the goal was to get as big as possible, Attila is definitely more of a survival game.\nAttila makes many improvements on Rome 2, such as obvious better visuals and improved anti-aliasing. Mechanically it is similar but the Campaign has many improvments including the Family Tree and more diplomacy options. These add to the complexity of the campaign gameplay. Battles are also much harder and have been reworked to be a bit more realistic. Units will route faster but will also return to the fight easier. Fatigue is also much more of an issue.\n\nIt has one main flaw, the lack of culture types. The game contains many factions from different parts of the known world, but we're missing Celtic, Slavic and Sarmatian units. Instead all Celts use Nordic units, Slavs use German units and Sarmatians use Hun units. It's a bit jarring and makes me miss the diversity of Rome 2, but I'm sure it'll improve in time with patches and DLC.\n\nOverall, Attila is a fantastic game, but it isn't a replacement for Rome 2. Both games should be played and enjoyed for different reasons.","February 22, 2015","true","636.2"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","56","76","2","0"

The graphics are impressive, and the battle mechanics are much more logical. They have fixed issues with archers and any ranged weapons being absurdly inaccurate to the point of not needing them. The new features allowing players to Raze cities is a good feature that certainly kicks dirt into your sworn enemies.\n\nHowever, the AI still cheats. Small nations can spam units, seemly immune to the lack of food. Agents with one star will tear down your nine star general in a max size army assisted by a five star agent of your own (Apparently it's statistically possible for enemy agents to succeed a 10% chance 8 times out of 10). Clearly from the unit rosters the Nations that you are intended to play to get the full Grand campaign experience are either the Huns, or either Roman nations (With Northern kingdoms added for extra flavour if you don't want to tackle the Huns). Except the Roman nations are seemly doomed to fail no matter how hard you try. But, that's due to unbalanced gameplay, rather then intended diffculty.\n\nDiplomacy may as well not exist. Usually I gather trade partners and allies at the start, yet just by advancing technology, and generally trying to use the features of the game you gain an unavoidable penalty, leaving the entire map against you. The only Nations I have on my side, leaving the majority at war with me are Nations I subjugated. AI doesn't really attempt realism at all. As I played with the Eastern Roman empire I had four stacks of Hunic armies sail directly from Spain, after ending the Western Empire, cross the full length of the Mediterrean Ocean with armies of Horse archers on ships, to deposit next to Alexandria the second I left to attempt a defense against no less then eight armies from the Sassanid Empire.\n\nThe Grand campaign seems to be following a programmed script, with events like declarations of war happening regardless of any effort you make. After the Barbarian Kingdoms Raze around 60% of the map, leaving a hard bill of 20000 currency to rebuild each of them from scratch, and the major kingdoms following predetermined orders to annihilate you, you will find the great empire you start with, over twenty cities, suffering from no food and constant rebellions, with a hot side of bankruptancy. You armies suffer attrition to such a degree that a full stack will have 10 people in each unit, with no hint of replenishment in sight.\n\nIn summary, if you want to play exactly as history occured, with the failure of the Roman empire (regardless of your efforts), and you like cheating AI that provides an artificial challenge, then buy this game. I don't recomend this game mostly because the Grand campaign is more like a long term scenario, instead of the real total war experience.","July 30, 2015","false","115.0"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","41","53","2","0"

Attila is honestly the only total war game since medieval 2 that I've been interested in enough to last through a whole campaign, but it still has its problems. Its a very different experience. Attila us more about survival than steamrolling, but unfortunately the only way CA came to present the apocalyptic world of the 5th century was by giving the huns wave after wave of free armies until you manage to  kill attila. I've also had an inordinate amount of trouble with rebellion which is compounded by the fact you're limited in the amount of armies you can field.

Release an incomplete game then slowly patch it, and then charge for the fixes and features that were originally promised, that everyone has wanted for so long, in the form of another 'darker' and more 'edgy' campaign, for $50. It's a cycle that they seem incapable of breaking.\n\nLure us in with a grandiose setting that everyone wants to play a campaign on - whether its the height of the Roman Empire or the Age of Sail, then release a stand alone expansion on a smaller map, with those completed features we want - the only difference this time is that Attila's map isnt smaller, in fact it's just the same map as Rome II with different (and more 'edgy' and 'darker') textures, to make it 'cool' and 'fresh'.\n\nOh, they have broken some things along the way though. A year of patching and polishing Rome II seem to have been forgotten. Balance has been thrown out of the window in Attila and battles are yet again very fast, more 'edgy' right? Darker? *Yawn*\n\nArmy variety and rosters? Don't even ask.... brittonic celts with 100% nordic armies in 395AD being the worst offender. "Viking Raiders" in 400AD? The rosters are simply not finished, ahistorical placeholders - this is very lazy, and very obnoxious (Of course, this will change with DLC packs). Rome II and previous titles took small bitesize liberties out of historical accuracy in the name of diversity and gameplay, Attila takes a sledgehammer to it and this I can not stand.\n\n\n\nRome II needs and deserves the politics, gameplay and user-interface improvements from the ATTILA campaign map. Let us not forget that the exact same 3d model faction screen and less-tablety interface improvements we are seeing in Attila were in fact seen long ago in Rome II development videos. Lets not beat around the bush, these were cut - we know it, CA knows it.\n\nCreative Assembly. Patch in these features that you have finally finished to Rome II.\nJust do it - I will even pay for it.\n\n\n\nConclusionWhat is Attila Total War? It's a 'fixed' Rome II that has been broken in a few places, in a more (I'll use it again) 'edgy' and 'darker' setting. Rome II with these fixes would be a FAR greater game.\n\nATTILA gets a thumb down from me not because it's a bad game, but because it's the only way I can express how disheartening it is to see all the fixes and features with a new price tag and fresh lick of paint. And it needs a lot of work too.

While BI for Rome 1 was sold as an expansion, Attila is sold as an stand alone expansion quite full priced. Granted you can buy it for about 24 € outside Steam - and legal too - at a lower price Attila is worth it and works out. What does not work out is the optimization.\n\nAttila is more demanding than Rome 2, but offers also better graphics, including MSAA, and more detailed units. While vanilla it looks like it is modded but it is not.\n\nAttila is Rome 2 2.5, without a year of patches. It is much better and whole, but still not worth a 8/10 that was given by the most of the reviewers.\n\nRome 2 was about civilized scam, Attila is about barbarian scum. Armchair generals will love it. Also the multiplayer works much better and fluid.\n\nI can recommend a buy but not full priced. Look for legal alternatives instead and be prepared you have to lower the graphical settings even on high end computers.\n\nCA officially explained that "extreme quality" is meant to be played on yet non-existent hardware. Yet 2 settings below that you still can find yourself embarrassed with low framerates.\n\nThis all has a high price though: People with AMD processors (not graphics cards) will suffer a lot as they did in Rome 2, on quality settings or below Attila becomes barely playable.

This feels like it could have easily been an expansion pack for Rome 2, many voices have been reused and the majority of the game's features are the same with the only main additions being the horde mechanic, religion and the razing of towns. If this was a £15 - £20 expansion pack it would be worth the price, the Westrn Empire is challanging, the new mechanics do add an interesting aspect to the game but releasing it as a full price game with it's own first day dlc feels extremely greedy and a little insulting.

In this game you pick up as the Roman Empire begins to crumble and the Huns are inmvading from the East. Blah, blah, blah. What we really have is an expansion of the Rome II game that the Creative Assembly wants us to pay full price for. And what do you get for your extra $45? Not much.\n\n• The same European map\n• Only 10 out of 56 playable factions\n• Basically the same gameplay\n• And of course the opportunity to pay for more DLC\n\nThere is a new feature that Attila adds: The ability to be a nomadic faction, or "hordes".  More than just fortifying your army, you become your own mobile city with buildings and such. It IS a cool new feature, but it only works if you don't own a city. Once you "settle" and quit migrating, that option is gone.\n\nThis is a better game than Rome II was at launch, but I for one am sick of buying basically a game skeleton and then having to buy all the pieces to play the full game. Just wait until everything is relesaed for Attila and buy the "Special Edition" with all the DLC.","February 18, 2015","false","157.4"," 163 of 267 people (61%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","61","163","267","20","19"

I can also say that Atilla is still just as fun and continues to bring in innovations to the Total War formula (hoards, razing and sacking without having to occupy, liberating dead factions, etc). The AI is also better, providing more of a challenge in battle and less unpredictability in diplomacy. No longer do I worry about friendly factions suddenly turning on me for no reason.\n\nSo all in all Atilla is a good game that I would recommend you play.\n\nHOWEVER: The only problem I have with it, is SEGAs pricing decisions, mainly to restrict content on first release that you must pay extra to unlock. Now I’m completely fine with developers continuing to release expansions for additional cost after they’ve released the game, as they obviously cost money to develop. However what offends me is selling a game and then deliberately withholding content for those not willing to pay a premium.\n\nAs far as i’m concerned, content that is in the initial release should be FULLY available to anyone who purchases the game. This is not something that has taken extra resources to develop, as you still play against the viking and celt factions. This is just a money grabbing scheme by SAGA to increase their profits.\n\nIf such factions genuinely would have cost enough to develop to effect the price of the final product, just sell the game at a marginally higher price if you must.\n\nI fear that this is part of an unfortunate trend in content limiting pricing policies. For example in Rome II, separate Greek factions were available with the release game, only to those who have pre-ordered. As well as another example of restricted content, it also disincentivizes a company to create a good game, so long as they can just market it well and generate hype to get enough orders up front. If the game turns out to be bad, they’ve already made their money.\n\nI can see how a small company may need pre-orders to generate some cash up front to help with development, or for high street shops so they can gage the number of hard copies to order in to avoid disappointment. But for a large company like SEGA on a digital platform there is no reason the require pre-orders. Collectables, development info, glossy maps/booklets, these are the sort of things that fans should get from pre-orders, not exclusive content that was created for the game in the first place.\n\nIn summary, people play hundreds and hundreds of hours on these games and, I believe, would be happy to pay slightly more for a good quality, full game as we would still be getting our money's worth compared to the average play time of an action game in the same price bracket.\n\nWhat I disagree with is not the price of the restricted content, but the principle","August 23, 2015","false","166.4"," 80 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","80","124","10","0"

I feel that it is poorly optimized and that the it doesnt feel like it lives up to the pricetag. The only new addition to Rome 2 is the horde system, which is entertaining but isnt a new concept as it was featured in Rome: Barbarian Invasion. Rome 2 Emporer edition is an empire builder, which is how total war games were meant to be played. Atilla is a survival game, and it just never seemed fun. There just isnt near as much content here as in previous titles. The unit variety is too scarce, and though i wont say the multiplayer is dead, Rome 1 has a larger multiplayer community. Also, with 2 DLCS at release, CA is just whoring content into the game that they clearly left out for DLC.

I would highly reccommend it for people that may be fans of the Total War franchise, or not.\n\nGameplay The gameplay in this game is great. It is very familiar to many fans of the Total War series, but it is also bringing in fresh, new elements that keep things from getting old and stale. One of my favorite features is a return of a well-loved feature; the family tree. It adds much more depth to diplomacy and makes things a lot more interesting on that side of the game. (A side I've had trouble getting into). They have added no aspects that make having a purley nomadic faction completely possible. The Huns for example, can not settle cities, they just go along, usually decimating cities and razing or sacking them as they do. I've gone through a very large portion of eastern and northern Europe in my Huns campaign. It is really great fun.\n\nGraphics and Sound Personally, I think the graphics are phenomenal, even on low specs thanks to my outdated computer. They are a large step up from the Rome 2 graphics which were actually pretty nasty as I look back upon it. There is an "Extreme" graphics setting which is intended for future GPU's to offer even better graphics for the future eras of PC gaming. Not even 980's can run the extreme graphics settings efficiently. The sound is pretty good. Nothing special, but good. My gripe with it is that they still use some of the same voices from Rome 2, namely the classic Barbarian guy voice that always shouts cliche barbarian insults and whatnot, but that is nothing too major.\n\nDifficulty Level This game is difficult. Simply put. It is a very challenging game. Earning money is hard, mustering enough troops to repel an invasion is hard, and just playing it is tough. I am playing as the Visigoths on normal in my main campaign and it was tough at first, but now it is pretty easy. The difficulty isn't too bad though. It doesn't make it so hard that the game isn't enjoyable *cough*dark souls*cough* (just kidding, it's a great game).\n\nI can't think of any other categories, so feel free to give me requests for what to put in, and I will oblige. Overall, I'd highly reccommend this game, and I'd say it's well worth $45.","February 20, 2015","true","64.8"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","43","61","2","0"

Ill tell you what I see when that happens I see intelligence a ai seeing its out gunned and with drawing and surviving instead of being slaughtered. Most of the complaints about this game I have seen are completely stupid complaints, "The games not balanced its not fair" as some of the trailers stated its not suppose to be fair, I want to fight a terrifying Hunnic horde one that makes me cry for my mama not some watered down hunnic horde that I smack down on my border. The familly tree system is great, the governer system is one of my favorite features, the foods system is much better fluctauting with winter and summer, the army system is great you must watch your army integrety a feature that was not shown in trailers that I saw but is a great one, if it gets low you can order 10% of your legion killed just like real romans did. This is truely a good game hopefully CA doesnt mess it up too much by DLC spam something that might help is maybe making blood and gore free to those who bought it for rome. All in all considering every major deatail I rate this a 8.5/10. Any nay sayers who tell you not to buy this game dont listen to them form your own educated opinion on this games most of these reveiws I have read from the nay sayers are completely false or just more complaining about Rome 2 some of them the stuff they complain about isnt even a major issue making the game have a bad rap when it deserve a good one.","February 21, 2015","true","433.7"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","41","58","2","0"

As soon as I began playing, the game made me sick. Even with a good computer set up, I still have trouble running this game in big battles on high quality. I wouldn't recommend this Total War game to someone who has a less than average PC, and loves graphics.\n\nThe AI in the game is still muffed up. There would be beach city battles that I would be defending and there is a high chance I will have to spend the sixty minutes waiting for the game to end, all because the AI refused to beach a unit.\nThe AI always magically knows where you are in the campaign, so there wont be much of a point in using guarilla warfare/ambush stance.\nThe auto-battle mechanic in the campaign is awful, in which I may have better tier/trained units than the enemy, who usually use tier 1 spearmen, but they magically still have the edge in winning the battle. This is bad as well because your allies are usually out numbered. Eventually it turns into a numbers game. Who can throw around the most troops wins. Not who has the best strategy.\nYour AI ally always makes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ decisions. For instance, I was the WRE and my ally, the ERE, was mainly in South Africa. This was somewhat later in the game. I sent a general and his army to help stop the Eastern invaders from pushing into South Africa. The point of no return was Alexandria, the spot we had to defend. Once my army got there, I place them in fortified stance. Everything was going smooth till the Eastern invaders arrived, immedialey the ERE AI took off from the defence leaving me to defend their own city by myself. If the ERE AI army was there, we would have easily beaten the Eastern Invaders back, but no, we got overran.\n\nI still have much to go on about. The game is addicting for what ever reason, and somehow I found it more interesting and fun to play versus Total War, Rome 2. The darker theme and setting in which the apocalypse is taking in due to Attila's reign across Europe.\nYou have a family tree and potential diplomatic marriage to work on, which can be helpful and fun to roleplay with.\nThankfully, the biggest and main reason I play total war is its mods. Without steam workshop I probably would never place Total War Attila. Radious makes the campaign fun to play as you can gain much better stats. Not only that, but Radious' unit mod finally brings diversity, which the vanilla units lacked.\n\nAbove all, without mods and steam workshop. I would NEVER play Total War Atilla.\nWith Steam Workshop, well from the hours I spend on it, you can tell for yourself.","January 27","false","064.1"," 46 of 67 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","46","67","4","0"

With fantastic additions to the strategic mechanics such as the new siege system where cities take damage every turn you're besieging them, the disease and sanitation system, the most welcome return of family trees and engaging political intrigue, it is by far the most complex and thus the most satisfying total war game to date.\n\nBUT... and there's a big but; the game is woefully unoptimized in tactical battles, the system requirements, minimum and recommended, are not representative of what you actually need at all. It makes it the most frustrating total war game to play for me, on the one hand you have the best strategic layer ever and technically the best tactical gameplay, but the tactical half is just ruined by insufficient optimization. After Rome 2 Emperor Edition I was highly anticipating Attila also getting the same treatment optimization-wise. It didn't happen. Right after they pushed out the last set of DLC, they moved right on to making Total War: Warhammer. So, much like Empire Total War, this leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth when I play it, knowing it has been abandoned before all the issues have been ironed out. No amount of excuses about how they were "future proofing" the game will satisfy me, the difference in performance between Rome 2 and Attila is like night and day and Rome 2 even looks better at times.

Maybe playing the huns themselves is an exception to this, but thatt's also fun because you march around as hordes razing every settlement, and can literally declare war on every single faction as you meet them and never negotiate a single peace treaty.\n\nThis brings me onto the new horde mechanics. For non-hun factions this is optional, and is generally used to relocate and settle somewhere else, which to me is a nice change from Rome 2 which makes the game - specially the start - feel more open and "free". If you feel like building a goth empire in Africa you can, and it's also viable to build one stemming form scandinavia. Dedicated horde play (normally as the huns) is a nice change from typical total war too - but the game is best spent building empires akin to old total wars, with the horde mechanics being a nice little option to have.\n\nSo what about the battles? Overall, they're more fun than Rome 2 in my opinion, but this is one area where Medieval 2 and Rome 1 feel better than both the latest games. The 2 main reasons for this are that firstly unit impacts stlll feel too soft and "un-impactful" (like Rome 2), and it still makes you wish cavalry charges felt like Rome 1 where they sent units flying. The second reason is something you can't quite explain - but there was a feel and quality of the old games which just felt "right". In Rome 1, each unit felt really different, cities felt large and battles felt epic. But, since Rome 2, TW battles became perhaps more polished, definitely better looking, but ultimately feel less rewarding. Also, charge infantry and shock cavalry are very strong in this game which makes battles kind of tactically one dimensional compared to Medieval 2, but this could be a good thing if you like fast paced charge battles or don't really care about battle tactics as much as hardcore Medieval 2 online battlers do.\n\nWithout being nostaligic, the campaign map still has the system of armies being undividable groups with a hard limit that's dictated by your "imperium". Some TW veterans hate this. However, it's simpler and easier to get into and that's perhaps their goal in making stuff like this, and being able to split armies like old would change the balancing of the game a lot. Ultimately, which system is better is down to preference, and for new TW players or people who liked Rome 2, this is no problem.\n\nOverall, then, this is a great game in it's own right, but it still has some of the flaws that Rome 2 had; mostly unit impacts and the feel of the battles not being as "epic" as old ones. It's a big improvement over Rome 2 in my opinion, and for people who have never played a TW game before this is a good one to start with. If only the battles still felt as "right" as Rome 1 this would be a 10/10 game - but the feel of the battles alone is probably why Rome 1 is such a legendary game. This isn't quite a legendary game but it's definitely a very good one.\n\nP.S. There are some DLC complaints from people and that's probably valid because it is like content which would have been in old games have to be paid to be unlocked now - but there's still hundreds of hours of gameplay even if you don't buy a single DLC.

Age of Charlemagne is a treat for those looking forward to Medieval 3.\n\nCons:\nStill a problem with "hidden income", i.e. CA doesn't understand difficulty, so they just fork in huge sums of extra money to give to all factions that aren't yours. One-city factions will be able to sustain 3-4 full stacks, as a result.\nNot only do minor factions get hidden income, but major factions do, as well. Expect to see the Persian Superpower of the Sassanids and their Vassal Fuccbois dominate the known world, if you don't play as the Sassys.\nLack of Diversity in Europe. Literally everyone is a Germanic tribe, with the exception of Britannia and the Slavs.\nFood is no longer universal, so you now have to build farms to support each province, which leads to building sanitation buildings to support those farms. Space you need is going to space you're forced to use to survive, in the long-term.\nPublic order is now harder to control, because of mass immigration (with no choice of building a wall), province-central food supply, religious differences, and a variety of other things.\nAll this DLC (that I still bought).\nAll this Free-LC (that I still downloaded).\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but if you're a definite Total War person, this game is for you.\n","February 29","false","414.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GinjaNinja1997/recommended/325610/","GinjaNinja1997","New Age Republic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GinjaNinja1997/","149 products in account","~Written 6 days after the game has come out for future reference~\n\nPositives:\n1) The battle AI seems generally improved. They flank with cavalry, go into spaced formation when shot at and have much better pathfinding. Also, they use their abilities more now.\n2) Politics has been reworked and now is quite in depth, though is slightly confusing at times. Characters can perform tasks such as looking for a wife or stealing funds.\n3) Unit upgrades have been added to all factions instead of just Rome from Rome II. Through tech your weak levy unit can eventually turn into quite decent units.\n4) The new siege mechanics of doing fire damage to inflict debuffs or maintaining seige for long enough to open holes in the enemy walls without having to have any seige equipment is useful and interesting, meaning you no linger have to seige them out for the whole 12 turns but can wait 7 and then swarm through the gap that opened up.\n\nNeutral:\n1) Morale seems either too powerful or too weak depending on the situation. Units rout very easily now, which on itself isn't bad, but by manipulating it you can really bully the AI. It rarely defends its general, and killing the general now seems to give a HUGE penalty to morale, so much so that I've seen entire stacks rout once their general dies. Helpful when attacking the AI, but it can be silly sometimes when your own army runs away despite still having full numbers because some unit fired a "whistling arrow" at you.\n2) Razing and sacking is an interesting mechanic which I want to like, and many do and I can see why, but for me it feels kinda pointless. Sacking gives lots of money and is great, but razing barely gives any money and wipes the town from the map, meaning you can't go back and loot it again and overall seems like a waste. Burning your own city to halt the AI or other players also doesn't work or make full sense, as armies don't attrition or take penalties for crossing desolate land, so that town you sacrified to create a buffer can just be walked straight past by hostile armies coming for your remaining places behind it. Plus, the AI is far too eager to raze places for no real reason. Cool mechanic and it has amazingly satisfying graphics when you do, but it just seems strange.\n3) Diplomacy is either hit or miss. The Eastern factions are all very friendly towards the Sassanids, but if you play anywhere else the other factions tend to hate you inherently. I suppose this is historically accurate, but your actions in game should shape the other nations opinions of you, not just entirely what has happened before you even began. Allies atleast don't seem to betray you.\n4) The addition of all the religions to the game is sweet and I really like it, but they seem mostly similar and the buffs are small. Celtic Paganism seems to be the best religion, but I only found that out by taking a risk and converting; the game doesn't tell you the benefits of each religion, so its a huge gamble unless you know what you're doing. Still, I like the feature, I just wish it was more important and you could see its influence on your soldiers in battle, maybe by having them shout specific lines such as the good old "BAAL HAMMON BE PRAISED!!!" if you convert to Minor Religions or "FOR TOUTATIS!" if you are a Celtic Pagan, especially as they must still have the audio files from Rome II. Religion specific units would be nice too, so we could see Naked Warriors, Christian Zealots, Beserkers and all other unique religious units.\n\nNegatives:\n1) Imperium seems to be locked to tech now, which makes little sense and can ruin your plans. Instead of you becoming more impressive and feared as you get bigger, you get more scary simply be having more techs. This might not sound bad, but when you are a measly village in East Poland who researches Goat Herding and suddenly the world declares you some form of super powered apocalypse it makes little sense. It will increase even if it is only civic tech, and the penalty for rising imperium is huge, so much so that anyone except the Sassanids will quickly find that all their neighbours now refuse to enter diplomacy with them due to the huge debuff to opinion. To stop everyone from hating you, you purposely need to stagnate your tech, meaning your buildings and units will be low tier unless you man up and tech up and face the consequences of learning the dreaded doomdevice know as BASIC SANITATION! THE HORROR!\n2) The AI seems to be ruggedly determined this time around. When war is declared, it will generally only end when one of you is dead. I've seen the Parthians off in the very east of the map bullet for 17 turns straight to Belgium to take out a wandering horde that entered loot stance in its land at the start of the game, and thats just once example. It will disregard its home situation and come straight for its opponent. This can often be seen the best with the East Romans, who will neglect their entire empire just to chase some 3 unit horde across Egypt. The effect seems doubled against human players too. I've seen that many players say that as the Huns, who start in Ukraine, all they've had is constant harrassment from the Ostragoths, who start in Greece. I've had this too, and they ignore the huge and ripe empire on their doorstep and rush straight to the middle of nowhere to attack you. It makes little sense and is actually quite annoying. Basically, the AI needs to learn priority rather than reckless agression, as it often screws itself in the process of trying to madrush whoever it doesn't like. Its funny when you are the Sassanids and can command your huge legions of vassal AI to swarm across the map for you, but everyother time, whether you're the migrating Geats in Morocco still being haunted by the Angles for no reason, or just one of the Romans watching your sister empire collapse as it runs off into the steppe, it will likely confuse and annoy you.\n3) The AI also seems to get a large, almost cheating bonus to its economy. Admittedly I play on Very Hard so it might be expected, but watching Youtubers and my friends on easier difficulties, as well as a coop campaign on Hard, the AI really must be magical. Very early in the game you will see 1 province minor nations toting 2 or sometimes 3 full stacks of units, including large amounts of mercs. By turn 5 no 1 province nation will likely have the economic power to do this, as the ai never optimises its buildings as a player would, and seen as villages only have at max 3 workable slots (The village itself takes one) and a food building is an absolute must to not have your army attritioning and even upkeep buildings, they either get a magic +200 food or +8000 a turn, possibly both. Its not so much of a problem as the armies are rarely filled with good units as the ai never builds good military recruitment buildings, but having 3 stacks sent at you from a tiny nation is strange nontheless, and if a coalition of AI attacks it can be almost comical to see 12 stacks arrive simultaneously to attack you. I've also noticed that the Celtic nations of Britain, as well as some German nations, don't take snow attrition even when not camped or fortified. Perhaps this is intended, but it seems strange when every player faction expect the Geats do.\n4) Being a migrating horde seems far better than being a settled power. Infact, you can even recruit much better units as a horde than you could as a settled faction at times, which seems off. Each horde army can build 10 buildings, while a city can build only 5 if you don't include the city itself, or even only 3 if it also has a port and a resource. So these hordes can economically outproduce settled civilizations, but it doesn't stop there. They can replenish anywhere simply by entering a stance that costs only 1/4 movement, recruit very elite men and don't have to deal with sanitation or unhappiness like a settled civ. It makes them fun to play, but also makes settled civs pointless.\n","February 23, 2015","true","108.9"," 51 of 77 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","51","77","4","2"

Now I'm not about to say that they are wrong or that you shouldn't tear this game apart for that. However I am going to say that this is by far one of the most detailed and fantastic Total War games I have ever played.\n\nHaving just gotten out of Rome 2 and prior to that Shogun 2 Fall of the Samurai with over 700 hours of gameplay between them I wanted a new experience and bought this game on the Lunar New Year sale of 2016 for a whooping $11.24, plus all the DLC for a total of $33.72 USD. Let me be clear this is probably the only way you should buy this game with the DLC, the base game has plenty to keep you interested but the DLC when it is not on sale is ridiculously over priced totalling $109.92 or an even more ridiculous $155.45 AUD.\n\nIn short, buy this game when it's on sale.\n\nNow looking past that this game is amazing, in terms of graphics it's engaging, violent and looks very alive and real. You also get introduced to a whole new level of faction control, a lot of common Total War mechanics like food, religion, your faction's generals and/or nobles as well as your city's infastructure have been revamped to include new levels of detail and challenges, pay special attention to what your religion offers you it can be important.\n\nThen there is the 'horde' mechanic wherein you can disband all your settlements and become a fully migratory faction which offers you the benefits of both a city, with a slightly limited recruitment roster, and the mobility of an army.\n\nOverall this game offers exceptional detail and of all the Total War games the by far best empire management gameplay; it is absolutely fun, the DLC is just too expensive.\n\nGet Age of Charlemagne though, it's amazing.","February 7","true","342.2"," 59 of 92 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","59","92","4","0"

This. It will not improve, because they just announced Total War: Warhammer.\n\nUnit control AI is RIDICULOUS now. It fails at pathfinding when you send in more than one unit at a time. Sieges are thus made obnoxiously hard.\n\nI appreciate  the fact that the grand strategy elements are a solid improvement over Rome 2's... But the AI in battle mode is blatantly worse than what they offered with Rome 2 Emperor Edition, and makes the game nigh-unplayable. I've stopped playing it, in fact, and will be getting back to Rome 2, despite the fact that the Horde mechanics actually make playing an underdog fun (In Grand Strategy mode)\n\nAlso, CA seriously underinvested in rosters. All of the breakaway factions look EXACTLY like their parent faction. Not only historically ludicrous, but also a blatant cashgrab. There are NO possible breakaway factions from the middle east. None whatsoever. You can't even liberate multiple settlements in a region belonging to a breakaway faction if you want to build up a strong ally. You didn't even offer us Arab factions as DLC.\n\nSo... Can't liberate the Graeco-Bactrians or Kushans from the Afrighids. Can't find a bunch of Greeks in the Sassanid Empire to put in charge of a renewed Seleucid Empire. And, to put salt in an already gaping wound, it wouldn't make any point, because all of the minor factions in the game are the same as the major factions.\n\nAll of the DLC is... Meaningless. There's no point to playing this game if you have Rome 2: Emperor Edition. None whatsoever. Get that instead. Despite its flaws, it's a better game with higher production values. I can't believe I paid full price for this piece of *ahem*.\n\nPlease, someone, kickstart a game that offers a better experience than this. I don't mind bad graphics, I really don't. What I do mind is the fact that Attila: Total War is nothing but a dress rehearsal that we, the dwindling fanbase of Total War, had to pay a pretty penny for, when it, like Rome 2: Emperor Edition, ought to have been made available for free or at least at a reduced price, as a concession to long-suffering fans who honestly wanted a game that would be good at launch and improve over time.\n\nI will not be buying Total War: Warhammer at launch. Not by a long shot. I will wait for at least a year before buying it, so  there will at least be proper AI mods and whatnot. This game is, like Rome 2 at launch, a black stain on the reputation of Creative Assembly. It's a travesty, and I cannot for the life of me imagine what CA thought when they released this game. Was it because they were pressured by Sega?\n\nYou screwed us over, CA, and it's pretty clear you're going to drop the ball pretty quickly, since this is a B-release. It was never intended to have the production values of a Rome or Medieval game. To make us pay full price for this travesty at launch was an insult to your fanbase, and you should probably switch publishers or self-publish. You've grown too big, too complacent.

Overall, the game is better than Rome 2 in my honest opinion.\n\nInstead of giving an arbitrary rating, I'm going to go into detail as to what I like and do not like throughout this review. If you're not interested in reading some blocks of text talking about the new features, you can skip to the end of this review and find a simple TL;DR section.\n\nI've been trying out the Nomad mechanics, which work fairly well - you own nothing beyond your armies, which act as cities themselves when 'set up' using a stance like fortify in the previous games. Nomadic 'cities' are more restricted economically and have a lack of defenses (none at all, if you get attacked while set up it'll be fought like any normal staged field battle).\n\nBeyond the Nomad mechanics, the game also appears to be harder than Rome 2. Better units will turn the tide of battle if used correctly, but even veteran soldiers can be crushed by peasants if you're unprepared. Combat is conisderably faster paced, making the slow down time and pause buttons more crucial for the more casual tacticians - if you don't know what you're doing, or miss even a small detail, you can watch as even the most stable stratergies go out of the window when troops manage to flank or break through your lines.\n\nThe family tree has been implemented nicely, basically in the same way as the previous games with better UI in my opinion. Long awaited in my eyes, I'm more than happy to see it back in the total war series, and not even a half-baked feature at that.\n\nThe UI has also been overhauled. I like the changes overall - initially a little off-putting because some stuff had been completely relocated but something\n\nOh, and then the desolation mechanic. I'm loving it - I burnt every city I passed by to the ground as I marched south as Hunnic armies chased me - the huns are somewhat unrelenting, something I feel the need to praise, as they chased me all the way into the mediterranean sea, where I found refugee on Krete - the huns apparently do not like water, and thus did not pursue. Many of the cities are still abandoned, years later, though the ERE has recovered some of them, rebuilding cities from the ruins.\n\nThe Huns can be rather... Dangerous. In my first campain, they've literally destroyed most of Europe and even most of North Africa in the process of chasing my Nomadic people from the Balkans all the way to Africa.\n\nSadly the doesn't have a great variety of playable factions. This is somewhat bad news as far as I'm concerned, especially after having seen the pre-order faction, Vikings, having a price tag of 10 bucks - if you buy this game and then get the DLC outside of any sales, you should expect to pay through the nose.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe Game adds a bunch of nicely integrated features that are far from half-baked. I'd argue this game is nothing more than a standalone expansion and the price is potentially a little steep (especially with the lack of factions), so unless you've got money burning a hole in your pocket, I'd suggest waiting for a sale - beyond that, I'd recommend it to any Total War fan.\n\nEDIT:\n18 hours of gameplay later...\n\nFactions. Oh dear. Overall, they failed to make the factions completely unique; most of the factions feature a generic 'Germanic' unit tree, with very few (usually a handful) if any unique factional units.\n\nThat isn't something I think is quite so great, but it *should* hopefully get fixed by players via modding. Sorta sad to see the devs take such a shortcut, but at least with modding it isn't going to be a permanent issue (but one people should be aware of prior to any substantial release of mods or changes made by the devs).\n\nP.S. Thanks for the game Hirovard! ;)","February 19, 2015","true","144.1"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","38","56","2","2"

It IS worth the money.. IF you don't own Rome 2 or if you don't expect drastic change.\nWhile I think this game is great so far I can only say that it seems like rome 2 but with a few extra additions. This could 100% have been a addon from Rome 2 (minus a few extra effect and additions the game made)\n\n\n\n\nNow you might ask "What changed"..let me tell you...\n-Lot's of Faction Diversity\nNow each Faction in Campaign and in battles have their Strong Suit.. Now you can argue that that has been in the game forever, but to the scale that it has increased since the last games has strongly improved. What might Work witht the Saxon (i.e Mass Melee Infantry) may not work with Huns (Reallly sucky Melee Infantry) and vice versa. There is lots of more pre-game planning now in my opinion.\n\n-Extremely good balance\nWhile some might say that Huns are completely op I say "Have you played or do you suck..." THere is NO ONE SUPER-Power Faction in this game. Everything CAN be countered. You just need to either time something right or setup the correct army or whatever you need to. For the most part, this is in my opinion the most balanced Total war in a while. (P.S. If anyone says that the game is unbalanced they are lieing. They just suck and probably don't know that Sword Infantry can't beat Horse Melee... that's like trying to destroy a tank with a rock... it doesn't work XD)\n\n-Seige\nThey took a mode I dared not play a second time on Rome 2 and made it into one of my favorite modes in this game. The escelation system is amazing (because I cried for it for years). That and the Barricade system is really intresting. You can divert forces by putting barricades in their way making them either try to destroy it or have to go on a path you set for them.\n\n\nThat's the biggest changes to the game, but there is one problem that I feel almost makes me not like the game (but I got over it fast.. but some might not)\n\n\nIT LOOKS VERY IDENTICAL TO ROME 2!!!\n\nWith all the changes they made it still seems to have a Rome 2 vibe and look. Trust me it will annoy you for a hour or two, then you should be fine. But for people looking for a game to look completely new. you might be a bit disapointed.\n\n\nBesides that issue there is little to nothing I don't like about this game... again, COULD have been a addon for Rome 2 in my opinion, but for the things they added it's worth the money.\n\nThanks and let me know what you thought of this Review...","February 17, 2015","true","6.2"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","27","37","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KommandantVideo/recommended/325610/","KommandantVideo","Guac Bowl Merchant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KommandantVideo/","65 products in account","It has potential to be the best Total War game to date. The campaign is incredible. To start off, CA not only restored the family tree, but remastered it, and integrated the politics from Rome 2 into it. Characters operate with influence, which represent how much political pull they have, which can be used to "convince" others to do things like embezzle money (That's right, you can get some more income on a turn through embezzlement), assassinate targets, and secure loyaly of certain characters who may have it out for your faction leader. Not only does this add a layer of immersion into the game, (I find myself actually caring about my generals, because they might go rogue if I don't secure their loyalty, or they could even orchestrate the assassination of my king) but it also adds some more stuff to do every turn, if you wish. However, if you don't want to do any of this stuff, you really don't need to. Political dilemmas will still pop up and alert you to take action should a character fall victim to an assassination plot, or should a character's loyalty become too low (in essence, you don't need to actually watch the tab at all. You can let it run it's course with little to no impact upon the granch scheme of things).\n\nIn addition to the reintroduction of the family tree, and building brower (it's fairly self-explanatory, however it was very clunky in the few previous total wars. In this installment, not only is it incredibly easy to access, but it's also very simple to view and understand), CA has added a completely new mechanic: The horde mechanic. You may argue that this isn't new, as there were horde factions in Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion, however this new horde mechanic is completely different. In Barbarian invasion, your men couldn't replenish, and you had no means of income short of sacking settlements. In this new installment of the Total War series, however, you can become a horde by starting as one through the 5 factions which begin in horde mode, choosing to migrate (which razes your settlements -- burned Earth policy) or by losing all of your cities and towns, yet still having an army. Once you enter horde mode, you will notice you have another tab in your army's troop viewer. It's buildings. That's right, you can construct buildings for training new troops in horde mode, for boosting replenishment, boosting income, boosting your army integrity (another new feature. This feature dictates your army's will to fight. If it drops too low, you will face a mutiny), and many other things. This is a huge step forward from the incredibly simple and unintuitive horde mechanic from Barbarian invasion.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are always cons to games, and they should be touched upon.\n\nThe multiplayer is great, and I've had a lot of fun with it so far, however the dominant factor in games is cavalry. Cavalry seems to be the end-all unit for almost any situation, certain shock cavalry units being capable of demolishing spear units. Missile units, save for crossbowmen, are all very disappointing and ineffective. In essense, the balance of the game is by far off, however that's fairly understandable for a game which, in this installment at least, had it's development heavily focusing on the new features of the campaign. Given just a few weeks time, I'm sure that CA will have sorted out some of the multiplayer balancing, and the game's multiplayer will be much more enjoyable. Not to say that it isn't -- army compostions are simply predictable.\n\nAnd the one thing everyone is probably looking through these reviews to find out about: optimization. I personally have a very low end computer, with a bad processor, however I can run this game almost flawlessly on the maximum peformance settings (aka low settings). Some huge battles (like 5 armies on the map in a campaign game) understandably, and that's just my computer, and a select few settlement battles lag. However, from a lot of the reading I've done, AMD processors have an incredibly hard time running this computer, even if they should be able to run it well. It's a bit of the Rome 2 case. It's important to make sure your drivers are properly updated, because that can make a difference... But the problem of optimization still remains. The beginning movie and the SEGA screen when the game starts both lag for me, and the music and background of the main screen (from which you select multiplayer, campaign, options, etc.) are choppy visually and audibly. This doesn't effect any battlefield gameplay, but I have read on the Total War official forums that people do have problems running the game when they share the symptoms I have. So I might be lucky.\n\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8.5/10\n\nThe game's new campaign features are incredibly fun and satisfying (boy it's fun to get away with embezzlement), and the game runs well for me. However it falls short in its multiplayer balance and optimization for people running AMD hardware.\n\nThis is a recommended purchase, especially if you can find it on a website for lower than $45. But even at $45 I'd call it a bargain. It's standalone DLC price, but with the quality of a AAA title.","February 20, 2015","true","102.9"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/I_am_Spartacvs/recommended/325610/","I_am_Spartacvs","Legionary Guard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/I_am_Spartacvs/","66 products in account","I'm gonna start this review by flat-out admitting that the only reason I forked over the $44.99 for this game is because my copy or Rome II: Total War (I refuse to refer to it as "Total War: Rome II") now refuses to load past the initial splash screen.\n\nThat being said, I did like the opening cinematics. The announcer, however, says "They made ready for war" and "The air was filled with whatever it was filled with" and "And behold, a red horse..." way too much/ I'm all for taglines and arc words, but this is a bit much.\n\nI started a campaign as the Eastern Roman Empire and noticed... very little of substance changed from Rome II. They added family trees back in, which is pretty okay in my book, but they seem fairly superfluous compared to Rome: Total War/Medieval II: Total War. So I started my campaign and immediately saw my cripping overextension, lack of secure borders, and F*cking Visigoths starting with two full stacks right outside Constantinople. All in all, not really unexpected considering that I started as Rome in the Volkerwanderung period.\n\nThe Visigoths, though, refused unilaterally to actually take my cities for themselves and settle down. They sacked the same village four times in a row, but never even tried for Serdica. And then they just kinda... walked off to my little brother's empire, leaving me scratching my head in bewilderment. As a side note: Persia will always declare war on you when Bahram dies and Khosrau ascends. Never before. Bahram is a bro, but Khosrau sucks ♥♥♥.\n\nOverall, the desperate straits that the Roman Empire faced aren't really accurately reflected in an Eastern campaign (I was able, with a minimum of fuss, to keep all my borders intact until 410 A.D., when the Sassanids sacked and burned Trebizond). The campaign AI is also very stupid, even in relation to other Total War titles. The Visigoths, I already covered, but the Huns - touted in-game as the scourge of all things bright and civilized - signed a full-blown military alliance with me for no good reason five turns in. Literally five turns in. I also waged a decade-long war against the Sassanids (That they somehow initiated without my notification, or chance to call my allies) that ended with me getting thousands of denarii in tribute, taking two entire provinces, and forcing the release of Armenia as a sovereign nation. The very next turn, they declared war on the Huns - who were my military allies and were, at that time, dicking around in Gothiscandza.\n\nI do, however, praise the battle AI. In one of the only Sassanid victories of that war, they marched 2.5 armies to engage my 2 full legions in battle. The Persians attacked in such a way that half their forces engaged my Third Cyrenaica and the other half cut off my reinforcing Second Traiana, so I basically had to literally fight two battles at once. I lost, but I gave more than I got and the battle ended with all five generals dead. Nevermind the fact that it clearly showed one Roman and one Sassanid commander remaining alive by the battle's end - I guess they committed dual-suicide at the end of the battle just to spite me?\n\nFactions also never seem to capture my minor settlements. They only ever sack or burn them. It also costs far too much to rebuild a destroyed settlement - I marched a 20-stack across the Danube into Dacia and the projected cost was somewhere around 10,000 denarii to rebuild. This on a budget of about 2,500 denarii per turn. As the Eastern Roman Empire. Creative Assembly needs to either lower the cost of settlement revuilding or lower the frequency of settlement destruction - I understand it was a barbaric time, but literally 2/3 of the map destroyed by 410 A.D. is a bit much.\n\nThis is a comparitevely minor quibble, but why is the Romano-British emergent faction named "Britain" instead of "Britannia" or "Romano-British?" All the other emergent WRE factions were named correctly - "Illyria," "Gaul," "Italia," et cetera - so why not that one? Most of the flags also look completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but that's subjective.\n\nI also find CA's strategy of charging us for factions that really should have been in the base game (If you're gonna put it out as a day-one DLC, there's really no excuse whatsoever to DLC it instead of core-game it), or for factions that are really just OP versions of vanilla factions (I'm looking at you, Viking Forefathers culture pack. Most of their units are OP versions of Saxon units). I'd say more on it, but I know I'm never gonna use the factions. I only ever use the two Romes, Sassanid Persia, and sometimes the Franks.\n\nAlso: Visigothic pike units are OP. I don't care what the stats say, there is no way that a bunch of half-naked migratory barbarians could fight off a Comitatanses unit while the Comitatanses is flanking it. Your Blood and Gore DLC as well. I shelled out three American Dollars for that thing and the blood doesn't even show up half the time. Most of the other half, it's a splotch here and there. I payed three good dollars to see gore, damnit, not some ♥♥♥♥ Spongebob would get away with!\n\nI really have nothing whatsoever to say about the religion aspect of the game, primarily because I didn't pay attention to it at all. If I didn't see a giant cross pop up whenever I clicked on Constantinople, I could've seriously forgotten that religion was a thing. In-game cinematics, while a good idea on paper, usually just tend to freeze up my computer for five minutes and the only thing that happens is Blood, Death, Making Ready For War, and Red Horses.\n\nAnd the Greek Fire. First of all, Greek Fire wasn't even invented yet, I don't think anyway, but I'm willing to excuse it by basis of it being Greek Fire, and thus Completely Awesome. What gets me is that every faction under the sun gets it when really, only the ERE and maybe the WRE should get access to it. Please CA: Fix Greek Fire. It's literally half the reason I picked the ERE at game start and I find out 30 turns in that anyone can use it. Talk about a downer.\n\nI also understand that you're probably using the name because most people don't realize that Byzantium and Rome are one and the same, but it's a little jarring and immersion-breaking seeing Byzantine Marines in a Dromon in the same fleet as Roman Marines in a Liburnian. Eastern Roman works just as well and doesn't kill my immersion. I payed 45 U.S. Dollars basically to play Byzantium (And a smattering of Persia/Franks) and you guys can't even get that much completely right.\n\nTechnology researching is pretty much exactly the same as it was in Shogun II and Rome II, so no quibbles on that department.\n\nAlso, most of the flags are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I have to say it twice.\n\nThere's probably some stuff I missed in this review, but there's my 2 cents at any rate.\n\nPizza-Sempai out.\n\nP.S.: I hate the unit quotes. Most of them are just R2:TW quotes with a more Christian context ("Hades can wait" is now "Heaven can wait.," etc.). The only unit quote I like from that game is the Comitatanses spears unit saying "Co-mi-ta-tan-ses" in that sexy, sexy accent.\n\nSo to recap, reasons to get the game: Sexy Comitatanses accents, Greek Fire, Byzantium, the ERE/WRE flags, and the Arcadius' name (And ONLY his name). Reasons to not get it: There is to tl;dr, read the review for yourself.","May 5, 2015","false","93.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","23","30","6","1"

Yes, CA are still ♥♥♥♥♥s and ofc I bought the blood & fire DLC - I accept that as humbly as one can. But the game it's self is perfect. It's not just a re-branded Rome II, it's entirely different in game play and strategy. Whilst set in the roman era, it includes familiar names and places which is nice, since the learning curve is already steep but with the implementations of all the factors that made Rome 1 enjoyable. I bought the game expecting to be a DLC for Rome II but what i got was a new, fresh game with all the fixes I could of asked for and more. If you're on the fence about this one, take the leap and get it already. Any total war fan would not be only be surprised how good this one is but also overwhelmed since expectations of the developer have been so low in recent years.\n\n9/10 (would 10/10 if not for blood & fire DLC)","July 4, 2015","true","351.2"," 112 of 189 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","112","189","8","9"

Playing Total War: Attila on easy feels like Rome 2 does on hard. If you are deciding between the two games, Attila is better, Rome 2 is easier and mostly stripped down with worse balance (Pikemen FTW).\n\nTW:A Looks better, is better balanced, has better internal politics, more rational diplomacy, more diversity between factions, the horde game mechanic, religions that give different benefits vs. unchangable cultures of Rome 2, and much more thinking-intensive situations as well. One wrong move and your faction could be totally obliterated before you even reach the point where you can stand up to the more belligerent foes.\n\nSo, where are the problems? Yes..DLC, but that isn't technically a gameplay issue that affects the game very heavily. The AI is much more of a problem, having the three modes of: brilliance, stupidity, and cheating. When the AI cheats it is just as bad as in Rome 2 and the AI can evicerate your full army with 4 units if you autoresolve, but that can be avoided by playing a battle (which is always better anyway).\n\nOverall: 8/10 - The game itself is fine and more of everything than Rome 2, lots of mods available, but quite a bit of overpriced DLC.","May 1","true","286.5"," 53 of 84 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","53","84","4","0"

Although the graphics settings were low and it was sometimes a tad laggy, it was still very much playable.  However, now since installing on my Mac (with far superior specs) I have had numerous problems.  DLC not showing in steam library (but showing in game) is the least of my worries.  Once I have loaded the game I find it impossible to start a new save with any faction, without the game encountering an "unexpected error" and crashing.  Attila is quite literally unplayable for a number of people, particularly Mac users, though upon checking the TW forums I see that a number of Windows players are encountering problems with crashing after the latest updates.\n\nMy advice: don't waste your time and money.  Until CA decide to pull their fingers out and iron out these problems, the game is literally unplayable for a number of people.  The support from CA is literally non-existent, so I, and no doubt many others, are likely to be sat here in the dark trying suggestions of fixes from other gamers (that have yet to work) and hoping that the problem will be fixed by the next update; whenever that is.

This game returns to the roots of the original Total War, and makes more inovations to the series and RTS genre than any other game in the Total War Series.\n\nCampaign\n-----------\n+ Weather is dynamic and strong winters have the potential to wipe out entire armies\n+ Great Migrant and Barbarian Horde factions roam the map sacking settlements and razing entire provinces\n+ Ships and Land Units travel realistically. The powerful viking navies will be restricted to travel through currents\n+ Britain is now a 4 way warzone between Vikings, Celts, Romans, and Barbarian Tribes\n+ Legendary Challenges trying to set up new kingdoms over a devastated Europe (by the time Atilla takes power in 422 over 100 regions will be razed and uninhabitable)\n+ Moderate sized factions can produce a dozen armies over time\n+ A new war economy allows any faction to make 100,000's quickly solely off of warfare alone\n+ Sacking cities yields nearly double the gold it did in Rome II, with perks allowing even greater loot\n+ You can now conscript captives into your armies after a battle to replenish numbers\n+ After a battle, you can sell captives back to their faction for money\n+ Integrity system has a major role on how your armies and legions operate in foreign lands. They are more likely to do dishonarable things, like hold off on giving you loot and raiding lands, if you let their integrity fall to low\n+ You can decimate legions in order to restore integrity\n+ The map has been extended to include more parts of modern day Russia\n+ As civilization begins to fall, new factions will quickly arise such as Britain, Gaul, Pontus, Macedonia, Illyria, ect.\n+ Armies, Cities, and Characters can be renamed. For example, you can take Constantinople and rename it Byzantium\n+ Capitals now exist which support certain buildings exclusive to the province\n+ New Architecture can be found on the map including the wall seperating the Picts from civilized Britain\n+ Land fertility FINALLY exists. Not all land produces the same amount of crops\n+ Barbarian societies do not have military chains. Instead, regular building chains allow unit recruitment\n\n- They took away northern Afghanistan from the campaign map (for those who want to play as Indo-Greeks)\n- It is very difficult to create a trade powerhouse, unlike other Total War games\n- Resources have less strategic importance, mostly as a result of the decline of trading\n- The devastation of the campaign map, combined with the extremely high costs of colonization, makes expansion drudgingly slow.\n\nUnique Campaign Battlefields\n--------------------------------\n+ Certain cities, fields, towns, and ports are custom designed by CA and can't be encountered twice on the campaign map (see below)\n* The Nile\n* The Tiber\n* Black Sea (specific area)\n* Cap Bon (specific area)\n* Mediterannian (specific area)\n* Abarsharar\n* Ancyra\n* Caesaria Euesabia\n* Casurgis\n* Constantinople\n* Corduba\n* Ctesiphon\n* Edessa\n* Kath\n* Londinum\n* Ravenna\n* Roma\n* Tuessis\n* Abursis\n* Vesontio\n* Zafar\n* Alia Capitonia\n* Asturica\n* Belz\n* Domavia\n* Harev\n* Hira\n* Iconium\n* Payttakaran\n* Petrodava\n* Siscia\n* Turonum\n* Virunum\n* 5 different unique land battles which can be encountered on the map\n* 8 different unique port cities (cannot access the list)\n\n+ The unique campaign battlefield modification will likely inspire mods for the other cities not designed by CA\n\n- The price to pay for all these unique cities and towns is that generic city maps off the list reoccur more often than Rome II\n\nBattle\n-------\n+ Units have more abilities and formations\n+ Units now spread out during engagements and pick targets, reminescient of the duels that took place in Shogun\n+ Cities and Towns can be completely destroyed and devastated during the course of a battle\n+ Defensive Positions now exist in sieges which can yield negative effects on the enemy if taken\n+ Barricades now exist in town and city battles\n+ Less units than Rome II, but they are more specialized and unique\n+ Second tier units no longer look like lazy reskins\n+ Civilians occupy battlefields. They will either skirmish your troops, run for safety, or huddle up to be slaughtered\n+ Artillery Barges with high ammunition allow you to devastate any coastal city with zero loss of life (in retrospect this can annoy some people)\n+ Pikes and spears are no longer unrealistically OP against melee troops\n+ Melee troops will fall back naturally on your spear units without having to order them to do so\n+ Fear and Morale has a greater impact on the course of a battle than the actual fighting. Vikings and Huns can rout entire legions by massive use of fire and shock tactics\n+ While exploiting defensive formations is still possible, a concentrated force can break a tightly compact formation without losing 90% of the army. This is the greatest improvement of the game.\n+ While minor factions can still produce hordes, the new realistic unit stats make it so a  levy is not balanced with a Roman cohor.\n+ The alliance setting will color enemies based on their allegiance as either a player, ally, or enemy\n+ Kill animations!\n\n- The morale effects of devasting a city during battle are slightly OP. An elite unit with high morale will lose 1/3 of his attack and defense if the city is in ruins.\n- The only units which can defend a barricade are archers. Spears are incapable of stabbing units horded around the fortification\n- The defenses in siege battles are oddly positioned. There are archer towers in the most vunerable places, and never near the town hall, capitol, or millitary camps where it is most defensible.\n- Combat could still use some work in areas. Without mods, many units will still kill by swinging their sword into the air.\n- It would be nice if you had some decent pike units to counter the Steppe tribes. Pikes are not overpowered in this game, but I still believe their abscense is a result of complaints from Rome II.\n\nReligion\n---------\n+ There are many new religions such as Latin Christianity, Greek Christianity, Graeco-Roman Paganism, Germanic Paganism, Celtic Paganism, Zoroasteranism, Manachiesm, and Tengri.\n+ Each religion has its own chain of buildings\n+ Priest units are back\n+ When 30% of your population worships a non-state religion, you can convert to that religion\n\n- There is no incentive to be a certain religion besides reducing discontent and improving relationships, since most building chains operate with the same rewards\n\nPolitical System\n-----------------\n+ There are now three new political meters. Dominion, Control, and Power.\n+ Dominion is the loyalty and control you have over your statesman, generals, and office holders\n+ Control is your popularity and influence in the senate or tribal council\n+ Power is the combination of your dominion and control. Being to weak will cause internal factions to try and rise up the ranks, while being to powerful will cause resentment and campaign penalties\n\n+ Intrique returns greater than ever. Every character in your faction, which is usually around 40 midgame, has a certain amount of loyalty, influence, and ambitionb. Unloyal characters will try to defect from your faction, or work against you on the political scene. Influence is a currency system which grows based on a characters office, and allows them to commit intriques. Characters with high gravitas, which represents power, are more ambitious, and will try to cheat their way into office, or even the throne.\n\n+ The new intriques include\n* Assasination\n* Secure Loyalty\n* Arrange Marriage\n* Divorce\n* Seek Wife\n* Diminish Popularity\n* Adopt\n* Become Retainer\n* Embezzle Funds\n* Gather Support","May 5, 2015","true","44.3"," 54 of 86 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","54","86","5","4"

However does that really stop a great game?  I have clocked in at over 300 hours playing this game and have bought every DLC.  Sofar, my experiance has been amazing and I am still spending countless hours playing the campaign.\n\nThe good :)\n\n- Many different factions to chose from.\n- Large campaign map.\n- Steam workshop and Assembly Kit.\n- Huge replayability.\n- Decent price if on sale.\n- Lots of DLCs.\n- Challenging gameplay.\n- Solid RTS features in the battle map.\n- Cool checklist feature when you end your turn so you don't miss anyting.\n- Nice "FreeLCs" that include new factions.\n- White huns help balance the Sassanids.\n- In touch developer.\n\nThe bad :(\n- Pricy\n- Bland color pallete.\n- AI loves to raze your settlements.\n- Blood and Burning should not cost as much as it does.\n- Calvery needs to be fixed, they will plow through a brick wall and keep going.\n- It is way too hard to convert religions.\n- Resettling is way too expensive.\n- Sasanids are LOADED and there is no way to kill them.\n- Western Roman Empire has almost no chance of survival if you're not an expert player.\n- Units for the Germanic factions are pretty much a copy-paste.\n- Huns f*** everything up.\n- Not able to change your faction name.\n- Not able to change your capital city.\n- Desert kingdoms faction has pretty much all copy-paste units.\n- Slavs are really diappointing in the sense that their kingdoms are just really spread out.\n\nMods:\n\nHere are my thoughts on the mod base for Attila.  Unlike it's Roman counterpart (Total War Rome II), Attila shows a severe lack of campaign mods.  I'm talking about real campaign mods, not the crap that unlocks new factions, I mean the ones that completely cange start position and make custom factions.  There are a few good ones, such as Antiquitas Posterior: Clovis - Origino Europae and Terminus Total War - Ageless Empires, but mostly these mods are hit or miss.  Attila does feature some interesting mods that alter features such as No Squalor for Farms, Sebidee's Unlimited Governors, United Roman Empire, Double Garrisons, Natural Water Mod and Lower Converson.  These mods are quite nice and really add to the gameplay experiance.  DLC Mods are also good, especially for Age of Charlemagne.\n\nExperiance:\nStarted up game and giddily watched cutscene.\nDecided it would be a good idea to be Western Romans because Roma Invicta.\nAfter about 25 minutes of expanding my cities and electing governers ends turn.\nFranks break agreements and immediatly start marching to your lands.\nBarbarian kingdoms start moving towards your lands.\nAfrican kingdoms capture every settlement in Africa.\nHuns declare war.\n10 settlements are razed by multiple different hoards across your lands.\n20 more settlements are sacked by more hoards.\nAll of the Spanish peninsula is taken by rebels.\nTurn 2\nThe empire is in ruins and the Goths are migrating across the eastern part.\nDecides to be smart and take a strategic aproach to this.\nGifts all hoards land and give them gifts until they are military allies.\nMake peace with the huns.\nSend all of my armies back to Italy to guard Rome.\nBuild up my infastructure in Italy and continue to watch the world burn around me.\nEventually build up enough money to resettle much of my lost empire.\nReconqure Hispania.\nBetray my germanic allies and the Eastern Empire until I rule the world.\nThe Sasanids then come and f*** everything up.\nI was eventually reduced down to only one city in the Spanish peninsula and was forced into subjugation.\nWaited for the Sasanids to become weak.\nBuilt up a max army.\nPushed back against the Sasanids.\nRetook much of  my old empire.\nSubjugated the Sasanids.\nLooked up from computer.\n3 days had passed.\n\n11/10 would waste my life again.","December 21, 2015","true","556.1"," 50 of 79 people (63%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","63","50","79","17","13"

About performance there is a long story to tell. I have AMD machine (PC specs: AMD FX-8350 4.0 Ghz, 2xR9 290x  4gb, 32gb ram) and my average fps is 22.2. I also tried playing on my friend intel pc (PC specs i5 4690k 3.9 Ghz, GeForce GTX 980 4gb and 16gb ram) and average fps is 30.5. Fps is tested on all graphic qualities (graphic qualities mean nothing in this game because you wont get fps boost by switching graphic qualities).\n\nSo i dont recommend this game if you want polished Total War game. Rather buy ROME 2 + you wont have broken multiplayer like in ATTILA. I own this game almost 1 year and CA didnt nothing about performance they just rush DLC to make money. Only good DLC for this game is Empires of Sand Culture Pack other dlcs are just reskined and boring factions. Campaign dlc like Age Of Charlemagne is example how bad dlc should look :D reskined units and no voice change (Frankish Kingdom they use Roman accent check more about that on youtube). Now Total War Warhammer is coming and they wont focus on ATTILA anymore and game wont get patched anymore.

But the game is so annoyingly bugged and unbalanced that it's better to wait for a patch.\n\nTried playing as Jutes first round. Within a couple of turns Brittania declares war and parks a fully equiped, only heavy units army in my area, and does nothing.. just sits there.. this while their homeland is destroyed and conquered, but apparently thats not an incentive to return home. In the meantime you stand no chance because you can only recruit amazingly weak levy units until you research some tech, which takes at least 30 turns until you got some the right ones. You may stand a small chance in a def. siege battle, but like i said the ai does noting but sitting out of range and fortify. So i was stuck/bored and decided to try again.\n\nSecond round the Angles declarded war early on and parked TWO bloody armies in my territory.. doing nothing.. just standing there.. doing nothing.. just waving their middlefingers gently in the air. And because you can field and substain only 1 levy army you, again, stand no chance and you're stuck.\n\nAlso migraiting = instant bankruptcy. And for some reason the game randomly freezes when it's my turn.\n\nin short: PATCHPATCHPATCHPATCHPATCHPATCHPATCHPATCH\n\n**edit**\n\nOther things:\n\n- AI spams raze button. In the time that Attila arrived, the whole of europa was a smoldering wastland with only 15% of its regions inhabitat.\n- Even on normal/hard neutral states, Allies and tribute stats from al over the world randomly declare war, even if you have a good relation with them. Example: i played the Eastern Roman Empire and out of the blue the Ebdanians, who i had a trade agreement with, declare war (they're in modern Ireland).\n\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC'S already coming out even before they released a patch, ♥♥♥♥ing10 euro for 3 factions who's code was already in the game.

But the thing is with this is just, it's just that if you just put the other factions into this game it might just have made more people happier with the corperation and this gaming seires, now don't get me wrong here, it's a OK game, but it's not fantastic, with those who didn't even purchase the dlcs so you could get more people to play as you get 4 factions to place with, thats it 4, it gets a little repetitive, and boring as every gameplay you do is either similar to your last or you just so happened did what you did last time playing this game, now there are factors that i enjoyed in this game though, 1 would be the survialbility aspect to the game, wanting to survive Attila, that atleast gives you something to look forward to, but when it came after like 897 turns it felt to expected, not very intertaining, something that was just to easy to predict, so in the end I'd say if you would want to get this game really I'd wait till it's on sale, for instance ROME II was for sale for 17.97 last time there was a sale, and for the DLC never purchase them unless they are like 1.00 because honestly it's just overpriced and not worth paying 7+ dollars for something they should of just added to the game in the first place","March 1, 2015","false","327.1"," 69 of 114 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","69","114","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunafish91/recommended/325610/","tunafish91","Dat Tuna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunafish91/","193 products in account","So after the catastrophe that was the release of Rome 2 everyones wanting to know if this is better. Well, I think getting run over is better than Rome 2's release, so obviously it is better. Rome 2 did get fixed up but it took a hell of a long time to get it right. But yes, this is better than Rome 2.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nIn fact, the campaign is absolutely fantastic, it's got the best atmosphere of any total war game I've played, obviously I am likely to edit this review as I sink more hours into the game, so far my first campaign as the Geats (a DLC Viking faction) has been enjoyable, sailing around, plundering wealthy coastal settlements and generally not giving a f*ck (stealing money, send it to strengthen my capital and smoke weed everyday).\n\nHowever, I dabbled a little bit with the other factions campaigns and there is a so much diversity in the general feel of each group of factions. You can feel playing as the Romans that their days are numbered and it's damage control from the get go, the  Sassanids are the new big power and are ready to rise up and become a dominant force and replace the old, frail empires in the west. The barbarian tribes have a fight for survival, scrabbling to hold their lands against the behemoths that are both Roman Empires, but the threat of hordes coming and destroying your lands and your people is ever constant, so you always have a lot to think about. The hordes are well, hordes. You are what keeps the 'civilised' people awake at night, especially as the Huns who can't settle, only loot and raze.\n\nSieges are an absolute delight as well, the defenders being able to craft barricades in the street really adds another dimension, the fire spreading throughout the city is great to watch, while the defeneders have the strategic advantage behind their walls and barricades, fire weakens their stats and morale, creating a better balance of gameplay. Each main faction looks great as well, this belongs in the bad section but since Im already talking about it I should mention that some of the unplayable barbarian factions are too similar, there's absolutely nothing to distinguish them from each other apart from their faction sigil. However the Roman soldiers look great, a far cry from the glorious looking legionaires you had in Rome 2, these legionaries are much uglier and darker (but in a good way).\n\nThe family tree is a welcome return, however it doesn't cast off everything that Rome 2 implemented, taking some of the good things like influence and political occurences. What was a disorganised mess, but a good idea in rome 2 has now been refined to something which is much easier to get to grips with.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nMainly technical, but the one gameplay flaw I can spot right now is the razing mechanic, while it is a great thing they've put in the game, once you raze a settlement, the land in that province is now classed as 'desolate' and inhospitable. This certainly is an interesting mechanic though I fear that as a campaign progresses there is a danger of too many places becoming 'desolate' and there being not enough towns and cities to take. This is yet to be seen of course but it seems all too likely a problem.\n\nTime between turns is unforgivably long, I've gone and made a nice brew (cuppa tea for you Americans) in the time it takes for turns to finish. Not to mention loading times for battles are huge. Once it gets going, its great, but have a book with you to read between turns, perhaps an encyclopedia on Roman history?\n\nGraphics optimisation is once again, poor. I can run Rome 2 fairly well at medium-high settings but it's very difficult to run this game anything higher than low settings. This wouldn't have bothered me so much if there was an increase in visual quality but it all looks the same as Rome 2, albeit a bit more brown, dark and gritty. For so little difference in visuals yet a huge decrease in performance it really is an irritating situation. Check your specs before going into it to make sure you're able to run it well as on low settings it does look pretty pants.\n\nTechnical issues aside, the game has fantastic gameplay mechanics and is a bloody good job by CA.\n\nSo far I'd give this an 8/10, great work.","February 17, 2015","true","380.2"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","25","35","0","3"

I have a minimum of 10 hours on games like empire... and hundreds and hundreds of hours on games I really enjoyed, like Shogun II and Medieval II (and Rome II after the Emperor Edition...) So obviously I have had a lot of experience with the games. But good as those games were, they have nothing on Attila. Now, I find it a bit of a stretch to say it is the best total war game yet, but if it isn't, then what is? Medieval II was great, but it's time is past. The graphics are almost painful to play with in this age where technology is so advanced. Attila is just a step forward in so many directions, it's ridiculous. The graphics are slightly better than Rome II, and certainly better than any other TW game. The campaign mechanics are phenomenal, they bring all the good parts of past campaigns back, and add in new, better parts. For example, the horde mechanic is SO fun to play as. You can lay waste to the empires, and there is a small chance the nation will be able to deal with you as they have many problems on their hands. However, they are still a force to be reckoned with and you'd better run if they come your way.\nAlso, the battle mechanics are amazing! the seiges are AWESOME and each city has stellar work put in to it to make it unique, ending the problem in Rome II how every city in a district looked the same, making defensive seiges very, VERY boring. But even the random cities in Attila have been changed. Also, Attila has finally dealt with a problem in all tw games... the damaging affects of the battle on the terrain. Now, everything you do can affect the battlefield; from accidentally (or purposefully) burning down a forest to scorching the earth with your catapults. No other Tw game has come even close to this (I'm not counting Rome II's pathetic attempt where trees with brun for a couple seconds then fizzle out).\nThere are a few problems, however; things they removed that I didn't appreciate. For some reason CA thought it would be a good idea to remove the bar at the end of a battle that showed you how many kills you got. This is not a problem in 1v1, but in 2+v2+ games, especially multiplayer, it removes a sense of achievement; that you cant figure out who had the most kills. CA, if you are reading this, PLEASE ADD IT BACK IN!!! Also a minor problem, they removed the function to duplicate units in custom battle. This is a really small problem however, and the amount of Pro's in the game overwhelm the small problems I have. GREAT JOB CA!!! I think this is hands down an amazing game and I recomend you buy it.\n\n-Arthur Wellesley, The Duke of Wellington","February 18, 2015","true","64.7"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","27","39","4","1"

I have tried both the osrogoths and eastern roman empire thus far and both are far more engaging then anything in Rome 2. This isnot to say there are not some problems or at least unusual things that can happen. For example as the eastern roman empire i have a serious problem with pictish raiders around Antioch. I don't know if this could be called a bug in AI behaviour or if it is simpily inevitable if the picts run out of enemies in britain. There are a number of definate bugs in the game but these are generally very minor and one has to remember that the game was just released and there will be much tweaking by CA down the line. For instance, on a certain minor town map if the invaders attack from the east, their General tend to get caught in a fence and be unable to move to the southh east. Also cavalry seem unsure about what to do when faced with barracades, often charging up to it before turning and moving out of missile range before running back. Civilian behaviour could also use a tweak as sometimes they niether flee nor fight and simpily ignore opponents. That said the game is ,by and large, very good it is very challenging and engrossing. 9/10","February 20, 2015","true","863.8"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","33","50","0","0"

Personally i prefer ATTILA over Rome 2 for many reasons. Some of those reasons is that the cinematics are back! Good Mideval 2 Total War cinematics that are back along with the family tree that has been missing for some time.\n\n\nPolitics have exploded in this game. Feels much more like Crusaders Kings 2 politics with the internal family and then the other nobles. Marriages now are important in that they secure alliances which bonds neighbors. Most of all the politics is something actually needed to be kept in order unless if you want to lose your control after a couple turns.\n\n\nBattles do feel very different, i will not lie some issues are abroad. Morale seems to be a factor which needs to be worked upon in my view. Battles do not last a few minutes anymore and can actually stretch for a long time. The various maps in which you play on are countless and will not stay the same for each playthrough.\n\n\nSieges are completely new. Actual siege towers and ladders needing to be used! I know right! Unlike ATTILA's predecessor, sieges are very hard now and the walls make a huge difference. Your archers will barely even scratch those on the wall until you smash them down using Onagers or some other siege equipment.\n\n\nSo after reading all this you may guess i reccomend right? Well i do and i don't. This game at its current state is very difficult and the AI is too good for new guys to just hop in. For gameplay? Yes i do reccomend if you enjoy a good strategy game which now has so many new features.\n\n\n\nWell thanks guys for asking and here is my insight for you all.","February 19, 2015","true","135.1"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","31","47","0","6"

Not one bit. They are just accurately reflecting the cutthroat reality of dark age business. Attila ravaged Europe, and 1600 years later, CA ravaged my wallet.\n\nAllow me to explain why it’s fitting that Creative Assembly chose the era of Attila for their latest installment of the Total War series. After years of painstaking historical research, I have come to the conclusion that CA based their pricing model on common dark age business practices. There is a tale, for instance, of High King Schwarzenegger, a Gothic monarch of the Conan tribe, who purchased a sword but only received a hilt. When the king complained about the hilt that he paid full price for, the smith told him that blades were sold separately and that if the king wanted a scabbard, that too would require another purchase. Awhile later, when the king dressed for battle, his squires fitted him with some leather padding, but when the king called for his chainmail, he was told that he needed to pay for that separately and that each sleeve, the headpiece, and the full chest arrangement would be forged over the next few months and then put up for sale as optional content. King Schwarzenegger, now fed up with the whole process, and with his credit card thoroughly maxed out, called for his horse. He would ride into battle naked. When the squires wheeled in the king's horse on a cart without a head and hooves, the king shouted out, "Hasta la vista, baby!" He then attempted to commit seppuku by falling on his sword, but was disappointed to discover that it's impossible to stab yourself with just a hilt.\n\nIt was this kind of desperation, ladies and gentleman, that drove the high king to make a movie as monumentally bad as ‘Kindergarten Cop’. And it was this kind of desperation that led us well-intentioned strategy gamers to spend $80 on such an incredibly realistic dark age business simulator.\n","September 12, 2015","true","11.5"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","61","47","77","54","0"

Its not just that you can't spot enemy forces in cover, but that without terrible scout units you end up with the enemy not being visible until they are 20-30 meters in front of your troops in open terrain, or until you're already being shot at from hills/walls.\n\n- Influence/Control; Good idea, poorly executed. It can be aboslute struggle if you want to maintain loyalty, integrity, higher influence than rivals, and if completely neglected, doesn't affect the overall game.\n\n- DLCs released within 2 weeks of game release? GTFOH, Squeezing the teet for every drop. These are all factions that should have been included with the game release - and now that theres new units ect that are released with it means even if you dont want to play those factions you still need to purchase them just so you get to play with ungimped nations. Disgusting abuse of the gamers which is soft coming from a guy who thought $3 for 'Blood' in a video game was the most idiotic thing ever.\n\n- Lack of unit diversity; while the vast number of factions (I think campaign starts with almost 60) is great, the unit diversity is weak for most factions. Vikings a 'dlc' faction has only a handful of unique unit types(everyone has around the same spearmen/melee/calvary which are parallelly upgraded through the tech tree). While there are 60 factions there's only around 6 base unit rosters (Roman - African/Middleastern - Nomadic - Germanic - Nordic - Barbarian.\n\n- Graphics; despite the mixed reviews I think they are reasonably solid, most reviewers are right though, there has been a lack of improvement in the last 4 years since Shogun 2 and frame issues even with the highest end cards is a little overboard (running 2x GTX 970s)\n\n- Unit Fatigue; straight up needs a change, units cannot sprint for very long at all before they are tired, you can get though 50 meters and they're winded/tired which with the short and unrealistic spotting range makes manuvering for a hun calvary charge that just 'pops up' in that empty grassland 20 meters from your troops a huge disadvantage.\n\nAll in all its still a solid game, with some pros and alot of cons compared to former releases. The cons some of which I hope will be changed by mods very soon. I definitely dont think the Total War series is going in the right direction, having played every single total war release since the Kenshins of S:TW. These DLC's, lack of effort into creative story or an interest in changing to a new venue or engine makes it all feel lazy and more and more like TW is going down a cash grab track instead of releasing quality products the way it did with the original Rome TW and Shogun 2. Both titles were in their time revolutionary strategy releases.\n\nThe multiple transactions for factions/blood ect that should be apart of the game to begin with is really driving me away from this publisher. TWO PURCHASABLE DLC WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF RELASES MEANS THAT CONTENT SHOULDVE BEEN A PART OF THE GAME.","March 1, 2015","false","140.2"," 45 of 74 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","45","74","0","2"

It boasts better gameplay mechanics, a 'smarter' AI, a more immersive campaign, and better graphics. However, the  game still contains quite some bugs, especially when it comes to multiplayer stability. Bugs which were originally included in Rome II (but were fixed later on) suddenly make a reappearance in ATTILA. Examples include: The game crashing after a NPC initiates a battle, sound cutting off, leaving you with nothing but sillence, or desyncs (especially the desyncs).\nI've played Rome II for 380 hours, which does not quallify me as a master strategist. However, I did experience the whole 'broken launch', and all the patches afterwards. Rome II has come a long way since its launch, with the final Emperor's Edition being excellently playable. I find it dissapointing to see these long patched bugs reappear in ATTILA. Let's be serious here, a (real time strategy) game shouldn't crash whenever an enemy attacks you.\n\nGamebreaking or not, let's keep the bugs on the sideline here, and move on to the AI.\nIn the Total War series the AI is a large, if not crucial part of the game, with the campaign consisting almost entirely out of computer controlled factions. I am aware of the fact that it is nearly impossible to make an AI truly sophisticated, although Shogun II came pretty far, but the AI in ATTILA seems to have lowered the standards even more by its ridiculous obsession over barricades.\nLet be support this statement with an example: Whenever you deploy a barricade in a settlement, and the AI comes near it, the AI will go full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in its attempt to destroy the barricade. This can be incredibly useful, because it gives you some time to reposition your units, but it is NOT (really? not?) what a 'master strategist AI' should do.\nThe AI still seems to favor suicide charges over camping, which was probably coded to prevent the notorious 'hillcamping' from Shogun II. I will give credits to the campaign AI however, as they really manage to f*ck me up the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game also has some performance issues, mainly when it comes to the graphics side.\nI know, I know, "this game is designed for future GPU's", but that doesn't ratify the frame drops when rendering shadows, especially in the campaign map. And why does this game only detect 3 gigabytes of VRAM in my GTX 970?\nWith the rather mediocre FPS i'm getting on max. quallity (33 FPS on average) I certainly could have made use of that extra gigabyte of memory.\n\nWhen you remove all these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs, performance issues or AI incompetence, you are left with an incredibly fun game. I'm certain that Total War: ATTILA is the best of what the Total War series has to offer right now, with lots and lots of refined content. However, I cannot recommend this game for what it is now: a rather broken mess of barricade-chasing morons with popping shadows. I certainly recommend you to buy this game whenever these problems are fixed.\n\n","February 27, 2015","false","21.0"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","24","36","0","0"

I say this as someone who finished Rome 2 out of sheer spite, pouring 150 hours into hate-beating the sequel to my favorite game of all time. This looks like Rome 2. It even has DLC like Rome 2. But the fundamental game is tighter and more compelling. I WANTED to play it.\n\nIs it Rome 1 or Shogun 2? No, it's not. It's still kind of sprawling, and lacks the focus of these high points.\nIs it possible to win a siege defense by sitting out at bay for half the battle, then hiding in trees with a single unit while the AI ♥♥♥♥♥ its pants? Sure. But CA at least TRIED to fix this stuff.\nIs the game secretly a fiscal responsibility simulator with some armies thrown in for good measure? Yes, I guess it is, a little bit.\n\nThe naval game fits well into the ground game. The whole thing really feels like total war, with the razing of entire provinces. And it's the little things, like how the province erupts into flames, or the civilians in a besieged city run around in panic. It's the blood and guts and the way that the AI actually fields halfway decent fighting forces, or at the very least armies that look impressive while you roll them over.\n\nIt's not a Paradox game, but I can't hold that against a Total War entry. It's a Total War game, and a damn fine one at that. It's a shame that some reviewers with DLC axes to grind have relegated this to the dustbin of "mixed" user reviews, because if you like giant campaign maps that zoom down into little orgies of human destruction, this game's a winner.","January 22","true","467.7"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","25","38","4","3"

I couldn't even get a decent time record on this game, it's just not worth it.\n\nOn top of that, CA Seems to be intent on bleeding us dry of our money by adding barely enough features to call it a new game.

If you're looking to forge an unstoppable empire and assert cultural authority across the entirety of the campaign map, do not get this game.\n\nIn past TW titles, you are the architect of an empire the world will never forget. Attila does not ask for this. Instead, your aim is to survive until a certain date. This particularly applies to sedentary factions like West/East Rome. If you wish to play as anyone else, you will be given missions to loot and plunder regions, as opposed to conquer them. Of course, should you choose to conquer, there is an option for that. But unlike its predecessors, incorporating a recently conquered region doesn't reap the same benefits as it used to. In Attila, you're usually left with a city lacking in food and/or sanitation. You'll find yourself pouring more money into rebuilding its infrastructure and economy than creating armies. Whether you feel this is worth it is up to you, but personally, the incentive is lacking.\n\nNow, here's the nit and grit.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Return of the family tree\n- Refined political mechanics (you actually have to start caring about your generals and statesmen or they might mutiny)\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Concise UI, tech trees and building trees\n- Ability to raze regions (helpful if you want extra dough, or to keep enemies from occupying as fertility is extremely downgraded)\n- VIKINGS GOD DAMN IT!\n- Archer units are actually useful now\n- Noticeable AI improvements both in battle and on the campaign map (though, CA still has a lot of work to do in this department)\n- Community still as great as ever!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Huns are OP, they literally spawn out of nowhere (how the hell is this fair CA!?)\n- Lack of unit variations for barbarian armies. Actually no - just a lack of units in general.\n- Essentially Rome II with mods and texture skins\n- Why is everything on fire. We get it, Rome was dying, but Europe wasn't s*** on by Satan.\n- DLC clusterf*** (blame SEGA, not CA)\n- Battles are far too quick, so I would suggest a quick trip to the workshop as there are plenty of fixes. Play the campaign for a few hours, see what you want and don't want, then tailor to suit your desires.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game to any TW or Strategy game enthusiasts, but if you spend enough time modding Rome II you'll have a better game there instead.

Buy this game, you won't regret it. Pros and Cons are already explained in other reviews. I write this review to explain the way AI cheats and the infamous DLCs.\n\nFirst of all, AI did cheat in every Total War game, be it economically or in the battlefield. If you have played a campaign on Normal/Normal difficulites(which is the most equal one) - and of course assuming that you know how to play on campaing and battlefield - you can see that it is super easy and the game gets boring as hell. Take 5 settlements, have a good army that can not be defeated and that's it. You won, the other factions stand no chance and you face no challanges. This is because AI can not think as a human being and if we were to expect AI to think and play as a human being, we would dream in a really stupid way. So, to make the game more challenging, AI cheats in a way that does not always break the game.\n\nAnd about the DLCs, I don't see a company that releases a game without DLCs. They all differ, but they just try to take your money with different additions to the main game that we all know they have planned or already prepared. So this is clearly the way the companies make their games. Unfortunately, complaining about this will not change anything. The game is not incomplete as many people say just because there are some faction DLCs. We have all the factions that feels different available already. What do you want to play as? Longbeards? Or the other Germanic factions around them? None of them feel much different than the Franks. Same religion, same roster excluding a few units, same starting location, same future enemies. Nordic fations? Same as Saxons. I would complain if they made WRE as a DLC faction, but the DLC factions are cleary not so much exciting. You don't feel like you missed something just because you didn't play as Longbeards. It is like complaining because in Rome Total War, Numidia is not available. Who cares? We have the Huns, WRE, ERE, Sassanids, Saxons, Franks and all of migrating factions. My point is that, you don't need the DLCs to enjoy the game and you don't miss anything just because you didn't buy them.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is really better than Rome2 TW EE and in my opinion, better than all the other Total War games and I played them since Medieval Total War. DLC factions worth nothing, you don't miss anything by not buying them. AI is improved in many ways but don't expect much. The game feels more challenging than any Total War game on Legendary and as long as you know how to play, cheating AI will not kill the game. But if you want to make it more equal, you can always make your difficulty Normal/Normal. Once again, if you like Rome 2 TW EE don't hesitate, you will like this game even more.","March 5, 2015","true","387.0"," 87 of 154 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","87","154","2","0"

Splitting the game into a number of DLC and selling them to us separately is a thing I would have never have suspected. Even after buying all the DLC the game does not feel as complete as others. When you compare the unit roster to that of Medieval 2 you only have enough units to populate 2 or 3 factions. Nearly all the units are re-named re-textured copies of each other that seem to re-use assets from previous games.\n\nThere have been several improvements over Rome 2 that make it fun. The fire system is great. The way that towns actually get feel like they get destroyed rather than just have a few buildings knocked down. The migratory factions are a great addition but all in all it feels like a $15 expansion to Rome 2 with a few additions and a new campaign. I still like the additions the game made and aside from the re-using assets it is a truly great game but I can't forgive CA all the DLC crap trying to get just a little more money.

Hence shifty marketing.\n-Diplomancy, AI refuse peace even when they are down to their last city unless they ask you and sometimes they will declare war for no reason even if they are far weaker then your faction.\n-Imperium is horrible, you end up with -80 diplomancy penalties with other factions even if you only have 1 city.\n\nI would avoid it until steam workshop becomes available and they make the DLC free.\n\nUpdate 29/06/2015\n\nThe pay wall is still there for the factions that are 'DLC' when they are in fact apart of the vanilla game and you have to pay to see blood and gore, the AI has not improved and still cheats.

It isn’t revolutionary; it doesn’t change the real-time or grand strategy genre as we know it. What it DOES do is provide a fun and engrossing continuation of the Total War series in an extremely interesting time period of mankind’s history. The core of the gameplay is still great fun, albeit a little repetitive at the later stages of campaign play. There are some nice, if small improvements to the latest instalment of the Total War series. Long-time Total War fans will enjoy the new factions, new horde and diplomacy mechanics and the new units of this fascinating historical period.\n\nSome people criticise Creative Assembly for releasing Attila with day 1 faction DLC, and the limited number of factions playable for the base game. These critiques may have merit, but unfortunately the DLC model is well established and here to stay. Let us be thankful that Creative Assembly is releasing more mini-campaign DLC alongside the faction DLCs. Again, your experience might be different, but I have been pleasantly surprised at the lack of major bugs in the Attila release. It was very refreshing after the troublesome release of Rome 2. I almost didn’t pre-order Attila, but I am VERY glad I did. It has proven to be an amazing game. The one-more-turn-itis of Attila is strong, and has led to me racking up a cool 110 hours of the game since it was released only 3 weeks ago. Yes, the developers do need to tweak some aspects of the game but the core is solid and most important of all – FUN!!\n\nI highly recommend this title to both Total War veteran and new-comers alike. Attila Total War fills a niche in the strategy market – it has elements of grand strategy - without the super detailed management of games like Civilization, Europa Universalis and the like; as well as the real-time strategy element sure to appease history buffs, aspiring tacticians and people who just want to see big groups of men charge into other big groups of men and hack them to pieces!\n\nCheck out the full detailed review with awesome pictures!! @ http://gamoha.eu/review-total-war-attila/","March 13, 2015","true","372.6"," 71 of 126 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","71","126","2","3"

Especially Campaign is a big step forward. In previous versions campaigns were easy, no real issues and A.I. did nothing really well planned. Now this is a diffrent story.\n\nWhat I like the most(I played mostly Eastern Roman Empire):\n-Charactes have longer lives. Faction leader in ERE lives for 200+ turns.\n-Battles: NICE imo\n-A.I. is much smarter and province management is much harder. As it should be. You need to pick regions with good fertility and build a lot of farms and other infrastructure there, def. at any cost. Rapid expansion and then keeping the teritory is now EXTREMELY hard, you need to have very strong economy and food production at home. If you don't, then you can start praying, you will burn in rebelion. You get attacks from all sides, barbarians razing and DESOLATING your land in the west, sassanids and their ~10 BFF on the east and unfriendly africans in North Africa hurting you like crazy. Diplomacy actually became super important, even deciding factor for your sole existance.\n-Research tree is very nice, both economy and military side have some interesting stuff and makes you think very hard what to decide.\n-I love Eastern Roman Empire campaign :)\n\nAs for hordes, they seem ok, still I spent 90% of my gametime playing ERE. And this "review" is for Total War: Attila and not for its DLCs.\nBy the way, CA. DLCs that cost 7,49€ are an insult to me. 7,49€ FOR SOMETHING THAT IS MORE OR LESS ALREADY ON MY HARD DRIVE! You need to put like 0 effort in and you make me pay that much. It seems like your sales people are completely clueless or do they really think they can sell me DLC that offers so little for so much money? And it seems you want to sell me like 10 DLCs like that to have full game experience? No thanks.\nThe sole idea of selling DLCs like that is very greedy in my opinion, but if you have to practice it I think 1 faction unlock is worth maximum around 1€. We would miss on one bag of chips and not complain too much while you laugh at your free money. And not ♥♥♥♥♥ 7,49€ .\n\nBtw I would love to pay for expansion that adds some new factions that are on map that is ADDED to the one in existing campaign. Extended map on the east with new factions there up to India, added Africa (what could have been, some factions that can maybe someday conquer Europe, it can be done np), even added America with Mayans, Apache etc. etc. with only connection to Europe and Asia on the north side, etc. etc. Get your developers to work and do something cool, so you can stop insulting us with these pathetic DLCs :)\n","April 27, 2015","true","274.5"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","36","61","4","4"

The game has barely been out a month and they are already up to three DLC packs... ridiculous.\nI would not recommend this game as it is clearly a cash-in on Total War: Rome 2, (perhaps Rome 2 focused on the rise of Rome, this focuses on its decline).","March 18, 2015","false","34.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/325610/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","I'd like to mention first, that if there was a "so and so" option along with Yes and No, I'd most likely pick it.\n\nJudging by the reviews people left after the release of Rome II, Attila's been really improved: A few new features, no major bugs, and so on. But, should the latest Total War title be compared to the failure of its predecessor, or should it be put next to the Emperor Edition of said predecessor?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that Rome should have been released the way the EE was, in the first place. Next to the latter, Attila's not so shiny. The graphics don't really look like they were improved (at least, from my pov), and as everybody would expect, any other aspect of the game needed little improvement and was left the way it was. Now, we've got the point at which one should ask himself: what is the point of this game?\n\nIn my opinion, it is merely to make money, and the DLC grab we've seen since the release is the proof of that. Who the hell would even release a game of which the strongest feature is realism in battle, with a paid DLC that adds blood, gore and vomit? Why have people grown to consider it normal? I have a job like most people above 18, and yeah I pay off the blood DLC in about 25 minutes at work, but if we don't get off this trail we'll end up having scale armour DLC's, Tier 3 units DLC's, Factions pack DL-oh wait, we've got that already!\n\nThe only thing I can praise CA for, is the fact that they spent some time on making decent Unit rosters for the "barbaric factions". As I've always picked germanic or gaulish civlisations in games set in the antiquity or the middle ages, it was really ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating to face endless hordes of your same own units, that all look the same between them. Playing as the Arverni, I had to kill off a dozen gallic tribes with identical soldiers to mine, obviously made of 5 or 6 different kind of units. Same when I started with the Suebi. The Roman Army could boast about 119 different unit types, something that I partly understand due to the fact that most were auxiliarii, but shall I mention the romans could sport gladiators, elephants, and special 'barbaric' units? In order to have a real fun I had to rely on modders that expanded some of the factions' rosters. I'll never thank Sebidee enough for his amazing work. By the way, in Attila every faction has a decently sized roster, and sports units of all tiers (unlike on Rome II were germanic factions had weak units only thus having to rely on sheer numbers), as well as soldiers unique to the faction itself. The only thing that sucks is that some types are really outdated and wear questionable armour (by which I also mean some don't wear any but pants). Dear Creative Assembly: no, there is no evidence germanic peoples fought bare chested in the late antiquity-early middle ages. Use of leather, scale and mail armour was extensive, and less wealthy warriors wore padded or plain jacks.\n\nSo finally, the reason I'm upvoting/recommending this game on a whole, is that it is a nice work (out of the context of SEGA forcing CA to release a game every year with a massive DLC grabbing) and a fairly enjoyable title. The setting has already bored a lot of people, as I could read on several reviews and talking to acquaintances; though personally I really like it. If you're in love with the Early Middle Ages, the rise of Christianity (or the Pagan resistance if you prefer), or just if you hate the Romans like I do: buy this game*.\n\n*I still advise buying during sales, or off steam. Considering the work CA had to do to make Attila out of Rome II EE, the game should be sold for half of its present-day price (€40).","April 27, 2015","true","120.0"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","34","58","3","11"

After Rome 2 this game feels like everything that Rome should have been.\n\nVisually the game has imorived by adding a fire mechanic and a siege escalation that brings some life to the cities and sieges. Watching building burn and fire spreading thru ought the city is deffinitely something to see, its that extra immersion you really appreciate.\nOn a game play side, the AI is performing much better than before, tho not perfect, the politics system has more depth to it that Rome 2, but still not to the level we wanted. The return of the family tree is much appreciated.\nThe food system has been drastically overhauled definitely adding a lot more strategy to province management, specialization of provences isn't easy like in Rome 2 and definitely equires a bit of planning.\nAnother small but useful change is making all the provinces have three regions.\n\nIn my campaign on Very Hard as Himyar I found it challening to expand into Egypt and squaring off against the Eastern Romans,  many battles had to be fought before I could get a single settlement and the AI moved its armies in strategic ways that actually withheld me frrom going forward, something that impressed me.\nPublic order isnt that easy to manage either, before I could go on my conquering rampage maintaining region control was important, while defending the same territory from the AI armies.\nPlaying in Europe is like racing against the clock in preperation for the Huns and if you can't stop em, then you better move, a sense of tension that is really engaging.\n\nAgents are still very important but not as OP as in ROME 2, Spies definitely got nerfed and you won't see alot of poisining going on which I am ok with.\n\nAll in all the game requires more strategic thought than before wether you play as a nomadic tribe or not and that is something I appreciate.\n\nThere are still somethings that could have been done better and more features could have been added, diplomacy is still the same as before and I would really like the re-introduction of region trades but its probably not happening, AI is good but nor perfect but overall the positives far outweigh the negatives.\n\nThe game gets a solid 9/10 as both a Total War game and a strategy game.","June 3","true","66.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Whatever course of action the AI takes it leaves there lines in a total mess and you just surround them or slaughter them in some way. In a nutshell the game look really really good but the actual game play is terrible as the AI is so ♥♥♥♥ you just cant have fun owning the AIs mass chaotic blob every 2 seconds.

As you may have heard people complaining about the dlc's so early on in the game. But lets start with the good and the bad.\n\nPros:\n- The game keeps you between a good mix of war and political matters and disputes meaning if you just ignore your political issues your faction will fall into despair. And if you don't have enough troops you will surely fall in battle\n\n- The AI aren't pushovers they will destroy you completely if you do not pay attention to what you are doing.\n\n- It combines the right sense of, Oh no my high king is becoming a bad king we must assassinate him and that guy is in a weak vulnerable position lets decimate him.\n\nCons:\n- As said before day 1 dlc's but I dont mind the game didn't cost 60$ when it came out like most new games, But it may be worse off for people not blowing money on games constantly\n\n- The AI are so good you will most likely die multiple times before ruling the world\n\n- Needs more bacon\n\n- If you use mac it probably wont work\n\n\nReview Continued :\n\nAfter several hours I have found myself growing more strategic. Going from the simple I need to defend my land to I need to use guerilla warfare even though im a newb to it. The farther in game you get the farther you will realize peace is far from your door step and the only choice is to push forward.\n\nAt times you may feel outnumbered or completely beaten. But at those times you must fight. Fight for your peoples lives even if the numbers are against you and you will defeat your enemies and make them run.\n\nWith that said this game has changed my perspective on strategy and I really enjoy it. But if your buying it get it off a keys website. The dlc cost next to nothing on a key website and the game can be up to half price depending on your country.","March 4, 2015","true","355.5"," 32 of 55 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","32","55","2","0"

If you loved Shogun 2 and the past Total War games but felt let down by Rome II, you should go pick this game up ASAP. Rome II felt way to arcadey for me, the seiges sucked, They took out the family trree from Shogun2, the battles felt underwhelming, the ai stunk, the launch was not very good and it just wasn't alot of fun to play for me personally.\n\nI was waiting to see some videos and hear the TW communities opinion on Attila and what I have seen and heard has been very positive so I had to buy the game a bit after release. The UI is improved and so much more that I will go into below.\n\nThe Family Tree from Shogun 2 is back and it is even better than ever with even more depth. The seiges and battles in general feel more satisfying and with more strategy involved. This here feels like the TW I have come to love over the years and makes me forget about Rome II and my distaste for it.\n\nCA deserves alot of praise for listening to the community for this game, alot of the things that have been improved or added since Rome II was stuff I had seen the community talk about and stuff I had been dissapointed with. It is wonderful to see CA listen to the fans and make a much better game. I don't need anymore hours in this game to know that I enjoy it, we have our Total War back at full strength people!\n\nThere is a few issues such as the high requirements for the higher settings and some of the bugs, but overall it is a very good release, especially compared to Rome II on release. If you liked all of the TW games up until Rome II, pick this up ASAP. Even if you liked Rome II, pick this up, for me this is CA on the top of there game and it brings back memories from Shogun 2 and past TW games.

I love the TW series with all of my heart.\n\nAttila is, for me, the best iteration since Medieval 2 - it's a great game, it really is, BUT....\n\nIn roughly 20 days, 3 culture pack DLC's have been released at 7.5 euros each. Content, which should have been in at release. To be honest the games one shortcoming is it's lack of playable factions. And it seems this is because they plan on milking everyone with culture pack after culture pack.\n\nI would no longer recommend Attila as you're going to end up paying 60+ euros to get the full experience at this point. Probably, within a few months we're talking 100+ euros. And it's not worth anywhere near this. If you couple this with the fact that the gamemechanics that make TW games truly good, are just as good or better in the older games - i would reccomend you to get Medieval 2 +expansions for way less(or Empire/Shogun 2). Also, the older releases have very polished overhauls/mods available from communitysites that vastly increase their quality/value.\n\nIf you're really hooked on Attila wait till it goes on sale for below 15, or you can get it with all DLC's for 30 or under.","March 25, 2015","false","398.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The only issue with this is that your army can get so terribly weak that a unit with 30 melee attack can be at much less than half of its strength at the BEGINING of a battle. Another issue is that if you are playing with battle limits and you are defending, a viable strategy might be to wait inside a walled settlement and see if the enemy come in range. This is useful when facing a much larger army but if that army does not want to come to you and the time limit nears completion, the smaller army will face a morale loss and may even route and run outside the walls to their deaths without your command. wonderful.\n\nLegendary start position This is probably the hardest start position i have ever played across any total war game. It is incredibly hard since you are completely open to nomads and you may not even be able to field enough armies to fight them off.\n\nOverhauled game mechanics You remember that cool civil war you fought in Rome 2? Mine only lasted about 3 turns but hey it was a suprise. See the issue here is that if you fight one civil war you will probably fight two or three more pretty damn soon. The loyalty system requires you to spend gravitas to keep people in line but since you lose gravitas you also lose control and thus suffer negative penalties. You spend gravitas to avoid penalties but spending gravitas gains penalties. yup. Would have been a cool thing if it wasnt done so oddly. I just adopt everyone so their is only one family and then hey whatever man. ill never look at that page again.\n\nIncredible period detail  This is true for a little while but the issue is that this is history, remember when all of italy became a barren wasteland that is no where near fertile? the entire east became near uninhabitable when the rot grasped the land? No? well that incredible period detail only lasts a little while. No matter how long you play things will only get worse and never better so food is definitely a large worry.\n\nOutstanding visual fidelity they did truly do something lovely here. They made a graphics setting that is meant for the future. You guessed it, instead of fleshing out the game for the present they made settings for the future. So in 3 years when your computer is good enough to play on the best settings you will have no new content left to play unless you are willing to buy 15 dollars worth of content that could have been in the game. One of my favorite childhood games was dynasty warriors, i remember vividly having to actually beat the game to unlock content. Now its so much better that i get to buy stuff i already payed for to play the game i bought.\n\nAll in all if you like old total war games you may like this one, You really are going to get upset at CA though. If you are new to total war maybe you wanna look at an older one. It wont be as pretty but you will have more to do.","March 25, 2015","false","119.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you're torn between purchasing Attila or Rome II then I would suggest this is the better title with much more involving campaign map gameplay/mechanics than the rather bland vanilla Rome II. Alternately if you already own Rome II then thanks to the ever brilliant mod community supporting it, it makes more sense to catch this on a sale. Attila will be a truer test- provided some of the hardest campaigns to date- for budding generals whichever faction they choose to lead; which should stretch to trying out the Viking DLC only- in my opinion- as they provide the more interesting faction traits and gameplay in relation to how campaign events pan out compared to the other faction packs. All this has culminated in Attila riding down and mercilessly clawing back the "just one more turn" mentality that was seemingly beginning to fade from the series.","August 30, 2015","true","53.5"," 45 of 80 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","45","80","0","2"

I tried so hard to make myself believe that it is but no matter how hard i tried it still ended up being sub-par. It feels like strategy is removed from the game campaign and multiplayer. In the campaign deployment is basically non existent. So if you wanted to play strategically; for instance, pairing one nation against the other and watch them destroy each other, you can't. Nor is there any other clever ways of playing. The only way to play is to directly attack your enemies in which your allies will do nothing or little to help. As far as the multiplayer goes theres is very little strategy. It's basically whoever has the most units wins; which causes for some pretty frustrating gameplay. I've tried playing vs strategically, looking up guides and tips yet I still get crushed. Maybe i just suck but i have never been this bad at any of the other Total Wars.

However, the UI (in my honest opinion) lets it down, it is clunky and is a step down from the sleekness of Total War: Rome 2. As well as this the much lauded 'graphic changes' don't appear to have materialised at all.\n\nGameplay is fine, as to be expected with any CA game, but nothing special nor an improvment on the Rome 2 offering.\nEssentially it is Rome 2 with a new skin and is simply not worth the price, even on this current 33% off sale. Wait for it to come down in price, it certainly isn't worth £29.99 at full price, or the current £20.99 in this flash sale.\n\nI am glad it became free for this weekend in order for me to gather opinions on this game, sadly I won't be buying it at anything more than around the £15 mark.\n\nEssentially Rome 2 with a much more clunky UI and doesn't run as smooth.

But that is exactly what has happened. The launch of Rome 2 was a disaster from which Creative Assembly are still recovering and in Total war Attila they have attempted to distance themselves from the confusing mess of the previous game and create a much more refined, challenging and enjoyable one.\n\nBefore Total war Attila, there were two Total war games focused around an historical figure; Alexander and Napoleon. Alexander was clearly marketed as an expansion and it succeeded, because it captured the dynamic, fast paced campaign of the great monarch so well. Napoleon was an expansion in all but name and failed; because it tried to turn itself into a fully fledged standalone game and at the same time maintain a direct focus on Napoleon.\n\nTotal War Attila is in-between the two in almost every way. It perfectly captures the intense desperation of the collapse of the Roman Empire, but the large number of playable factions and the detail in the campaign map gives it much more depth than Napoleon ever had. Attila is playable, but he is not the main focus of the game; he is a driving terror working behind the scenes. This allows the focus to shift depending on who you are playing as. For some migrating tribes you flee from the Huns, others flee from a hostile climate, others batter their way through the decaying wreck of Rome. The game is harder, and there are more adversaries that encourage you to keep playing until the late game.\n\nFirst of all the campaign map. It is a marked improvement from Rome 2, with family trees, improved stances, terrain and city management. The family tree system is not as easy to understand as the original Rome, but it does make your generals more important, and that is important. But the other features of the campaign map mean success of the game does not depend on characters alone; similar to Empire, there are wider issues afoot. The climate works against you and can force you to change your strategy entirely. This leads into migrations, which add a whole new way of playing Total war. Yes, it is like barbarian invasion, but far better.\n\nBut the focus of a good Total war game shouldn’t be on the campaign alone. Don’t get me wrong, it is very important that the map doesn’t become bland and repetitive like Rome2, but I think of it this way: the first total war game I bought was the original Rome, not because I wanted to manage taxes and buildings for the ancient world, but because I saw Time Commanders on BBC 2 and thought to myself ‘I want a piece of that action!’, and battles in Total war Attila are honestly disappointing. True, unit cohesion and unit collision don’t suffer from any serious flaws and the Ai is smarter. However, battles are a case of two steps forward one step back, as units tire much faster and rout far too easily; after around a minute of combat. Battles that look terrifying on the campaign map turn out to be a walk over on the battle map. This is disappointing.\n\nFinally we get to the elephant in the room. Is Total war Attila an expansion or a proper standalone game? This is the question that seems to determine whether so many people decide whether or not to buy it. I think this is because people are put off by the perceived link to the disaster of Rome 2, but look at it this way; if someone was trying to get into Total war and you had to recommend to them either Rome 2 or Attila – which would it be?\n\nAttila is not perfect but it is a step in the right direction for CA, showing that they can still make a good game. Contrary to many others I defend the DLC choices made for Attila - the faction packs are not vital for the full game experience like the Greek City Sates were, but what did annoy me rather was the release of Longbeards days after the game first went live. But anyway, Total war Attila is a marked improvement over Rome 2 and I would definitely recommend it.","June 28, 2015","true","164.7"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeFergus/recommended/325610/","DukeFergus","JerichoEffect","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeFergus/","108 products in account","So yes, this game is 'essentially' the same as Total War Rome 2, but it is also much better and more in depth. The main changes to the game are many, but they are mainly centered around the UI (user interface) on the campaign map.\n\nThe foremost thing most people will probably notice is that all the building icons have been changed (they look really cool now I think) and you have been given a TON more information about said building and a variety of stuff pertaining to the city or proviince you have selected. Specialized buildings are also available now if a city has a resource available to it, which is really cool becasue some of these resources can actually have a really big impact on your or the AI's economy and it can be devastating if you or even the AI loses one of the places. Sanitation and sqaulor have actually been given a purpose now outside of just making people happy/unhappy by balancing each other with the chance of a disease outbreak if squalor is higher than sanitation. Diseases work fairly in a really interesting way, they can spread across cities and through trade routes or an army can infect an entire other province if its sanitation is outweighed by squalor. The biggest impact of a disease is bascially just a public order penalty, building a sanitation structure in the province can easily remedie its impacts.\n\nApart from the new unit icons and units being faster to fatigue and breaking, not much has changed with the RTS side of Total War Attila. I liked the old unit banners I think, but once you get used to it they can be useful at figuring out what a unit is with just a glance, and holding spacebar gives you information on every unit's moral and fatigue, which is much preferbale I think to hovering your cursor over each individual unit. There is also a new icon that appears at the bottom left of an enemies unit icon when you have one of your units selected that indicates how great a threat that enemy unit is, another nice yet small change. Fatigue is a much greater hinderance than it was in any previous total war game, as it barely takes any time for a unit to become exhausted and lose moral/fighting effectiveness as a result. Thankfully I think this is faily well balanced with shorter time to recuperate stamina and more elite units' resistance to those penalties. Units can break faster, but they can also come back faster. Unfortunately I am not sure what I think of this as thus far when teh unit breaks from combat they suffer additional casualties from getting attacked in the rear. So when they stop routing they are basically useless because they suffer additional moral penalties from too many losses and if you don't have a general nearby they can route and come back almost a dozen times (true story).\n\nLast but not least, I think I'll just touch on  a few small complaints I have and try to explain why I like this game more than Rome 2.\n\nDuring the RTS battles, the one thing that a absolutely hate with all my being is the inability to take down the 'pinned unit' tab that can take up almost an eighth of your screen during a battle. I do find it really useful for comparing unit stats, for both my units and the enemies, but it is really ridiculous that it is basically the only tab you can't minimize and it constantly has to take up so much of your screen. It also took me a while to figure out that this same tab can be further expanded and you can see more detailed unit stats, something I should have known fro the moment I started recruiting units, but there was no advance waring (though keep in mind I turn off advisor and didn't play through the tutorial/prologue).\n\nThat is about my only major complaint apart from the faction politics system, I still find the system redundant (apart from now that you have to worry about heirs) becasue there are just too few events relative to it and nothing really has an impact on power balance unless you blow ridiculous amounts of money on really stupid endeavours. I will add though that apart from the expense apointing people to administrative positions, the bonuses you get from putting an individual into a certain 'office' is a nice added feature.\n\nWhat makes this game so much better now though, I think, is the new nomadic system and the shear importance of even a single army and how key one can be to a faction's survival. Playing as either of the Roman factions, the last thing you are worried about (apart from maybe the byzantines) is territorial conquest. You will likely be so focused on trying to keep your armies alive and consolidating your borders that there is really no time to think about conquest. Having so many factions going rampant across your borders alos impacts your income, there is nothing in the game that actually explains it (again, I have advisor turned off and did not play the prologue), but simply having any enemy army present in your territory can cause your income to drop significantly. Thus far I think it mostly has to do with trade, though there is no indication that trade is being affected or anything, you just have a reduced income. Though as much as it s a major challenge having so many full stacks against you, for the naomadic factions these armies are also an achilles heel. Most of the nomadic factions never exceed two full armies, but since they are also mobile settlements you can drastically impact such a faction's power by destroying one of these stacks. So focusing down the stacks of a nomadic faction and killing as many of them in battle as possible can be hugely rewarding. Playing as the Romans though, this is not so easy because you have very few cavalry units to start (which are invaluable in running down enemies when they are routed so you can wipe their stack) and most nomadic factions have a lot of cavalry. Early on I think this is fairly well balacned because the lack of the Romans' cavalry units can deny them running down all the enemy forces, allowing them to fight another day. This is what I really enjoy about Attila thus far becasue it makes each army in the game much more important and definetly adds a new level of survival to the game.\n\nSorry for such a long bout, but that is the gist of what I value from this game in the first week of its release.","February 21, 2015","true","170.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

While I would like to see some Attila features in Rome II but upon playing the game I relaize it is quite distinct from Rome II in a number of ways. Politics for example is redone in Attila and a family tree exists and is better then ever in my opinion. You can have family members kill even thier own family members for example you can have a wife kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child. They added new managments to armies in that you have to maintain integrity or else they will mutiny. Technology is redone in a manner similiar to Shogun II with some features from Rome II like spending money on a tech. City management is similar to Rome II although you have to wirry about Sanitation and fertility and also minor settlements can have some minor fortifications unlike Rome II. One aspect of the game I like is how buildings catches on fire and how it can spread throughout the city, it adds to the immersion for factions like Huns. There is also horde like in Barbarian Invasion but redone in a better way with some new features such as encampments where it acts like a city in which you can upgrade buildings or recruit/replenich units while in enemy territory. Attila needs to fix some of it's performance isssues and load times. And it also seems like units can't form a solid straight line like in Rome II so I would like to see that patched in as well.","February 20, 2015","true","394.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

There is alot more strategy needed for Attila than Rome 2, so prepare to sink a few hours if you wish to complete the campaign.

Food is also more effected by seasonal changes, which can ruin your armies in a harsh winter and disease now plays a more active role and you will have to find a tidy balance between sanitation and cultivation as disease is more prevalent and can be spread along your trade networks, which is always nice if you want to give your neighbour the...plague.\n\n\n","February 22, 2015","true","437.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

One of the leading figures in bringing about the Dark Ages in which many great achievements were lost, forgotten and not to be repeated for nearly a millenia, was Attila. A man who saw a rich, once mighty empire in peril and saw an opportunity to rip some people off before the rotten edifice finally collapsed.\n\nIt could be argued that Rome was already on an inexorable downward spiral and Attila mearly helped hasten the inevitable, but one thing cannot be argued. After Attila had finally finished his ruining of Rome, the francise could never recover and the Dark Ages were beckoning.\n\nMaybe a more generous attitude and greater Mod Support could have helped save Rome, rather than nickle and diming its plebs for blood pack dlc.

The factions are awesome although the migratory factions and the barbarian factions have similar units starting out but as you progress you get better units that stand a part from the other factions. Surviving seems to be the main objective especially as a migratory faction because some right off the bat are at war with the eastern and western roman empire and the huns, playing as the barbarian factions the saxons or the franks is fun as well although as the saxons you are a bit land locked starting out. The two roman empires are not to much of a threat but it is a good idea to keep an eye on them, the Huns are a faction that is best to avoid at all cost until you at least have two fully maxed armies.  The family tree is back a feature I was jubilant to see because the family tree actually makes me care more for my faction.\n\nThe only thing I dislike is that to expand the amount of factions you can play as is you have to buy faction DLC for the price of $7.99 which in my opinion is BS!!!! I know I am probably the one of many people griping about this but if you have played total war medieval two you would understand my irritation of this mainly because I feel that many game companies are starting to sell you a bare minimum game but if you want to have the full experience just buy the DLC.\nWhich saddens me that CA has become another company to follow this practice.","March 4, 2015","true","316.5"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","42","76","0","0"

Great gameplay that feels like the older Total War games which all TW vets can truly appreciate. And guess what? Unlike in Rome 2 where I stomp my enemies on legendary, this game forced me to go from legendary to very hard to normal. And I am STILL getting my ♥♥♥ kicked! It's freaking fantastic! The ai actualy makes logical choices this time around too! Siege battles truly feel like sieges and a real game cat and mouse is played during set sieges. No longer can you just stand at the center of your town or a chokepoint and wait for the ai to send all of its men through that one chokepoint. The ai will send some men if any to the chokepoint and try to flank you with the rest. This game is so well polished that it's almost oozing with it.\nIt still has its flaws (like any game). The game isn't well optimized, but it is playable nonetheless. And there's still no real collision, but that's more to do with the engine rather than the game itself.\nI gave Rome 2 (at launch. Check my profile page for my youtube link if you want to watch my reviews) a 4/10. After the Emper Edition, it went up to an 8/10 (though now I'd give it a 7). Attila, at launch is a 9/10.

Having said those three letters, DLC, I know that will instantly turn off a number of people from buying this game and they will stop reading this review right here.\n\nNow, for those of you who are still reading, you're in for a treat. TW:A is the most fun I've had in a Total War since shooting my first flaming catapult shot in Medieval 2. For those of you who haven't played, that's pretty damn fun. But back to Attila, which is an absolutely great game, whether you like Grand Campaign, multiplayer, or just dicking around in custom battles. Everything from the fire dynamics to the VASTLY improved naval battles highlight the fact that Creative Assembly has really listened to the complaints of RTW2. I know what you're thinking though, "Listened?? le DLC tho!!1!!!"\n\nYes. This game has a number of DLCs, no way around it. But they aren't your average, "Here's three new factions have fun," but rather unique and fun little additions that add a better overall experience. Plus three new factions! For example, the cool bonuses the Desert factions get in the Empire of Sands DLC create a totally new way to play the game. Or the Viking Forefathers pack which gives you all sorts of cool little questlines that pop up, with the consequences of your decisions creating a unique general to recruit for Grand Campaign.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Do I recommend you buy all the DLC? No. I really love this historical time period and so I had no problem paying a little more, but I realize that isn't the case for everyone. What I do recommend though is picking up TW:A next time it's on sale, and giving it a go. I promise you will have a good time, DLC or no DLC. I don't understand how this game has a 67% positive rating (at time of review) other than people hating because of DLC, which is understandable to a point. CA really did a good job on this one, overabundant DLC be damned, that shouldn't overshadow that this is a seriously fun game.\n\n8.5/10","September 23, 2015","true","146.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This is the WORST of all the total war games, and i own all of them! I got it on sale for 12$ (Waste of 12$ too) and I see why no onw would want to buy it for 44$ because ITS ♥♥♥♥! The reason why is:\n1) None of the tactics work the way they should be intended. Example: I recently play ed the saxons campain and they had a pretty tough army of almost double my men, but imanaged to breach their towers and thin out the enemy army to only their general. It looked like an easy victory until with my 7 remaining units (including my general whom i kept in the back) met the enemy general unit.

For example, after the Western Roman Empire fell in my Geats campaign, I settled all of Italy and started a Geatish Empire based out of Scandanavia.\n+Diplomacy and politics are back in this game, after they were stripped from Rome 2. There are actual meaningful effects that occur from random events, like the death of the Pope. If you're a Christian faction, which I was during my WRE playthrough, you'll get a huge public order penalty across your nation and you must find a way to overcome it. You also need to make sure your ruler/ruling party is maintaining a respectable level of control as well as allowing others a position of power, or else you'll have a civil war... and you don't want a civil war.\n+The graphics are quite impressive but nothing ground-breaking, even with Extreme settings on. Nonetheless, it'll make your game look pretty enough.\n+Very stable right now. I haven't encountered any bugs or glitches for a long time, except for one: when your men are in Defensive Testudo (a heavy defensive formation) and they are in heavy combat for a while, sometimes they will reform their formation sideways or something, allowing the enemy to hit them from behind. You just need to keep an eye on them and make sure their formation is facing the correct way.\n+The UI is great. It feels modern, and I always have a difficult time going back to the old Total War games because I am spoiled from CA's advancements in their recent titles.\n+The campaign AI is much better this time around. They'll actually bring large armies to oppose you, and in logical ways. The Romans make decisions as they did in the real life timeline, the Huns are very tough to deal with no matter which faction you play as, and the Sassanids use their vassals to create huge problems for you.\n+The time period itself is interesting, good choice by CA.\n\nSome things I didn't like:\n-The DLC whoring, though CA themselves probably doesn't have much control over it. Honestly, this doesn't bother me much because the unique factions come in the base game. Those DLC packs are just 3 copy-and-paste factions sold for $8. Long story short, you won't be missing anything if you skip the DLC - just as it should be.\n-The classic Total War battle AI is back. They made steps forward with Attila, but there are some returning issues. If the AI "doesn't know where you are" (they always know), they'll do their best to convince you by marching their units back and forth in front of the tree line where you are hiding.\n-Even after you sign a non-aggression pact with a faction, they can still raid your provinces with no penalty. All you can do is declare war and drive the army out.\n-Politics still take a back seat in this game. As long as you click the right options for the dynamic events, you will be fine. If you want to get ahead, you'll need to put some effort in but not much.\n-You will have to micro your units in battles maybe more than you should. They'll start doing stupid things like chasing routed units across the map who have 5/160 men left when they should have turned their focus to the next active enemy unit.\n-Naval battles are still boring.\n-You don't have much control over your vassals in campaign.\n\n*I may have neglected to mention a few things in this review, but I wrote from the things I remembered most in my 100+ hours of playing.\n\nConclusions:\nAttila is my favorite Total War game to date. It's very well done and you can see how CA's many years of experience have been coming together. There are minor issues that'll make you yell at your monitor on occassion, but those are in every good game. I'd like to see a more developed vassal mechanic in the next game, as well as deeper politics and diplomacy. Despite the issues, I fully recommend this game and wish it had more exposure than it does. People need to stop whining about DLC packs and start seeing how great of a game this really is.","October 2, 2015","true","426.7"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","20","34","0","0"

We all remember what arrived to plague our rigs on sept 2013. After this date, years of delusions and legions of patches were the everyday bread to eat for total war player.\n\nIt's anyway a matter of fact that Attila does not deserve to pay this price; even if the delusion and rage of many players is 100% understandable and must be respected at all.\n\nOne thing unfair: Creative Assembly dlc politics. Campaign packs and Factions packs are nowaday the law.\nThese are in many cases (Factions packs almost), cut content from the game sold separately.\n\n"It's the free market, baby...are you surprised nowaday?".\n\nNope, I'm no more surprised; fall of the Gods is already happened after Rome II arrival; no more romantic thoughts on CA.\n\nNo surprises but, I can deal with cut content sold separately BUT, good gods, make them worthy their price.\n\nCampaign packs are a bit more decent because of the camapign itself but ALL those dlc have at last a common point I must mark here: total lack of variety in terms of units.\n\n"New" contents made with many times a percentage of recycled stuffs higher than new ones.\n\nEmbarassing rosters for the new factions sold as dlc.\n\nThis is the weaker aspect not of Attila, but of a company who has abandoned their first approach to games (ok we can accept changes!) and almost to their loyal community.\n\nThis is unfair. We do not deserve this.\nModders do not deserve this.\nLoyal players do not deserve this, especially if we are all veterans of Rome II.\n\nAttila is a good game. Decent campaign mechanics one can enhance also with some mods.\n\nPlus all fixes coming after 3 years of beta-Rome-II.\n\nPlus intriguing historical timeframe, yes, less famous than Ancient Times but believe me, full of its own beauty.\n\nI also liked the new visual approach to menu, backgrounds, buttons and event messages.\n\nI can repeat what others said because this is a simple truth:\n\n___Attila si what Rome II should have been from that far sept 2013.___\n\nBUT BUY IT (game and dlc) ON SUPERSALE.\n\nGame is worthy the entire price, but this CA politics of cut contents that is not abandoned but it seems will be more applied with warhammer fantasy total war it's an unfair, disappointing choice and they must understand this.\n\nBUY ON SALE and enjoy Attila and sto being a poor son of God with all the pain you suffered with Rome II Golgotha Edition.","March 10","true","293.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

My advice!  The states/areas have 3 cities in them.  The people get mad about everything.  Cities grow faster the bigger they are but need sanitation and structures to maintain order.  Only 1 other specialty building can be then made.  The bigger the city, the harder it is to take.  Building have "spill-over" buffs that can go to the other cities in the joined province.  Family tree...go to battle with the king to have lots of points to use.  Stay in the balanced part of your power bar.  To increase your influence, use "gather support" ability.  To lower power from the right, appont non family members to office or make stupid decisions that will obvious lower your power.  Like someone gets married, what you wanna do/  Well, do nothing and you get a power loss penalty to get back to the balance stuff.  Make allies, start with trade, non aggressive pact, etc.  Use the politics button to understand who likes who and don't ♥♥♥♥ off your allies.  Razing is great to purge  a completely different culture but the immigration penalty hurts a little.  Let your allies pull you to war and only conquer land you historically conquered or you get corruption for having to many lands.  Fool around with the objectives tab.  Put the graphcis on quality, it's nice enough but the game will run fine then.  Good luck, this is a RIDICULOUSLY HARD GAME.

Its rather strange that in the middle of a battle with tons of enemies it ran the smoothest (avg 25fps) but on the campaign map and in all the videos the framerate was a stuttering mess at around 5 fps.

I've been a Total War fan since Empire, played every game of series till then and I've been looking forward to the release of Attila, after Rome II being quite enjoyable (after a pretty messed up launch). Does Attila achieve to be better than Rome II, does it bring new mechanics, more unit variety, better AI, or for short: Is it worth buying? The answer is yes.\n\nBut now comes the big BUT(T) lol. If you're expecting an all new game you will be a bit disappointed. Attila uses the same engine as Rome II, the interface has been tweaked, but is generally the same, province and city management is mostly the same, agents and army management also. The big changes of the game are mostly to be found in the siege mechanics, new politics system and the new horde-feature. Let me explain these first.\n\nSieges have been revamped alot. With every turn a settlement is besieged, it now loses a percentage of its "health" and gets more and more destroyed. This has effects on the siege battle. Walls and gates might be breached, houses burn, the air is filled with thick smoke. Enemy morale gets worse, the more the city is damaged, but your repair costs increase if you decide to conquer the city and keep it. Well, IF. Here comes a new "fun" feature. You are now able to destroy settlements after conquering them. And I mean completly destroy, all buildings gone, the city removed from the map, all that remains are ruins, you have to rebuild with an army (which is quite expensive). While this adds variety in your war strategies, you will feel how bitter that step is when you fall victim to it yourself. Imagine your capital being back in your homeland, far away from the front. Now an enemy raiding party comes over the seas, attacks your city, you have no army stationed there, and boom, they destroy the entire city with all the highend-buildings that cost you thousands of gold. Fun. This definetly makes you pay more attention to your borders, and makes losses much, much more devastating.\n\nThe new politics. First things first. The family tree has returned!.. and it sucks. Yes, unfortunately, the family tree of Attila: Total War is basically just fan service. While Shogun 2 had an excellent family tree, very clear, very useful and fun to manage, the Attila one is just way to complicated. Within a few turns it completly gets out of control, and your family grows to such enormous scales that you don't want to click that faction button anymore. Also the missing ability to zoom out and see your whole family tree makes things much worse. You have to scroll through the tree and will easily lose track of who belongs to who.\nThe reason you get so many new family members is probably the new feature to install a governer to a province, otherwise you can't use edicts. But making one of your family members one prohibits him from leading armies, so always choose wisely who you send to the front and who will watch over your citizens in the meantime. Family members also have many different actions at their disposal, like murdering someone else from the family, increase someones loyalty or your factions popularity. The resource they spend for doing that is called influence. Influence is generated by winning battles as a general or by political measures as a governor.  The latter will earn a lot less though, which makes it hard to use them for intrigue. Overall the new politics system feels unfinished. People asked for a family tree, for politcal intrigue and more political interactions in general. CA implemented that, which is nice, but it really seems as if they didn't think it through. So far, nothing beats the clan management from Shogun II.\n\nLastly, the horde-feature. The Huns, the Visigoths or the Vandals, they are called the Great Migrators. These factions start of as hordes. That means, that they have no controlled settlement at the beginning, and only armies. They have a special stance that allows them to go into camp, where they can build structures for unit creation, food production and wealth. When they capture a settlement, and choose to occupy it, their migration ends, and they are no longer a horde.\nThis feature means, that when a faction loses its last settlement, but still has an army, it becomes a horde too. This is a good addition to the game and fits the theme perfectly. The Huns (who cannot leave horde-status btw) play very different from other factions and this way, the first time in a Total War game, you have two completly different playstyles. Overall a very nice feature.\n\nSo. Should you buy the game? Let me just make a quick list, why or why not you should.\n\nPros:\n- New horde feature\n- Good tweaks for the HUD\n- AI seems a lot more logical\n- The game is much harder\n- Very good atmosphere, soundtrack and graphics\n\nCons:\n- Unfinished politics system\n- Overall only small changes from Rome II\n- Horrible DLC-policy\n- Still a bit buggy\n- Feels more like an addon than a whole new game (similar to Napoleon --> Empire)\n\nJust a quick explanation to the con points.\nCA or Sega, or whoever is responsible has a horrible, horrible DLC-policy. It has been a week since release and the first DLC is out. Price: 8 Euros for 3 new factions. DLCs from Rome II, like the Blood and Gore DLC, that adds blood and gore (who would have thought) does not carry over. The games have the same engine, almost identical fighting animations, why not just give the DLC free to everyone who owned it for Rome II?\nThere are still some bugs in the game, concerning ingame messages, AI and battle calculation. But that will probably get fixed someday.\n\nSo, to finally conclude. YES, you should buy the game if you are a fan of Total War, like the new, dark scenario, have no problems with scummy DLC and are willing to spend around 35 Euros for an addon.\nYou should however NOT buy Attila, if you expect a whole new game, are not okay with the DLC policy and are new to the series. If you want to get into Total War, I highly recommend Shogun II !\n\nThanks for reading everyone, I am very open to change my opinion and gladly accept any critique or discussions. :)","February 25, 2015","true","47.9"," 66 of 123 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","66","123","3","3"

Units disappearing in forest eventhough in a distance of 1 meter and AI on world map is stupidly following you around the world and ignoring evertyhing else. Friendly fire is most tremendous especially for javelins and is just stupid. Eventough the desolation and razing mechanism is a cool add into the game the AI ruins it by desolating far too much of the cities and campign is just stupid for example playing as huns who cant get any cities. Losing one army entirely is ruining too much and makes you rage quit as huns. Even losing a single battle makes the hordes repair fee more than citys repair free is stupid. Tribute states will back stab you as fast as they can (have seen that happen after 1 turn of conquest) which makes the tribute state system useless. Unit upgrading system is also poorly made because then you can no longer recruit cheaper units and even the slightest upgrade without even rising the tier makes the unit upkeep ridiciously high.\n\nEventough I have left Rome 2 behind and moved into Attila I still think Attila is unfinished product and should not be bought by who are thinking of buying a Total War game.

Total War: Attila is quite likely the best game in the total war franchise. Maybe not the best for its time but by a close margin I'd put it just ahead of M2.\n\nGameplay:Amazingly diverse campaign playstyles (empire in decline, migrators, conventional start and safe empires)\nBattle mechanics are improved (fatigue and morale are more intersting, units return to the fight more and you have to give more thought to fatigue (tired quickly but you also recover faster, makes running more tactical).\nBalance so far feels very good, nothing is insanely OP (that I've discoverd yet)\nUnit diversity is huge, there are a wide range of factions and faction styles which makes the game intersting and I predict will increase replayability.\nBattle AI (including siege) is substantially improved from previous games, it now makes logical decisions (I've found they're a tiny repetitve however.\nFamily tree is highly immersive and complicated which gives greater depth to the game (especially in the long run)\nThe economic system is a fair bit more complicated than R2 and is more interesting as it changes over time (climate change) and involves an increased number of relevant variables (immigration, religion, desolation/raiding etc.)\nDiplomacy feels similar to R2 but slightly more polished, the ability to gift factions to migrator factions is a nice addition. Overall small improvement here.\nSiege escallation is great fun and adds more complexity. Gladly the AI also makes good use of this most of the time (at province capitals)\nGraphics/Performance Played on a GTX970, i53570k on a 4k monitor.\nTextures etc. are a small step up from R2, they aren't amazing up close though.\nGood detail in units\nGame performs above 30FPS at 4k on 'performance' (with some max performance mixed in), drops to high twenties when I zoom in with a large number of units.\nOverall performance is okay but could improve, the forward looking approach of the 'extreme' graphics settings is comendable to help ensure their game lasts.\nMeta Stuff Day 1 DLC is annoying but common in the industry, neither a negative or a positive\nThe fact that they've made the improvements that the community have made (on the whole) is highly commendable. They appear to have learnt from their errors.\nIf you liked R2 you'll love this, if you didn't like R2 you may find some enjoyment in this game but it won't amaze you.\nI haven't encountered any game breakings bugs, the new path drawing system however is a little bit unreliable though.","February 19, 2015","true","346.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can understand entirely why that is frustrating to many people because we all would like to have the full experience that the DLC provides, however, I don't see that as a reason not to purchase the game. In my honest opinion, and I'm sure I'll get some rage response, just earn a dollar a day and by the time you get to the end of the week you can buy your DLC no problem. I agree it's bullsh*t but the game itself is too good to pass up because of the DLC BS.\n\nNow to the game itself. I immediately noticed the improvements when I started my campaign as the Saxons. First of all I love all of the new options and family mechanics. I'm not very good at describing things, but for whatever reason the entire game seems to feel very smooth as compared to Rome 2 which was very rigid. (Although a great game I do recommend Rome 2 to everyone)\n\nThe only thing I can even remotely complain about is the DLC rip off, which while indeed is a ripoff, is not enough to keep me from enjoying this marvelous addition to the Total War franchise.\n\nThank you for reading, feel free to add me at anytime if you would like to play a battle.","March 5, 2015","true","220.4"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

Battles are greatly improved and almost on par with the first rome and barbarian invasion now, the camapign draws you in much more with more immersion, more features and greater replayability thanks to the dynamism of the migrating peoples that are the hordes and the steady climate change. The prologue campaign is engrossing, much more so then Rome 2's Etruscan one, I am still yet to finish it yet enjoying it so far even as a series veteran.\n\nBad: Kinda bad performance at the moment, get some stutters, way lower FPS compared to Rome in general and big blobs fighting kills the FPS. This can be fixed by patching and driver updates from Nvidia so I'm not too fussed.

The AI does not strategize or perform better. Rather, higher difficulties just enable it to mass-produce large armies of cheap and worthless units, then relentless toss them at a single settlement of yours. Let me highlight that last part: relentlessly attacking one particular settlement of yours. During a war, your AI enemy becomes absolutely fixated on one single city that you own. It doesn't matter if they've lost three, four, or five whole armies at this one city; they will come back. In terms of gameplay, this is depressingly repetitive. In terms of historical strategy, you would think they'd try something different (like attack a different city of yours or try to isolate the one they want).","May 29","false","43.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game can also sometimes feel like its over before its really started. What i mean by this is the action if fast and intense, if you play as a Roman nation if you do survive the first onslaught, you will likely feel like the game has become incredibly easy. (I found this at least). Only other issue i can think of is the Ai can be extremely aggressive towards the player especially when you play as a hoard nation and sometimes hoards seem to have a six sense for where you are moving your armies, and will constantly outrun your forces until your turn around or take enough losses then they won't stop hunting you until everything you love is destroyed.\n\nBasically if you want a challenge this is the game for you, i've never really lost a campaign on any other total war, but my first playthrough as the Huns led to a civil war where i was hunted down and slowly eliminated cultivating in a last stand just outside constantinople.\n\nHighly recommend, perhaps dosen't live up to Shogun 2 but its a good heading for the total war series 7/10","July 26, 2015","true","239.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I have played every Total War game since I got Rome Total War in 2005. And this game is so sad…\nOverall it's better than Rome 2. (Others have explained this really well already) But that's if you can get the game up and running. I have twice the RAM, 3 TB hard drive, and a far more powerful graphics card than the recommended requirements and I can't get a decent frame rate even on the lowest settings. And that's only assuming it won't crash.\nTechnical issues aside let's reflect momentarily on how this is basically an updated and prettier version of the Barbarian expansion pack for the original Rome. The main difference being that the Barbarian expansion pack wasn't masquerading around as a full game worth $44.99 and when you bought it you bought all of it. What they’ve done here is make an expansion pack for Rome 2, sold it as a full priced game, and then hacked it up with culture packs and campaigns worth as much as the original Rome’s expansion packs each.\nSo in conclusion; they are ripping us off with something that barely works anyways. And I’m very sad to see my absolute favorite franchise go down the tubes.

Battles have a faster pace than in the EE of Rome 2, which makes them more fun in my opinion, and the new campaign features are also very interesting. The politic system is harder to manage, fertility becomes an issue when the lands become infertile as time goes on and the new migration mechanics are also nice, especially for the Huns who can't settle down and thus are constantly migrating. With hordes laying entire provinces to waste and the slow climate change, the campaign also feels more like you're fighting for survival instead of simply getting an empire as big as possible like in Rome 2, making Attilas campaign stand out from those in previous TW games.\n\nAll in all, Attila is definetly worth buying if you liked the campaign in Rome 2. While the multiplayer still needs attention by CA its still playable and can be a lot of fun. However, expect a few exploitable glitches and questionable balancing in some cases.","February 23, 2015","true","377.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The graphics are nothing short of beautiful. It's extremely satisfying to set a defiant enemy's town ablaze.

There are also several minor changes (for example when attacking a city, you will see civilians fleeing. And yes, they can be killed). To add a bonus to the beautiful graphics, you'll be happy to know the game seems to be much better optimized than Rome 2!    Gameplay  8  With a few new additions to the campaign map (scorched earth policy, hordes, etc), they gameplay is a little more fresh than Rome 2. The interface has been fleshed out more fully, and is far more understandable than Rome 2 was. You are now able to set way points for your units to march to in combat, so you can finally become as strategic as you like, and arc that army around the flank without having to babysit them. Overall, it feels pretty much like a Total War game always has. I was hoping for a bit more innovation, but I'm certainly not disappointed with what we were given. Plus family trees have made a return!    Story  N/A  There really isn't ever a "story" to the Total War games, other than "history." In this game you'll find yourself facing off against a dying Rome, and the Huns.    Multiplayer  9  Co-op campaign makes a return in Total War: Attila, and it's as enjoyable as ever. Several of the glitches from Rome 2 have been worked out, thankfully. In combat, you can split your army with your friend (as before), so you can both enjoy the battles together as you conquer the world. Or, you can face on in a massive one-off skirmish mode!    Replayability  7  Enjoyable to come back to for sure, the only problem here (and it isn't the game's fault), is that once you've played through a campaign, you need a break for a bit.    Overall  8.1/10  The Total War series has been a long time favorite, and Rome 2 had everyone worried about the direction it was headed. Attila is a confirmation that the developers heard their fans, and adjusted course accordingly. An enjoyable experience for sure, with good optimization, and subtle gameplay improvements that make the Total War experience even better. Co-op campaign, as always, is a blast and I highly recommend it with friends.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","July 11, 2015","true","26.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

We always will have a portion of our brain that tells us that ‘something’ could be done better… And it’s with the awkward wisdom of hindsight I begin my two pennies of thought on this latest ‘Total War’ release. For those who have never played a Total War game before, I do apologise in advance for not being concise enough for a balanced review or completely detailed report.\n\nI’ve always been an avid fan of the growing database that controls CA’s Total War series that was first launched with the original ‘Shogun – Total War’. Although I have to admit, from a solo player point of view the ‘Zerg’ style AI scripting that ensues throughout, seems to ruin things for an overall strategy game. By this I mean, it’s ‘no’ matter how you start, the end is the same when it comes to the final push. This is hugely lame and in my individual opinion, is a shining example of how bad some game designers are in employment or more so, over-paid Producers (For the record, I worked at various gaming publishers and can name quite a few that ‘should’ have never have been employed in such a role – utterly clueless to gaming – “Apologies for the rant, but it is relevant”).\n\nFor my part, the only way to scale a strategy game in difficulty is to simply incur penalties to the roll of a die or likewise incur penalties for ‘bad’ decisions – a simple mathematical notion but for a game, it is a rewarding dynamic of randomness. But after 900 hours+ on Attila, 700 hours+ (Total War – Rome 2) and an insane (according to Steam) – and I really hate to publish this fact. Although I think many hours were because the PC was left on overnight *coughs* – 3800+ hours on Total War – Shogun 2. I have to come to an eventual and final conclusion, “Complete waste of time”.\n\nThe combat on field is great fun; UI is good, graphics, sound and so on. All detailed, rewarding and completely atmospheric. Hard to fault and mainly because it’s almost as good as it gets on that front. The complete and utter jewel in the crown of the entire series and lead to many a late night of “Just one more…”. And to be honest, I don’t think even the hardiest gamer could be bored with the thrill of detailed RTS (Real Time Strategy) battles.\n\nBut you’re left feeling divorced from your 20 minute+ achievements when taken back to the ‘real’ part of the game – i.e. the ‘Campaign Map’. Rather than feel like a conqueror, you’re simply adding to your invisible foe’s strengths – even when using agents and so on. When you push, they push back and more – no matter what your style or tactics in play. In the end, your achievements in Attila (and the recent Total War games) are very counterproductive.\n\nSo if you don’t care about gaming and just want a laugh – buy it. Play it and I dare say in 2-Player mode it’s probably the best in a turn based with RTS/Strategy you could find. But for a solo player, I would rather be sat in a prison cell with a deck of cards, with each card being the same colour/suit.\n\nPS: Funny how most ‘professional’ game reviewers come up with the same scores… Having worked alongside many publishers in the UK during the 90’s, I’ve always wondered how they can tell the difference between their mouths and arses. Both portals seem to produce the same excrement when priced in wealth and insight.\n\nPPS: Warhammer in CA’s hands – yeaaaah riiiight… Nice GFX I bet, but RPG/Roll of a die gameplay? You may as well handle dog poo and make a sandwich without washing your hands, and see if the randomness of picking up something ‘horrible’ is more prevalent than the £40+ bundle that is edging it’s way to the Steam Store soon…\n","July 25, 2015","false","256.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","12","20","6","2"

Atilla is a brilliant game and is better than rome 2. i do believe that some things are could do with a little reworking like upgrading buildings cost a little too much, and when attacking a walled city, it does not give me the option to assault straight away and makes me siege for 1 turn. this is very annoying when playing as a horde it forces me to stop rampaging and then i get ambushed and i lose one horde. while on the subject, losing one horde usually means certain death for the other(s). other than the said issues this game is very good and i do not see everyones issues with it.\n\none this i should say, CA please dont listen to sega, your a nice company and i like how you get involved in the community you can do fine without them.\n","March 5, 2015","true","365.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

As a game, Attila is perhaps the best Total War title to date, surpassing even the fan favourites Shogun 2 and Medieval 2. Attila has so many great features which the earlier total wars don't have. Every time I go back to rome 2 or shogun 2 I wish it had the city burning, migration, politics, the UI etc. of Attila. It's very hard for me to get back to those earlier titles (especially rome2) again after playing Attila.\n\nAttila, when compared to Rome2, is superior in almost every way, except performance. Everything from battle to politics to campaign gameplay feels and is more fleshed out. Both the campaign and battle AI are phenomenal in the Total War standard. It's not great, but it is simply the best when compared to other total war titles.\n\nTotal War: Attila has an amazing atmosphere. The crumbling empires, cold, long winters, starvation, overall misery and the inevitable hunnic horde of thousands and thousands of warriors with the objective of raiding/killing/♥♥♥♥♥♥/burning your lands and cities. These presented with a gritty/grim colouring and graphics, make this total war title my absolute favourite. And I've played ALL Total War games.\n\nThe idea of having a "final boss" in a total war game is brilliant. There is absolutely nothing more satisfying in any total war game, than finally, after a long struggle, being able to overcome the hunnic invasion and kill Attila the Hun himself. Believe me, when I played as the Western Roman Empire and I managed to kill Attila after many battles, it was a fantastic feeling.\n\nAnd concerning the DLC, this game is absolutely fully enjoyable without ANY DLC at all. And if you ever wish to try out any of the dlcs, wait for the inevitable steam sale where they are 75% off. Shouldn't be too expensive.\n\nThis game deserves more positive feedback. No matter what you think of Sega's stupid DLC policy. The game itself is a masterpiece in the total war franchise and its developers at CA should be congratulated for what they've done here, not bashed for it.","June 25, 2015","true","360.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DARGOL/recommended/325610/","DARGOL","I am the Heat Miser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DARGOL/","422 products in account","Definitely the Napoleon of Rome II. Some say it is a copy and paste of Rome II, but I disagree, even by the end of all the patching that game was a disaster without mods. Attila is better in every way essentially, better tech tree, better town management and building, better combat options (because apparently half the troops in Rome II couldn't use loose spacing), the barbarians are represented better, the AI actually build armies now and aren't horrifically braindead with their building choices (yes AI, build 16 farms across one region...), more depth in siege battles, agents are less overpowered (you can't get a champion almost instantly anymore), the ground is FAR more detailed and well themed, ranged units have more depth and are more balanced, family tree/government is usable and has a point again and better skill progression of characters.\n\nThere's a few things I don't like however, namely; general's bodyguard units are too weak later on in the game, but more importantly, you no longer get a choice of bodyguard units, which is my most hated change for some reason, I liked in Rome that you got a choice from like 3-5 different units, often a really fun unit like elephants or chariots.\n\nThe raze settlement mechanic is far too imbalanced. It is way too easy for the player and the AI to raze a settlement, often able to attack, sack and raze in one turn. Razing does far too much permanent damage to the player or AI and it is too costly and time consuming to settle on a razed location. Due to this and the AIs fondness with razing, the campaign map ends up mostly razed and deserted.\n\nOnline Co-op Campaign matches dysync FREQUENTLY. Often you can attempt a resync, which takes ages, while other times the game just closes.\n\nNo workshop........... really?\n\nThe AI are still far too diplomatically stubborn and stupid, they very rarely accept reasonable deals, almost never accept peace even if they are very far away and weak unless you pay a hellish amount of money. I have had a situation where I paid them a considerable amount for a non agression pact, only for them to break it the FOLLOWING turn and also declining my trade offer, only for them to ask to trade a few turns later. I've also had the AI break three treaties including non agression by declaring war in a single turn but suffer no diplomatic penalty to other factions.\n\nThe horde system is really cool, but due to the AI diplomacy I mentioned above it is pointless to stay as a horde for any extended period of time. As a horde you cannot seem to request military access (not that the AI would agree anyway), probably because as a horde you own no land for them to access in return, but an option to get access for money would be helpful. Anyway, due to that, factions get angry at you for trespassing even if you have a defensive alliance and they will eventually declare war on you, bribe more people into the war against you, never take peace due to their stubborness, repeat until the whole world hates you and tracks you down and you lose. You shouldn't have to pay above 20k to get a weak faction to stop fighting you at the start of the game. Not only that but making puppet states doesn't seem to work because of how much your state will hate you and then declare war on you later anyway.\n\nThe game doesn't run as well as Rome II, which I expected considering how much better it looks, but i'm sure improvement could be made here. The game sometimes will freeze up between turns, it doesn't happen often and thankfully it does not crash the game, but it is still annoying. This seems less prevelant now than at launch though.\n\nUnit portraits don't look as good as Rome II, they had a really cool theme going and I think they could have made it work again by making the painting look a bit darker. Also, the voice actor for all of the non Roman/Eastern factions is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one from Rome II.\n\nFirst two culture packs were clearly cut from the original game to be sold/used as a preorder bonus. Frustrating, but was bound to happen due to almost all big publishers being jews now days. If you thumbs down the game or not buy it because of this then I really can't blame you on that principle. Hopefully we get free stuff like we did in Rome II, but I doubt it because Attila wasn't a disgrace on launch so there's no need for damage control. In saying that, I do feel that the price of Attila was pretty great.\n\nI'd like to see a heap more unit types and some more playable factions though, I'm willing to pay for that if it is good value, most importantly however, MORE GENERAL UNITS.\n\nOverall a hell of a lot better than Rome II though, aint no Shogun 2, but it earns the Total War name. The Steam reviews are incredibly harsh on Attila, like seriously, the % of recommends is lower than Rome II, which I cannot fathom.\n\n8/10","March 16, 2015","true","86.3"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","32","59","0","0"

I saw.  I s**t my pants...    8/10.\n\nThis game is markedly better than the unfinished steaming pile of horse droppings that was Rome 2.  Basically, it is what Rome 2 should have been.  However, units are still way too similar and can still do very stupid things.  There is also very few factions to choose from and most of them feel like generic clones of each other..  The ERE is also pretty much identical to the WRE but for a few different buildings and starting situation (as best I can tell).\n\nOverall though this game is a lot of fun.... would have been nice to be able to start Rome as a small faction, however if you want to play as Rome you start off with a MASSIVE empire and just get smashed constantly by barbarians (can wear thin after a while).  Still waiting on blood and gore..!!\n\nAfter Shogun 2, CA seemed to have abolished the option to choose short, medium or long campaigns... I seem to never actually finish a campaign because they are simply faaaaaar too long and I get bored and want to start afresh (it can also become too easy when you are cleaning everybody up with ease)\n\nUpgrade system and family tree are a HUGE improvement from Rome 2, although politics are still not explained very well..\n\nThis game is a lot of fun and in my opinion easily worth $50 (although CA will probably charge at least this much again by selling us missing chunks of the game in pieces).  Would love to see a medieval version!    There is still a slight moshpitting cowardice illness - the units behaving like idiots who seem to prefer to hide en mass in a long column rather than make a line and spread out and fight properly, but the mechanics as well as the AI are vastly improved from ROME 2.  What was amazing about the first Rome was the feeling of mass... when units hit each other you felt it!  This was almost non-existant in Rome 2 but is certainly improved in it's successor.. although, sadly, it is still inferior to what Rome 1 gave us so many years ago..... sigh..\n\nOverall:  8/10 (I would give Rome 2 a 4/10 although made better by modders - there is as of yet no workshop for Attila which is a shame given that ROME 2 was basically unplayable without mods).","March 4, 2015","true","297.0"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","19","34","3","0"

The AI, even on normal difficulty, is challenging. I've liked most of the Total War games, but this is among the better ones. Each faction is engaging, especially with the new migration options and horde mechanics, it allows the player the option to make their own history nearly from scratch, whether one creates an Ostrogothic Persia or a Vandal Britannia or an Alani Scandinavia.\n\nOn release, this game was and is leaps and bounds ahead of Rome 2 Total War as a comparison. Although, the game still has tweaks and fixes that are necessary, I am sure they will be fixed given time. There are some historical inaccuracies that will annoy history nerds, like myself,  but they aren't game-breaking. One example being the Alani tribe: in game their roster is almost entirely German as is their appearance, yet they are an Iranian Sarmatian tribe - closely related to the Roxolani and Iazyges tribes. Their appearance and roster should be more like that of the Rome 2 Nomads than what it is now. The Huns, at the moment, have more powerful infantry than they do cavalry - which is baffling. There aren't any Slavic, Celtic, Semitic, or African tribes (yet) but it's still possible they may release in the future with DLC.\n\nCampaign Gameplay: 8/10\nBattle Gameplay: 7/10 (Still very quick battles)\nMechanics: 7/10 (Needs polishing, may change)\nReplayability: 9/10\nGraphics: 10/10 (The Raze function is amazing)\nHistory: 5/10\n\nAverage: 7.7/10","March 13, 2015","true","77.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Western Roman Empire are harder to play then their Eastern cousins but i had a blast as the Eastern.\nIts easier cause you have less enemies and more money.

I also had a huge battle, where i was in war with the sassanid empire and i made a huge push unit i came to their capital, there i was defeated and i had no one to defend my conquered cities, i had one army on the way but before that their faction leader and 2 more full stack armies attacked the conquered city, i had a garrison with 2 spear unites, 2 archers and 1 sword man and i defeated 3 full stack armies, this was in very hard, i was sweating like ♥♥♥♥ing hell, that was probably the best battle i ever fought in a total war game by far!

My King was dead and my army crushed after it had succesfully defended one enormous invaision by the Jutes, just to have the remnants be slaughtered by Varinians that then desolating my home.

One of the most notable is one of the best AI's I have ever seen in a stratagy game. Allies aid you, even if they are far away over the course of a long seige, as would a human ally. Enemies are cunning and use the gameplay against the player on the campaign map. Splitting your armies via subterfuge and cold/calculating manouvers.\n\nIt is also very visually appealing, though it has its rough edges in the performance sector as does every total war game at the start, but it is many times over better than Rome 2 in this regard. Stable and fairly bugless. Even the Co-op is very stable. It is obvious they have learned their lesson from Rome 2.\n\nThere are some things that are a bit wonky though, its color scheme on the campaign map while fitting for the mood, can make seeing things on the campaign map a bit of a challenge unless you adjust your brightness/Gamm settings. And battles are more often taking place in rain, snow, and fog than in clear weather.\n\nThe politics system is also greatly improved, and the addition of the family tree along with its gameplay is very welcome.

And the AI is using their equipment intelligently, 99% of the time. Sometimes they put a ladder near a collapsed wall with no enemies near the wall. (wooden walls, which are small). Other than that it is great.\n- The game is generally more immersive and it requires less to run it in my opinion. I can now handle 20000 units on a field compared to Rome II where I could only handle 8000.

Once again we are capped at 14 armies. Once again we can only build 6 buildings in the settlement. The only difficulty you will have is C/A making the game harder with things like infant mortality, the plague and so on. I tried playing as the Lombards, every single one of my male heirs died? I thought i did something wrong, so i started over. Again, every one of my male heirs dies, someone gets made king that isn't even in the family tree, and i can control nothing. Silly. Or you have a flood that destroys a city every 5 turns, or it will be a fire. Something always very unrealistic that just throws a wrench in to what you are doing, making you waste resources and time. I don't think Winchester burned to the ground every other year, did it? And honestly, i want the enemy to make the game hard, not the damn plague, or the inability to make a food building. I don't know what the reasoning is for making the game so much smaller and more mean spirited, but i mean come on, killing every male child is kind of morbid, don't you think? Anyway, i haven't played total war since Empire and Medievil 2, and i was totally stunned to see how much it has shrunk, it's depressing. C/A had totally sold out, nothing cutting edge here anymore. Just a stripped down version of the old games, with some new mechanics and graphics thrown in. Let's all get even with them by not buying this game anymore, maybe it will be a wake up call for them.","March 29","false","274.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Overall they've just taken Rome and overhauled it and changed the unit roster, which believe me, doesn't sound too good, but it really works since they took all the good stuff from Rome 2 and fixed the bad stuff, i.e the AI has had a major improvement which also makes Attila much harder than Rome 2, which is good I guess?

I must say it still makes fun even after 300h+ Playtime. At first I was very excited to play this Game probably everytime what is new is really cool for itself ^^ I choose the first time the Northmen (Jutes) the Leader and his Family are really cool and with this Fraction to Conquer others Citys and expand your Land and your Armys makes a lot fun. The Political System is a Point in the Game what i like you have more Options make a Alliance or make a Statment for a War or be Neutral and wait^^ the one think what i not like is the voices it has zero variations in there voices and in the long run you skip it over badly =/. Without the Workshop its a good Game but after a while you play more and hours later or days later its just a little bit the air out. With the Workshop you have so many new Option to enjoy this good Game even more just as before the normal Game and also makes these Modders a very good mods that they makes for us. I can really recommend Total War Attila also to the Persons they not familiar with the Series like me ;)\nThe only thing that bothers me, in principle, that Rome goes really fast down and the Huns largely dominated the Game^^ but also for that there are mods with or without it's fun to paly (Y).\nThis is my very first review i hope it's not so bad written by and sry for my english =>\n\nPro\nNice Prologue.\nSingle Player Campaign.\nMultiplayer Campaign with friends a lot of fun.\nWorkshop.\nBeautiful Graphics and Atmosphere.\nDLCs ​​(Yes, it is always very controversial but who do not like it does not have to buy it ;))\nTurn-Based Game\nCombat System Scissors Stone Paper principle\n\nContra\nVariations of the Voices.\nStrong Huns with there siege equipment which in my opinion are too strong with countless stacks.\nKI (They is not able to capture the city during the siege and sacks only.)\nPoor optimization of the Game.\nFew Factions in the Main Game available only with the DLCs are exciting.\nWeak Bows Units no harm except the crossbow.\n\nOn the whole, a really great and enjoyable Game that can be purchased at the full price without having to consider =)\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nDeutsch\n\nMein erstes Total War Spiel der Reihe überhaupt, ich muss sagen es gefällt mir immer noch auch nach 300h+ Spielzeit. Am Anfang war ich sehr begeistert klar ist warscheinlich bei jedem so wen was neu ist^^ ich habe mich dann direkt für die Nordmänner entschieden (Jüten) der Anführer und die ganze Familie sind echt cool und es war eine riesige Freude nach und nach mit meiner Fraktion Bündnisse oder Kriegserklärungen zu schmieden die Dörfer auszubauen und die Armee aufzubauen, erobern etc. etc.. Das Politische System gefällt mir auch gut nur ich hätte mir mehr Variationen in der Stimme gewünscht das nicht jeder die gleiche Stimme hat auf Dauer wirkts einfalls los. Ohne den Workshop bleibt es ein gutes Spiel nach ner weile aber nimmts die Spannung. Mit dem Workshop hat man viele neue Möglichkeiten es noch mehr zu geniessen als zuvor und ausserdem machen die Modder eine saubere und sehr gute Mods die sie uns zur Verfügung stellen. Ich kann Total War Attila nur empfehlen auch an die die nicht mit der Reihe bewandert ist so wie ich ;)\nes macht aufjedenfall ein haufen Spass. Das einzige was mich im prinzip stört ist das es der Untergang Roms ist und die Hunnen das Spiel grossteils dominieren^^ aber auch dafür gibts Mods mit oder ohne es macht Spass (Y). Dies ist mein aller erstes Review hoffe es ist nicht dermassen schlecht geschrieben =>\n\nPro\nNetter Prolog\nEinzelspieler Kampagne.\nMehrspieler Kampagne mit Freunden ein richtiger Spass.\nWorkshop.\nSchöne Grafik und Atmosphäre.\nDLCs (Ja es ist immer sehr umstritten das Thema aber wer es nicht mag muss es auch nicht zwingend kaufen. ;))\nRundenbasiert\nKampfsystem Scheren Stein Papier Prinzip\n\nKontra\nVariationen der Stimmen.\nStarke Hunnen mit zahllosen Stacks dazu deren Belagerungsgeräte die meiner Meinung zu stark sind.\nKI (Die nicht im stande ist bei der Belagerung die Stadt einzunehmen und plündert nur.)\nSchlechte Optimierung des Spiels.\nWenige Fraktionen im Hauptspiel vorhanden erst mit den DLCs spannender.\nSchwache Bogeneinheiten die kein Schaden anrichten ausser der Armbrustschützen.\n\nIm Grossen und Ganzen ein super Spiel das zu dem Vollpreis gekauft werden kann ohne bedenken zu haben.\nLg","October 18, 2015","true","382.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Both the campaign map and the battle map color scemes are far better, making the terrain more realistic and crisp looking. The AI is also definetly improved, as when I was in battle, the huns act different and attack different than the Goths, and so on for all the factions. Also, viking factions seem to go more for a naval army, and inland germanic factions go for a lot of land, so the campaign AI is balanced to adapt to it's surroundings, where ever that may be. I also must say the music is a good improvment, as rome 2's music seemed boring at times, Attila's music is definetly adding to the overall immersion of the game.\n\nI have, however found some early bugs and overlooked details, such as in some battles (mainly siege battles) the AI units get caught on an invisible barrier, or they all want to go stand on exactly the same spot, creating circular groups of bodies that won't stop running towards the center of the blob, until attacked. On one occasion, even, my units got caught on an invisible barrier, and attempted to go around it by trying to walk into the sea? Another topic I would like to bring to attention is in siege battles, if you attack by land and the AI has a mix of land and naval units, it can choose to not disembark its artillery or archers, so in minor settlements even if you wipe out the entire enemy force, you can't win the battle because of a few boats just sitting off shore, out of ammo and useless. These are all minor bugs, and I know they will be fixed, probably within the first patch, so I don't let them feel too immersion breaking.\n\nI could go on and on about how many improvments there are, but in my opinion the ones listed are the major ones. overall this game gets a 9/10.","February 17, 2015","true","116.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

This game is certainly an improvement on RTW2, but in reality, it is nothing more than a reskin of that game and the changes that have been implemented should have also been included in RTW2. That they haven't speaks volumes about the mindset of the devs.\n\nDespite this, game play is nothing to write home about and I didn’t find myself excited by this game during any stage. Unlike other incarnations of the series prior to RTW2, I never felt engaged by my empire building. Indeed a continual sense of frustration was about the only coherent thread running through my time with this game.\n\nThe issues that ruined play are still there. I won’t go into boring detail, as many of the other players have already pointed them out. Limits on Armies that don’t seem to apply to the AI and which turn the task of resupplying armies into a micromanagement nightmare. A province system that forces you to overextend if you want to fully develop your lands and which just feels arbitrary and clunky.\n\nThe encyclopaedia function was bugged and on several occasions required a restart to get working and then had a “yet to be translated” message plastered all over entries, despite the fact that I am plying in English.\n\nUnit rosters are dull, limited and without variety as shared by fairly much everyone. Much yawnage to be had.\n\nAnd perhaps worse, is that the game has shipped with only a fraction of the actual game content activated and we are expected to buy the rest of it in instalments that will most likely end up more than doubling the cost of the game.\n\nReality is that the previous incarnations of the series are far better investments for your time, energy and money and have the benefit of having a complete game at purchase.\n\nI don't recommend this game to any but the most die hard, or carelessly rich.\n","June 28, 2015","false","59.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Also when it's not your turn they just get ignore. You cannot set the in a way to prevent land troops to not get on your coasts.\n- Various bugs with the fire (graphics)\n- Units unlock progression sucks, thanks to this so badly designed technology tree\n- Traditions - unlock system sucks\n- Ability points for the characters - unlock system sucks\n- The barricade placements when defending a town is most of the time ridiculous and useless\n- When grouping units with control, you have to unlock the formation every time with CTRL+G\n- The way special units (spy, champion and priest) were working was way better before\n- Coop campaign still has desyncs\n- The city colonization process costs way too much money, it is just stupid\n- The conversion costs of building is ridiculous (Take a city in a good state, pay 9000 to change buildings to your "style". "Ok, let's transfrom 400 ACN Britain's latin stone buildings into wooden huts for the fun of spending your money ..."\n- ...\n\nI could continue but it is not necessary I think. There are some features that were great improvements, but other than that there is not much to it.\n\nPros :\n- Great graphics\n- Sea units are now more efficient than "regular" land units, in a sea battle\n- The genealogic tree system is great\n- The "fear" and troops morale system is great\n- The new nordic cultures are interesting (even if they really did a poor job with other factions, like the Saxons)\n- The "horde" concept is interesting\n- Religious system is interesting\n- Fertility concept is great but needs heavy tweaking\n\nThere might be other things but anyway, I did not enjoy the game as much as I would have wanted to.\nIf you played to Rome II, you will probably be disappointed too.\n\nI dont recommend this game in it's curent state, unless you plan to heavily mod it, thanks to the workshop and people doing CA's job when they make a bad release.","June 1","false","57.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","2"

I sympathise with a lot of the negative reviews, and I understand what they're talking about in their reviews. Though in my Opinion this game really isn't so bad that it deserves a negative review, and I really don't hate this title, I think it could be one of the better Total War Titles.\n\nThough the AI is markably better than Rome II's AI, it's still not that smart... at all. My experience with rivercrossing battles and Town Battles is one of a slaughter. With a spear infantry core and basic ranged support can keep the most powerful enemy armies in check, unless the numbers are disproportionately against you. There are no tactics to try lower possible casualties, they just rush in at you. This slaughter is even worse if you have pike units, who cannot be beaten in melee, and occasionally cause scenes like in Rome II where they simply plough down large groups of charging enemies. The other battles seem much the same, with most City Siges won or lost at the walls with no battles in the streets. Its more a matter of numbers than anything at this point, with increasing the difficulty only making the units harder to beat, not making use of tactics.\n\nHowever, Campaign map AI has improved. It raises its own well rounded and massive armies (The effects of which are apparantly of now consequence to the AI nation) and will attack and defend where required. They fight you where they can, and retreat where they don't have the numbers. You fight in the open, they sige you, they expand (Not really unless you use mods, otherwise they just burn down the whole world around them and create a dead zone around them with no neighbours.) However again, the AI nations seem impervious to huge ammounts of Squalor and apparantly have no budget. There are no political instabilities within their Nations themselves, and seem to suffer no setbacks when they lose their National Leaders or heirs.\n\nAnother small note is that Naval battles just seem to not exist or not be anywhere near as fun or intresting. The only navies that I tend to see are just generals transporting their troops across the seas. It does feel like it plays a very big side note in all of the game, unlike what it has been in all previous titles.\n\nBut regardless of all these things, I still have hours and hours of fun when I play Attila, and dont see these problems as thigns that can't be fixed in coming titles and improved upon.","November 26, 2015","true","601.0"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

It is not a review of SEGA/CA's DLC spam. You can find my opinion on that DLC in my reviews of those DLC packs and at the end of this review. (Hint: It's not positive)\n\nRome 1 had this neat expansion pack (do people even remember expansion packs anymore?) called Barbarian Invasion that covered the final days of the Roman Empire. It was pretty cool, depicting a dissent-ridden Roman Empire trying to hold off a large number of barbarian invaders. When Rome 2 came along, which basically shows the rise of Rome, it was pretty much expected that a re-release of Barbarian Invasion would come eventually too.\n\nAnd so it did, though in the form of an entirely separate game rather than an expansion. However, as much as one might think this is just Rome 2 again but sold at the price of a full game, this is very much its own beast. Much has changed, and improved, since Rome 2. Family trees are back, ranged weapons actually pack a punch again (yet still can be managed by abilities such as testudo), and the game itself has some new mechanics that can be *really* immersive.\n\nLets make it clear that, thus far, i've only played as Western Rome, but since this era is basically about the fall of Western Rome that is basically the faction to choose if you want to experience what most would consider to be the "main perspective" of this era. And holy hell is it a dark perspective. Like in Barbarian Invasion, dissent is rampant, your armies are weak and not the mighty legions of Rome 2, and you will be attacked by lots of people on the Rhine/Danube frontier. And by attacked I mean SWARMED.\n\nIt's relatively mild at first, but then the "climate change" mechanic (winter is coming, literally) kicks in which, at fixed points during the campaign, the fertility of the whole map is reduced - meaning you generate less food. Food is extremely important here, as without it you will have insane dissent, army desertion, and.... that's bad enough, to be honest. But since each province has its own "fertility" rating, it means that the lands richest in food, and therefore most desireable to own, can be found in the lands that were traditionally the most well-off during this period: Italy, Southern Gaul, Spain, Africa, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. The areas beyond the Rhine/Danube basically become uninhabitable, forcing those who live there to either find somewhere else to settle (read: lands owned by Romans) or to wither away and die. In other words, the game itself forces migrations into Roman lands on a scale like what actually happened.\n\nAnd then come the Huns. The Huns were the ones mainly responsible for the mass migrations into Roman land, on account of their tendency to burn and pillage everything in their path. Early on, they are a stronger than average barbarian faction that raids frequently and can be difficult to fight due to their very good cavalry forces. But they only get more dangerous as time passes, and it reaches its peak when Attila himself shows up at the head of doomstack after doomstack of Hun armies that crush all in their path. Once you hit this point, ending Attila's life becomes a matter of life and death for the Romans. The Hun doomstacks will keep coming until he is dead, and they will do terrible damage to armies and provinces. I had several battles against the Hunnic hordes where I would have 3 full armies (~60 units) engage a similarly sized pack of Huns and walk away with a third or less of my troops. You have to setup your forces specifically to defeat the Huns (anti-cavalry and something to kill all those horse archers) or else you will get rolled over. Fighting off the Huns was some of the most vicious and difficult gameplay i've ever faced in a Total War game.\n\nBut even after that, the ongoing problems of invasions, dissent, and dwindling food supplies don't go away. If anything they get worse. All of these invasions, worsening conditions, and constant need to fix problems that never stop coming makes for a very different sort of Total War game. While in other games you start small and build a mighty empire, here you are far more concerned with simply surviving and maintaining what you have rather than going off to conquer. Total War: Attila, in short, feels like the world is facing the apocalypse itself, and that by the time it is over little, if anything, will remain alive.\n\nI enjoyed this experience quite a bit, but Attila has some problems too. While playing as Western Rome is supposed to be extremely difficult (they, after all, did not survive this era), the immigration mechanic that is non-stop for the WRE is obnoxious and adds an additional unfun and unfixable problem that needs to be dealt with. Basically, it's a massive dissent hit for all of your provinces that you just have to put up with, and nothing you will do will make it go away for anything longer than the short-term. Second, while the doomstacks the Huns keep spawning around year 420 and beyond when Attila is unleashed upon the game do add to the atmosphere, it is a bit excessive and leads to repetitive (albeit intense) battles until you finally manage to bring Attila down. Lastly, I found it really obnoxious how Eastern Rome, which did survive this era largely intact, got eaten alive by the AI Sassanids and Rebels. Based on what i've read, this is a not uncommon experience for people playing the game. In a game that does historical setting and immersion really well, it was annoying to have to see one of the only nations that endured this era to just roll over and die so quickly.\n\nAnd lastly, there's the DLC spam. I may be reviewing the main game itself here rather than the DLC here, but SEGA/CA really went too far with the DLC for this game. Rome 2 was bad, but this feels even worse somehow. While you can still play the game, all the factions locked off by that DLC are the actions of an asshat publisher/developer that seem to have no shame about their blatant cash-grabbing for content that should have been in the main game.\n\nMy opinion of Attila is overall positive. It's better than Rome 2 and is probably the most interesting Total War game i've played simply by being different and using the mechanics to create a compelling and immersive experience. But it has its problems, and the volume of DLC is ridiculous.\n\nSo, as for getting this game I say two things: It's worth it, and get it at a 75% discount or higher in order to hand over as little money as possible to those tossers over at SEGA/CA for their DLC BS. I may enjoy Attila greatly, but SEGA/CA are now officially on my game publisher/developer shitlist next to the likes of EA, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros. They need to clean up their act or lose customers such as myself who can always find other fun games to play.\n\nWoohoo Apocalyptic Winter.","March 17","true","92.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'd suggest getting some marshmellows and a stick, because it's going to burn.

(I recommend Radius BTW)\n\n-Don't buy the DLC's just because, no point in feeding CA and chances are you might no even play the factions you buy, (kind of like the nomad factions in Rome 2.)\n\n-Lastly, this game needs some time, if you can wait, give it about 6 months for CA to hopefully get their sh*t together.

The battles feel smooth and streamlined, where other Total War titles' battles felt, at times, clunky, tedious, and repetative. The new campaign features, such as the family tree, razing, and resettlement, keep the campaign interesting in my opinion.\n\nHowever, to touch on what others are saying that I agree with that is unfortunately bad or missing about this game, is the DLC. I understand that Creative Assembly is first and foremost a company, existing to make money, with providing entertainment seeming almost like a byproduct. While SOME DLC would be acceptable or even expected, this is truly dragging my willingness to purchase future CA titles. I paid for the Vikings culture pack, (Because F**k yeah vikings) but I don't think I'll be purchasing any future DLC. With the exception of the almost inevitable Blood&Gore DLC.\n\nCA, I'm begging you. Make the blood&gore DLC a "Free"LC. It's something that should be in the game in the first place. I understand that you want to appeal to a younger crowd as well, and therefore keep a lower rating, but really. In Shogun:Total war, you had an option to turn blood off.(After purchasing the "DLC.")

It all comes down to what you want to compare it to.\nTo me it is a clear single player upgrade to Rome 2. They have refined everything, and built upon what worked in Rome 2.\nThey have been keeping up with the weird tradition of adding DLC factions in small quantities. What would help them actually motivate this is if they kept on updating and patching the older DLC factions as well. It royally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off that they started adding faction quest lines with additional content to the newer DLC factions, but ignored the first ones and just let them be. There is such a thing as bad DLCs at the moment.\nFrom a MP standpoint the game is more stable than Rome 2, but from an online combat standpoint it's a bit disappointing. The maps are really detailed and a clear upgrade from any TW game before. But the unit balance is very icky at the moment.

Fighting off the Huns was some of the most vicious and difficult gameplay i've ever faced in a Total War game.\n\nBut even after that, the ongoing problems of invasions, dissent, and dwindling food supplies don't go away. If anything they get worse. All of these invasions, worsening conditions, and constant need to fix problems that never stop coming makes for a very different sort of Total War game. While in other games you start small and build a mighty empire, here you are far more concerned with simply surviving and maintaining what you have rather than going off to conquer. Total War: Attila, in short, feels like the world is facing the apocalypse itself, and that by the time it is over little, if anything, will remain alive.\n\nI enjoyed this experience quite a bit, but Attila has some problems too. While playing as Western Rome is supposed to be extremely difficult (they, after all, did not survive this era), the immigration mechanic that is non-stop for the WRE is obnoxious and adds an additional unfun and unfixable problem that needs to be dealt with. Basically, it's a massive dissent hit for all of your provinces that you just have to put up with, and nothing you will do will make it go away for anything longer than the short-term. Second, while the doomstacks the Huns keep spawning around year 420 and beyond when Attila is unleashed upon the game do add to the atmosphere, it is a bit excessive and leads to repetitive (albeit intense) battles until you finally manage to bring Attila down. Lastly, I found it really obnoxious how Eastern Rome, which did survive this era largely intact, got eaten alive by the AI Sassanids and Rebels. Based on what i've read, this is a not uncommon experience for people playing the game. In a game that does historical setting and immersion really well, it was annoying to have to see one of the only nations that endured this era to just roll over and die so quickly.\n\nAnd lastly, there's the DLC spam. I may be reviewing the main game itself here rather than the DLC here, but SEGA/CA really went too far with the DLC for this game. Rome 2 was bad, but this feels even worse somehow. While you can still play the game, all the factions locked off by that DLC are the actions of an asshat publisher/developer that seem to have no shame about their blatant cash-grabbing for content that should have been in the main game.\n\nMy opinion of Attila is overall positive. It's better than Rome 2 and is probably the most interesting Total War game i've played simply by being different and using the mechanics to create a compelling and immersive experience. But it has its problems, and the volume of DLC is ridiculous.\n\nSo, as for getting this game I say two things: It's worth it, and get it at a 75% discount or higher in order to hand over as little money as possible to those tossers over at SEGA/CA for their DLC BS. I may enjoy Attila greatly, but SEGA/CA are now officially on my game publisher/developer shitlist next to the likes of EA, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros. They need to clean up their act or lose customers such as myself who can always find other fun games to play.\n\nWoohoo Apocalyptic Winter.","March 17","true","92.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fans of real-time strategy games, turn-based strategy games, or both, should play this game. Despite this series' rocky history regarding polished experiences, Total War: ATTILA delivers a compeling experience. Coupled with a vibrant modding community and interesting downloadable campaigns in the form of DLC, this title should be held equal to the classics such as Rome: Total War and Medieval II: Total War; titles easily regarded as this series' pinacle.\n\nPROS\nThe ability to field huge armies in real-time battles - I fought a battle with approximately 10,000 men seiging a fortified city without major performance drops on high- to maximum-settings\nNew game mechanics including Re-settlement and Political Intrigues,\nA return of the family tree, also with new game mechanics allowing you to influence marriages, political support, decrees to office, assassinations, defamations...and the list goes on,\nIndividually tailoured national objectives which you can use to guide your conquest,\nAddictive pseudo-RPG system for generals, characters and forces,\nAmazingly detailed units, battle maps, and campaign maps,\nA highly detailed and diverse range of settlement types represented on the real-time battle map,\nOverall excellent graphics and performance,\nCONS\nSome campaigns have balancing issues. For example, Mercia, despite being described as "Starting Challenge: Easy", had initial turns more difficult than the Danes, who are described as "Starting Challenge: Hard",\nSomewhat limited faction diversity, and for some factions, limited unit diversity,\nSome DLC packs are done poorly, and are obvious "cash-grabs",\n\nCONCLUSIONS...\nA great return to the Total War series, this title is not only addictive and fun to play, but it is also marvelous to look at and encompasses a scale in a manner that isn't captured in any other strategy game on the market - not one I have played anyway.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622913270\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=622913333\nCombining turn-based grand campaign strategy with real-time military engagements is the defining factor of the Total War series. Establishing power and growing your kingdom or empire while personally commanding your armies in real-time battles is an addictive experience that keeps you justifying "one more turn". Combine interesting game mechanics such provincial management, politics, assassinations, pseudo-RPG systems, army traditions (again...the list goes on), and you have a truly unique strategy experience.\n\nWhile the title does have some flaws, they are minor in comparison to everything Creative Assebly have done correctly. I am now thuroughly looking forward to playing through a Roman campaign in "Total War: ROME II" and conquering the known world, followed by a Western or Eastern Rome campaign in "Total War: ATTILA" where I have to fend off the barbarian hordes and defend my empire.\n\n\n_______________________\nRANKING DESCRIPTIONS\n\nScore        Description                1        This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!                2        Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.                3        Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.                4        I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.                5        While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.                6        An "average" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...                7        A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.                8        An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.                9        A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.                10        PERFECT.

See the metaphore there? We crave for a Total War game, with true DLC. I mean don't make us pay for factions we essentially already bought.. That was a thing that just bothered me a lot in Rome II and it is no different in Attila (although i heard Age of Charlemagne was pretty cool). I could really go on about this, just talking about the DLC alone. That being said, gameplay wise, the game is "loyal" to what you would expect form a TW game except here you get to wander around as the Huns which in my opinion is pretty awesome. Lots of new features and tons of mods as always.

It surely  wasn't as much fun as the original,it was buggy,unstable,it was a bit ,well  weird,certainly  wonky and a lot of us started to feel there was something seriously wrong with CA and Total War.The game should not have been released how it was and a lot of us felt ripped off by all those DLC's they wanted us buy and that should have been  included in the price we paid for a dud game.\nBut good news,despite the fact that I am a bit cynical now re. CA and Sega,both,got to acclaim  "Attila" Its a very good game and for me at least catches the magic of how a Total War game used to be and should be." Attila" is fun,engrossing, the AI is tough, the game doesn't appear to have bugs (yeah yeah I know if you are a Saxon you've got to fight the Franks but is that really a bug?) its stable ,clever, quite pretty and the music is very good. I even  brought one of the afore  mentioned much  hated DLC's (Celtic pack) and that also is very good and at 10 bucks value perhaps.(About the same price as cup of coffee and a muffin  after all.)There is a lot of game there , its tough and for me historically interesting.. All in all "Attilla" is a good game and reassures me that CA  is back on track.Well sort off ;what on earth is this Warhammer thing? Whats wrong with the 30 year war?or WW1 or the US or English civil war? Or Empire 2. Ah well at least "Attila " is a good one.

Graphics are excellent.  Improvements as compared to Rome II include the following:\n-Fire mechanics are impressive.\n-Crossbows are introduced as well as axe infantry and neither of these are present in Rome II.  This adds more variety to the game.\n-The game play is a little bit slower than Rome II, which is a good thing.  In Rome II the calvary charges came too fast and could deciminate archers before you have sufficient time to react.\n\nThe game is worse than Rome II in the following aspects:\n-There are no banners for each faction.  This is really terrible.  All of the banners on your team look identical and the ones on the other team look identical (either blue or yellow).  This makes the game less visually appealing and makes it more diffcult to assess the battle you are facing.  Considering how easy it would be to fix this issue, it makes one wonder why they don't do it.\n-The "start battle" glitch is still in the game, same as Rome II.\n-There is a new glitch that was not present in Rome II.  In Rome II, to group and organize units all one must do is press G to group the units and then right click to drag the units into a line.  In Attila, you must first group the units and then you need to manually select the type of formation that is desired and finally you get to drag the line.  This is a bit more laborious and is not necessary because this system was perfectly designed in Rome II and all they did is mess it up.\n-In Rome II the archers would shoot at the unit you select it to shoot at.  In Attila, the archers shoot generally in the direction you ask it to shoot but not necessarily at the actual unit in which you intend to hit.  The archers shoot in that general vicinity hitting a variety of units.  Not sure if this is intentionally or a glitch that was not present in Rome II.","December 20, 2015","true","215.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

ATTIL, though hard to run, has stunning graphics and a great atsmopher in which you strive to  maintain your kingdom, but also to conquer other kingdoms.\n\nDespite the reviews ATTILa is not bad game. Though not the best within the franchise it still is a fun and enjoyable game. The game brings back features from the previous Total War games and adds new features within comabat and diplomacy. There is mechanics that work well and there are some that don't. The ai in ATTILa is... special. At random moments the ai will just run back and forth wearing out there men and not attacking you. Sometimes though, the ai will do something smart and put you in tough positions w/ criticle outcomes.\n\nIf your a history nut then you'll apreciate this game w/o all of the mechanics, combat and diplomacy. The game allows you to play as the corrupted roman halfs, the barbarous Kingdoms, The persian empire, Great Migrators, and even the Huns w/ their legendary General ATTILA. Though there is much replayability to this is as you don't have to follow the historcle timeline and if you wanted to, could resotre rome to it's former glory by conquering the entire map!\n\nThe game has a thing w/ fire and destruction giving you the ability to raze a settlemen or catch one on w/ fire. ATTILA has great seiges, though are sometimes buggy, and well forged combat system making the battles more strategy then just brute force(although that works sometimes). The diplomacy aswell can have strategy to it aswell as the decisions you make carry impact to what could or could not happen.\n\nHowever, the DLC for this game is horrible. The few good ones being the last roman campaing and the age of charlemagne. the rest just being silly cultures packs that add about 2 factions to game for 8$.\n\nOverall this game is, though not perfect, enjoyable espicially if you love history. It offers alot, like the strategic battles and diplomatic decisions w/ historicle starting zones, but the ability to change the historicle timeline. It takes alot aswell though, making certain parts being buggy and laggy w/ glitches. I feel that this game has alot of potential. But 60% of the times, games live up to that potential. Sadly this game is the 40%, though it's still great, if could have been alot better.\n\nRating For Total War ATTILA:  7.8/10","December 27, 2015","true","182.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Polishing up Rome II‘s original dynasty system (or lack thereof), the nobles of your house and faction play important roles as governors, generals, and councillors, each position granting its own factional and personal bonuses. Without loyal retainers, your doomed to civil war–which, in its own way, can be played to your favor, expunging political rivals who bark louder than they can bite.","February 9","true","130.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","7"

It enjoyed a stable launch, is extremely difficult, places a much greater value on specific characters, and it’s as un-optimized as the Red Army in Afghanistan. The game itself takes place in Late Antiquity and sees the player tasked with either defending their already pre-existing empire (East/West Roman and Sassanid) or attempting to topple the giants as one of the smaller barbarian or dessert peoples. So the question is, will you attempt to save civilization? Or destroy it? And… well… is the game even any good?\n\nTo answer that last question quickly, yes the game is very good, and difficult, extremely difficult. However, instead of continuing with a normal review, I will instead give you guys an amusing story.\n\nStep 1.) Play as WRE\nStep 2.) Get owned\nStep 3.) Try again\nStep 4.) Lose\nStep 5.) Try again\nStep 6.) Marry away 17 year old girl to 55 year old man for money (Roma Invicta!)\nStep 7.) Our Emperor has at least 7 illegitimate children (Staph man!)\nStep 8.) Kill the Batman\nStep 8.) Heir to throne gets an attribute called “flaccid”, he doesn’t have any kids…..\nStep 9.) Fight more wars, lose Africa\nStep 10.) 3 wars and two plagues later, family is all dead, have to bring in new guy\nStep 11.) Go public with an IPO of $55.\nStep 12.) Stock goes up, shareholder very pleased\nStep 13.) Board wants result, so I try harder\nStep 14.) Board says they are not pleased and fire me, something about unethical\nStep 15.) Say NO, I am an artist!\nStep 16.) Counter invade Gaul\nStep 17.) Burn down everything!\nStep 18.) End up killing Girl I sold off earlier on accident (such is life in the zone)\nStep 19.) Get Owned by Attila and never-ending Doomstacks of Huns….\n\nAnd that’s really what you need to know about Total War: Attila. Like all TW games it has faults, like dumb(ish) AI and enough DLC to bankrupt a Super PAC. But what Attila does right, is enough to make up for its admittedly smaller number of mistakes when compared to Rome 2.\n","February 12","true","132.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","4","6","4","0"

Thank you\n\nThis is more of an introduction to the game and my opinions instead of a 'review'. I don't really have any method to my madness, I just start writing about what comes to mind first, I hope you enjoy the read!\n\nFactions\nYou can play as the rapidly declining Roman factions who start with a large number of regions but very little military power. Oh, did I mention that they are surrounded by nomadic factions (some hostile) trying to flee west to get away from the rampaging Huns? You can also play as the Huns (Attila) conquering everything in your path.  Alternatively, you can choose one of the fairly weak (by comparison) nomadic factions who are the first factions the Hun's come across. As the Visigoth's, I made for the sea and travelled to Spain to start my empire.\n\nAI\nI feel the AI has been significantly improved over Rome 2, I'd say it's the best it's ever been. In battle it's aggressive, so don't expect them to sit down until your ranged units use up all of their ammo, and they will make you charge them if they have a ranged advantage. In sieges I haven't had the AI mess up allowing me to exploit them once yet (an old common issue),  it's always on the move and you'll need to be on your toes to stop them from flanking you.\n\nOn the campaign map however, the AI still acts strangely sometimes. I've had a faction declare war on me, send an army just outside of one of my ports and kept it there for a few turns only to beg for peace, and then brought the units in closer to my port the next turn. I can't expect a perfect AI, but it's pretty silly to see sometimes.\n\nFamily\nThe family system is more involved than it was in, say Medieval 2, but it's not anything special. It's a battle within your  faction, trying to gain total power over it.  Though the more power you gain the more corruption you'll face (which is a loss of income and public order). There are certain events that can pop up, but it's all based on chance and using up your character's 'influence' and there's not much beyond that.  It's very basic and feels like a chore at times. I'd love to see a more complex and rewarding family system in a future game.\n\nDiplomacy\nHaving played Medieval 2, Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2 in the recent past I have to say Attila's diplomacy is also the best it's ever been. I've never had a friendly nation declare war on me nor had a hostile factions trade with me unless I bribed them with something. You have to build up your reputation with factions by starting with a non-aggression pact which will build positive relations with them over time, though nothing is ever a guarantee. A lot of factors go into this, such as your deals or wars with their enemies or friends. There are also religious factors and even something akin to jealousy comes into play. These have been in the TW games for a while now,  but everything seems to be fully explained making it helpful for figuring out how to overcome certain obstacles.\n\nAgents\nAgent's are as helpful as ever. The name's vary between factions, but break down to: Assassin, Priest and Champion. The assassin pokes holes in and poison people, introduces fire to buildings and can improve the black market in their deployed region. The Priest spreads religion and improves public order in friendly regions, can lower public order in an enemy's, and can increase the integrity of an army. The Champion can train your troops in an army, scout out areas and can incite unrest in enemy lands. It's really nice to see the agent's having more varied roles.\n\nArmies / Units\nThe number of units is about on par with normal Total War games, the Visigoths for example, have ~36 different units. In Medieval 2, England has ~35 units. You have your spearmen, swordsmen, skirmishers, archers, calvary and siege engines as you'd expect, but there are different flavor's of each type. For example, there are armored swordsmen units with high armor and defense values though have slower movement speeds and mediocre charge bonus values making them perfect for head on fights. Then, there are lightly armored, fast, 'light infantry' with high charge and attack values making them perfect for flanking but s bad choice for a prolonged engagement due to the poor armor and defense values.\n\nCavalry, while not quite as numerous as the infantry, are quite varied too. Some just have swords and shields and are a solid mobile unit that can stay in a fight for quite a while. Others have spears and are a great to counter to enemy calvary and have high charge values but generally lower armor and defense values so keeping them engaged is a poor idea (cycle charge!). There are also archer and javelin skirmisher cavalry as well making them very well rounded units.\n\nUnit growth\nYou start out with being able to recruit tier 1 units and through research unlock higher tier units which are basically advanced versions with increased stats and sometimes new skills. When you research a new tech that unlocks replacements it will allow you to retrain your obsolete units, but retraining has a cost and the new units will have an increased upkeep cost as well. I really enjoyed this as I was being introduced to new units throughout the campaign and my old units kept their ranks as they evolved into something new. If you remember Rome 1 & 2 with the Marian reforms which were pretty much a downgrade at worst and a side grade at best.. this is nothing like that. There are no downsides to it besides the initial cost and upkeep.\n\nA better building builder\nIn Rome 2, before the Emperor's Edition update, the building management was a mess to say the least. Buildings and their advantages (and disadvantages) were poorly explained and I had a very hard time figuring out what would be best to build. Maybe I was just too dumb before, but in Attila can form a plan on how I want to set up certain regions very easily. For example I've set up one region for recruiting solders so it would give bonuses to their starting rank, stats and morale. In another region I set it up to maximize agricultural income. I'll have a region in a central area set up to reduce squalor and spread religion and increase public order in it's surrounding regions. If you want to get as much out of these regions as possible you'll need to take some time to plan but it's worth it!\n\nIn brief\nSo, do I like this game? Yes and I'd recommend it to any fan of the series and to strategy fans in general. It isn't my favorite in the series (due to the time period), but I'd say that this is the best game from a technical standpoint. It runs great with a 4 year old rig with everything on max. The UI is nice to look at and easy to use. The combat feels great and rewards tactics over mindless fast clicking, and the sieges feel intense again. The building system is easy to understand and should help you plan out your buildings better than before. The units are varied enough from faction to faction making different playthroughs feel quite different by having different army compositions as well as the starting locations. The graphics and sound are wonderful as you'd expect. I can't think of many bad things to say about the game to be honest. You can't go wrong with buying this on one of the frequent sales where it's around $10.\n\nThank you for reading this, I hope I was of some help\nFeedback is always appreciated as long as it's civil","March 19","true","125.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While I can play Rome 2 on max settings 60FPS, this is impossible in Attila, I get less than 20 FPS and 10 FPS when zoomed into battles. The issue lies with terrible optimization for multicore CPU that causes bottleneck. The issue got fixed with R2 Emperor Edition because of the terrible backlash.\n\nWell guess what, CA definitely learned its lession, FOR THE WORSE. It still chose to release a broken product, but instead of acknolwedgeing the issues, which will force it to fix them, it says that the game isn't even made for the current gen, so BLAME YOUR HARDWARE if your game's performance sucks. For sure, this game plays smoothly if you have a water-cooled rig with 4,9 GHz and high end GPU (GPU's not that important for this game).

Great graphics, in depth strategy, hundreds of hours of content here. Most technical issues have to do with the fact this is a very demanding game on ones system. However with a powerful enough system the Battles are stunning, the attention to detail both historically and visually is great. Now the problem with the game has nothing to do with the game, but rather segas terrible dlc system.\n\n$75 of dlcs on top of a $45 dollar game.\n\nThis is not as bad as Rome 2 which is still $60 and has $85 I. Dlcs.\n\nThis is a shame to see in what is such a beloved franchise. Now I am not against dlcs, or individually pricing them at this rate. But with no option to have a season pass,which is standard on nearly every AAA title that plans on doing dlcs; there is no other conclusion to draw other than that sega is squeezing te gamers for every penny. Now while most of these dlcs are a welcome addition to the game, one in particular has drawn the ire of I'm sure every total war gamer.\n\nThe blood and gore dlcs that have been seen in shogun 2, Rome 2, Attila 2, and I'm sure Warhammer, is nothing short than proof of the fact that sega is sticking it to gamers and bleeding them dry. This "dlc" should have been in game at time of release and it's quite sad that what was once a beloved franchise has to resort to penny pinching.\n\nAlternatively look what Bethesda with the fallout series has done, heck even the behemoth call of duty has a season pass. Come on sega do the right thing.\nOverall if you have $100 plus to spend on Attila and it's dlcs than go for it, but if you are like the rest of us who have bills, and money that does not grow on trees, wait till it goes on sale.","May 28","false","13.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","4"

The whole mood is way different, which I think is the biggest improvement for me over Rome II.  In Rome it felt like each battle was meaningless; you were probably going to win, and even if you didn't, the only consequence was losing out on some meaningless conquest in the corner of the world.\n\nIn Attila, it is entirely different. Playing as the Eastern Romans, if you do not meet the enemy in the field and win, the barbarians will raze and pillage your cities. You are not fighting for glory, you are fighting for survival. I get nervous for each outnumbered battle I fight, because I know that if I lose, I am opening up my heartland to irrevirsible destruction.\n\nSo far the only bugs I have experienced involve pathfinding issues, which occurred when a fortress spawned on a slope, and despite the walls being buried underground, I could still not send units over them. However, this seems like a minor issue to me.\n\nOn the optimization side, I have experienced no problems whatsoever with my year-old graphics card. I'm pretty sure that all the people complaining about crashes/low framerates are too ignorant to update their drivers, so... sucks to them?\n\nAll and all a great game, and a worthy contender for being my favorite Total War game yet!","February 18, 2015","true","136.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

(STILL no convinsed on hords lol)\n\nPro's:\n-Graphical increase scales nicely\n-Difficulty\n-New management sysems more in depth management of family\n-UI throwback to the midevil total war system of upgrading units by having upgrade trees nothing you wont instantly recognise if your a vet\n-Vets will have no problem jumping in\n-Dificulty increased\n-Units attack and defend smoothly you dont seem to have the 5 min stand offs that ROME had.\n-Better tech tree's "IMO"\n-Faster Load times!\n-You can assign offices and region Governerors\n-Additions of mechanics dating back to midevil total war like the tree look and upgrades of characters.\n-Family mechanics! added complexity to each turn!\nPro/Con:\nhords after playing for a while im editing this to say that the computer makes use of this mechanic for no apperant reason so im still not convinsed it works as intended.\n\nCON:\nHords? this is a personal opinion however. you might like :)\nBugs that cause crash to desktop (since this is a day one review) 2 times so far\nPerformance suffers\n\nI cant think of many cons right now except for whats listed.\n\nAttila is a nice change of pace from Rome, it is harder especially if you try the crumbling empires. The new mechanics added to the game are basically overhauled tech tree with more tech to choose from. Family mechanics however these are easy and havnt impacted my games but could have if i didnt pay attention. The battles seem to flow better the units attack swiftly so i dont feel like im watching a stale mate when heavies are attacking each other which is nice. The biggest addition though if your coming from ROME is the addition of migration and hords, you can abbandon your settlements and turn your whole civilization into a hord which makes all your towns into units that can settle. you can upgrade your hords with buildings etc however you wont get the raw income like a city however your mobile. the downside to this is when you convert you loose all your upgrades and buildings, then you have to start over when you settle your hord. so basically you use it as a last ditch effort to run but if your doing that bad chances are your not going to last long anyway. one way to use Abbandon is if you see a large army coming to attack your settlement you can abbandon it for cash but you loose everything doing so gaining money. (not allot eather) They have brought back marriges and a few old family mechanics from the older games that seem familier however i cant remeber to pin point it for you.\n\nHonestly I like the changes and additions however if you really like rome and your on the fence on buying due to the price i would honestly wait for a sale since the additions add to the game however dont feel like they are really all that important. one game i barely used the family tree and won the campaign so i dont know if it impacts to much (i will update on after a grand campaign) so to sum it up i feel like this game is Rome with the mechanics of the previous games like midevil adding hords that you really dont use unless you have to (the huns start as hords) its a fun step in the right direction.","February 17, 2015","true","241.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

This game is what Napoleon was to Empire.\n\nWhilst it made me sick to see so much DLC at the start, it has been a while since any has been released which is good news.\nI was very happy to see Blood and Burning is a lot cheaper than Rome 2, I would also say it's better than Rom 2's blood and gore pack, I just hope they will make an option to make the blood stains permanent instead of quickly fading.\n\nOk, so for the main game...\nThis game is horrible to run on my current PC which should be more than capeable of running this at at least 40-50 FPS, I get FPS drops on the main screen, not even in game. Gameplay on the other hand is good and I can maintain a good FPS, even in chaotic battles, I just don't think SEGA and CA did enough to optimize this game at all. During the campaign the game crashes after perhaps as little as 30 minutes playing for no reason. This happened in Rome 2 as well, although that was fixed in patch 15.\n\nSaying this, what little I do get to play of my campaigns in between crashes and me raging, the game is good. Never too easy like in Rome 2, the AI is responsive and generally adapts well to situations in battle, and example of this was when I attacked an enemy camp, they lacked the men to block up all entry points to the camp, I also lacked the men to attack through each one, so they just pinned me at the entry points I went for and kept a unit in reserve to block off any other one I tried to attack. I did win, purely because of my numbers though.\n\nI love spreadable fire, makes the battle map feel more interactive and dynamic.\n\nI also like the fact when I attack cities and leave them for a few turns, they start to collapse, it was the only thing which allowed my small Saxon army to attack a poorly manned but formidable Rome.\n\nThe the units are good, for once they actually vary, unlike Rome 2 where any faction from a particular region was almost identical in terms of unit roster.\nIt's not as good as Rome 1 where every faction is different, but it's a start.\n\nHappy to see a return of the family tree.\n","May 9, 2015","true","219.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Rome II or Shogun II accomplish the same, and I find to be definitely better; gameplay-wise. However, there are some underlying factors that should steer you away from this game:\n\n1. DLC is King! "No seriously.... Just give them your money. Its fine, all of our DLC's worth it!" (Says every CA spokesperson, who doesn't need to pay for it).\n\n2. Random bugs. This is minor in theory, however when you start noticing the same bugs.... It doesn't feel minor... This is an another gripe against CA as I seem to find these bugs in their last 2 titles apart from Attila, and no ♥♥♥♥s were given on any day to fix them... Look forward to Warhammer!\n\n3. Pricing of this title. I would not recommend it, again, you can achieve feel and looks in past games, especially since they cost less than this.\n\n4. DLC is beautiful, again! "I mean come on, we can release this ♥♥♥♥ like clockwork, and they'll [consumers] never know! Pre-release DLC and DLC just weeks after the game is released? With no differences amongst these packs? ♥♥♥♥ yeah! Additionally, we'll throw in little details like blood and vomit... That will make panties fall! People [consumers again] WILL LOVE THIS." Impersonated CA workers conversing at final release development. -- Understand that pre-release DLC is already made game content prior to release, which means that it was made with the base game, they only separated the two to make more money.\n\n5. AI are about the same as past Total War games. Attila's AI... May be more dumb than the wiseguy at CA who thought DLC was a good idea. AI is not too difficult to beat, however you need to do it in certain ways, which eliminates certain play styles (unless you mod).\n\n6. This is a conclusive observation. Although the graphics are amazing, and the ideas behind this game are interesting; this game is a reskin of Rome II at its finest. The multitude of redundant factions shows carelessness on the developers behalf. DLC prior to first day is something I have always been against (which is why I DID NOT pre-order this game (not that naive)), and should steer clear from unless certain criteria is met. That criteria is price; this is too much outright, so buy everything on sale if you are hellbent on being interested in this game.\n\nOverall, I will still play this game, as I like the graphics and the time period that this game is set in. However, will I support anything else from CA and Total War? That will have reside on the outcome of what happens with upcoming games, such as Warhammer (which is not looking good from what I have seen).","December 30, 2015","false","165.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I mean who would want wage war against Carthage or the gallic tribes on a much smaller map that is in the same time period. There's no satisfaction to doing it. Rome 2's launch was a disaster and it took a year to get the game where it should have been AND YET it has better ratings than Attila. My guess, why? People are absolutely r-e-t-a-r-d-e-d.\nAnyhow, in my book Attila would tie with Fall of the Samurai as the best Total War entry to date. Just to get it out of the way, the graphics are pretty awesome. Now the family tree is back which is lovely. The political system actually has meaning to it and you also have to make sure that your generals or family members stay loyal by spending your hard earned influence points.\nUnlike in every previous title, this time it's not about starting with a province or provinces and conquering the world just like that. Different faction groups have different playstyles, the one resembling the previous total war style best would be the Sassanids. As the romans it's obviously a fight for survival against the endless hordes of barbarian,sassanid or hunnic scum. Then there are many migrating factions that do not own any provinces, they build buildings in their mobile camps and recruit from there as well but they can eventually settle down and start their own kingdoms. Lastly the horde specific factions like the huns cant take any provinces, the main goal with them is to just cause as much chaos and destruction to the world as possible. All this offers many interesting takes and plenty of replay value. (also I dont get how people can get 100+ hours of entertainment out of this and still downvote, like you got your moneys worth. If you want to cry go cry on rome 2 for being launched a year before it should have and has utter ♥♥♥ dlc)\nPersonally for me the time period is really fascinating, I mean it's the fall of the good old Roman empire! Oh and the map you can conquer is even bigger than before so your countrys colour can be more satisfying than ever before. Then the "ice age" mechanic which might seem a bit too much for some but it forces you to manage a lot more carefully as a lot of the land is no longer as effective in producing food and the game is meant to be more difficult than other tw titles so I think that's wonderful.+++There are many different religions with different bonuses. The only thing that bothered me is the huns respawn mechanic, they shouldn't just magically reappear a turn or two after you smashed them and the Uar warriors are ridiculously tough. But other than that I cant really think of anything that bothered me during my playtime.\nI'd give it a 9,5/10 Simply wonderful","February 20","true","190.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

If Rome II is about building an Empire, Attila is about surviving an onslaught of calamity or causing it, depending on what side of the wall you are on.\n\nThe Good:\nThe Setting...\nAttila is set during a time period of terror and dispair. Themes such as disease, war, famine, loss of hope, and the failings of civilization are ever present. The game is not fair, nor does it pretend to be. I can say honestly without reservation that when you play Attila, you are playing a game where the board is stacked against you and you are always one step behind its devilish designs. Sometimes, the only option is to make the best out of a bad situation and soldier on. Other times, the only option is to start the game over after being systemically dismantled. The game is engaging however, and has a lot more character than previous total war titles with in game cinematics telling the tale of Attilas rise and fall as the scourge of God. This game is about survival first and foremost: conquest or glory takes a back seat. The music is also leaps and bounds better than Rome II and sets the mood.\nThe Gameplay...\nThe gameplay both on the campaign map and in battles is quite good. It is arguably what Rome II should have been at launch. Unlike Rome II, I play this game absent any mods and I find the AI is punishing and as devious as ever. Seiges and playing on the defensive has never been so fun in a total war game since Shogun 2. Playing on the offensive is simply not an option for several factions until you are 100 + turns in as your units simply do not have the capabilities (the Romans). For other factions, offence is THE ONLY option. This means that the game has huge replayability: the game will play differently everytime you play as a new faction. With so many factions to choose from, you will be playing this game for a long time. Add in the Age of Charlamagne DLC, and you will be playing even longer. However, as mentioned above, Attila is a game where paranoid strategists will feel right at home because the game is stacked against you. It is not fair, and you will lose...a lot. But like games such as XCOM, sometimes getting pummelled is just part of the fun. You will lose a campaign 150 turns in and still be amazed with how epic it all was. New gameplay mechanics like a family tree, sanitation, hordes, governors, and my personal favourite, the ability to set fire to settlements while in battle are a delight.\nThe Grapĥics...\nThe game looks amazing and is optimized far better than Rome II. Running this on max graphics settings is quite a sight to behold. The new settlement razing mechanic both in the campaign map and in battle look amazing. It feels like you are there, fighting in Rome with the entire city burning around you, and that is pretty sweet. The graphics in this game are what was promised in Rome II at launch...incredible. There is not much else to say on the matter. The game is beautiful.\nThe Challenge...\nPlaying as Western Rome is the most satisfying but brutally hard game of total war I have ever played. And I loved every second of it.\nThe Bad:\nPreferences...\nThis game is not a traditional total war game. I personally view this in the games favour as I like the change of direction, but this is something that divided many fans. It is less of a historical what if simulator and more of a historical survival simulator.\nRazing...\nBy the end of the game almost the entirety of the map will be a pile of burnt tinders. This makes expansion an expensive proposition late game, as it takes on average, 10,000 gold to rebuild a minor settlement. This makes the legendary victories time consuming to achieve more than challenging. You will often get a minor victory and find yourself in a wasteland with no other factions left, and just call it quits rather than mash end turn over and over to save to rebuild. I like the razing mechanic but wish the AI used it a bit less zealously. That said, razing settlement after settlement as Attila is a blast.\nBar Bar...$$...\nBarbarian Factions must spend so much gold to transform roman settlements into their own that it is unreasonable. Again, this acts as a barrier to rapid expansion, and forces you to sit back, turtle, and save money more than I would like.\n\nConclusion: Buy when on sale with Age of Charlamagne expansion. Do not buy any of the other DLC, as it is not worth the $$. Buy instead of Warhammer TW.","March 8","true","305.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","4"

In a game named after the most Famous Hunnic leader, it's rather dissapointing that you can not actually carve out a Hunnic Empire(without mods).\n\nAdditionally, the Raze meachanic, coupled with the doomstack spawning of the Huns, makes this "Survival Strategy" game feel rather corny(which is an unfortunate trend with Total War these days). The End of Days theme is too overplayed, and to the detriment of gameplay.\n\nLuckily, as I said, a plethora of mods can deal with these issues. Which makes the game, for me, a solid buy.\n(It's true that the "Make and Mod" mentality of game developing is annoying, but if you can accept that as a fact of life these days...

Though the game is not "completely new," I can't help but say how much fun it is playing this game. Whether you play as the Roman Empire desperetly trying to maintain its large borders, the Norsemen from Sweden, and Denmark, or even the Scourge of God, the huns, the campaign feels amazing to play. The game plays very similar to Total War: Rome II, but then again this was to be expected. A good comparison to this game would be how Napoleon was to Empire.\n\nATTILA's Rankings\n\nBugs/Glitches - 9/10   Through my playing of this game, I have not encountered many bugs, and most of them were graphical bugs that should be fixed in a patch or two.\n\nGraphics - 8/10 Though the graphics are very similar to Rome II, ATTILA has a darker and sharper feeling than its predecessor. The only problem with them is that occasionally, I get a random frame drop when I zoom into the action, but if you have a nice computer, you should be able to run this with ease.\n\nGameplay (Battle) - 7/10 ATTILA has made some progress over Rome II, however the battlefield AI is still not perfect and will sometimes make headscratching decisions. Despite a few flaws, the AI is very playable and a large step up from Rome II.\n\nCampaign - 8/10 For me, ATTILA's campaign rivals such great campaign experiences of Shogun 2 and Empire Total War. I have found that (On Hard Difficulty) the AI makes clever moves and usually presses the advantage when it has an obvious one. A drawback to the experience is that it sometimes feels that a nation will declare war on you for almost no reason at all. The diplomatic system in ATTILA is, however improved. AI now make reasonable demands and will atempt to make peace if they are losing the war badly.\n\nInterface - 10/10 In ATTILA the interface and advisor help have been fantastic. Even though I do not need to use the advisor helpthat much as i am an experienced total war player, it helped me through the new features of the game in detail.\n\nFINAL ATTILA RATING - 8.5/10 The game is beautiful and fun, however i believe that the slight lack of AI inteligence and minor glitches bump it down a notch.\n\nHow ATTILA stacks up against other totals wars ive played (Based on fun factor ive experienced.)\nRome 1 < ATTILA\nMedieval 2 < ATTILA\nEmpire > ATTILA\nNapoleon < ATTILA\nShogun 2 > ATTILA\nRome 2 < ATTILA\nATTILA beats 4/6 Total War Games.

The migrating factions are interesting to play as but most of the decisions are matters of fight or flight (but I feel that's the point). The Sassanid Empire is perfect for beginning players because of the distance between you and the migrating factions. It is true that the AI does raze way too much and the north and northeast will be mostly empty latter on. I do feel the factions have a lot of similar units, and that they clearly took out some factions purely for DLC (I can conceive no reason why Vikings, Celts or "longbeards" couldn't be put in the original game).

Over time I started to like it, since it stopped the "mow through the A.I" type of conquest if only for a time. If you even cared about it, anyway.\n- The family tree helps this game immensely by actually making you care about your generals. I always have my king/prince in the main army, making me extra careful and therefore almost insuring I don't rush into battle, it's great.\n- The hordes are basically like the "no more land" factions from Rome 2 if you took their land they are an army running about, the diffirence lies in that the hordes have their own mobile camp and can also just burn anything in their way (any faction can but the hordes benefit from it).\n- The politics system is still abit boring and needs more work done on it, I said it was re-worked but I actually prefer Rome 2's "more casual" system...\n\nOne cannot talk about any Total War game without bringing up mods, that's like playing Skyrim on PC without mods. There are currently a few interesting mods in development that are really promising, such as the Medieval Kingdoms or Ancient Empires. Since TW Attila is based at the end of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Medieval times it's a great spot to have both mods.\nThat does not however mean that there haven't been any cool mods yet, Terminus TW - Ageless empires is a good one, although it's been discontinued as well as the Clovis Origin(something) Europae.\n\nAll in all, is it fantastic? Not quite. Is it as bad as Rome 2? Not even close. It's a step in the right direction for the TW franchise after Rome 2's step backwards. It has faults and issues, but the experience of playing it if you're into Turn based/RTS games is great.\nI give it an 8/10. Amazing game.

This lead to some very lack luster unit rosters in the base game, however, this issue is fairly easly fixxed by free steam mods that add units or even factions. Creative Assembly has also added a few free DLCs and updates which also helps some of the areas that the community originaly found lacking.\n\nSummary:\nWhile the original game was lacking, many of the issues have been fixed by free mods the can be found on the steam workshop.

Game was complete and very very very stable and almost bug free. Now like the person above said, WE ARE THE TESTERS and we PAY THEM TO TEST THEIR game. I wish this CRAP can stop. But its the users fault because they (me included) starting to pay for all these DLC's and take the crap.\n\nIn my defence if i bought a DLC or expansion i expected whole new content like new races or new weapons or stuff but on major scale change so that you can really say this is a change and this DLC worth it.\n\nThese days we get DLC's with content i expected in my opinion to have been part of the game in the FIRST PLACE.\n\nFor example, Star Craft 2, now we have to buy the DLC's or so called expansions just so that we can play the 2nd race in game (Zerg) and the third expansion coming to play the 3rd race. In the past you got games where you could play all races in single player, each having their own story, cutscenes etc. BUT NO!!!! We have to now buy it as DLC and everyone just throw money at them and now its become the trend, the norm. This is BSHT. Unless people stop throwing money at all these developers and start demanding full games again, then this will never change.\n\nAt least CD Project Red tried by taking a step in the right direction, we got a huge game (The Witcher 3) and they giving us 16 Free DLC's for the game, not PAYING but FREE. This is stuff that should have been in game in first place and they are adding it and giving for free BUT.... we are still trapped in this huge DLC or Expansion (whatever you want to call this) nightware where we are paying for stuff that should have been in the game in the first place to make the game COMPLETE.\n\nNever had this 10-20 years ago.\n\nIts a pity how we let them do this to us and gaming just a money making scheme and they always thinking what else can we do to SQUEEZE more money out of the SUCKERS.\n\nTotal War sadly went the same route and they are doing it even more to us now, 4 DLC's with stuff that should have been in the game. I am a BIG Total War fan, no, no, no...let me say... I WAS a big fan. I am also fed up with all these DLC's and trying to milk us for everything we have and then get content that should have been in the game in the first place.\n\nIts time WE put DOWN our FOOT and say NO MORE!!!!\n\nIf we do not start a REVOLUTION regarding this then it will get WORSE and WORSE. Its time we take the power back and say NO MORE!!! Its time we get FULL games again!!!\n\nThis is SERIOUS people (gamers), we allowed this and now we need to STOP this!!! Hurt them where it hurts the most. THEIR WALLETS, THEIR BANK BALANCE.\n\nWe need new developers who do this for the love of it and still make a living, but this DLC CRAP is getting redicioules.\n\nIT MUST STOP NOW!!! and it can only be done by YOU!!!\n\nThis is DLC TOTAL WAR!!!","June 25, 2015","false","188.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","1"

It improves greatly on Rome II; gameplay is smoother, the morale and fatigue system is the BEST it has ever been in a Total War game. The over all gameplay is more challenging, diplomacy feels so much more rewarding and the return of a true family tree with engaging court politics and intrigue adds so much more to the role playing element of the game, which in my opinion can be as important as the truly epic battles that Attila allows you to fight. One thing that upsets me is the continued downsizing of the ultra unit size; 120 men simply isn't enough for infantry and 60 Cavalry is often very underwhelming. The 40 unit battles that you can have in some ways does make up for this, considering I've had huge engagements with up to 4 full stack armies on either side(mind you the max is 40v40 at one time), but that kind of battle is rare but incredibly fun. Hopefully Creative Assembly will adress better unit sizes in Warhammer, but I digress. Overall, Attila is a lot of fun and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying the game, especially if you're just getting in to Total War.\nP.S In the way of DLC, I recommend waiting until it's all on sale and nabbing everything then.

The reasons? well that's pretty simple honestly, with 60 year focus CA was able to create a  atmosphere that no other total war game has. Apocalypse. Attila is a game about making a small kingdom more so and survive rather than a empire. With my 10-11 settlements i have had over 30 battles just to get them. With 4 major wars happening in only 20 years.  I've had to stop 2 civil wars and constant rebel threat in Gothascandza. Now i'm at war with the invading hunnic horde.\nMy first campaign might be slow do to the fact that it's a new game and we have yet to fully understand how to be as profficiant as possible but i do sense that is also do to how they designed the game. The campaign map Ai is far more organized and competent than ever. Aswell as the battle ai has seemed to improved but in total war fashion it's still a bit derpy. Luckliy you're allies actually do stuff in Attila, what i mean by that is if you set a target or just a war in general they will do what they can to take territory or help you fight major battles.\nThe ui has  had  a major overhaul and you have all the information you really need in just a click away, and the family tree is at it's most advanced form yet and the politics why confusing have more depth than any of the recent titles.\nSo here is where i'll probably debunc my review but i'll tell you all that i liked Rome2 I have more hours put into rome 2 and shogun 2 than anyother total war game. I stuck with Ca through the shaky launch and kept playing till the release of Attila and by god i must say that CA really do care about their fans. Attila, Napolean and of rome 2:ed, are obviouse signs of it. Thank you for reading to this point and sorry for my horrendous spelling, and thank you CA for providing my favorite srategy games.\nTotal War Attila gains a baddass aproval and a score of 8.5-10.","February 25, 2015","true","104.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Attila falls a little better than mid way between the 2. The high points of the game are its graphics/effects, the devestaion/raze mechanics and the overall apocalyptic atmosphere which the game manages to capture perfectly.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws however, the most glaring of which is the practice of selling DLC on the day of launch which should have obviously  been included in the vanilla release itself.    Another problem the game suffers from, is a lack of genuine diversity in the barbarian cultures. I would have liked to have seen more culturally specific units and building types. At some point I stopped playing the diffrent barbarian races as they all started to feel the same to me.\n\nEven with these flaws Creative Assembly has produced a wounderfuly immersive game and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan strategy gamming or even just a history buff like myself. I give Attlia Total War a solid 8/10.","March 8, 2015","true","300.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

Yes, its a good game overshadowing the old glorified beta of a game but this type of game development is plainly dispicable along with its day 1 faction DLC. Also it isn't as though the Saxons don't exist, so unless you really want to start as one of three tribes up in Denmark you may as well skip the DLC until a steep 75% sale.\n\nImprovementsNow, to the actual meat. Visually its far superior, even simple things like arrow types look distinct. Political and family management is actually a thing, not just some set of percentages as in Rome 2. Maps especially like cities are far less constricting and easier to move around in, they're also plainly better in design.\n\nCities aren't just plots of dirt to capture, they can actually be burnt down and you can even migrate as a horde; by choice or after your last settlement has been destroyed. Though easily I find being a horde far more interesting than being stuck playing the typical empire management game. Its just so much easier to fund your faction when your cities are part of an army.\n\nBugsOf course, there are problems. The AI is as per usual, completely stupid but this time aggressively stupid. Along with the broken major power diplomacy modifier, its impossible to trade or do anything but have some random faction declare war on you every few turns. No, not as Rome but as anyone like the Saxons for instance.","February 19, 2015","true","357.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","10","18","4","0"

This is by far the best game in the Total War series and my favorite as of now. It has the most variety in terms of units. You get everthing from alchemist throwing flammables and explosives to Norse berserkers. Stealth deployment for certain units makes for very refreshing tactics. Cavalry being stronger discourages camping and infantry spam. You get to play as some of the most interesting and important empires in the history of Western Eurasia such as the Sassanid Empire of Iran/Persia and the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. You also get to be the barbarians like the Huns, Saxons, Goths, etc. It's all around good fun. The campaign is basically a survival horror strategy game. Everyone complains about MP being unbalanced but I win the majority of my games and I've used a variety of factions that are usually not picked.\nTLDR: BUY THIS GAME!

I don't think the fact that the game runs smoothly really is something that should be praised as it should be expected from any game. As such I wouldn't suggest buying this game.

Raiding will destroy your economy even if it is a pointless settlement it will criple ur game)\n-Reblions- public approval is the worst its ever been killing rebelions will do nothing for approval, and they will rise next turn again. making it impossible to leave ur base.\n-Turns are long ai hardly expands.\n-Should be called total war: horse archer horde Because thats all they build. This kills open feild battles even when u have horses they will kite the ♥♥♥ out of your army.\n\nPros\n-Ui is much better and makes it hard to go back to other total wars because it is done so well.(very good family tree)\n-Razing is fun and does change the map/gameplay.\n-Migrations are fun running razing and camping bring fresh breath into totalwar.\n-Faction leaders with way better skill trees and custom skins\n-battle and campaign map LOAD MUCH FASTER.(tunrs are still long as ♥♥♥♥)\n\nI have played every total war since i was a child(i have bought/played every single one with full dlc) my favorite being shogun 2/ and medival first one, and empires was also great.\n\nTEAMS AND ROSTERS\n3/5\n\nThere are very few teams (for the money) even with the vikinings The majority of the teams are copies of eachother and differ by maybe 1 or 2 units. example The viking forefathers have about 2 different units then the barbarian raiders and thats just in name.\nrome/sansannids/huns have the biggest unit rosters, but they are not at all impressive. Want to be Britains tribes? Like in rome 2 where they had a ♥♥♥♥ ton of units? Ya you can’t be them, and all their units are roman units… they forgot to copy and paste the code im sure it will be a (7.99)dlc\n\nAI CAMPAIGN\n3/5\n\nNothing new here. Rasing settlements is the only thing that seems to be somewhat satisfying and its because of the AI.The ai is more annoying then ever. They never once took a city after 5 hours(only rebelions would AND your cities will rebel more then any previous total war before it. During the game the AI will spam units faster then you ever could (this is on hard to legendary difficulty) and the ai will declare war on you for litterly no reason (some times 4 of them at a time but this is also like almost all the total wars on hard to legendary difficulty).\nHere is the new, the AI will spend the entire time just raiding your bases and then running away and coming back. If you dont chase them down, they will repeat this over and over which can get very frustrating chasing them for 10-20 turns. So instead of chasing them you end up razing your own towns just to be rid of the annoyance of the annoying ai. Also now teams do not die when u take their provinces they run into a secluded area and mass a horde until u kill them THIS IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING the rebelions will do this to they will sit out side your base and mass and mass and when u go to kill them they will runaway always being just out of reach.\n\nAI BATTLE\n3/5\n\nThe ai is SLIGHTLY and if not at all better during battles they do BUILD seige equiptment (atlast!) but are incappable of using it example: AFTER 11 turns of me being seiged they finally attacked out numbering me 4-1 mind u and still took 11 turns to attack.(i was, of course, excited to defend against such a force) My gates at the start of the battle were already broken for reasons unknown(probably an agent) yet they used ladders to get on the walls and the rest of their seige equipment stood still, they then abandoned the equipment and slammed as many forces through the gate as possible(this is after the gate was already broken, and they felt the need to take 10 minutes to get the ladders up)  During non seige battles its the same except they use much more horse range lots of catapults.\n\nUI\n\n3/5\n\nThe ui has been changed and is much better then rome 2. The unit pictures are 3d representations of the units. They do have alot more notifications the hud is full of everything you will ever need to know which is great also the family tree is wonderfull.\n\nFraction leaders\n\n4/5\n\nThe leaders are great they have 3 item slots( u dont pick up items they just randomly happen, and they do not change the look of you leader). Finally the skills arent just absolutely terrible like in rome 2. Great little skill tree. With that said it doesnt, even compare with shogun 2 hero trees.\n\n\nPolotics\n\n3/5\n\nWith the new ui political monitoring is easier and more neat. Just like in rome 2 you will have random events example: there is an earthquake should speal blood? Sacrifice a bull? Or ask a priestess? just like in the first one even if u choose right the affect is minor. And you will get annoyed of the spam of people trying to marrior your daughter and if you deny them they take away 20 gratitas(in rome it was adoption and took money to stop thank god that is somewhat over with happens very rarely now) and if u let them u get closer to civil war. It is exactly like rome 2 kind of meaningless. Diplomacy is the same to nothing new depending on the difficulty level of the campaign diplomacy will either be way to easy or impossible. On legendary as soon as one fraction declares war they all do again this is the same as most total wars.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n3/5\n\nThis expansion is not worth 45$ unless u truely love total war Hence why i bought it. If you are looking for some great fractions and new content u will be somewhat dissapointed. This game feels forced like they ran out of ideas and instead of making something new they decided to mod rome 2 and pretend it was a new game with fancy UI changes. Die heart fans will get a bittersweet taste.(bitter because of the half ♥♥♥ job done and sweet because of the for love total war.) For those of you looking for game changers, this is not one despite the new optition to horde which is ok but does not have a lasting quality about it.This is my first total war i give thumbs down. If you were trying to decide on wether to buy this right now i would wait tell its on sell would be a decent game at 29.99 and i bet you there will be over 100$ of dlc do to the lack of content. Rome total war 2 imperitus is better, and i would stick to that for now. If you didnt like rome 2, u will not like this. You also dont get the great feeling playing any of the fractions yes being atila is fun but fighting the dieing roman empire just isnt as glorious as when i played rome 2 when it got the imperitus update and you could play as Julius and turn the republic into and empire. Just the thought of my being julius/or any of them and conquering titans like Crassus Sepius, and pompei had refreshed the game by itself. But being the nomadic huns gives and fighting an empire thats split and been in decline for awhile gives no feelings of glory the team just isnt that well put together and rome is in decline (as you can tell by their roster) and is the worst team to play due to massive rebelions and nomadic tried running through ur base razing/raiding and running. U will neve have a big enough army to stop the raiding.","February 17, 2015","false","107.6"," 144 of 283 people (51%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","51","144","283","28","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unanimatedfelix/recommended/325610/","unanimatedfelix","Felix Stormcrowfleet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unanimatedfelix/","303 products in account","Initially, I regarded Total War: Attila with muted anticpation. As a long time player and fan of the Total War series, I still had hope for the series despite the many regrettable circumstances surrounding Rome II (despite said circumstances though, I really enjoyed the game and never had many problems with it but that does not discount that others did) and such. After playing Attila though, I was greatly surprised at just how polished and fantastic a game this is. A real triumph for the series and a welcome return to form.\n\nI will go through different important areas and give the pros and cons.\n\nGameplay\nReally solid and done well. It actually reminds me of Divide et Impera, the mod for Rome II. Battles feel decisive and have a dynamic feel to them. It lends a real tension and exhilirating feel when you know that one very well executed Hammer and Anvil maneuver can completely change the tide of a battle. Battle AI is very impressive too. I've had a few slip ups but on the whole, the AI maneuvers really well. The use of cavalry is especially noteworthy to me. Quite a few times, my thinly defend flanks have been ruthlessly exploited by enemy cavalry. Sieges are another high point. Settlements are fantastically detailed, the best so far in any TW game. There's a wide variety of them too, meaning sieges tend not to get repetitive. Sea battles are the same as Rome II for the most part but a bit improved. They're simple but enjoyable. Overall, battle gameplay is fantastic and holds up well.\n\nThe Campaign map is something that's seen a very large improvement in Attila. Politics, which fell very flat in Rome II, is legitimately enjoyable. It has a function, adds new gameplay challenges and really improves the immersion/role-playing aspect of Attila. In this area in particular, I feel the game really shines. Creative Assembly really took on complaints about Rome II's bland/unimmersive campaign and rectified it very well. The faction campaign intros are great, random events occur more often and each general has a real sense of personality and life to him. The return of the family tree is welcome too. The game also pulls off certain events well, to lend a sense of story but also keep player freedom, such as climate change in the north and the growing strength of the Huns in the east.\n\nFactions is a point I'd like to emphasise as being very strong. They really do play and feel different. As the Western or Eastern Roman Empires, instead of conquest you're more locked into a fight for survival, with the odds stacked against you. As the Barbarian kingdoms, paths for expansion are numerous in every direction. As the Huns and other hordes, the new horde mode shines and makes you play completely differently to a normal TW game. It's a breath of fresh air.\n\nCampaign AI is pretty good, although I have noticed some odd occurences. Sadly, that seems par for the course when it comes to TW though. I was surprised that allies seem to listen to your war coordination targets now though, it is quite helpful.\n\n\nVisual and Audio Quality\nAnother area of large-scale improvement. The game's graphics are improved on both a technical and artistic level I feel. The detail is excellent both in units and their environments. The "Dark Ages" aesthetic works very well. The game has a grim and dark look about it. From the wind battered and bleak forests of Germania to the vast steppes of Central Asia, battle maps look great and fit the theme of a time of war, famine and death. Music has improved vastly too. It was dull and repetitive in Rome II but no longer. Battle themes are good but it's the campaign themes that shine to me, particularly the main menu music. I shall put a link to it at the end of the review so you can hear it for yourself.\n\n\nTechnical Issues and Ethics\nSurprisingly few. Performance is not the best but still fine. There are a few minor bugs I've run across but nothing game-breaking at all. The game is polished and fully functional, far removed from Rome II's launch state.\n\nMy one sticking point is a matter of ethics. Call me old-fashioned, but having one pre-order DLC (cynically, it is a faction pack for the Norsemen, which is bound to be very popular as everyone loves Vikings) and another DLC released within a week of launch is consumer unfriendly and goes a fair bit to diminishing the good will deservedly earned from a brilliant game. I suppose one should expect as such from any game that Sega is involved with, sadly.\n\nConclusion\nAn unexpectedly great game, of a very high quality all round. A return to form for a series of great pedigree and an example of something that is getting more and more lost in modern gaming I feel. That sometimes less is more and a game built on a solid foundation is far better than some bloated game filled with gimmicks.\n\nP.S As odd as it sounds, I have to heap one last accolade on Attila. It has the best tutorial of any game I can remember. It's like a mini-campaign of sorts that explains everything really well, is fun to play and ends with the historic battle of Adrianople. Even if you know TW well, I'd still say to play it. So you heard it here folks, best tutorial ever!\n\nTL:DR Version\nThe game is really good.\n\n\nThe Main Menu Theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh9HI4eudR8","February 25, 2015","true","140.8"," 40 of 78 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","40","78","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exilius/recommended/325610/","exilius","Jimlawl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exilius/","335 products in account","Since the game is mostly great and a massive improvement over Rome 2 I'll just name cons. Non-gameplay/Business related cons appear below. Won't mention performance/lag/technical bugs.\n\nCons:\n-3000 base income ruins the game balance, Garamantian tribesmen armies larger than the Roman army... Can be a good thing if you love fighting battles since you get to fight more but if you're into the grand campaign then bad news for you.\n-Combat is A LOT faster than Rome 2. More about fast reaction times and less about decisions.\n-Diplomacy AI still poor, getting a trade agreement is hard, random war declarations without reason by very friendly nations, marrying your daughters to barbarians have a low chance even if they're young and have a beneficent trait. Also getting peace treaties seems to be impossible unless you're massively stronger over whoever you're offering peace to.\n-Politics are slightly confusing although definitely an improvement over Rome 2\n-Most stances are still useless\n-Can only gift regions under very limited circumstances,  for example you can't give the revolter Egypt his land back so he remains as the random Libyan province it revolted from.\n-Although the building tree is definitely an improvement over Rome 2, some buildings are useless (For example tier 2 is 400 income, tier 3 is 400 income, -2% build costs and -4 food, +4 squalor). If it was say 700 income, -50% local build costs and -30% regional build costs I'd consider it.\n-Speaking of useless, several character traits/ancillaries/etc are useless (-10% sanitary building costs, really) although it's still an improvement over Rome 2 considering there are now 3 ancillaries.\n-Resources aren't as useful as they should be. Rome 2's DeI had it right by limiting almost all buildings past tier 2.\n-Apparently several people on the steam Attila forums have reported that while migrating as the Saxons, Danes, Juttes, Gothes, Franks, etc. they were pursued all the way to their destination by random neighbouring nations which proceeded to kill them with full stack armies. I played as the Saxons myself to test this and while migrating to Greece I had 3 neighbouring German tribes declare war on me and follow me all the way to Constantinople with full stack armies just to kill my horde.\n-Imperium increases exponentially for no reason even if you haven't expanded, giving massive relation penalties with everyone and eventually resulting in the whole world declaring war on you.\n-Very minor but generals don't move their mouths while giving speeches\n\nNon-gameplay/Performance/Bad Business practice cons:\n-No Blood and Gore on release day even tho some previewers stated they had it. They basically didn't want to have 'Day one DLC' except their pre-order bonus.\n-No Steam Workshop on release day.\n-Turns take at least twice as long, similar to Rome 2 on release.","February 19, 2015","true","246.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This review is done with most DLC (Not Viking forefathers and Germanic tribe pack, because they add literally nothing)\n\nAfter the Slavs culture pack was released I decided to do a campaign for the Eastern Romans. I had done one when Atilla was first released and had my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me by the Sassanids while being simultaneously attacked by the Huns to the North. I started off this new campaign in the hopes that this would be the most balanced playthrough I had done yet.\n\nI started off the campaign with Visigoths raiding around Macedon, one of their hordes became seperated, so I took this attack and attacked them. After defeating the army, the other weakened horde buggered off to the West Romans with a legion hot on their heels, next I had to secure public order. The next 10-15 turns was focused purely on public order management, although in this time I did secure a diplomatic marrige with Armenia, made peace with the Tanukhids and sent them into sassanian territory.\n\nThe next big problem arose when my buffer state in Arabia was taken over by the Arabian emergants, I took this chance and added an extra territory to the ERE before the Sassanid client states could take it. My northen client state had war declared on it by Kartli, but after several turns of ♥♥♥♥ all happening, Kartli wanted to be my client state as well (no complaints from me)\n\nNow came the time I was waiting for, the time when I could declare war on the Sassanids, considering this had been suicide on my previous playthrough I was interested to see how this would go. After several turns of blitzkrieg Sassanid Kebab removal that would have made Guderian himself proud, The diplomatic marrige with Armenia fell through and he entire East declared war on me. I ended up within striking distance of Ctesiphon and the Gulf of Persis in my sights. The siege of Ctesiphon was climactic and super difficult, even without Serbia Strong in the background. With all the garrison and supporting armies, the Sassanids had 3 and a half stacks defending with 4 of my legions attacking, siege mechanics have been massivly improved since Rome II from the initail onslaught on the walls to the last charge of the Sassanids kings royal cataphracts, the entire experience was engaging and fulfilling. After renaming Ctesiphon "Nova byzantios" I moved on.\n\nWith the new DLCs added to the game, my time was relativly easy. Most of the Sassanids client armies were dealing with Himyar in Arabia while the White huns tied up the Sassanids main armies in the east. Armenia fell to a combined coalition of my legions and my client armies in the north, I reached the Persian gulf 7 turns after the fall of Ctesiphon and all Sassanid land had fallen 10 turns after that. That was the easy part, as 4 armies now appeared out of Arabia. After dealing with them my aims turned into converting persian structures into roman ones, within 30- 35 turns I had complete control over the east. While my attentions were turned east, 2 Hunnic hordes crossed the Danube and raised Marcianopolis to the ground, despite a valiant defence by the garrison. In response to this I had both my Thracian armies chase them into the ruins of my town and had a apocalyptic  battle where one of my armies was surrounded and shot to death by horse archers.\n\nMounting tensions with the Axumite KANGS in somalia caused war, with no armies to defend Africa I had to disband an army in Persis and raise another mercenary army to deal with the Axumites, I finally defeated them with help from Nobiata, my client state and a redirected fleet from the persian gulf.\n\nIn contrast to my conquests, the Western "Romans" tore themselves to pieces as if it was a plaything. The Huns wrought their path of devestation into WRE lands like a Tyranid hive fleet, causing mass starvation and destruction. The Roman succesionist thralls and their Germanic masters warred over the last remaining land that had not been razed. Italy was pillaged and destroyed, Roma itself was razed and never rebuilt, Rome survived (even as a phantom of its previous self) in southern Spain and northern Africa. The Vandals claimed Carthage, the Ostrogoths ruled Sicily and the Suebians inherited nothern Spain, so very true to history. The celtic kingdoms and vikings have made substanial gains in southern France while the other 33% of non-ERE controlled land was razed by the Huns\n\nIn all a very balanced campaign and well worth the money for the game.","March 5","true","197.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who like to play as the Romans this makes for a fun advance start which gives you either the eastern or western empire, completing half of your plans of conquest, but adds the challenge of maintaining order in your lands while rebuilding and holding off barbarian hordes.\n\nUnfortunately Religion seems to be something that supposedly one can change, but is pretty much fixed, spent several turns knocking down churches and building coliseums in order to change the Western Roman Empire from Catholic back to Roman Paganism, and no Dice. Another Issue, Attila seems to take his sweet ♥♥♥ time showing up, and you can’t eradicate the Huns until he is born and reaches of age. And sadly the DLC department in CA has yet to pull their heads out of their asses and is once again selling off Fluff DLC and ripped out parts that should have been in the original release like blood and gore. Fortunately the Age of Charlemagne is pretty well done and definitely worth the $15 price tag.\n\nOn the Plus Side, the game is a leap ahead of the disastrous mess that was Total War Rome 2. The politics engine is actually engaging, characters and their families can actually do things now. The effect units have on a battle field is more apparent but less overpowered. Buildings are simplified as to their benefits and detriments to the settlements public order, food production and sanitation, and they have actual art assets as opposed to lazy icons inspired from ancient roman pottery. And lastly a dedicated Hardcore modding community which produce great works of minor fixes and tweak mods to total conversions which change the way the game plays and feels entirely. Plus there are mods which bring the Antiquity feel of Rome 2 to here, further negating the need for Rome 2.\n\nFans of the Franchise should definitely pick this one up. New Comers to the franchise considering Rome 2 should pass it up in favor for this cheaper and better refined alternative.\n\nPros:\n-Better Political and Diplomatic Engine.\n-Unit buffs are actually apparent on the battlefield without being overpowered.\n-Settlements that aren't region capitals are now more defensible.\n-Buildings are simplified as to their effects.\n-Actual Art assets for unit and building cards rather than lazy icons.\n-The Age of Charlemagne Campaign is actually pretty fun.\n-Cheaper than Rome 2\n\nCons:\n-Continuation of Lazy and Arbitrary DLC practices.\n-Huns are un-destroyable until Attila spawns. (They can be defeated but you can’t destroy their faction until Attila is defeated.)\n-Game takes place during the Twilight years of the Roman Empire, but there are mods (at least i remember seeing them) that let you play the game with Rome 2 Style Factions.\n","March 7","true","230.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I waited a long time before buying Attila since it was ridiculously expensive at first, with the base game at $45.00 and then each subsequent DLC ranging from $2-8 a piece. However, I just bought the game on sale and I am relatively pleased with the game overall. I downloaded Radious's mods and he did not disappoint with his quality of work - it truly raises the game's fun factor with the different units, etc... Overall, I recommend buying this game ONLY when it is on sale so that you can enjoy the DLC, with most of the DLC being fun, just stupidly priced (3 factions for $8.00).","December 7, 2015","true","136.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me just say it is fun as hell. The new political system makes for some interesting and sometimes awkward moments. For example my King's daughter elopped with one of my general's who wasn't very loyal to me. So I striped the general of his men and sent him to Rome to send a message, "The Jutes are coming". Of course it was a suicide mission but I allowed him to die honorably with a sword in his hand instead of assasinating him for his disrespect. Seriously though. Fun and unique factions, tough campaign that made me get rid of my normal blitzkrieg styled gameplay and become more tactical, new and fun internal as well as external politics, just an all around great game. Sure it has need of some improvements (do I seriously have to buy blood and gore again!) and not all the changes they made were for the best, but overall I just wanna say to all the haters who haven't even played the game yet.

It's full of DRM, presented in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sega DRM way where you know you'll end up buying the damned product.\n\nSo is it worth buying? I guess. Buy it on special.

It is a marked improvement over Rome II in almost every way. The campaign is infinitely more enjoyable than Rome II. The balltes are more fun to play, and the new fetures make it all the better. BUT. I am going to focus more on the Cons in this review. There aren't many, but the few that exist are major game killing problems.\n\nI will start with the worst and most obvious problem: frame rates. Now, my laptop runs Rome II Emperor Edition on Ultra with a few settings like shadows, particles, water, sky turned down. I get about 30-40 FPS. I cannot get 30 FPS on Attila on any setting, except on the campaign map. The campaign map in Attila runs like butter, much better than Rome II. The battles barely run. Land battles get about 15-20 FPS. Seige battles? Well they get 10 max. I wasnt around for Rome II's release, so I don't know if this is standard for a release game. But I have to mention it. Fix the frame rate issues, optimize the game. It is literally the only thing preventing it from being the best Total War title yet. Ultra on Rome II should at LEAST get you Performance on Attila; it does not even come close.\n\nThe second aspect: poor design choices. The game feels sloppy at times. From the bar on the left of the screen that will not go away, to the uneven stacks on unit cards, the game feels sloppy. Rome II had a lot of faults, but it was visually pleasing. Everything fit together, nice and neat. IN my 4 hours playing this, I constantly felt like I was playing a sloppy, unoptimized Rome II. Polish up the visuals, and fix the frame rates, and then it will be a great game.\n\nThe game is fun, I give it that. But the horiible frame rates and sloppy visuals prevent it from being great. Right now, I give it a 7/10. Come back in a month or two, it could very well have earned a 10 by then. Right now, I say wait for the patches and drivers. Pick it up in a month, and then we will have the game we wanted since 2013.","February 17, 2015","true","105.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For Rome 2 I had such high expectations, and was thoroughly disappointed due to the lack of features. As such, perhaps I wasn't expecting much from Attila - after all, it had a rather quiet release (in comparison to Rome 2) and was 15 dollars cheaper at launch. My low expectations were blown away, just with the gameplay elements alone.\n\nAttila combined many of the great elements of previous Total War games and squished them all into 1. CA brought back the much-loved Family tree, the ability to assign members of the court into political positions (similar to the cabinet feature of Empire), and expanded on the disappointing, but novel political features that debuted in Rome 2 - such as court influence and imperium.\n\nAs for the actual "war" aspect, I'll get back to that (if i remember to update this review). From what I've seen, however, sieges have been nothing but absolute fun to play.","February 18, 2015","true","199.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall I had a mediocre experience. This game does not have any of the problems that plagued Rome 2 at launch (I would know I preordered that piece of garbage) but it didn't offer me a "wow" experience. In other words it was neither bad nor good. The only quantitative improvements I saw were: Greatly improved user interface, unit cards are back, and skill/technology/family trees.\n\nThis game was fun for a few hours but after I got bored and went back to my Radious Rome 2 campaign. I even had 17 hours left on the free trial yet I still didn't boot it up. Here's the thing, this game is a glorified DLC expansion pack for Rome 2. Nothing about this game stands out and makes you say "Man I got to get this for $33 bucks!". The campaigns are boring, 1/4 of the factions are piecemealed as DLC, The AI cheats (The Huns hunt you and you alone), the Roman factions are pathetically weak, and once again CA's latest Total War has no soul in it. It's just a grind really.\n\nAs it stands this game is DLC for Rome 2. Think of it as "Barbarian Invasion 2, HD version". If it was $15-20 with all faction packs included then I would recommend it. For now wait till it drops further in price. Look guys, Atilla is not a bad game at all!

Played a few customs battles at first, still don't understand why fire ships are even in the game yet alone available for every other faction. So Navalbattles are a bit better from Rome 2 but still not up to  Shogun 2 (in my opinion), which were awesome. From what I played the land battles were pretty good, the Ai still  short of a few chromosomes served it's purpose well although still made questionable if not down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ descisions sometimes but this is nothing really new to total war. The campaign: First campaign I played as the Saxons despite having very weak starting units, was having a good time until the romans showed up with 4 full stacks to conquer my terriritoires. I was forced to allope with my two remaining armies when it became clear this was a fight a cannot win. Sailed to Britannia to start anew however the romans followed me there and so the saxons passed into annuals of history. Lesson learned try not to so close to the romans. Second go I tried the Huns. Now this was fun! The Horde mode was easily the best part of this campaign for me. Moving across the map raiding and sacking settlements, until the other factions got ♥♥♥♥ed of with me and drove me back east into syria which was no mans land. Ended camping out at the edge of the map with two hordes to the north and two to the south, east of the balck sea, trying to build up my ecomony and armies for round 2. However 2 factions decided to pursue me. Although quite fun at first as there settelment were provinces away, I imangined angry generals with desires to avenge the plundered settlements and fallen comrades chasing the savage hoards across distant lands in order to wipe them out once and for all. However the quickly became irksome as after defeating the first waves, they continued to send more after me, one stack at a time. Quickly losing all immersion as they were just throwing away men when they had other wars closer to home to worry about.\n\nSo for campaign horde mode was fun. Making regions desolate also fun but the Ai does take the ♥♥♥♥. Family trees being back and being able engage in faction politics with them is also great.\n\nDownsides: All the unecessary streamlining and streamlining is back :(. Restricted armies still not understanding why I can't split my army in order to surround a smaller force. Yes I get that having a named army which can level up is cool (especially when you are naming your four hodes after the four horsemen :)). What about reinforcement column? In my medieval 2 campaigns I would be sending small forces out after conquering armies for the sole purpose of replenishing them after particulary harsh battles or sieges. Bringing me on to another point; I wish CA would bring back the simple drag and drop for merging units. Province system and city building is the same as rome 2 which you may like but I thought was horrible, I think Shogun 2 went far enough on that one. Anyway my point behind this rant was, this is a strategy game and I hate that you are being restricted.\n\n\nNow would I recomend this game? Yes when it goes on sale after all the DLC is out. Now the focus campaigns are fine, but faction DLC is and always will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Selling a game piece by piece is ♥♥♥♥ing insulting, especially when in past games you could just unlock the factions. Not only that but it is really lazy, microtransactions (which what it basically amounts to) have no place in AAA gaming. How much work does it take to unlock a faction? Not very ♥♥♥♥ing much yet that's what it boils down to pay me and I will unlock them for you. Not create and add a new one to the game but unlock it! I know Shogun 2 did this but I didn't like it then I dam well don't like it now.","June 29, 2015","false","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This review is done with most DLC (Not Viking forefathers and Germanic tribe pack, because they add literally nothing)\n\nAfter the Slavs culture pack was released I decided to do a campaign for the Eastern Romans. I had done one when Atilla was first released and had my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me by the Sassanids while being simultaneously attacked by the Huns to the North. I started off this new campaign in the hopes that this would be the most balanced playthrough I had done yet.\n\nI started off the campaign with Visigoths raiding around Macedon, one of their hordes became seperated, so I took this attack and attacked them. After defeating the army, the other weakened horde buggered off to the West Romans with a legion hot on their heels, next I had to secure public order. The next 10-15 turns was focused purely on public order management, although in this time I did secure a diplomatic marrige with Armenia, made peace with the Tanukhids and sent them into sassanian territory.\n\nThe next big problem arose when my buffer state in Arabia was taken over by the Arabian emergants, I took this chance and added an extra territory to the ERE before the Sassanid client states could take it. My northen client state had war declared on it by Kartli, but after several turns of ♥♥♥♥ all happening, Kartli wanted to be my client state as well (no complaints from me)\n\nNow came the time I was waiting for, the time when I could declare war on the Sassanids, considering this had been suicide on my previous playthrough I was interested to see how this would go. After several turns of blitzkrieg Sassanid Kebab removal that would have made Guderian himself proud, The diplomatic marrige with Armenia fell through and he entire East declared war on me. I ended up within striking distance of Ctesiphon and the Gulf of Persis in my sights. The siege of Ctesiphon was climactic and super difficult, even without Serbia Strong in the background. With all the garrison and supporting armies, the Sassanids had 3 and a half stacks defending with 4 of my legions attacking, siege mechanics have been massivly improved since Rome II from the initail onslaught on the walls to the last charge of the Sassanids kings royal cataphracts, the entire experience was engaging and fulfilling. After renaming Ctesiphon "Nova byzantios" I moved on.\n\nWith the new DLCs added to the game, my time was relativly easy. Most of the Sassanids client armies were dealing with Himyar in Arabia while the White huns tied up the Sassanids main armies in the east. Armenia fell to a combined coalition of my legions and my client armies in the north, I reached the Persian gulf 7 turns after the fall of Ctesiphon and all Sassanid land had fallen 10 turns after that. That was the easy part, as 4 armies now appeared out of Arabia. After dealing with them my aims turned into converting persian structures into roman ones, within 30- 35 turns I had complete control over the east. While my attentions were turned east, 2 Hunnic hordes crossed the Danube and raised Marcianopolis to the ground, despite a valiant defence by the garrison. In response to this I had both my Thracian armies chase them into the ruins of my town and had a apocalyptic  battle where one of my armies was surrounded and shot to death by horse archers.\n\nMounting tensions with the Axumite KANGS in somalia caused war, with no armies to defend Africa I had to disband an army in Persis and raise another mercenary army to deal with the Axumites, I finally defeated them with help from Nobiata, my client state and a redirected fleet from the persian gulf.\n\nIn contrast to my conquests, the Western "Romans" tore themselves to pieces as if it was a plaything. The Huns wrought their path of devestation into WRE lands like a Tyranid hive fleet, causing mass starvation and destruction. The Roman succesionist thralls and their Germanic masters warred over the last remaining land that had not been razed. Italy was pillaged and destroyed, Roma itself was razed and never rebuilt, Rome survived (even as a phantom of its previous self) in southern Spain and northern Africa. The Vandals claimed Carthage, the Ostrogoths ruled Sicily and the Suebians inherited nothern Spain, so very true to history. The celtic kingdoms and vikings have made substanial gains in southern France while the other 33% of non-ERE controlled land was razed by the Huns\n\nIn all a very balanced campaign and well worth the money for the game.","March 5","true","197.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Regardless of what rubbish you may read with people talking about "downgrading" mechanics and such - they did no such thing. The only thing people are so pi22ed about is the DLC overload which individually go for between $2 and $4 each.\n\nIn terms of AI and game mechanics you can tell the developers are trying new things leading up to the release of the obvious new Medieval addition to the series, even the new Warhammer for instance is the developers gearing up for what they are going to do with the new Medieval.\n\nI'm a solid fan of Total War series, I don't actually think I will be getting the Warhammer addition because I don't know how I truly feel about incorporating magic and mysticism into battles with mythological stuff - it just doesn't do it for me. I like the gritty feel Attila delivers, the game requires a high spec computer to really enjoy the epic battle graphics which are awesome on account of little things like settlements actually having visible settlers wondering around and the way settlements can be completely burnt to the ground.\n\nThe game is perfect for playing as a barbarian race and raiding rich settlements controlled by the East and West Roman Empires.\n\nWhen Attila actually begins his conquest it can be a little scary too depending on who you are playing as.\n\nOverall the game has great graphics, awesome mechanics and micro management, it is not as simple as say Shogun 2 which I found to actually be one of the worse Total Wars in my opinion on account of climbable walls and such - people just like playing "rush" now days and don't value the thought and effort in getting things done in games now days which is depressing because these ADD kids are actually starting to overwhelm the market supply and demand and literally changing games for the worse but whatever - I am getting old and don't really care what the new generation choose to push things towards - Attila was a great addition to the Total War series and I thoroughly enjoyed it and am literally picking and scratching at my skin like a meth head in anticipation for the new Medieval which I am seeing all the hints in both Attila and Warhammer and am sure have read a few things online now.\n\nI know what to expect and pretty sure I know what Total War are doing having played all of their games since the first Rome adaptation. I did not play the earlier title unfortunately - I started on Rome.","March 3","true","248.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Steam Workshop! DLC's! Things! Also I'm a hypocrite!\n\nAlthough I still have yet to see much of the late game content due in part to my own incompetence and the fact that I find myself going back and deleting old saves to account for updates, DLC's, and now mods!\n\nAll in all I'd give this game a solid 7.5/10 (Previously 8, will explain) especially considering the price isn't even full retail. This is the Napoleon where Rome 2 is Empire, if Empire and Napoleon were both garbage (Yes, I liked Empire).

Has lots of improvements since Rome2. Being a Total War fan for a very long time, I myself enjoyed playing it. I didn't even buy this game for a long time, mainly because of my anger towards and disappointment of ROME2. But I immediately regreted when I played with Eastern Roman Empire.\n\nPros:\n-Decent AI\n-Very good graphics\n-Nice historical touches\n-Very good DLC packs\n-Fertility system\n-Decent battle soundtracks\n-Fixed civil war\n-Above else, you can really feel those times. The despair, flight of people and great migration.\n\nCons:\n-Family tree is finally here after Rome2 but it still sucks\n-You have lots of factions to play but nearly all of them have same unit and building system. (Basicly you have romans[east and west roma], easterns[all middle east and arabic factions], nomads[huns], celts and barbarics [germanic migratns & germanic kingdoms]. So you have actually 5 DIFFERENT factions to play with different names and start positions.)\n-NO CAMPAIGN MUSIC WHATSOEVER. This is the biggest disappointment for me. No decent campaing map music since Med. II !!!?? But we saw it coming when Jeff van Dyck was no more, didn't we?\n-This game(with it's good fixes) doesn't change the fact that they lied (in every espects of game) to all of us when Rome2 was released way before it was ready.\n\nOverall sum up:\n-Good TW game.\n-Still have minor issues.\n-Worth buying(since it's price decreased)\n-But you can't play it 500+ hours without geting bored.","January 3","true","338.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Still I am impressed. Looks very good. Just one question: Where the hell is my blood and core?\n\nAfter a first day of playing I can now add to this review.\n\nMy first impression still hold. The game is what Rome 2 should have been. Some wird freezing happens on the campaign map here and there but the game has not yet crashed on me. Everything seems to work smooth. I hope that same improvements have carried out to the coop side too because Rome 2 is still a  game that constantly fails on coop.\n\nSo far everything looks very very well tought out. The familytree is back wich is exellent. I have no understanding why it was ever taken away in the first place.\nAll the poltics and powerplay inside my own faction is interesting and I actually pay attention to it when making decicions. Also the foreign poltics play a healthy role in my campaign so far.\nI have not much allies or tradepartners so I ceep good care for those that are.\n\nSome of the things I dont like are first the different funit flags. Expacially the ones that are in the campaign map are just plain terrible. I had to play long time until I learned to read the usefull and much needed info from them.\nThe unitflags in the battlemap aren't much better. There's more info but it's difficult to read at first.\n\nAlso there is one feeling that I just can't get rid of. This should have been a DLC.","February 17, 2015","true","151.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tried all the solutions, tried every fix. Nothing. My computer has run every Total War game but this one fine.\n\nGreat job, Creative Assembly and Sega! Go Hog Wild!"\n\n\nSince apparently the game was crashing because of some kind of DRM issue (clearing Winsock and Ipconfig wizardry fixed it), I have since fixed the problem.\n\nSo, now that I've got it working, do I recommend it? Yes. And No. But mostly yes? I think.\n\nIt's a total war game. Hordes are cool. The battle gameplay is fun and intense, the grand strategy still wonky and confusing. Balance is, as always, really weird, so never autoresolve anything beyond overwhelming odds.\n\nIt's a fun game. It's violent and bloody. It's full of DRM, presented in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sega DRM way where you know you'll end up buying the damned product.\n\nSo is it worth buying? I guess. Buy it on special.

The siege AI is markedly better than the previous installment, the AI acts much more nicely during land battles as well. The campaign is much more in-depth, and has many wonderful features restored like Family Trees and a deeper political system. The title's star faction, the Huns, were appropriately horrifying to encounter on the battlefield, and will quickly leave your army in tatters if not dealt with properly. The graphics have been improved as well, notably bloom and reflection. Trees and buidling catch fire and there is satisfying destruction of the environment, especially on siege battles. Having also pre-ordered Rome II I must say I am much more content with the release of this installment, and while it does have a few performance issues, I am sure the developers will patch everything in due time. I highly recommend this Total War, for an even more gritty and intense experience than its predecessors. 9/10","February 17, 2015","true","525.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's less based on 'overwhelm with numbers', and more on the skill of the commander. In this game, if you play your cards right, and you are strategic enough, you can hold a town with barely one hundred troups, outnumbered ten-to-one (I've done it before).\n\nLet's get down to the analysis:\nCampaign\nAttila's vanilla campaign is extremely fun to play. Play West Rome or East Rome (two of the best, in my opinion), and try to hold your empire together as the world crumbles into anarchy, strife and the Huns and other migratory factions threaten the very survival of your people. You will be thrust straight into battle: the first several turns are incredibly difficult and extremely crucial as in many cases, the survival of your empire depends on it. You can make or break the Romans depending on who and how you play.\n\nTake control of the falling political giants as the Gothic warbands, or raze everything in your path to the ground, as the Huns. Attila introduces a new system of 'migratory factions', where you begin as a horde of troops, and you can choose where to settle. I'm not a big fan of playing a migratory faction, although it is very well polished, it just isn't my playstyle.\n\nUnits\nWell for one, horsemen are actually useful in this game. If you play them correctly, engaging from the flanks or rear, a unit of armored horsemen can cut through unprepared spearmen in seconds, much more realistic and useful than the horses we saw in Total War: ROME II. Campaign research is much more interactive and simple to use for researching units, and most factions have a very fun roster to play with. I particularly like the Roman and Germanic rosters, very well thought out units.\n\nDLC\nThis game only has two major DLC released so far, though I haven't yet tried one of them (although I'm hoping to grab it before the sale ends). I got Age of Charlemagne though, and I recommend you get it if you are looking into buying this game. The most fun I've ever had with any game DLC, Age of Charlemagne thrusts you into the early Medieval era. Play as Charlemagne and unite Europe under your banner, or take control of England as the Saxon Kingdom of Mercia. Charlemagne offers what all Total War DLC should be like. SEGA and CA have learned their mistakes with the Rome-DLC spam, and all the DLC offered so far is not the 'buy this to get some new units that aren't actually very useful' crap we saw with Rome II\n\nMulitplayer\nUnfortunately, this game still has the Mac-PC incompatibility that all it's predecessors had. This puts a large divide in the playerbase, and shouldn't be in place. I mean, in 2016, we have no need for the tired 'Macs can't run video games' crap that has (and pretty much always will be) untrue.\n\nFinal Verdict\nI give this game a solid 8/10\nIf you are looking to buy Rome II, buy this instead, much more enjoyable. I wasn't able to actually complete a campaign in Rome II due to boredom, in this game, my East Roman campaign is more than one hundred turns in, I've achieved Minor Victory and I am still having lots of fun trying to get the major victories.\n","March 12","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which may leave you asking yourself, so WTF, why was this not just an expansion pack? My simple answer to that question is that CA has extensivly overhauled the game's engine since Rome 2 Total War, not only graphically but in cool little additions like being able to literally burn cities your seiging to the ground. Makes for a very interesting campaign if you want to be the "bad guys" for once in a Total War game.\n\nJust like its predecessor we see Rome in a state of decline, split in two and under pressure from hordes of migratory Barbarians, and of course the name sake him self Attila. The campaign is told through quotes of the seven seals of the apocalyspe(Book of Revelations I believe) as you progress through the years, not only providing really cool cinematics with excellent voice acting but also a sense of relevance and even perhaps a sneaky commentary by CA on the current world state of affairs. The problem with these highly entertaining form of Campaign however is that it seems to limit the replayibility a little bit, as in no matter which faction you pick, you will see the same cinematics, same seven seals each time. Good oppurtunity to rewatch those awesome videos though.\n\nthe DLC is a bit of a money grab, but nothing too outragous compared to Shogun 2 or Rome 2.\n\nPerformance wise the game is still a bit wonky with the framerates, so if you're worried about about that side of things I would recommend perhaps holding off until a few more months for them to patch everything to the same state Rome 2 was left in(Which atleast on my computer, is amazing framerates/performance), who knows you might catch it on sale that way too.","April 23, 2015","true","513.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I just never managed to really get into it. Most of the time I'd end up starting a campaign and never completing it. Leave the game for a few weeks/months then I'd come back to it and try another campaign which, ultimately, ended up the same way.\n\nI bought the DLCs hoping they'd make the game more interesting and manage to keep me hooked like the previous Total War games did. Never happened.\n\nAt first, I wasn't interested in Attila because of Rome II. Then I started watching the videos from CA and the new mechanics seemed interesting and refreshing plus it looked like CA actually listened to the playerbase. So I gave it a shot.\n\nThis is what Rome II should've been. Attila is a true Total War game.\n\nThe family tree is back.\n\nThe siege AI is working and is not totally incompetent.\n\nThe horde mechanic works well, is really fun and offers such a different play style than what we're used to in Total War games. Playing as the Huns burning down cities, pillaging and just, overall, being an ♥♥♥ is amazing.\n\nThe BAI has also improved and so did the naval battle AI. Naval battles are much better than they were in Rome II, not an impressive achievement considering how bad Rome's naval battles were but still deserves to be mentionned.\n\nNow, not everything is perfect, there are bugs. Nothing major. I've had a few crashes here and there. When ending a turn the game will sometimes freeze for a few seconds when all the AIs have finished their turns. Nothing patches cannot fix.\n\nOverall the game feels much more polished than Rome II ever did, even as an "emperor" edition.\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","145.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I just never managed to really get into it. Most of the time I'd end up starting a campaign and never completing it. Leave the game for a few weeks/months then I'd come back to it and try another campaign which, ultimately, ended up the same way.\n\nI bought the DLCs hoping they'd make the game more interesting and manage to keep me hooked like the previous Total War games did. Never happened.\n\nAt first, I wasn't interested in Attila because of Rome II. Then I started watching the videos from CA and the new mechanics seemed interesting and refreshing plus it looked like CA actually listened to the playerbase. So I gave it a shot.\n\nThis is what Rome II should've been. Attila is a true Total War game.\n\nThe family tree is back.\n\nThe siege AI is working and is not totally incompetent.\n\nThe horde mechanic works well, is really fun and offers such a different play style than what we're used to in Total War games. Playing as the Huns burning down cities, pillaging and just, overall, being an ♥♥♥ is amazing.\n\nThe BAI has also improved and so did the naval battle AI. Naval battles are much better than they were in Rome II, not an impressive achievement considering how bad Rome's naval battles were but still deserves to be mentionned.\n\nNow, not everything is perfect, there are bugs. Nothing major. I've had a few crashes here and there. When ending a turn the game will sometimes freeze for a few seconds when all the AIs have finished their turns. Nothing patches cannot fix.\n\nOverall the game feels much more polished than Rome II ever did, even as an "emperor" edition.\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","145.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is what that should have been, the little tweaks are much better and the AI is much better too. but they are essentilly just tweeks, I can't help feel it's a glorified dlc.. (especially coming out relatively soon after rome 2: sept. 2013).. at this point because the campaign map just doesn't have the grandour as most the other games. so this game for me is deserving of it's extra 5 metapoints over rome 2. But still not the complete total war experience i've been looking for since empire (although i had a few gripes with that) and medievil 2 and the original rome.\nI'll leave you with one fact.. If you enjoyed Rome 2 you'll enjoy this more\n\nin short; no crashes, looks great. Nearly everything since rome 2 has been improved. 8/10. Rome 2: 7/10\n\n# and by grandour i think it's not far off the same size as other games but because the factions are so big at the start it just feels small, like a dlc from rome 2, and while i'm on that point, what's with releasing factions as dlc? money grabbing. i loved starting a game in medievil 2 and working my way up the defeat scotland just so i could go them and take over the world again. now i've gotta pay money for some guys i might not even want to go. stop the trend!! give us the full game to start with please","February 18, 2015","true","110.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once you get to grips with it though it is simple to understand and the need to balance the influence of various characters adds another dimension to the game.\nThis might not be a good game if you are looking for instant gratification, it not only rewards attention to detail but tends to punish rushed or badly prepared actions quite harshly.\nBattles compare favourably to Rome 2 and feel challenging but not frustrating.\nThe game is quite demanding and I suspect if you were using the recommended specs from steam the graphics would look less than impressive, I would recommend having a look at review sites or youtubers and seeing what specs they were using.\nThere a great deal of variety between the factions in terms of the starting positions with everything from small settled tribes, rootless nomads, great empires on the verge of collapse and rising powers with strong starting positions. I also greatly enjoyed Attila's atmosphere; the soundtrack and the overall aesthetic of the game really drew me in.","February 18, 2015","true","286.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When you are playing a faction that is not Christian, then you will encounter this idiotic error, when you are conquering Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. These are "Patriarchal See", and that means that there you can build "powerful" Christian Churches. But that also means that if you play a non-christian faction, it's not possible to build any religious building in that city.\n\nFor example; you play Sassanid Empire (their religion is; Zoroastrianism), and you conquer Antioch or Jerusalem, and you will then convert the area to your religion. The problem for you is when folgenden; You can not build religious buildings of Zoroastrianism in these cities !!\n\n\nCreative Assembly has confirmed that this error is actually a "design choice";\n"Due to the way buildings work, it is unfortunately not possible to build any non-Christian religious buildings in Pentarchy regions. We are aware this may not be intuitive, however*other solutions that were explored that would allow*non-Christian religious buildings*in these regions*would result in*complications for Christian factions." (http://forums.totalwar.com/showthread.php/147689-Bug-Cannot-build-quot-Consecrated-Ground-quot-in-Pentarchy-sees-like-Roma).\n\nThis makes me, as a player, really frustrated. If CA has meant that religion should have a bearing on the game and players' experiences, and then delivers this section with an idiotic mistake, then play for me broken. Therefore, I recommend everyone who bought the game, forcing CA to correct this, and CA should have fixed this a long time ago.","May 12, 2015","false","532.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
