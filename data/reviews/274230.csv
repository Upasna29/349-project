Your father has been killed and his death is somehow linked to five men you can see in a photograph with you and your father. As your father's only child you take it upon yourself\n\n+Great art style which suits the game well\n+The skills which you can unlock over the course of the game are really fun to use, for example you can unlock the ability to throw your sword at enemies or hang enemies from the ceiling to kill them stealthily\n+Once you've got your head around the turn-based combat mechanics, combat against a small number of enemies can be quite fun. Combat mainly consists of jumping into enemies to knock them over and then stab them but it can be quite challenging when you also have several enemies shooting at you\n+Stealth sections of the game are incredibly fun, especially once you've unlocked the hanging enemies skill\n+Each mission has three overall objectives (admittedly they're the same across all the levels) which, when all three are completed, grant you a skill point to spend\n+Great soundtrack which fits in with the game well\n\n+/-It's locked to 30FPS, personally I'm not bothered by this but I know this is an important issue for a lot of people\n+/-While the game does feature a NG+ mode as well as two different endings the game has zero replay value to me, though that may just be because I really didn't enjoy playing it\n+/-If you aren't very good at the game then it's incredibly difficult to unlock more than one or two of the skills as completing all three objectives in one go is pretty challenging\n\n-Combat against a large group of enemies in open spaces is incredibly frustrating as it's often very difficult to find an opportunity to single out an enemy and kill them\n-Enemy AI detection is awful, it's possible to stand on an enemy without them noticing, it's also possible to stand on a window while someone is looking out of it without them noticing\n-Despite feeling like it should be a stealth game, Ronin seems to force open combat on you as much as possible, there's not a single level that be completed without engaging in open combat and very few encounters with enemies can be completed without combat\n-The jump arc the game provides you with when you're planning your next move is pretty much always inaccurate which is incredibly frustrating\n-The game enters turn-based mode when you enter combat, or at least that's how it's supposed to work. The game often doesn't enter turn-based mode at the right time and it never enters turn-based mode when it's convenient for the player, such as when you can attack an enemy from a rope. Furthermore, the game often leaves turn-based mode too soon, i.e. while there are still enemies left in play\n-The backstory of the game is only explained in the Deluxe Edition Digital Comic so if you own the standard edition, like I do, the game effectively has no story\n-The game consists of fifteen levels only and can be completed in around four hours, the only reason my playtime is longer than that is because I spent around two hours total stuck on some of the levels\n-You can only jump when you're in combat, regular movement isn't allowed, this gets incredibly frustrating when you just need to move a small distance\n\nVerdict:\nNot Worth Purchasing Unless Heavily Discounted.\n\nRonin has a nice idea behind it but its weak gameplay, poor AI, short length and complete focus on action make it fall short of the mark. If you're looking for the next Gunpoint or Mark of the Ninja, look elsewhere.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 10, 2015","false","6.9"," 242 of 318 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","242","318","6","11"

Now that my hyphen quota is out of the way, I can address the real question: how the hell did they screw this up?\n\nThe central mechanic to the game is, somewhere deep down, solid or even excellent. Movement is real-time when you're undetected -- which is rare -- but when combat begins, time freezes and you enter a form of turn-based combat that I can't say I've ever seen before. Your only form of movement during this phase is through jumping -- using the right stick to control the arc and direction of your jump as you dart between enemy lines of sight and between bullets. As you plot your next move, time freezes with your enemies' laser sights visible to show where they will fire between turns. There are a few variations on this basic bad guy type -- some enemies fire continuously, others wield swords and utilize a lethal dash instead of a firearm -- but by and large, you're dodging bullets.\n\nSounds cool, right? A turn-based Mark of the Ninja with a little Gunpoint thrown in is, in theory, a fascinating combination. Unfortunately, things come undone very quickly and in a variety of ways. For starters, the visible arc of your jump is often inaccurate or misleading. Too often I fell short of the marked landing spot, bumped into an enemy the arc showed me I could clear, or had trouble discerning if the path of my jump was or was not clear of enemy fire. As this jumping control is the ONLY method of movement during combat, the lack of tightness and poor tuning are unacceptable.\n\nCombat also often devolves into tedium due to the quantity of enemies. As you progress through the game, you'll take on rooms packed to the brim with gun-toting baddies who rarely give you any time to do more than continually dodge. This is fine to an extent -- there's absolutely a certain thrill that comes from bouncing from floor to ceiling to wall while your opponents fire helplessly at your previous position -- but there came a point where it felt nearly impossible to get into a position where at least one guard wasn't aiming at you at all times. The poor level design really hurts this area of the game since the vast majority of your conflicts take place in large, generic open rooms that offer little room for improvisation or enemy separation.\n\nWhen RONIN clicks, it feels damn good. Dropping onto an enemy agent, throwing your sword into another across the room, and then grabbing it from the floor while bullets whiz by is the sort of rush that few games can offer. But the hours of tedium separating these flashes of brilliance are simply too much to ignore.","April 21","false","3.7"," 83 of 99 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","83","99","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjmara813/recommended/274230/","jjmara813","Naoto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjmara813/","205 products in account","Ronin is a very fun game but many people may have huge faults with the game.\n\nFirst of all there is really no story at all in the game, there is small bits but overall there is nothing to call a story. So instead of gunpoint where you know why you are going in and doing the this job, you just kill random people to get data to kill a boss character. Sadly we don't even know anything about our character...you can assume who she is in the picture but that is it. On a side note i want to know about the 2 guys other then the assume dad and the normal ninja guy in the picture, i want to know why we don't kill them.\n\nGameplay it is very fun and enjoyable. Yes there is many bugs where you teleport around but it happened when i screwed up already, but i see how it could be a huge problem. Luckly there is checkpoints every 3 minutes so really the glitches are small "aww i got to kill these 2 people again" then doing a whole level again. I feel sad that the game is only 4 ish hours long, well 8 counting NG+ but overall a very short game.\n\nMusic i really did enjoy and liked listening to, it fit the action of the scene and always nice to have some heartpumping action music while you slow down time and kill 5 people in a room. You can see this as a bad thing but to me the music was one of the best parts of the game in my mind.\n\nThe last thing is NG+. Now i did find it interesting that they change one enemy's attack which made the game harder and the obvious more guys in a room. Weirdly i found the game easier in NG+....with all the abilities i had and how easier to get the abilities i just found it easier. The only time i had huge troubles was the final guy where i had to do a certain pattern to beat him, but overall i wished there was more put into NG+.\n\nBasically i had fun and found it enjoyable. I feel like gunpoint is better then this, but i had more heartpumping moments in this. If i have to give this a rating, i give it a 7.5, there is huge problems with glitchs and the fact no story makes you sometimes go "why am i even killing this guy?". Not the best game in the genre but a fun game to play","August 4, 2015","true","11.2"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","33","40","2","6"

I didn’t like the game at first.\nAlso still not quite sure why I enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\nOh and be warned: This game is hard. Or easy. Depends on whether or not you’re familiar with such games and whether or not you make use of your skills.\n\nAnyway let’s get into that stuff now shall we?\n\nStoryThe first thing you’ll see is a picture of a little Girl with her Father and five former Associates.\nThe thing is the young girl, known as the RONIN, has lost her father for unknown reasons and all that’s left of him is this photo. All she knows is that his former Associates are responsible for his death so she’s now taking revenge upon those one at a time.\n\nAnd that’s pretty much it. It’s you, your blade, your bike and your trusty Helmet versus those guys and a bunch of nameless cannon fodder (Weeeeeeee).\n\nGameplaySo here’s the deal. I’m pretty sure that you’ve either played or heared about Gunpoint and therefore notice an incredibly strong resemblance … one could say that the whole game is a Rip-Off but hold your horses!\nWhile it has been strongly influenced by it RONIN still manages to be rather unique in the way you have to play the game. First things first: This is not a stealth game. Just kill everybody.\nIn case you’re thinking that I must be kidding … I’m not. Even a hint tells you exactly that.\n\nYour goal is to move from point A to B while murdering every enemy you see and sparing civilians at the same time Most of the time you want to stab the civilians in the face tho but sadly this isn’t part of your agenda. Bummer I know. If you manage to kill every enemy and sparing those civilians without triggering the alarm you can pat yourself on your shoulder because you’ve done a good job. Also you do get a skill point which you will need in order to run amok in a ninja-esque fashion. There’s a Decoy ability for example and, my personal favorite, a Shadow Strike which will basically teleport you to an enemy.\n\nWhile you’re able to control your character with either the Keyboard or the Control Sticks, depending on your input device, either moving around or jumping from place to place you’re unable to once you’re in combat. But why you must ask? Well little Johnny it’s simple. Sit down and listen. The combat is turn based. This might sound, feel and even look weird at first but after some initial starting problems I can safely say that it’s actually quite charming and fitting.\n\nBefore you’re going into your murder frenzy you have to get around. And sadly not on your Motorcycle. In order to locate and murder those former Associates of your beloved Father you have to either move around or, just as in Gunpoint, you jump from place to place and even through Windows. Hey you’re even wearing a Helmet so don’t be afraid to jump face first into those and your enemies!\n\nThere’s also a rather big part of stealth in this game, despite the hint telling you that this isn’t one. So make use of the shadows.\n\nOnce you’ve been seen and you’re in open combat you’ll have to make some decisions that will determine whether or not you will stab people in their faces or if you get shot in your face.\nIn the bottom left corner is your Limit bar which you’ll have to keep an eye on once you’ve unlocked some Skills. Every action grants you one point and a kill grants you two. It’s pretty straight forward from there.\n\nVisualI have to say that I do like the look of the game and I can see why this certain Art Style was chosen. While I do appreciate that I still have to say that I would have love to seen some variety. Every level and enemy looks the same. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it makes things dull rather quickly when you’re feeling like you’re at the same location basically the entire time.\nBut still like I said I like the way the game looks and it’s fitting.\n\nWhat else is there to say?It’s a shame. It truly is. I want to like the game I really, really do but … it’s mediocre at best.\nThe reason why I’m still recommending it is simple: It’s okay. It certainly isn’t bad nor fantastic but it’s not garbage. I’d say get it on sale if you’ve enjoyed Gunpoint or if you like such type of games but it really isn’t worth it’s full price. Which is truly sad. This game could have been so much better.\nHere’s to hoping that we will either get a Sequel or just some DLC which could fix a lot of it’s problems.","September 5, 2015","true","10.3"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","33","40","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robudev/recommended/274230/","robudev","[spinwise] Saucisse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robudev/","253 products in account","Okay, this is going to be a long one, so i'll start with the obvious : take what you'll read in this review with a grain of salt. It is my personal opinion on this game, and if after reading you still want the game, or think i'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, or that i'm over-critical, then by all means, go ahead and buy the game. And make your own opinion on the game.\n\nI got this game as part of the Humble Devolver Bundle of April 2016, and suffice to say that RONIN basically was the reason for me buying the bundle.\nOh boy, was I in for a world of Pain and Frustration.\n\nBecause yes, RONIN is the most Frustrating video game i've played in the 23 years I've been on this planet. Never had I ever insulted a game out loud like I did for RONIN. Never before had I wanted to punch my screen after the N-th death on the same level. But RONIN has this special quality about it that, after a few dozens of minutes with the game, you'll have forgotten you're human, and you'll be screaming at the screen like a beast each time the game tricks you.\n\nThat game made me ashamed of a behavior IT incepted in me. Shame on you, RONIN, Shame *bell rings 3 times*.\n\nLet's start with the main loop of the game : You have to kill a bunch of people, for some reason. The helmeted character you play as has an old picture of a group of people, and he/she circles the heads of his/her targets on it. When he/she has killed one, he/she crosses the head, and circles another, until you've killed them all (Kinda).\n\nWell... here comes the first negative point of the game. I still haven't explained what the basic gameplay principle is, and I already have something to point out : You'll never know why you go around and kill these targets. It is just never explained. But let's forgive this, a game has a right to be myterious.\nAt the start of the game though, you start assuming that you'll kill everyone on the picture, but only 5 heads out of 9-10 ever get circled. Why some are killed and others not, you'll never get the entire truth (though you'll get pointers on some of them). Which means that early on, the game makes you think there will be more levels than there actually is. So if you like the game, you'll be disappointed by the early end of it.\n\nThank god there wasn't more levels, though.\n\nSo onto the gameplay. For each target on the picture, you get several "info-gathering" levels, in which you go to buildings to which the target is linked in some way, to find out their location.\nThen you get a final level where you kill the target.\nNew target, rinse and repeat. The rinse and repeat part is in no way a problem though. The problem come from the levels themselves.\n\nIf you've read up to here, I'm assuming you've seen images or footage of the game, so i'll be short.\nThe game plays in real time, but switches to turn-based when encoutering an enemy in the level, putting you in combat-mode. This mode, i'll add, feels more like a strategy game than an action game. Here's why.\nIn combat-mode, enemies will try to shoot you, lunge at you with katanas, or report your presence on their phone, subsequently ringing the alarm.\n\nNot ringing the alarm is one of the optional challenges of all levels, so if - like me - you like to do everything perfectly on the first try, you WILL get frustrated really fast, because it is really hard to prevent the guards from ringing the alarm. Guards inside or outside of your view will ring it, civilians wil randomly ring it atfer seeing you, or after you broke a window in their general vicinity. And I could swear the timer on them is broken, it feels like sometimes it is not displaying the lowest alarm timer, so if you think you have 7 seconds to down a dude, well sometimes you're in for a reset because another dude has a 4 second timer on him.\n\nBecause the game is turn based, the enemy attacks are - mostly - preventable. You'll be presented with a series of red and white lines showing where the bullets will hit at the end of the turn. Your job is then to kill the guards while, at the end of each turn, not colliding with any of the lines. On the ground though, your character wil auto crouch and avoid bullets, to a certain degree (it is never actually shown when you'll avoid the bullets, but you build up a sense of when it will happen, which is actually one of the good points of the game).\nThe main problem with this is that the red lines represent several types of attacks, making it very confusing. Here is what a red line could represent :\n- a single bullet shot at the end of a turn;\n- a flurry of bullet shot all throughout the turn;\n- a katana lunge.\nWhile white lines represent a second turn of bullet flurry. It would have been easy to give all these attacks a differently colored line, but that wouldn't have been as frustrating, would it have now ?\n\nOn to the actual combat. The only way to move in combat-mode is basically the jump arc. It is a prediction of where you'll land if you aim your jump a certain way. In theory, it gives you a precise representation of the jump you're about to make. In practice though, it rarely is that precise. Here's why :\n- It is quit common to try and jump down a platform to avoid incoming fire, but instead of jumping down where the arc showed you would, you just jump forward on the platform a few pixels, taking all the incoming bullets in the face.\n- Sometimes you'll be close enough to an enemy to kill him, but you'll want to jump away instead, because of incoming fire. Instead of jumping properly like the ark showed you, though, you'll bash into that enemy and send him flying, resuting in a tiny jump at the end of which you're still on the path of the bullets.\n- In a lot of cases it is impossible to jump up a platform from under it, which just sucks. So if you planned to do that 2-3 turns ago, well congratulations you just trapped yourself. Have fun dying.\n\nOne important thing to note about the arc, is it will show you, by turning part of itself red, when during the jump the turn will end. This is a pivotal point of the gameplay because in many cases it allows you to kill a guard with minimum risk. Ideally you'd want to jump in way that, at the end of the turn, your jump hasn't finished and has put you just over a guard, so that other guards aim at you in the air. Killing the guard under you then puts you under the bullet lines, out of harm's way.\nThe problem with this is that the arc is REALLY inaccurate, meaning sometimes (and this happens a lot) you'll do the method I mentionned before, expecting to float at the end of the turn, but despite the arc telling you you'll stop in the air, you finish the jump and end up on the ground anyway, usually to dye (the floor red).\n\nSome would tell me :"Saucisse, the jump arc IS an approximation, and you have to play around that."\nThe developers even put a tip in game saying "The arc jump is lie". Yeah, thanks a lot.\n\nBut the matter is that the combat-mode of this game is more strategy than action, and it requires precision. And when a job requires precision, you use precision tools.\nThat game is like being hired to nail nails (heh), and on your first day on the job your boss gives you a hammer with a foam handle, telling you : "That'll get the job done!" Non, it won't.\n\nI'd have a lot more to say on this game, but I  can hear you yawning. So here's a little conclusion.\n\nThere's a reason why I bought the Bundle for that game. It has potential. Heck, it was even fun at times. But ultimately the implementation of everything that made the game interesting in my eyes was just short of "good enough".\nI'm okay with brutally difficult, punishing games, but when you make a game like that, make sure it's oiled well, or your games loses all fairness.\nFrom cool turn-based action cinematic goodness to die-and-retry strategy, the promising RONIN in a nutshell...\n\nToo bad.\n\n(English isn't my mother language.

On top of that, several poorly placed checkpoints have resulted in me having to restart levels from the beginning, which is extremely frustrating when most of what this game involves is solving the combat puzzles through trial and error. It's a damn shame, as the game is actually a lot of fun when it's not seeking to stifle your enjoyment of it.\n\nThere is still fun to be had here, and those that really think they can look past these points I've made should pick this up when it's on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/recommended/274230/","adam1224","adam1224","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adam1224/","1546 products in account","Ronin in an indie turn-based semi-stealth platformer game by Tomasz Wacławek. It admittedly borrows some features from the excellent Gunpoint (I guess the physics, somewhat modified and the jump-system) but otherwise it's combat system that makes it unique - as soon as an enemy notices you, the game changes from real-time roaming into turn based combat - you see where the enemies target, indicated by red lines, and basically you want to not to end your turn on one of those lines, but to knock the enemies up then finish wish a quick stab. Sounds easy, but more than 2-3 enemies can really make hard to pull off this feat.\nAt the start of the gameplay I was really optimistic about the game, but with time I had less and less enthusiasm. There are really obvious problems with the game and some less noticiable ones, that need time and attention to notice.\nPositives:\nUnique turn based fight\nSkilltree\nPulling off some great dodging then finishing enemies rewards the player with the real feel of success\nWell placed checkpoints during most of the game (!)\nGood level design, where accuracy pays off. For example if you jump in through a window, kill a guy (2 turns) you'll get 2 energy from the kill (good for a decoy, but not much) , and everyone else will aim at you. But if you land ON a guy, knock him out (1E) then kill him while he's in the air (2E) you'll have 3 energy that's enough for a teleport attack that helps you to stun at least one enemy while dodging all the bullets and sets up the rest of the fight nicely.Negatives: Sadly a lot of thing. A LOT.\nPhysics is broken. There are incredible amounts of clipping issues - grappling through walls, jumping through full building, including numerous walls, throwing sword out of the map, falling below the map, or kicking enemies inside the walls. Not to mention when you pass through enemies without stunning them and they just shoot you. (If you try to jump away and upwards from a vertical glass panel, you often slide down. There's no sliding in the game. For some reason that's a really common bug)\nAI makes no sense on the long run.\n-Sometimes enemies spawn from previously closed doors. The game supposed to be part-puzzler - but the spawned enemies are random! Your strategy against an agent (simple shot) means nothing if there's a guard armed with machine gun (burst), that means totally different firing pattern (especially in new game+)\n- Enemies spawning at said doors ocassionally require one turn to aim at you. Another time they aim instantly.\n-Sometimes enemies don't even fire at you, but above you, seemingly randomly. Besides it making no sense logic-wise, it can completely block your movements and lead to your death.\n-Clipping or AI, I don't know which category - but sometimes you can jump through the machine gun's burst, another times you die from it.\nThe game can't figure out sometimes who should attack first. Basically you see the enemy aiming at you by his red indicator line, and you dodge it - so you move first. But if you're standing in the way of the fire close enough, you can attack him as well. Sometimes you kill him. Another time he kills you. Again another time both of you die!\nThere's almost no explanation about game mechanics. We have hints about the game not being Gunpoint, or that the hints can't be turned off, but you don't know how much energy needed for a skill when you unlock it. No mention that you can not stun the samurai because he'll cut you in half. Nor that the machinegunner spray 'n prays your position for three (?) turns. Of course, you can learn these on the fly, as the game doesn't really punishes death. Or is it? See the next point.\nNot unbearably, but overly long dead animation. Plus way too long loaing screen to restart the level when sometimes I didn't even moved from the same screen. While games like Hotline Miami kills you waaaay more often, it can be restarded in the blink of the eye, while in Ronin it can take more than 10 seconds. It doesn't sound too much, but multiply it with the numerous death previously written "features" can cause.\nMobility during fight. It's just terrible. You can only jump, even when you want to move a few steps. You have time to jump over 5 metres away but not for three steps.  The grappling hook is almost useless during said fights - you don't know how much you'll swing - I think it may be affected by the lenght of the rope, but anyways, it's a highly uncalculable and unpredictable tool. Now combine the two faults! You can not move normally, neither use grapling hook in a trustworthy way - meaning you are almost incapable to get a guard who's above you, even in an arm's reach. You need to jump, grappling hook to the ceiling, pull yourself up then jump on him - FOUR TURNS minimum.  The lockdown countdown starts from 9... In The Mark of the Ninja it would be a simple stab...  So long story short, while the idea of turn based fight is good, the implementation is really, really lucking and crude.\nI've nearly forgot this: THERE IS NO STORY. All you know that you have a character in biker helmet with a sword, who has a picture with persons who she (Based on comments you need the Special Edition to even know your hero is actually a heroine, or anything more about the story) will kill - so it's a vendetta story, but that's all. No story, no explanation, no reasoning why is there a bleed-out mechanic at the last level instead of the usualy shot-dead.( At this level if you're damaged, you'll die in 9 turns. Each hit decreases your life by one additional turn, and kills restore it to 9, though it will still tick down)I want to mention the feature level bugs - you can make the game almost stay in one place, meaning you can kill 4-5 enemies with sword throws before you even fall as much as one floor - or when you can climb up on a building faster than the elevator even starts :)  Plus the sword throw quite funny - you can call the sword back *towards* you. If you jump and dodge it, it will fly further and can potentially kill someone. And you can repeat this.\nOne can have quite much fun with cheezing kills with this methods, but at the end the problems will cause the game to be more frustratingly hard, than enjoyable hard.  A last positive aspect - all of the negatives are fixable by the developer, the base features of the game are working well (excluding the clipping), so there's still a possibility that this game can erradicate all the negatives I mentioned.","September 25, 2015","false","19.1"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","34","47","2","1"

Controls can be very finicky, and your movement options often get restricted in weird ways (like not having a quick way of climbing over a ledge/corner). Your jump is also pretty off-and-on, although it's less life-damaging as the game auto-pauses for you to line up a jump.\n\nThe game seems to be going for the Hotline Miami brand of repeated slaughter broken up by swift deaths, but the game's loadtimes tend to break that trance. They're not long, but definitely long enough to make the infinite deaths a pain in the ♥♥♥. It's comparable to a death in, say, Dark Souls, but the thing with a dark souls death is that your subsequent life is going to last longer than the thirty seconds it will in Ronin. As such, it gets swiftly tiresome, especially on very difficult sections.\n\nIf you want to upgrade skills, you'll want to go for the perfect runs in each level: no alarms, all enemies dead, all civilians spared. It's basically required for the later levels, although one upgrade in particular makes one of the bosses a two-turn affair, so hopefully they fix that.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is fun, nothing amazing, nothing horrible, and a few tracks are real stand-outs. They contribute to the game's tone, which is good, because there's no dialogue beyond a few loading screen monologues.\n\nIt's a decent game for a ten dollar pricetag, and will probably last you around eight hours for a single run - perhaps double that for a full new game+ run. That said, I really didn't feel a desire to go on after I'd beaten the game. Still, didn't consider it a waste of time, and the game takes a prety cool approach to a binary ending - there are no red vs blue buttons, just a matter of skill and some pretty cool thematic mechanics.\n","June 30, 2015","true","9.2"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","0"

Others are painfully hard - they require perfect execution and a lot of luck.\nFor example, main difficulty of second boss consists in a sheer amount of enemies in the boss room. I discovered only one single way to clear that room - a very specific way, which I had to add 40 minutes of repetition and memorization and random guessing. When I actually did it, there was no sense of accomplishment - only reason i accomplished it this time and didn't on other tries was luck. On this moment you might ask - what is luck in a game with no random numbers? Well, the problem is that lifeblood of this game is tiny, almost uncontrollable twitches of mouse that completely change course of almost every action. Taking the same action with just a bit of mouse twitch could turn it from best course of action to a total disaster.Due to this, I can't even imagine playing this game with controller.\nAmount of meaningful decisions you can actually make is really minor - action points for unknown reasons deteriorate every turn, and on most turns only thing you can actually do is run(jump) for your life. Overall, it just turns every fight that is not to easy to engage you into a long streak of endless jumps, during which you simply hope for a lucky moment when nobody will actually shoot at you.\nSoundtrack is great. Nothing else I can say about it.\nArt style is decent, although completely copied from mark of the ninja, with a little nice twist of taking-itself--less-serious.\nOverall, this game could(and, probably, still can) have a huge potential, but a set of mechanics and  level design promote only extreme caution and endless repetition, not creativity and proper choice-making. Unless something really serious is done to both those aspect of game I doubt it can be really enjoyable.\n","May 27, 2015","false","2.6"," 90 of 148 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","90","148","5","5"

The movement between real-time and turn-based is inconsistent (can't pull up ledges in turn-based? why?), the jumping arc is a suggestion at best, with many deaths being more the result of the jump not going where it claims it will than a miscalculation. Sometimes running into an enemy near a wall will make you clip through the wall, forcing you to restart the checkpoint\n\nIf the combat abilities are consistent at all then the issue is that the rules are never explained -- sometimes you can use your abilities with enough points accumulated and sometimes you can't. Enemy sightline raycasts are only visible outside of combat (and even then only sometimes?), so sometimes an enemy halfway across the map will target you, sometimes they won't.\n\nAll in all, the game would be fantastic for anyone who loved Gunpoint, Hotline Miami, or Mark of the Ninja, if it wasn't an unpolished mess. As-is, the difficulty of RONIN feels more like the product of bad design, rather than of player mistakes or imprecision like in the aformentioned games.","July 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","41","62","0","0"

But this game had a great idea - turn based action, dodging according to sight lines, planning out encounters - and really sank it all by being very fiddly and unpredictable. This game really should have had more playtesting and care put into designing areas, encounters and the basic platforming. What became the breaking point between 'this is kind of aggravating' and 'this game deserves a bad review' is the in-level tip, that 'The jump arc is a lie.'\n\nThat really brings home all the problems. When it's about precise attack dodging and knocking down enemies, doing little frog hops instead of leaping into someone aiming a gun at you means resetting. Trying to jump onto someone near a ledge sometimes means knocking in just underneath it, and there's no helping you if all you need to do is go up instead of jumping around aimlessly to do a simple climb. The jump arc is essential to playing the game, but is unreliable and frustrating; that's not funny, that's just poor design.","May 2","false","2.2"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","2"

This is shocking to me; not only because he likes it (which, still) but because he was also SO bullish about Invisible, Inc.\n\nIf Invisible, Inc. is a masterclass in how to make a turn-based stealth combat game really WORK and provide the player with all the information they need to make informed choices (and it is!), this can be considered its antithesis. When in-combat tooltips mention that the projected jump arc -- your ONLY form of in-combat movement, and the only means by which you can avoid instant death to a single bullet -- is "a lie" then you know you're in for a rotten time. The number of deaths to randomly falling short of a projected landing point, stopping dead because you hit someone to knock them out (which usually lets you keep going???) or unexpectedly crossing over an enemy's line of fire are many and infuriating!\n\nThe poor signposting and bad readability don't stop there, sadly. Your special abilities, gated by consuming Limit points, are usually OFF-limits, as you'll automatically burn your entire stock upon filling up, getting a free turn that's usually much less useful than a ranged instant kill, but too bad! It's never quite clear how near you need to be to kill enemies -- which is a problem when that is what the gameplay entirely consists of -- you're sometimes able to snatch flying enemies out of the air and sometimes not, sometimes teleport short distances through floors for a killing blow, sometimes not... and the ever-present problem of not knowing where you will be standing when you are DONE killing an enemy often as not leads to your heroine helpfully standing in the line of fire of a shot that would have missed, had you only known.\n\nThere are a lot of other problems with polish, like the "humorous" tooltips that "humorously" mention they can't be disabled -- good one dude, glad you prioritized this over working jump arcs -- or the incredibly bad movement both in AND out of combat, the entirely nonfunctional "stealth" elements... just don't get this.

Go to the maker's website and download the demo:\nhttp://teedoubleu.itch.io/ronin\n\nNot the 'demo', the prototype demo. The 5MB prototype where your character contains less pixels than Guybrush Threepwood. Play that prototype demo.\n\nIf you enjoyed it, play it a few more times and stop there.\n\nRONIN had the chance to be a good game, but it's so damn hard it's near impossible to enjoy. I might even go so far as to use the term 'broken'. There's lots of level texture variation but very little variation in gameplay - and it becomes a tedious slog to get through a single level. Let me go through a few bits and pieces in depth.\n\nStealth.\nStealth is completely missing. You can either get through a room without being seen or you can't, and most of the time it's the latter, which is upsetting. You'll hope to see multiple entry points to a room like in Gunpoint, but as the 'hints' that appear ON EVERY TURN will tell you 50% of the time, "This isn't Gunpoint." There is usually only one way into a room, which requires you to run right into full view of all the enemies and limits your stealth to linear hallways.\n\nMovement.\nA novel way of playing, with the turn-based platforming combat. Or it would be, if you could move outside of jumping during the combat. You can't. You are restricted to jumping, no movement or crouching or anything like that. You also crouch after certain jumps seemingly at random, so you'll never know if the jump you're making will take you under the line of fire or not. I would (un)happily agree with other reviewers that the second boss is simply learning the directions to jump in for half an hour or more of tedious trial and error. This does not make a fun game.\n\nSadly, it also suffers from clunkiness. Climbing is particularly bad. It tries to copy Mark of the Ninja and falls flat on its face.\n\nCombat.\nYour combat is basically jumping at people and then severing their arteries with a large sword. However, everyone but you has ranged weapons, and it becomes a refreshing form of combat in a way. However, jump-kicking people also affects your jump arc, which means you will almost certainly die because you accidentally kicked someone and passed directly into the line of fire. Another unfunny hint screen: "The jump arc is a lie."\n\nOh, and good luck trying to hack a console or go through a doorway during combat, because the symbols for those actions do not appear until you have become 'hidden' (got out of everyone's sight lines) or killed everyone.\n\nSkill tree.\nLiterally no reason to include this in this game, or to use 'Action Points' to allow you to use the skills. Tried the prototype demo? So yeah, you can totally just throw your sword at people (when airborne) from the beginning, and recall it to you from a distance. In the full game you have to purchase the ability to throw your sword by spending a skill point (I'll get to this in a sec). But wait, there's more!\n\nTo throw your sword in combat, you have to have at least three Action Points, which deteriorate by one a turn every time you don't do something ACTIONY, like kicking people, or actually using your sword (a rarity between all the bullet avoidance). You'll be jumping around so much just to avoid incoming fire that you won't earn any AP unless you get extremely lucky with enemy placement and reloading intervals. Once you get enough AP to use the ability (2AP) you think you'll jump into the air and get to use the ability. Wrong. You jumped and didn't do anything actiony, so you lose an AP and waste your expected sword-throwing moment. So you have to get at least THREE AP, so that you can waste one on the jump before you use your ability.\n\nSo you finally work out how to throw your sword at someone and it's all flashy and brilliant and you go to recall it back to you and ... oh no. You can't do that until you purchase the ability to do it. Which costs two skill points. Why two? Because you need to spend one first, to unlock an empty node on the skill tree which doesn't give you anything. Why. Why. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS. So now you're running jumping around the room, empty handed, kicking people until you can get to the one moment where everyone's reloading and you're close enough to your sword to pick it up (and since you can't just move like normal during combat, that requires you to get the perfect jump or OH NO! Everyone's reloaded, time to go jumping again). This basically makes the entire ability to throw your sword worthless until you can get the ability to recall it.\n\nEarning Skill points is the worst. To do it, you have to complete all three side objectives in a level. These are:\nNo alarms. NPCs can spot you all you like, but if you happen to disappear out of sight of one of them, and eight seconds pass before you get back to them, they trigger an alarm and you fail this objective.\nKill all enemies. Usually easy enough but horrible in some big fights.\nSpare civilians. Considering there are civilian areas where there is no option but to walk through the light, achieving both this one and No Alarms on all levels is completely impossible.\nLimit Break.\nWhat is this and why is it here. Essentially, when you build up to 5AP, you automatically 'Limit Break', which lets you perform two actions in a single turn before the enemies can react. That's great for when you want to do that. Other times you'll be trying to get into position to throw your sword, and suddenly LIMIT BREAK! "You have no AP now, but feel free to aimlessly jump nowhere because we wasted all your action points."\n\nMachine-gun enemies.\nThis was an interesting development since in the demo, all the enemies used pistols. I thought it would be interesting to pick them off first and avoid their fire, but they're so inconsistently programmed even between individual enemies in a single room. Usually, they fire a long burst and aim towards you, so you're under suppressing fire. This carries on for at least two turns, making the combat slightly more exhilarating as you try to avoid all the shots, especially with multiple enemies. However. They fire for inconsistent numbers of turns (2-5) at random, and sometimes you can jump past their bullets safely and sometimes you can't, at random.\n\nCheckpoints.\nCheckpoints happen completely at random and at the worst possible places. In Mark of the Ninja, a vastly superior game which you should buy if you haven't already, a checkpoint would appear in a reasonable spot, somewhere out of the way of guards where you could easily reconsider your approach and start doing a different route if you wanted to. In RONIN, it drops a checkpoint on you whenever it feels like it, or not at all, such as reloading you in the middle of a brightly lit room full of enemies.\n\nStory.\nLimited. From what I gather, you're an assassin trained or programmed by a corporation, and you've gone rogue and decided to take out your creators. Sadly, the immersion was lost when we ran into spelling errors during the few, single screen story moments. Working with a company like Devolver, you should at least have had a proofreader go over the script to check for errors, but somehow you missed some.\n\nGraphics.\nI usually wouldn't mention this of a platformer, but I do appreciate the upgrade from pixelated Black Widow lookalike to sprited Kill Bill stunt double. The sprites are nicely animated and seem to be well thought-out.\n\nAnything else.\nSoundtrack's pretty rad. That's about it, though, sadly.\n\nAll in all, do not buy unless fixed. I paid £9 so you don't have to. Go buy Mark of the Ninja and Gunpoint instead. Just don't buy RONIN.","May 28, 2015","false","4.3"," 49 of 79 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","49","79","3","11"

The gimmick is this turn-based combat system that has you jumping around from place to place, trying to avoid gunfire so that you can get up close to stab your enemies with a sword. When it works, it's pretty brilliant. It's a good mechanic, but it lacks polish, and when your one original idea comes with serious bugs, it ruins the entire game. The big issue is that this jumping ballet requires extreme precision, and very tactical thought, as a single mistake will see you dead, and so when the game tells you your jump is going to land you in a certain area, you need to be able to trust with 100% certainty that you will land where expected, else you are likely to die. The problem is that a decent percentage of the time, the game will screw up your trajectory just enough to get you killed, and see you frustratingly replay the same section over and over and over again.\n\nWorse is when the game decides abruptly, and for very little reason, to suddenly drop you out of the turn-based play, and back into real time. If an enemy spots you but you're too far away to attack, they will call in a Lockdown, which can screw up your progress, or cause automatic failure of the level. It takes them 9 turns, or 9 seconds, to initiate the lockdown, giving you 9 turns, or 9 seconds, to reach them and stop them from putting through the call. 9 turns is difficult enough in some of the particularly dangerous levels, where there are a dozen enemies around you, all trying to shoot you dead every turn. When the game suddenly drops you into real-time mode, you can suddenly lose 2-3 seconds before you even realize what's happened, and now you've gone from 8 turns to 5 turns through no fault of your own.\n\nThe game can easily be beaten in less than 4 hours, if you're decent at it and the game doesn't screw up repeatedly and cause you to have to replay sections of the game again and again and again. Two sections in particular, which should have been 5 minute sections to beat, took me over 90 minutes to beat because I kept dying. Sometimes it was my own fault, the game can be a challenge even when it's working flawlessly, which is a good thing, but a good chunk of the time I died because the game didn't do what it said it'd do, and got me killed as a result.\n\nBottom line: The game is reasonably fun, but I'd wait for it to go on a massive sale. Even at the entirely reasonable $10-13 dollar range it just doesn't feel like enough game, and the bugginess can really hurt the fun. If you can get it for $5, and don't mind some frustration, there's a fairly decent game here.","July 4, 2015","false","20.1"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","28","47","0","1"

Do you want to roleplay as a ninja? Like turnbased combat? Like platforming elements?\n\nFor me it reminds me of a bunch of elements from other games and then a few of its own aspects. Certain aspects remind me of Mark Of The Ninja and Hotline Miami but with its own unique turnbased combat once you have been seen. I really like the combat, just a blast to mess around with.\n\nThe things that could be improved for a sequel or expansion pack are as follows: With good writing this would really compliment the wonderful combat (Chris Avellone is in free agency atm, hint hint hehe) and if they made more variety for the types of missions. Also the game only plays at 30fps which isn't a huge deal for this game but still annoying and hopefully something they can improve in a next game.\n\nImagine this gameplay with some good writing for a revenge storyline, the game handles well and the art design fits the game well. If you don't mind the story being near non existent, give this a go! Good writing is one thing I love in games but this game is a great example of gameplay stealing the show and being more than enough to carry things. The many ways that you can go about these missions is wonderful and a make it a ton of fun to play. The soundtrack is also good, the atmosphere is well done and the fun factor is very high for me. Also bonus points for taking a chance and doing something new with the turnbased combat.\n\nReally interested to see what the devs do in the future as this turnbased combat for this type of game is breath of fresh air and something new. With a few improvements and better writing a sequel could be GOTY status.","July 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

If you had asked me before I started new game plus, I would have said 5 out of 5.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the stupidly high difficulty in new game plus. Apparently, since the 4th patch, the difficulty was drastically increased because the behavior of an enemy got changed (and new game plus gives you way too many of these enemies). I mean, the regular game was hard enough at some points, thanks to the level design, but new game plus absolutely takes the cake.\n\nSuggestions for improving this game:\n- Decrease the (stupidly high) difficulty of new game plus by reverting the behavior of that one enemy\n- Add a "watch replay" feature to see your gameplay again in real time (might be difficult because of checkpoints)\n\nOverall I would recommend the game and, on top of that, advise you to stay out of new game plus","May 2","true","6.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

The jump arc is inaccurate, the turn based combat, although interesting, results in you evading gunshots at the end of every turn rather than killing the enemy you've just stunned. On top of this, basic movement is not allowed in combat, meaning you can't just climb up this ledge to avoid gunfire, you have to jump, which uses one portion of your special meter, meaning you can't pull off moves nearly as often as you should be able to. The stealth mechanics are incredibly fun outside of battle but as  soon as you enter you've lost all of the mobility that makes you dangerous. A stealth combat game where you can pause time would have been much more fun than this forced turn based combat. Realistically the turns were only implemented to differentiate it from Gunpoint, which is a much more fun, challenging, and funny game.","August 20, 2015","false","5.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

Great art style and musics, however the gameplay is inconsistent. Basically, if you don't do like the devs wanted to, you can be punished baddly. Like the game ignoring a checkpoint because you didn't do the hacking in order and when you respawn you respawn way back because of it.\n\nIn some levels, some guards that weren't alerted will spot other guards alerted when the alerter guard is in the shadow and should not be seen. You're being seen in the light (logical), but sometimes you're not when you definitely should be seen (Hey Officer Boss!). When you're seen by ennemies, the game is supposed to pause for the turn based combat to happen, but sometimes it's not happening. That kind of sheit happened to me multiple times and lead me to jumping thinking there'll be a pause but nope and I ended up in a death trap (lasers or electricity).\n\nThe UI is overall fine but I had to find on the Steam Forums that I could move an elevator without being in here because the camera is always focusing on you and there is no visible stuff to indicate that you can do so without moving the camera around. Talking about moving elevator without being inside it, I don't get that feature. It was cool in Gunpoint but it's pretty much worthless here since it's useful in just one level.\n\nWhen it comes to the story it's pretty meh. You are basically avenging your father death from guys that were supposed to be his friends. There is not so much narration, like we don't know why we need to hack so many stuff to get the targets locations, why they did that stuff to the character's father. Which pretty much leads to me not giving a single ♥♥♥♥ about the happy or sad ending. Why should I care about the main character when we know almost nothing about her or that the story wasn't really engaging?\n\nLet's finish saying that this game has no keybinding options, which means that an AZERTY user like me was pretty much forced to play uncomfortably with arrows+mouse. And of course the 30fps (I feel for you 144Hz users.) just because the game team "didn't like" their 60fps build. To their credit about the 30fps lock, at the very least it's not too painful since the combat is turned base and the background scrolling in a 60Hz screen isn't so terrible.\n\nOverall, I find this game pretty Meh, which is sad since it would probably needs just some tweaks to it to make it more enjoyable.","August 16, 2015","false","6.9"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","9"

If the game allowed you to play back a level in real time you would probably look like the Primordial God of Ninjas by the time the credits roll.\n\nIt's one of the most mechanically creative and solid indie games I've played in years. A brilliant concept that shines confidence and precision in every aspect - the minimal storytelling puts you into the action immediately while still making the stakes clear, the mechanics are deep but don't require much explanation, it knows its limitations and the game ends before it starts asking too much of the player.\n\nMain problem is that around 10% of the time, the controls aren't as reliable as they should be, and can occasionally wig out on you, but outside of the last level the checkpoints are generous enough to where this isn't a dealbreaker.

I liked it then and I liked it now. The game manages to remain frantic while essentially being turn-based. It's neatly tactical and the pace is basically defined by the player. The environments may seem a little stale currently but it's basically to be expected given the content matter of the game.\nOur protagonist's jump arc is finicky to work with and for some reason he can't do an arc that is short horizontally but tall vertically. He's kind of an all or nothing about his jumps. Furthermore there are strange inconsistencies in how the protagonist will choose to kill a person, I'm sure they're all based on distance from and position of target, but I've loaded a checkpoint and moved down some stairs and immediately had a samurai get ready to strike me while I chose to kill a regular guard, sometimes leading to me striking the guard and moving just out of range of the samurai and sometimes leading to me striking the guard and being slaughtered by the samurai. In both instances I start this from the position of the stairs and choose the exact same path and it seems in both cases the samurai is about the same distance away.\nThis wouldn't be an issue if you could choose the length of your strike the rest of the time, but instead it's entirely based on positioning, which is something of an arbitrary gameplay restriction.\nAnother such arbitrary restriction is that although you can use the scaffolding parts as floors that you  can travel through from below, you cannot use them as ceilings that you travel through from above, meaning that you cannot hang bodies from them. You get used to it quickly, it just seems like a bizarre restriction on the gameplay and you wouldn't expect these restrictions to be in place.\nThis sounds like I'm panning the game but these are just minor issues, it's an engaging game\nIf you're curious about the game just play the free demo damn it","May 27, 2015","true","9.5"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Think forward, and your character can perform spectacular combos, crushing hosts of enemies. Sometimes you need quick reaction (mostly when real-time actions changes to turn-based) still.

I've seen reviews saying that the game is too short, but I don't feel that's true. It is a game with layers of difficulty. You can make the game as difficult as you want in order to achieve bonus objectives for skill points. Often that requires playing the same level multiple times until you have that 'perfect run', which really appeals to the OCD completionist in me :). That can pad out the game length significantly (if you choose to). It also ramps up the difficulty. At some points the game gests harder than a blind lesbian's nipples in a fish market. But it never got frustrating to the point of not being FUN! The harder the challenge, the more motivating it was to beat it. I remember thinking that the first boss was IMPOSSIBLE until I had that 'ah ha!' moment and solved the problem. It was VERY satisfying. After that I felt like I was ready to take on anything the game threw at me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/david_reid/recommended/274230/","david_reid","Jesse Pinkman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/david_reid/","288 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTl:dr – Ronin is a side-scrolling action-platformer, with turn based combat, that adds a fresh perspective to the stealth kill genre. Great atmosphere, music and combat system allow this game to shine where others have lacked. Currently in early beta access, it feels complete enough to warrant the purchase. With a skill tree allowing new abilities to be unlocked, retribution will be swift on the ones who have done you wrong. I definitely recommend giving this a shot if you are looking for a fresh challenge in this genre.\n\nFull review below and link to article\n\nIndieGamersUK - http://indiegamers.co.uk/archive/2015/06/22/lets-take-a-look-at-ronin/\n\nRonin a side-scrolling action-platformer developed by Tomasz Waclawek and published by Devolver Digital. I’ve played games published by Devolver before, all of which are extremely stylized and unique. Ronin does not disappoint, and I quickly fell into the world that this game was portraying.\n\nThe first few levels serve as a tutorial, getting you into the swing of the games play-style. You control your street ninja by jumping, wall climbing and slicing through levels. Complete the 3 optional objectives in each stage (avoid triggering the alarm, kill all enemies, spare civilians) and you’ll earn a skill point which you can then spend on various upgrades to how your character can attack. They call these Limit Breaks.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of Ronin is the combination of a turn based combat system with free-flowing movement. Each level consists of a combination of buildings with locked doors, windows and elevators. Each building has computer terminals to hack, and bad guys to kill; it’s your task to work your way through them. The moment you are spotted by the enemy the game switched to the turn-based system, allowing you to plan out your attack. Enemies’ bullets or movements will be reflected as a red line that shows the path they’re going to take to attack you. Once the turn has ended you make your next move by either jumping on them, for stunning purposes, or by cutting them down with your sword. Kill enough enemies and the skills you’re able to purchase come into play as your limit break goes up, allowing you to perform more elaborate sequences. Throw your sword, create a decoy, or even teleport to an enemy to gain the advantage. The odds are often against you, you but with careful planning, and the right combination of skills, every fight is winnable.\n\nThere is a story underpinning Ronin, although it’s a bit cryptic. You aren’t even sure what your name is, or the true meaning behind some of the bigger targets you will have to go up against.  It appears someone did you wrong and you’re on a crusade for retribution. The boss fights offer interesting scenarios, requiring even more careful planning to defeat them and their cronies. Enemies are fairly varied. There are agents with pistols, super agents with machine guns that fire for two rounds and a samurai who is just a PAIN in the ♥♥♥ to kill. There are also civilians that can be killed, but that should be avoided unless you plan on not earning your coveted skill point. If the civilians see or hear you, for example if you break a window near one, they’ll trigger the alarm. They’re almost as dangerous as the enemies shooting at you!\n\nEach level felt familiar but there was enough variance to keep me interested for the 7 hours I played. There are only 2 music tracks, but both are great and really add to the atmosphere. I wasn’t able to finish it as the last mission is real crazy, but I was engaged throughout and really enjoyed my time. Once I finish the game I’ll update on the story more so be sure to check back for that.\n\nRating – 8/10","June 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Skills get really intense because they add complimentary skills that work off of them, such as teleporting to stunned enemies that you may have stunned with a shuriken rain, being able to use the decoy without needing to pick up the hologram itself, and much more.\n\nThe music is simplistic, but keeps to the original game. Such as battle music stepping out of the stealth music boundaries, elevator music that is annoying yet funny and catchy.\n\nOverall:\n5/10 -Story(vague mainly because early access, but it is the simplistic daughter seeking vengeance I believe)\n9/10- Gameplay(gives the same challenges that Hotline Miami would give you, except more linear)\n7/10-Music(like I said, simplistic but catchy)\n\nOverall: 8.5/10(more likely a 9 because I am a bit biast because it tried to push something "new and creative)(but this isn't much of a biast review, now is it?)\n\nAlso Samurais are the silliest but most broken thing in this game.

As of 06/01/2015, the game is labelled as Early Access, but it is in fact complete. The devs want to bug test and get feedback before the June release (unless it's pushed back again).\n\nIt is a simple little game presented in a simple art style with a minimalistic approach to character progression. The soundtrack is wonderful if a bit understated. Completing missions is a combination of stealth, turn-based combat, and puzzle solving. There is a sense of being a powerful ninja that can dodge bullets and clean out an entire room of hostiles with a careful tactical approach.\n\nHowever, the game mechanics are seriously flawed. Completing missions is more about memorizing certain patterns, and repetitively jumping around to avoid being shot or cut down by samurai. There is also an attrition factor in that the longer the fights going, the more likely you are to get killed. You might say that tactics comes into play here, but they don't. The player has little in the way of tactical capability; special abilities require a power gauge type device to fill before he/she can use an ability - it is filled by stunning and/or killing enemies - and if you find yourself in the endless jumping phase to avoid getting killed you will most likely never fill the bar. Additionally, you can't use the abilities unless you are in mid-air which presents additional problems because if you spend a turn to jump into the air, you run the risk of depleting the gauge rending the special ability useless.\n\nThe platforming aspect of the game is also perplexing. The jump indicator (represented as an arc) often indicates that you will land in a certain area, but then drops you onto a platform that is in the way, often times leaving you in the path of a stray bullet (one shot one kill in this game).\n\nThe level design is interesting to begin with, but overall boarders on the too easy or the absurdly difficult.\n\nThe game itself is not so much challenging as it is extremely frustrating, relying on handicapping the player to make it difficult, more than sophisticated game design that tests the players ability to think laterally.\n\nThe story is so-so. A simple revenge story with two endings depending on how the final mission goes for you.\n\nSo if it's so bad why do I recommend it? Because the game has a lot of potential to be a fantastic little distraction, but falls way short of the mark because of flawed game mechanics. The ideas might work on paper, but in practice they not so much.\n\nIf you want to kill 5-8 hours get it, but I'd say wait for a steam sale.\n\n6/10","May 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The second you realize you can stop time as often as you want as long as nobody has noticed you yet it becomes really awesome. It can be painfully annoying at times to play the same part over and over, especially when the checkpoint requires you to walk a long way rather than just spawning you at the beginning of the battle, but just like Hotline Miami it gives you an overwhelming satisfaction when you've finally finished that hart part you've been playing for an hour.\n\nThis is the kind of satisfaction that modern games ceased to give. Nowadays it's all about quick achievement, this game is about doing the same thing over and over until you're doing it perfectly and you're finally feeling like a ninja.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nPros:\n-The ambient feeling is very fitting\n-A lot of stealth, but you can also just massacre your way through\n-The soundtrack is pretty cool, even if a little repetitive at times\n-The gameplay, being a mix of gunpoint and Hotline Miami, is unlike anything I have ever played\n-Skilltree you can choose from\n-Cool storyline\n\nCons:\n-Not too long, but has a "plus" mode after finishing the game\n-Sometimes glitching through the floor ( happened like 3 times in 5 hours of playtime)\n-Checkpoints sometimes are at very stupid spots\n\nAll in all I'd give this game a 9/10\n","July 4, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The snarky 'jump arc is a lie' hint shows that this is intentional, but watching your character die, AGAIN, because what happened in reality differed from what you told the game to do, is incredibly frustrating. This is exacerbated by the arbitrary checkpoints, and in the New Game +, the Lockdown mechanic.\nI can heartily recommend the game's normal playthrough, but I advise buyers to not even bother with New Game Plus, at least as it stands at the moment. The addition of the unpredictable machine-gun fire mixed with an auto-fail for Lockdown makes NG+ a tiresome slog that ends up in unbelievable frustration in the most basic of levels, as it's reduced to a trial-and-error grind-game to race towards the one infuriating enemy doggedly calling in Lockdown.\nHopefully the dev can consider removing Lockdown's auto-fail from NG+, as it's challenging enough as it is.","July 6, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are some issues/glitches with it but it's very fun.  Firstly I want to say to anyone looking for a stealth game that this isn't it.  You can stealth through portions of the game (and I would reccomend it) but it's seems more meant to help you thin the ranks before engaging full force.  This is particularly worthwhile when on the final level, where enemies abound and it's easy to get overwhelmed.\n\nThe combat's very fun, and you feel totally badass while jumping and flipping, teleporting and throwing your sword, kicking enemies into mines and using guards as human shields against enemy samurai (I can't honestly tell if this is intended behavior or not, it's hard to replicate, but it feels AMAZING when you pull it off)... and that's most of the game really.  Making neat stuff happen.  It's fairly difficult, and quite often until you learn the 'rules' of movement it can be very frustrating when your character does something that it seems like he shouldn't and it gets you shot in the head.\n\nOverall I would reccomend it if you like turn based combat with a requirement to be strategic I would reccomend you pick this up.

And it's actually a plus for me.\n\nTurn based combat is great, allowing the player to plan their jumps and other actions. Grab walls, use the grapling hook to swing, collide with enemies making them fall or just cut them right away. While simple in the beginning it offers quite a few strategies later on. The character can teleport, throw her sword, use decoys, throw shurikens to stun enemies etc. You decide what suits you the most by upgrading the skill tree.\n\nI find the gameplay to be a decent mix of skill and luck, so if you lack one, you can compensate with the other. It's worth mentioning that the game is hard in a good way, not the frustrating way. Finishing a tough part can be really satisfying.\n\nOn the minus side, the story is pretty simple, but I didn't find it to be a huge disadvantage, bacause I like the gameplay anyway. As the game is in early access few things need some upgrading. For example there are some empty places in the skill tree, that are only used to unlock more advanced skills later. I think those empty spots should be filled with actual skills or different kinds of bonuses. I also experienced few crashes, but none of them were gamebraking and they usually happened after I died anyway.\n\nOn the plus side:Action oriented (for me)\nSatisfying, turn based fights\nDifferent skills, resulting in various fighting strategies\nChallenging gameplay\nThe gameplay is a good mix of skill and luck\n\nOn the minus side:Simple story\nSome non-gamebraking crashes\nSkill tree requires some additional skills or bonuses\n\nOverall:7.5/10 (recommended)","June 4, 2015","true","12.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's this unique gameplay that really sets Ronin apart from other turn bassed games. It's deep, fun and very satisfying, which is an incredibly rare thing for a turn based game. The visuals and over all style is extremely cool too.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much of story beyond a simple objective. This works, for this game, but it would've been cool if there was a cool tale woven through out it.  Still, it's an absolutely brilliant game, that balances its difficulty perfectly. It's not easy, but very beatable, and your hardwork is rewarded. Overall, I would say this is one of the best games I've played in a long time.","June 28, 2015","true","29.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

The story was expertly written and presented, despite the difficulty of framing a wide array of characters and giving them a lot of depth and development while keeping the characters' personalities true. I have reviewed Captain America, Civil War, because I just got back from watching it, and Ronin has no plot but is superb anyway.\n\nRonin is a game about being a (cyborg?) ninja that's out for revenge. I didn't know if I was enhanced cybernetically, and I didn't know why I was out for revenge, but I revenged the hell out of all the antagonists. It was fun and it was challenging and it made me smile (sometimes), even when I died. Set aside your prejudice against turn-based combat and dig into this game. My best description of Ronin is that this game reminds me of a pie. If someone offers to sell you a pie at a reasonable price, you buy it and eat it, because pie is delicious.

The controls are a bit finicky, so take some time learning where everything is. Expect to die often.\nReplayability is pretty decent, but content is a bit lacking since there are only 15 stages and three types of enemies.

It has loads of style and the gameplay is pretty unique.\nI guess you can compare it to Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, but it's really it's own game.\n\nI will say that I had one big problem with the design ---- the lines\nThere are two kinds of line in this game:\nred lines that signify incoming enemy attacks\nand the white line that shows your movement path\nMy gripe with the attacks is that you cannot differentiate between enemy type without panning through the map to see the point of origin. It would be nice to be able to tell which line will do what without breaking the flow to move the camera around the map.\nThe white line shows where you will jump but the streak that you input is much smaller than the character, resulting in accidentally jumping into fire when you thought you were clear.\nI realize that this game was EA before, but unfortunately I didn't purchase it when it was. And maybe I'm the only one that can't anticipate when I'm going to be clipped by jumping too close to a bullet's path...\n\nThough 'this isn't Gunpoint' the levels really feel like it. You go from room to room taking out guards, unlocking the next floor/room and stealing data. You need to stay in an area before moving on or else an enemy will call for a lockdown. I really liked the last level where lockdowns were absent and you could quickly swing from room to room in rapid succession, killing in flashy and badass ways. In most encounters you jump between positioning yourself for a kill and all of a sudden trying to stop a lockdown counter. If the whole game was moving quickly, swinging like spiderman and slaying foes as quickly as possible; I would have had a load more fun. Most of my deaths were a result of trying to get to another part of the room because a guard is counting down.\n\nOh and civilians are way too keen, they call in for the littlest things......\n\nThat being said, Ronin is still a really excellent game with challenging encounters and tons of style. This review may have seemed a bit negative but I think Ronin is one  of the better games I've played this half of the year. Though the enemy juggling and the visuals can be frustrating, the experience still gets a sparking Recommendation.","July 2, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First off, this game is frustrating, and it's not in the fun or rewarding way like super meat boy.  I only got to the first few levels of the game before I got stuck.  I got into moments where I could spend up to 20 minutes jumping around trying not to get hit.   While at the same time not killing anyone because I'm too busy staying in the line of sight of EVERYONE in the room, so the alarm isn't triggered.  Since the game is turned based, I can't simply jump over to someone, kill them then back in the line of sight of everyone else.  Almost everything you do takes up your turn.  So first you have to jump over to someone, and then wait a turn before you can attack.  So it becomes hard to lower the amount of people in the room, and not trigger the alarm or get shot.  You may ask why I care so much about the alarm being triggered.  Because in RONIN, you can only progress in the skill tree by completing side objectives.  ALL of the side objectives in the level, and they're all the same.  Don't set the alarm off, don't kill civilians and kill everyone.  If you fail ONE of those, you have to restart to a checkpoint if you actually want to progress in the game.  There are also many other flaws like locked 30 fps, but that doesn't really matter in a turn based game.  After all the flaws I have to give this game a positive review.  The combat is so damn fun (when you aren't stuck in frustrating levels).  Hopefully if a sequel is made, that they fix all the problems from the first one.

It has loads of style and the gameplay is pretty unique.\nI guess you can compare it to Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja, but it's really it's own game.\n\nI will say that I had one big problem with the design ---- the lines\nThere are two kinds of line in this game:\nred lines that signify incoming enemy attacks\nand the white line that shows your movement path\nMy gripe with the attacks is that you cannot differentiate between enemy type without panning through the map to see the point of origin. It would be nice to be able to tell which line will do what without breaking the flow to move the camera around the map.\nThe white line shows where you will jump but the streak that you input is much smaller than the character, resulting in accidentally jumping into fire when you thought you were clear.\nI realize that this game was EA before, but unfortunately I didn't purchase it when it was. And maybe I'm the only one that can't anticipate when I'm going to be clipped by jumping too close to a bullet's path...\n\nThough 'this isn't Gunpoint' the levels really feel like it. You go from room to room taking out guards, unlocking the next floor/room and stealing data. You need to stay in an area before moving on or else an enemy will call for a lockdown. I really liked the last level where lockdowns were absent and you could quickly swing from room to room in rapid succession, killing in flashy and badass ways. In most encounters you jump between positioning yourself for a kill and all of a sudden trying to stop a lockdown counter. If the whole game was moving quickly, swinging like spiderman and slaying foes as quickly as possible; I would have had a load more fun. Most of my deaths were a result of trying to get to another part of the room because a guard is counting down.\n\nOh and civilians are way too keen, they call in for the littlest things......\n\nThat being said, Ronin is still a really excellent game with challenging encounters and tons of style. This review may have seemed a bit negative but I think Ronin is one  of the better games I've played this half of the year. Though the enemy juggling and the visuals can be frustrating, the experience still gets a sparking Recommendation.","July 2, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QQuixotic/recommended/274230/","QQuixotic","QQuixotic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QQuixotic/","260 products in account","RONIN is a neat action/strategy game about jumping on walls, swinging from grappling hooks, and most importantly dodging bullets as you slash entire facilities of mooks to shreads.\n\nThe game exists in two 'phases', spotted and not spotted. If not spotted, you move around with regular WADS controls, and can create leap arcs to walls, send out grappling hooks, choke people who haven't seen you, and pause time (with Space, super important for taking out several enemies before being spotted).\n\nWhen spotted, the game becomes entirely turn based where you lose the ability to walk and can use leaps and the grappling hook to get around. Red lines will show where bullets are about to be fired so at your turns end you either need to not be near any of them or you need to kill whoever is holding the gun. There are mechanics that allow you to throw your sword and a few other powerups that aren't very useful. Being spotted but then disengaging from combat will cause them to call in a lockdown as well, making the rest of the level harder. Every level except the last has three 'bonus' goals: Kill all enemies, kill no civilians (useless, but can call in a lockdown), and don't allow a lockdown to occur. Getting them all in one level gives you a skill point to invest into upgrades.\n\nThere are quarks in the game to consider. The arc of your jump doesn't give you information like if you'll hit someone, if the glass will stop you (you need enough momentum to break it), etc, but overall the game is solid and gives you all the information you need to make an informed decision (as long as you realize reinforcements are always coming anyway).\n\nThe discussions page has a LOT of people complaining that the game is too hard, but nothing even close to unfair starts until new game plus, where a few modifications make the game boarder on the masochistic. On your first playthrough, though, you simply need to evaluate your straetgy and git gud and you'll have no trouble at all.\n\nTHE RUNDOWN: Kinda difficult, sometimes frustrating, but pretty fair- this game is the challenge you might be interested in. Fun gameplay, and is long enough to feel worth ten bucks or so without dragging on. Do recommend.","May 19","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remember how cool it was to swing around, infiltrate buildings, pull off stealth kills? If so, this game is for you.\n\n\nPros\n* Lovely, atmospheric graphics\n* Great music\n* Fun turn based combat mechanic\n* Excellent level design\n* Addictive\n* Free to complete level however you want\n\nCons\n\n* Skills (and therefore, game progress) are tied to perfect completion of "optional objectives". So, one small ♥♥♥♥ up can mean no new skills for you...without which you'll find the latter levels nigh impossible\n\n* Some of the cones of visibility are incredibly arbitrary, without indication of what they are at all\n\n* The civilians are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You can't kill them nor incapacitate them. What I wouldn't have give for non-lethal civilian takedown\n\n* The "lockdown" (you've been spotted by a civilian or an enemy and have 9 seconds to deal with it) is often unfair. How someone on the other side of the map can see you through several walls is baffling\n\n* Some of the control mechanics are not explained in game. For example (and this is important) holding down spacebar pauses the game in real time, allowing you to perform quick actions (such as break through a window, launch a  grappling hook at the roof and then hang enemies) before they can react.  This because important later on.\n\n\nUltimately, I can summarise the game experience in four words:  Flawed. Beautiful. Irritating. Fun.\n\nTo the designer (Tomasz):  I bought this (at full price) to let you know that I appreciate your effort. It's not hard to find pirated versions of this (and most) Steam games but I paid $12.99 to  say "thanks for making Ronin".

Having said that, this game makes sure to point out that at it's heart it is NOT a stealth game. One of the recurring objectives is kill all enemies, so a non-lethal approach will not work here.\n\nAs for the game itself, the gameplay is very reminiscent of Gunpoint; and while you usually have the ability to pause time at will, if you are spotted time will begin moving forward in one-second increments, making combat turn-based.\n(Hint: With the Sword Throw and Sword Recall skill upgrades along with some fancy jumping, there's an awful lot you can do if you remain unseen. This becomes particularly helpful in New Game Plus.)\n\nAt time of writing, the game is still buggy - **OH GOD, THE BUGS!** - mainly in the form of clipping issues. Sometimes you'll jump too close to a corner and land at the wrong angle, clipping through the wall to the other side. About half the time, this will result in you needing to return to a checkpoint in order to continue the game now that you're stuck in a wall, or some other place you can't escape from without glitching your way back out again. In earlier levels/difficulty this isn't so bad, but in the more challenging levels it becomes infuriating to progress so far and then have to reset because the game decided to put you into a wall.,, Hopefully this is fixed sooner rather than later.\n\nTreat it like a roguelike, even though it isn't one. You'll die and die again, until eventually you find a better way through a level and manage to overcome it. At first I found this immensely frustrating, but as I started to learn what the character was capable of, it became much more manageable.\n\nThe story to this game... is mostly non-existent. Which is disappointing, as the soundtrack is beautiful, the visuals are so very reminiscent of Gunpoint, and the gameplay (when it's not glitching out) is actually pretty fun.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs-up, but definitely wait until it's on sale before buying RONIN - at least until all the bugs are properly fixed.","September 8, 2015","true","18.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found the controls clunky and hit a glitch that caused me to teleport randomly around levels. Then the first patch hit. I don't know if it did anything to the controls, or if I just got the hang of them, but it solved the teleporting glitch, which allowed me to really get into the game, and I'm glad I did. It's very fun.\n\nThe game plays like a cross between Gunpoint and Super-Hot, both games I love, and the fusion works. The influence of Gunpoint is obvious, the general aesthetic, the side-view planned jumping, the occasional stealth elements...all are clearly inspired by that game, and all are implemented quite well here. Super-Hot comes in to the combat, which is turn-based. Unlike what "turn-based" usually brings to mind, though, you don't go to a seperate screen where people stand around and hit each other in order. Instead, when combat starts you move a set distance (or perform an action) and then enemies get their turn to do the same. This repeats until either they or you are dead. It's *incredibly* addicting, and results in you carefully planning out complex series of moves to kill an entire room of gun-wielding thugs while only wielding a sword.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it's an incredibly fun one, that manages to tell a story in only 20 lines of text and one picture.

The turn-based combat works very well, and turns most fights into puzzles based on the positions of your enemies and yourself, and what jump arcs you choose to take. When you get it right, you'll feel like a badass. When you don't... hope you don't land in a position where every escape route is covered.\n\nThere is stealth, though there are many areas you'll have no choice but to fight through. Player reflexes are also a bit more important in some stealth situations, too, since you may need to very quickly try to get out of an enemy's field of view, or move around into position to take someone out before they call out an alarm. Some occasional annoyances there, but I'd recommend learning how to deal with suspicious enemies, because some fights are much easier if you can pick a few people off first, and the hanging assassination isn't always an option.\n\nThe difficulty on NG+ can be frustrating, but most levels have pretty good checkpointing. The occasional exception can cause some headaches, though.\n\nAll said, and even with the frustration I felt on a couple levels, I'd recommend this game. Also, there's a demo! It's good for giving you a basic feel for how the game plays, though the difficulty does ramp up well beyond what's available in the demo.","June 21, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's exactly what a tale of a Ronin should be, revenge, destruction, and badassery.\n\nYour best bet is to go with the flow in this game, use your rope to smash through the window and cut the guard by the entrance in half. No one noticed you? Hang half of the others from the ceiling, but then you get spotted by the super speed samuri! Jump next to the window, then jump away and watch him hilariously throw himself out the building to fall to his death after hitting some electrified wires. Your turn stops with you hanging in midair, you throw your sword at the guy at the far end of the room and land infront of another. You summon your sword to you and it flies into his back!  Launch yourself to the wall to avoid the stream bullets from the guard with the submachine, wait a turn, then cackle evily as you now have two whole turns to finish hims off any way you want becuase now he has to reload and then reaquire you. Jump to him and use your grappling hook to close in... but another default guard sees you and your rope swing doesn't clear his aim. A single tiny bullet hits and you fall to the ground clutching your wound.\n\nThe guards will come better equipped with all sorts of gadgets weapons and abilities, but all it takes is a single bullet to kill you. The really good news is that you get a checkpoint every time you enter or exit a room. this means plenty of retries that don't force you to comeback across the map, because there is going to be that room that takes 20 tries. You may get respawned dead center of all the guards, but that's because it was the only entrance to the room.\n\nYour biggest advantage is that Ronin is turn based, plan where your gonna go and who you slice next with all the time in the world. Your turn can even (and often) end with you in midair with a nice selection of methods to dispose of the baddies. The skills can only be activated by action points, and the action points can only be acquired from stunning and killing enemies. At five points you trigger limit break wich resets your points but gives you a whole extra turn, which could be a godsend as that was all you needed to tackle the annoying guard about to set the alarm. Or it could be really annoying as sword throwing would have been really more helpful at the moment.\n\nYour skills are granted points for completing these optional objectives:\n\n-Killing all enemies; not a stealth game, you can be stealthy, but loud is suprisingly more fun and rewarding\n\n-No alarms; there isn't a guard standing next to the magic game over button, you have 8 turns to at the least get his attention\n\n-Kill no civillians; this is where your stealth play is pretty much most used, simply avoid lights to dodge the chatting civvies in some sort of puzzle fashion\n\nSpending your skill points will mold how you paly the game, deciding which you will get more use out of is frustrating, especially when there is so many cool choices.\n\nAs for downsides, (to this fantastic game!):\n\n-The transition between combat turns and roaming can be disorienting. You can use the pause button at any time, but if you use it when you thought you entered a room unoticed and press it right as combat starts you may think you're still roaming and lose that valuable first turn since it's your skip turn button during combat. Or think it's still combat and not notice the guard calling the alarm isn't paused, the pause button and time pause for jumping can save you there sometimes.\n\n-The objective for almost every mission leading to the bosses is go to the computers and press the button to auto hack. Some other challenges would have been nice. Since making your way through the building and guards is the main challenge and often very different and fun, that one should slide.\n\n-The optional objectives are also all the same. They feel more like requirements since that's how your skill points are earned, and you NEED those skill points. Minibosses and optional fullfilment objectives could have spiced things up.\n\n-As mentioned the limit break "extra turn" can be very unhelpful in certain situations. The mechanic will add a layer to tactics, but an accidental stun can lose that sword toss you really needed and that will cause you some gray hairs more than once\n\n\nAll in all, I loved this game. It's not to hard, not to easy. It's nice to see someone create an action game that doesn't sell off of hype or humor. Ronin tells you what it is, and does it very well. I'll even say it, I had more fun with this than gunpoint, and I loved gunpoint.\n\n-9/10\n\n-Minus one point because the "optional objectives" don't feel very "optional" or "objective", some more creative optional objectives would have been fun.","June 27, 2015","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found the controls clunky and hit a glitch that caused me to teleport randomly around levels. Then the first patch hit. I don't know if it did anything to the controls, or if I just got the hang of them, but it solved the teleporting glitch, which allowed me to really get into the game, and I'm glad I did. It's very fun.\n\nThe game plays like a cross between Gunpoint and Super-Hot, both games I love, and the fusion works. The influence of Gunpoint is obvious, the general aesthetic, the side-view planned jumping, the occasional stealth elements...all are clearly inspired by that game, and all are implemented quite well here. Super-Hot comes in to the combat, which is turn-based. Unlike what "turn-based" usually brings to mind, though, you don't go to a seperate screen where people stand around and hit each other in order. Instead, when combat starts you move a set distance (or perform an action) and then enemies get their turn to do the same. This repeats until either they or you are dead. It's *incredibly* addicting, and results in you carefully planning out complex series of moves to kill an entire room of gun-wielding thugs while only wielding a sword.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it's an incredibly fun one, that manages to tell a story in only 20 lines of text and one picture. Its developer deserves praise, and I eagerly look forwards to anything else they might do.","July 9, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can understand my frustration.\n-doing side-objectives, while not exactly difficult, are the only way to get much-needed upgrades\n-final boss level has no checkpoints and in combination with the gameplay faults listed above, has created a frustrating experience which, in turn, has led me to write this review\n\nTo the dev--physics in this sort of game should be less prioritized than making sure the players commands get executed.

A level editor would also give this game some fantastic replayability as, in its current state, the game is unfortunately rather short.  I completed it in about 4 hours or so.\n\nUnfortunately the dev has mentioned that unless this sells 100k copies, a level editor is highly unlikely. This is a great shame as I feel it would add so much more and give players a chance to really experiment with the unique gameplay mechanics that Ronin offers.\n\nFor its price, though, Ronin is a fantastic little game that offers a unique experience you won't find anywhere else, not even in Gunpoint.\n\nPick it up!","July 7, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is very cool at times :)\n\nSadly some bugs do take from what is otherwise a fun experience. For eg, sometimes if you die, your checkpoint is 15 secs of mundane (at least when youre repeating it) travel back to the action.

(Stealth is theoretically optional, but not sneaking around picking off straglers from time to time makes combat sections far more difficult.)\n\n-Story-\nThe story in Ronin is a straightforward revenge mission with not a lot new to say, and I LIKE that the game really OWNS that. They waste no time telling you things you can readily assume, or that you just don't need to know. If you are interested in this game, then you know the tropes already. You can just jump into the action and fill in the blanks yourself.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThe first few missions are easy enough, and give you a chance to get some starting ninja skills in your arsenal. A ninja must be sneaky and thorough. Allowing someone to notice evidence of your presence without actively threatening them starts them phoning for help, so stray bullets alerting the next room are almost as bad as them hitting you. Eventually you'll start encountering large rooms where enemies guard eachother from all angles, and even from neighboring buildings. Planning and trickery are required to thin their numbers down to manageable levels before you reveal your presence and start turn-based combat. The difficulty ramps up suddenly in a few places, but fortunately the automatic checkpoints are generous.\n\n-Controls-\nThe game's controls do take a little getting used to, and when you drop into turn based combat you lose some of the flexibility you enjoyed moving around in real time. That can make certain movement tricks difficult or impossible once the bullets start flying. The jump arc indicator does not take the loss of momentum from crashing into enemies into account, and jumping to corners can leave you in unexpected positions. I also experienced a few places where the grappling hook triggered clipping problems, and I ended up on the opposite side of the ceiling from where I wanted to be. Not ideal, but overall manageable.\n\nThere is a downside to the game being so light on text: some of the more subtle mechanics are not obvious. They make complete sense in retrospect, but not having them pointed out is a learning curve. For instance, I see some reviewers have complained that the enemy AI is inconsistent about when they can spot you or not, and that seems to be because those people have not noticed or understood the light/darkness mechanic. A ninja in the dark is undetectable, and an enemy in the dark is easy to pick off. Only by standing in the light do the poor guards have any hope of having the alarm raised and their murder avenged. Fits the ninja theme perfectly, but only obvious in hindsight. Perhaps an addition to the "very helpful hints" could be patched in.\n\n-Sound-\nThe music is a joy. It fits well with the changing level of action, and doesn't get old even after hours of hearing the same loops. I do wish more of the chapter finales had music as sweet as Chapter 2.\n\n-Time/replayability-\nRonin is a bit on the short side, though not upsettingly so, and I don't know if that is a problem. If the game went on much longer, its sparse story and simple mechanics might start to drag. If you want more of a challenge, or just more game, there is always the New Game Plus. There are a few more enemy spawns, and you get to keep your unlocked skills to be a total badass. A second playthrough doesn't start out much different, except that if the alarm is raised at all you fail the mission entirely instead of just that side objective. It's only when you start encountering large numbers of the upgraded machine-gunners that it feels like the difficulty really ramps up.","November 19, 2015","true","17.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Sometimes landing on a wall or ceiling will glitch you on the other side, or might just teleport you across the map. It would be nice to have a better understanding of the character's hitbox. The quick trial and error gameplay doesn't match with the few seconds of loadtime before restarting, and checkpoint placement often seems thoughtless, putting your character at the top of an elevator ride, or back before you hacked a computer.\n\nBut this game is ultimately totally worth playing because when it does work it's rad as hell. Great concept with a solid excecution. Once you get the hang of the grappling hook, and get skills like throwing and recalling your sword, the game is a joy to play. It's a trial and error type of game where you will die and restart a lot, but when you get that perfect run it feels amazing. Knock people out of windows, grapple swing 270 degrees around a platform and land on a guy, throw your sword at a dude and swing around to catch it in midair - it's all great.","November 29, 2015","true","8.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The biggest difference between the two is that as soon as you are spotted by an enemy it switches to a turn-based gameplay until you're no longer visible.

It happened so much in one spot that I said, "eff this, I'm going to exploit it", and did so to finish the game much more easily.\n\nIt's a shame the feature was never implemented to replay your level back in realtime.

Oh, and there are special enemy types, including some regular grunts that will do nothing but call in the lockdown command, a giant samurai who if you land anywhere near him or jump over his personal space in mid-combat, he will, without even using a turn, kill you instantly, and a swat looking grunt that uses a machine gun.\n\nI cannot count the number of times where I have had to desparately bounce around a room because every time I land, my enemies line up another shot on me, and if I dont move out of the line of fire, i'm dead.  However, since I can't get behind cover very often (it's pretty rare) and kill someone without taking fire, I have to just keep bouncing around and either come up with some elaborate plan ahead of time, or hope I get lucky and just get a small openning with which to pick off ONE of probably 6+ enemies.  Also, since combat is turn based, I can't just turn that off temporarily, run somewhere very quickly while they continue to line up a shot (as they would do on their next turn anyway), and then turn the turn based back on.  This has multiple times lead to me being trapped by fire on multiple sides and having to sit there, and forfeit turns, just so I don't die.  Oh, and the skills I mentioned?  Very lacking in variety.  You actually have to spend skill points on empty spots to get to the final skill point of each "tree" (calling it a twig would be more appropriate.  most all of the twigs only have 2 to 3 skills at most, and there are only 5 separate twigs I believe)\n\nPersonally, I really enjoyed gunpoint.  it had a story to it that could be both funny and serious, and the gameplay was fun (even if it was admittedly too easy), but RONIN lacks well thoughtout level design and enemy placement, and intsead tends to shoehorn you into one or just two methods of approach.  Pretty much the exact opposite of gunpoint.  I would not recommend this game.","January 21","false","1.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The turn-based combat is clunky, with the forced jumping infuriating.    Many times I just needed to walk one or two feet, but wasn't allowed to.  This is made worse with the inaccurate jump arc.  I died far too many times from accidentily knocking-out an enemy and being pushed into an unexpected position.\n\nOpen engagements with a dozen enemies are an exercise in patience, jumping in circles and waiting for reloads just to be able to pick off one enemy.  Even then, it's sometimes possible to be shot through a solid floor or wall.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to play through even half of the game with these issues.

No stealth, which is fine, though I don't know why it's tagged as stealth, but it seems more like it's trying to be hotline miami than gunpoint since gunpoint was all about doing it your way, whereas this almost always has one correct way of clearing a room, and it's just not that good.  It's got some cool ideas, and when you pull off a level perfectly it can be very satisfying, but those moments are few and far between. Much of it is trying to deal with the weird controls, lack of knowledge on what's actually going on in the level and poor level design.\n\nThe game isn't hard because it's strategic, it's hard because pulling that strategy off without your character moving an inch forward, instead of jumping to the ceiling like you told him to, or stopping in the middle of enemy fire for some reason, or the character just straight up not doing what you told him to - is a constant issue.\n\nIn order to make a strategy, you need to react to the information provided, the problem is that information is wrong most of the time. The game might tell you that if you jump in X area you're in the clear, but then you do that and get shot anyways because your character jumped a few feet back from it and got shot for no good reason. It's infuriating.\n\nAnd in a game like this, where responsiveness is absolutely essential since you die in one hit, these problems are fatal for the game, and are reason enough for me to not recommend it.","April 27","false","1.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

In some cases this scale goes down to -10.\n\nDANGER! A wallpaper of text!It's an inconspicuous little platformer, that I got for free(I'd never buy it myself, I didn't even know that this game existed). At the first glance it has nothing special. I still might think that RONIN is not quite a remarkable game. The storytelling in the game consists of only a couple of sentences. I'm not saying it's awful, but at least it could be a bit longer and more detailed, just a bit. Gameplay is "meeh". In fact sometimes bugs can cause your character to stand still and not jump, which leads to death(and a lot of frustration). Also at first I thought that it was ported from a mobile platform, mostly because of HUD and game mechanics. In my opinion the greatest feature of RONIN is soundtrack. Not a great variety of songs, but they suit really well. And I never got fed up with them. Design of the game is also worth mentioning. It's pretty and elegant.\n\nSo, what made me to write this review? It is the number of times I changed my mind about this game. First time when I tried to launch it, it crashed. I tried a couple of things, like checking cache and reinstalling. It didn't help. But leaving a comment in discussion helped. So after a week it was working(or perhaps devs did nothing and I was helped by a  ninja fairy). Two chapters into the story and I'm mad because of how hard this game is. Literally 50 tries and no progress at all! ♥♥♥♥ you, game. Salty review and off my mind. But I did some searching and "hallelujah"! You are supposed to earn skill points by completing a level with no lockdowns! Jesus Christ, no wonder I had so much butthurt. Alright, started a new game and perfectly accomplished every single stage, and earned every skill. It's time for the final boss, man I'm excited! Though the excitement didn't last long. More frustration and pain in the ♥♥♥. Damn it, I hate this game... Thirty attempts later. Ahh! You don't have to kill everyone on this level! Another thirty attempts. Yeah, duck me! I did it! Oh wait, to get the other ending achievement one needs to redo the last level :/\n\nIn the end I'd say that RONIN is a fine game if you get it for free(not really of course, it worths it's money, and discounts are also strong with this one). I'd recommend it to people who enjoy stealthy platformes with a tint of hardcore. I requires some thinking, planning and rarely you have to do these things quickly as well. The sense of achievement is inexplicably satisfying after you clear out some rooms in the game. My best guess is that you don't gradually become better, but it's rather that you can randomly succeed just by trying.\n\nOk, this review is getting ulgy, I'll have to stop here.","February 15","true","10.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

I wanted to start by saying that, because at least for me, that's all I need to hear.\n\nRonin is about a heroine seeking justice for atrocities a criminal syndicate comitted against her. You don't see much story for the interesting puzzle-esque combat system, which for some may be a detriment, but for me, it's more of a "Hey, you go ahead and play. The story will be here if you're interested. The graphics are simple but fun, and well executed.\n\nThe gameplay is an interesting offspring of platforming and stealth, but Ronin is no stealth game. Nor is it particularly a platformer, either. You run around in active time, until enemies engage you in combat. You then take turns moving and jumping to knock down and eventually kill your enemies with samurai movie esque violence. The puzzle is in planning your moves to keep the enemies off their feet, and avoiding their convenient laser reticules indicating impending violence.\n\nThere are a few cons. The game's menu could use a usability pass... It's difficult to realize, especially with their color scheme, that there's a whole skill and menu system with perks to add to your character. That being said, the level up perks are really fun and interesting! The only other mild flaw I found was if you're working on an extremely high resolution, the menu doesn't function properly. I assume this bug will be fixed, though.\n\nGood:\n* Unique gameplay* Fun and interesting puzzle mechanics* Combat is highly stylized and very satisfying* Suprisingly deep combat system under the hood.\nBad:\n* In need of a usability pass* Some technical issues with menus\nUgly:\n* The body count and property damage of level 3.\nOver all, well worth the money and a chunk of your time.","July 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/recommended/274230/","EvilLost","EvilLost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilLost/","626 products in account","An extremely awkward, frustrating, and poorly balanced mess with cool art.\n\nI really like the concept here and badly want to like this game, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired....simple design decisions, such as being unable to pull yourself up a ledge or even MOVE (other than jump) in turn-based mode are only the beginning of the problems....\n\nUltimately, this is a shallow action combat game that has you "pausing" (turn-based) the combat so you can time "perfect" jumps all over the place (remember, you can't move during combat other than jump).\n\n\n\nPROS:\n-Action sequences are fun (non-turn based gameplay)\n-Art style\n\nNEUTRALS:\n-Mini RPG / ability unlock system was ok but felt slightly out of place (not sure how I earned the ability points, seems like you get 1 per level)\n\nCONS:\n-The turn-based components are there, in essence. However, the core of the game is built around an action game (dodging the shots, etc) and with little to no stealth mechanics or other "strategy" component, it leaves for a very confusing and frustrating turn-based experience.\n\n-Can't MOVE in turn-based mode. WTF? You can ONLY JUMP, so if you are hanging off a ledge, you cannot pull yourself up.  NUMEROUS times there will be combat areas with excessive edges. During these sequences expect to die+restart countless times because your character automatically grabs ledges, and once she does, you are basically a sitting duck unless you happen to have an arc you can jump away from since you cannot do anything else. Frustrating and extremely stupid design.\n\n-Many actions simply disappear when you are (forced) in turn-based mode. For example, those stairs you just climbed down? Sorry can't climb them in turn-based mode.\n\n-Lockdown mechanic: If an enemy loses sight of you, they will automatically initiate a lockdown in 10 "turns." Since not triggering the alarm is an objective in every mission, and since you CANNOT MOVE during turn-based combat, this means you have to "jump" (1 jump = 1 turn) over to that enemy so that he does see you and stops his 10-turn countdown.....in almost every instance of doing this, some OTHER enemy will now lose sight of you and immediately begin na 10-turn lockdown counter.....extremely annoying.\n\n-Atrocious level design and pacing. Most of the level is reasonably easy and then out of nowhere a room that is near impossible. Several places in the levels have ledges which grossly interfere with gameplay due to the inability to move properly during combat.\n\n-TERRIBLE documentation. Absolutely abysmal. Virtually nothing is documented.\n\n-No UI information for a "turn based" game (for example, the robot looking minigunners appearing in mission 3 shoot their gun for 2 turns, but the only way to know this is by trial and error).\n\nTIP:  The game bugs out at resolutions above 1920x1080 but it is hard to tell that it is bugging out. If your combat icons do not appear above the enemies, and you are having a hard time with the controls, try running in windowed mode or reducing resolution.","April 28","false","2.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The music is used sparsely but fits the dystopian thriller-feeling but the story is non-existant. Anything else would be a lie. Another lie (contributed by Steam reviewers) that this game is a stealth game which it is definetly not. You have almost no option to sneak, so Ronin is an action-platformer with turn based combat. The gameplay works but in my opinion the game design has some flaws. For example the skills you unlock. You can only use them, when you use a form of combo which is stupid in my opinion. Also the AI is too picky for me. But all of this would be ok if this had not been so repetetive. You arrive at a level. You need to hack computers, engage in some combat, hack another computer, engage in combat again. Then you leave and have to get to your motorbike WHICH IS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF ARRIVAL.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/regalsoulslayer/recommended/274230/","regalsoulslayer","Regal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/regalsoulslayer/","306 products in account","I would like to first mention that if you just want an overview it's gonna be at the bottom but if you want to see in depth why I don't recommend this game at all you can keep reading. We're gonna go from Story to Gameplay to Audio to Overview to Thoughts and Opinions. (Note: Anything in paranthesis can be ignored but adds my own thoughts. This review assumes you saw the gameplay trailer above and slight spoilers although the game is so boring and generic that I don't think they are actually spoilers)\n\nStory: There is none. You're some generic dude who has a vendetta against 5 (generic) people for an unknown reason. I assume your dudes name is Ronin. So Ronin goes off to kill (in order) an old dude, arrogant chick, swordsman dude, scientist, and just some dude (gonna give the game more credit than it deserves and say hes' a mob boss even tho the game makes no mention to this). That's it. Right before each mission where you kill them, Ronin makes some uninteresting remark about the target. They have names but I couldn't tell you them off the top of my head for the life of me. All I know is that the old man is called "Old Man"\n\nGameplay: It's garbage. I hate this game. This game has 1 weapon, a sword. A utility item, a grappling hook. And a skill tree. To unlock points for the skill tree you have to meet requirements on every level. They are as follows: 1. Killing all gaurds, 2. Not setting off an alarm, (this pretty much goes hand in hand with killing all the gaurds btw) and 3. Not killing civs.\nSo every level is the same ♥♥♥♥. Go in buildings, kill all gaurds, hack computers to find the targets, leave. There are like 4 enemy types in this game. Regular gaurd, gaurd that you have to stun before he calls HQ to set off the alarm, machine gunner, and swordsman. That's it. So I'm gonna assume the targets are (and I use this word loosely) bosses. They are terrible. Old man doesn't resist. Girl chick acts like a normal gaurd, swordsman is like a regular swordsman (except he's wearing fancy red armor), scientist dude kills himself on accident (in the trailer is shows you chasing him but somehow he jumps out a window and misses the next window in my 2 playthroughs) and some dude just acts like a normal gaurd.\nHere's the main thing wrong with this game: It highly recommends controller, I highly recommend that you DON'T use the controller. I beat the main game with controller cuz I had one but it was so agonizing and unresponsive. So this game requires you to be VERY precise with where Ronin is and moves because one ♥♥♥♥ up and you're dead. But I gaurantee that over 50% of your deaths are gonna come from Ronin doing something you didn't want him to do. In the trailer it doesn't show it but you can hop down through ledges. So there's a little icon telling you when Ronin is about to jump and frequently you put the icon to jump and this guy doesn't go through. He hops over 2 inches on the ledge you told him to go through. I have died so many times it's so frustrating. It made me want to punch a hole in my monitor so many times. This game's controls were not polished and leads to anger. The skills are whatever. I feel like they should all be there from the beginning because this game is broken but whatever (Need a reason to not kill the civs I guess). Nothing in this game is satisfying, the trailer plays it up, killing gaurds is boiring and bosses are pretty much reskinned gaurds.\n\nAudio: There is none. The music sucks. There's like 2 soundtracks that stand out but they repeat themselves every 30 seconds so it gets old fast. Everything else, sword strike and gunshots are generic clips (probably royalty free).\n\nOverview: Ronin is a very frustrating and nothing you do in the game is satisfying, killing, the story, sound, it tries to focus on a few things and fails at even those. The controls are frustrating and sometimes unresponsive. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to grapple somewhere and just completely missed for no reason. There exist games in Steam that are difficult but satisfying (I highly recommend Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number), this game is difficult and unsatisfying. Completionists beware, new game plus is not for the feint of heart. Speedrunners you're out of luck, there's nothing for you. If you'd like to see specifics on why I hate this game then stick around for my Thoughts and Opinions.\n\nThoughts and Opinions: (Spoilers ahead for certain levels.) At first when I started this game I thought I was just bad cuz it's a brand new game but after a while I started to get really annoyed by how Ronin didnt do what I wanted him to do. This game is terribly designed. So regular game is beatable but it's an annoying trudge through mud. It's about a 3-4 hour game. Look at how many hours I have in this game. Literally two levels in new game plus took me like 5 hours. They are designed like garbage. In the trailer you can see the machine guns moving up and down, that's in new game plus, during the regular game they stay still. The levels are not designed around this concept. So in the regular game there's a level where you have to kill the officer, every other level took me a few tries. This level took me over 20 times on REGULAR mode, I don't even want to mention how many hours it took me on plus mode. And before you all mention how I should "Git gud" I want to refer you to my achievements. One of them is beating Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number on HARD mode. This game isn't meant to be very difficult but it is. The final level on new game plus is so hard I literally had to stop playing, take a shower and contemplate my life's choices. It is so brutally difficult I had to look up on Youtube how to beat it and the Youtuber went through hoops to do it. So in new game plus when you're trying to kill the samurai dude, he's in a big open area surrounded by machine gunners and gaurds and 1 dude that's on a timer to you losing the level cuz he starts a lockdown and in new game plus if there's a lockdown you automatically lose. So there's no where to grapple. At least 5 machine gunners and a few gaurds sprinkled in with this samurai dude rushing you down. The game dev made the game harder on purpose and practically telling us to go ♥♥♥♥ ourselves with some of the mine placements in the game (did I mention there are mines?) the mines are in places that would make life so much easier if you could be there. Not to mention that you can't climb up a ledge during the turn based combat so your'e stuck there. If there's a mine on the floor or the walls (which there are on the final level) you're gonna get shot because you can't move. I hate this game, it has no redeaming qualities. The only thing I like is the ability to hang people. That's it. I'm sure I missed a few things but this has gone on long enough. Don't play this game.","April 21","false","10.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/recommended/274230/","Grizzly232","Grizzly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grizzly232/","103 products in account","I picked up Ronin for 1 euro on the Humble Bundle, although the pick of the crop was "Gods will be watching" which turned out to be ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI took a brief look at Ronin's description and heard that it was turn-based, which is usually a bad sign, and after coming straight from Gods will be watching, I wasn't expecting anything great.\n\nThe game proved me wrong pretty damn quickly.\n\nI'm a massive fan of games like Gunpoint, Hotline Miami and Superhot, so when Ronin came along with the same mechanics, but then made them time-based, it pretty much tipped those mechanics on their head. Combat is fluid and responsive, I get into crazy situations where I barely escape by the skin of my teeth, and to top it all off, the game forces you to improvise rather than plan.\n\nThere's nothing quite like smashing into a room through a skylight, landing on one motherf**ker, throwing your sword at another motherf**ker, then diving past the sword to grab it just in time so you can cut another motherf**ker. It's all so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfying.\n\nThat being said, as the levels progress, the game reaches an annoying level of difficulty. The final mission had me tearing my hair out for an hour straight.\n\nFurther on the topic of flaws, the story really doesn't mean anything at all. There's no explanation for who the main character is, no explanation for why she's hunting down five guys. She has a short monologue before each assassination, but it doesn't tell you anything. And then the ending offers two choices, neither of which make any difference at all.\n\nThen there's the skill point system. You can only earn a skill point if you ace a mission, as in, complete it without killing a civilian, raising an alarm and without leaving any enemies alive. That being said, it's impossible to do that on certain missions without specfic upgrades. That means if you don't upgrade yourself in a certain way, you can quite literally be locked out of skill points.\n\nSay for example, there's a part where an enemy is standing underneath a light, and a civilian is watching him. You can stab the enemy, after which the civilian will see his body and raise an alarm. You can attempt to knock the civilian down, after which he'll raise an alarm, or you can kill the civilian, after which you'll lose the objective of not killing civilians, or you can leave the guard behind, which will void the "kill everyone" objective.\n\nTurns out the solution is to get an ability that lets you drag bodies up to the ceiling and hang them there, but that costs a skill point, so you're going to be screwed in that mission unless you've gotten that skill beforehand.\n\nOther than that, it's fine. Movement is a little janky at times, but the game is pretty good. It really needs an endless arena mode where enemies continually attack you until they eventually beat you. Also, the design on the Officer's level and the Boss's level is terrible. Just gotta say that. Expect lots of frustration on both.","April 25","true","9.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The on screen player tips remind us 'the reticlue lies' but this doesnt lessen the fustration as no pattern to these 'fibs' is, for me at least, apparent. The grapple also behaves inconsistenly sometimes firing after the dots turn black (to signify a valid move) sometimes not. Worst of all there is a set turn time before guards call back up (often 8 turns) but on occasion, mid fight, the turn based  counter is replaced with a real time count down that can mean a fustrating end to a fight. This has happened to me on a number occasions and spoiled some, up to that point, to plan battles. I would love to recomend this game but it feels to me that tweaking is required. As Giant Bomb suggested: a shadow displaying where ronin will actually move to on the next turn could help as at present the game feels to rely too heavily on trial and error. If you have not played Mark of The Ninja I would recomend you grab that instead. At least for now.","July 8, 2015","false","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/274230/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nBecause of its visual style, it’s extremely easy to get the wrong idea about Ronin. Take a look at one screenshot and you’ll think it’s similar to Gunpoint. Take a look at another and it will remind you of Mark of the Ninja. Don’t judge a book by its cover, goes the old saying, and in Ronin’s case, it’s certainly true. Ronin doesn’t actually play anything like either of those games. Ronin is an odd beast filled with contradictions. It’s an action game, but its combat system is turn-based. It’s a 2D side-scrolling platformer and yet it doesn’t really compare to any platformer you’ve ever played. It has stealth elements, but it bluntly states that it is not a stealth game and advises the player to simply kill everyone.\n\nRonin has a razor-sharp focus on the gameplay which is reflected in the fact that the story is extremely simple. Its most obvious inspiration is Kill Bill as Ronin tells the tale of a katana-wielding heroine on a bloody revenge path. The entire story is delivered through approximately 20 short lines of text and there’s no mucking about. They killed your father. Now you kill them. The end.\n\nSo how does it play? At first glance, it really does come off as your regular side-scrolling platformer. Until you encounter your first enemy, that is. Once an enemy spots you, the turn-based system kicks in. Seeing as how Ronin’s protagonist only wields a katana, the goal is to get close to the enemy and cut him down. During your turn, you can plan your next jump using a dynamic jump arc, attack an enemy or use certain abilities or gadgets that may be at your disposal depending on the situation. During this planning phase, you will be able to see the next move your enemies will make as well. If they’re aiming at the location you are currently occupying, you will have to move as the game employs a one shot, one kill rule. You can jump on enemies to knock them out for a couple of turns and you can also jump into them which will send them flying either into another enemy bringing him down as well or out of the window for a one way trip to digital hell. You have a grappling hook at your disposal as well which will come in handy when trying to escape a particularly unfavorable situation. The tool is also necessary for traversing almost each level as you will use it to hurl yourself through windows, for example.\n\nYou can unlock abilities and gadgets by completing optional objectives in each mission which pretty much makes these objectives obligatory or else you’ll simply be at a disadvantage in the next level. These objectives are always the same – don’t trigger the alarm, don’t kill civilians and kill all enemies. The good thing is that completing these objectives doesn’t feel like a chore at all, doing a perfect run is extremely satisfying. The unlockable abilities and gadgets facilitate more diverse gameplay and range from being able to leave a decoy which will distract enemies for a couple of turns to teleporting near an enemy and stunning him.\n\nYour next move will also depend on your enemies and your surroundings. Different enemies will follow different patterns. Ordinary enemies will aim and then shoot until they empty their gun clip at which point they will have to reload leaving you with a welcomed window of opportunity. Enemies equipped with assault rifles will shoot at the same location for two turns whereas samurais will charge straight at you even across great distances. As far as the surroundings are concerned, sometimes you’ll be able to strike unseen from the shadows whereas other times your progress will be hampered by mines and laser beams. Naturally, you can use these obstacles in your favor by jump-kicking enemies into them. While Ronin is a relatively straightforward game, all of these elements contribute to some engaging emergent gameplay as you try out different tactics each time. And even though the level design isn’t really open-ended, it is extremely important to survey the entire level first as that will provide some insight regarding the most optimal course of action.\n\nRonin is also a very stylish game. The visual style is relatively simple yet pleasing and clear. It actually reminded me of old Cartoon Network shows such as Samurai Jack. Certain characters reminded me of Professor Utonium from the Powerpuff Girls with their rectangular heads. Animations are also very stylish and smooth, although it would be nice if our heroine had some more execution animations. Overall, it’s a great art style. I also need to mention the superb soundtrack that sets the mood perfectly. Even though the track list is relatively sparse, it still greatly contributes to the overall badassery of the game. The main complaint I have with the game are the controls which simply do not offer the kind of pinpoint precision you require from a game like this. Make no mistake, they’re far from bad, but they could’ve still used some fine-tuning as it’s not really uncommon to fumble up a move as the jump arc is a bit fiddly to maneuver. Also, there is one extremely hard and annoying level which absolutely requires you to go about it in a very specific way. It simply hurts the emergent gameplay and even when you figure it out, it’s still really hard to complete. It just sticks out from the rest of the game.\n\nEven though it can be frustrating at times due to its not-quite-perfect controls a bit of trial-and-error, Ronin is still a thoroughly great game thanks to its stylish presentation, innovative mechanics, emergent gameplay and well-designed levels.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","July 13, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I dont know how to feel about it.\n\nAs it states, it is a turn based ninja combat game, where you have to dodge red lines that indicate enemy attacks while at the same time trying to kill off the enemies. Thats, pretty much it. No variety and stealth is pretty much needed because, well, you're a ninja. Unfortunately you have to deal with enemies much more then you do actual ninja'ing stuff. This game is fun, I wont lie. But its the fact that it outright FORCES combat onto you is something that annoy's me greatly. I've been stealthing as much as I can for the sole purpose to avoid fighting, because after a while it is VERY repetitive. Absolutely no thought went into the gameplay as a whole, which even though it goes for something new, its ironically one of its few weakest points in the game. There's an upgrade screen, but even that feels lackluster in its attempt because its just "Spend a point on nothing to get closer to that one particular skill". It makes me feel I'm just wasting points just to get to that one specific skill. All skills, by the by, are useful. It just doesn't feel very fun to level up because you spent a point on a node that does NOTHING. Thats just my view on it.\n\nThe story is.....something. You're a ninja that must kill off five people in a photo. The thing is, I dont know the whole backstory, and probably never will because the SPECIAL EDITION apparently locks away the story behind a paywall! What kind of fair business is that? I have to spend an extra 20 dollars on a game just to get story, which I will find through other means, thank you. Overal, the story IN THE GAME is lackluster. I'm not counting the digital comic because when I play a game, I expect a game with a story implemented into it. Not locked away over a "Special Edition"\n\nThe music is quite repetitive. I mean, its cool and all, sounding pretty dark to fit the mood and such, but its the fact that you hear two (or three) of the same track, with the only different moments being when you've just (Or about to) assassinate one of the five people. Those are the only times that the music sounds any bit different. Everywhere else is the same couple or so tracks that have always played.\n\n\nAll and all, the game RONIN is another one of those games that provides something interesting, but bores out in the end probably because they just lost interest mid development. It feels pretty shallow, and doesn't really hold up to be what I was hoping for. Luckily, I got this on a humble bundle for a dollar, so at least I felt I got the money's worth of the game. Only buy this game when it is SERIOUSLY cheap, because this game doesn't really feel like it earned 13 or even 20 dollars due to its repetitiveness, and story that just flopped because you didn't spend the money needed JUST to get some context.","April 28","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's an upgrade screen, but even that feels lackluster in its attempt because its just "Spend a point on nothing to get closer to that one particular skill". It makes me feel I'm just wasting points just to get to that one specific skill. All skills, by the by, are useful. It just doesn't feel very fun to level up because you spent a point on a node that does NOTHING. Thats just my view on it.\n\nThe story is.....something. You're a ninja that must kill off five people in a photo. The thing is, I dont know the whole backstory, and probably never will because the SPECIAL EDITION apparently locks away the story behind a paywall! What kind of fair business is that? I have to spend an extra 20 dollars on a game just to get story, which I will find through other means, thank you. Overal, the story IN THE GAME is lackluster. I'm not counting the digital comic because when I play a game, I expect a game with a story implemented into it. Not locked away over a "Special Edition"\n\nThe music is quite repetitive. I mean, its cool and all, sounding pretty dark to fit the mood and such, but its the fact that you hear two (or three) of the same track, with the only different moments being when you've just (Or about to) assassinate one of the five people. Those are the only times that the music sounds any bit different. Everywhere else is the same couple or so tracks that have always played.\n\n\nAll and all, the game RONIN is another one of those games that provides something interesting, but bores out in the end probably because they just lost interest mid development. It feels pretty shallow, and doesn't really hold up to be what I was hoping for. Luckily, I got this on a humble bundle for a dollar, so at least I felt I got the money's worth of the game. Only buy this game when it is SERIOUSLY cheap, because this game doesn't really feel like it earned 13 or even 20 dollars due to its repetitiveness, and story that just flopped because you didn't spend the money needed JUST to get some context.","April 28","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A livello di gameplay e stile è simile a Gunpoint, questo salta subito all'occhio. E' un indie realizzato da un sola persona, che pur con i suoi evidenti difetti, avrebbe meritato una metacritic maggiore di quella che ha (70). I difetti sono comunque non troppo pesanti: qualche imprecisione nei controlli, qualche checkpoint non posizionato benissimo, poca varietà dei livelli e una difficoltà non sempre ben calibrata.\n\nRonin è si difficile, ma tremendamente appagante, quasi al livello di Hotline Miami. Nonostante le imprecazioni l'ho trovato molto stimolante. Peccato un po' per l'ultimissimo livello, senza checkpoint stavo seriamente considerando di disinstallarlo con un ragequit, fortunatamente sono riuscito a scamparla in una delle innumerevoli run.\n\nC'è una modalità new game plus, ma sinceramente mi sento sazio dopo 9 ore passate col gioco (dato che tra l'altro dovrebbe durarne di meno, sulle 6).

You cannot kill the lights even when you are exactly near them. Skill unlocks are available only when you finish the level perfectly (no alarms, no civs killed and I forgot the third rule). If you can't get the perfect score, too bad. Without those the game is pretty hard at times. Another thing that's bugging me is that AI bullets go through different AIs. It would be much cooler if you could position yourself to lead AI to shoot each other. Changing these obvious things would make the game much better, IMHO.

So I can't jump then quickly grapple-swing, since the character does the FULL jump and I end up in an inconvenient position.\n\nAlso, the arc indicator when you're jumping is not always accurate. This is infuriating because each move matters a lot. I keep finding myself trying to jump to a certain point where the enemy can't hit me, but the character just nudges slightly and I get shot instead. ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating.\n\nAnd you can't reset the skill points you've earned. I normally wouldn't mind as I pretty much never use that feature in any video game, but apparently I am lacking the "recall sword" skill, as level 6 is pretty much impossible to beat without it.\nSo not only is the skill tree completely broken and pointless, I have to replay the entire game to get the skills required just for that one level I'm stuck on.\nNo thanks, I don't want to go through all that ♥♥♥♥ again with the clunky as ♥♥♥♥ control mechanism.\n\nIf this kind of game interests you, I recommend picking up Gunpoint instead. Way better controls, plus dying isn't infuriating as ♥♥♥♥, as you can just instantly rewind to say, 3 seconds ago where you were still on the ceiling for example.

Spend any time at all with the game and you'll see its heritage - titles like Gunpoint, Mark of the Ninja and Splinter Cell: Conviction. However, its stealth game heritage has been flavored with doses of Transistor and Hotline Miami, creating something which only looks like  a stealth game.  Stealth kills are available (and necessary at times for three starring levels), but ghosting through a building undetected by all and sundry will not happen - there are going to be several set pieces on each level when you will have to draw your katana and go to work. In combat, if you get hit once, you die, but checkpoints are plentiful and other than the last level, you never need to replay more than your current room.\n\nKilling in Ronin is a turn-based system of taking jumps, knocking enemies down and finding windows in which to finish them off. As you level up, you'll get some extra advantages (decoys, thrown weapons, teleport stuns, etc.), but they never sidestep the core of the experience. At the end of the game, it will still be you, your sword and a bunch of enemy laser sights to avoid. And when everything plays out well, you'll come out feeling just as satisfied as you would after a particularly obnoxious level of Hotline Miami.\n\nThere are three kinds of enemies: pistol-packing security guards, armored guards with assault rifles and cybernetic samurai with blades (there are also a few bosses sprinkled in). Each is different - the pistoleros fire single shots while the riflemen put down suppressive fire that is dangerous to leap through (but are consequently slower to shift aim points). Cybernetic samurai take two hits to kill (a stun and then a quick follow up hit).  There are also a few environmental hazards (long falls, laser grids and sensor activated mines) to be navigated - fortunately, all of these can be used against enemies. The enemy A.I. is adequate and has patterns which you will learn to exploit over the game.\n\nTo level up, you need to satisfy three criteria on each level - spare the civilians, kill all the guards and prevent the alarm. Sparing civilians is generally a matter of planning (how to dispatch guards without being seen, which should be old hat to any stealth pro). Killing all the guards is just a best practice. The last criteria is the most annoying - during combat, guards will sometimes try to trigger the lockdown, putting you on a clock to stun them (civilians will also trigger the alarm but are much easier to avoid). In large fights (and especially those where there are mutually supporting enemies in different buildings), this can cause a significant amount of tooth gnashing and cursing.\n\nI thought the game controlled reasonably well, except for the grappling hook, which was a bit swingy.

The concept of sneaking around and going into complexes where you use great leaping, critical thinking and flexibility skills to slip or slash your way through complexes to enact revenge is an awesome idea. The game has great and a unique art style and everything has a feeling of adventure with an overtone of revenge to it. The controls are simple but very unique and can lead to moments where you really feel like an urban rogue assassin who intends on getting the job done as efficiently as possible.\n\nHOWEVER, the game is insanely short for the price of 13 dollars (or 20 if you wanted that soundtrack and comic so badly.). It's only a good 4 hours long if you intend to just finish it and, to me, the mechnanics can get iffy quite easily. For example, on a controller, I have great reaction abiity due to being able to just press a face button to chop someone in haf the moment I crash through a window and get an edge in the fight, but using the right thumbstick to jump can easily lead to major mistakes without even meaning it due to the control being very specific on how you release the jump. On the other hand with a mouse and keyboard I can aim my jumps very well, but I have to click on buttons to do actions. Which can easily lead to me being chopped in half if I need to do an action right then. The camera always locking into a specific position every time a fight starts out does not help.\n\nThere's no real story either (in the main game anyway) You're just some Ronin who feels wronged by a group of individuals and are determined to kill each one of them. The game never explains why you want to kill them, who you are, and who these people are in general: No names, no backgrounds, nothing.\n\nTLDR: Great concept of a game with good visuals, but there needs to be a story of some kind of this kind of deal and the mechanics need polish and possibly new functions to help make it easier to play the game. Wait for this game to go on a real sale before buying, and even then don't expect hours of gameplay.","September 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It constantly reminds you that "THIS IS NOT GUNPOINT", or "THIS IS NOT A STEALTH GAME" etc... It really isn't Gunpoint, because gunpoint had enjoyable gameplay, whereas Ronin is just an exercise in seeing how long you can stand to play this garbage. You find yourself just leaping from guard to guard hoping to find an opportunity where you can at least stab one before either being shot or having to leap off again like some sort of ADHD monkey who's forgotten to take his medicine this morning.\n\nYou die in one hit and have to start all over, the other ninjas in the game one shot you too, but are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to kill, and you can be shot by the basic guards from off screen. Meanwhile all you can do is stab someone knocked down, or throw your sword at someone (which does nothing to the ninja♥♥♥♥♥ and just disarms you for nothing) leaving yourself with nothing but more leaping until you can pick up the sword again somewhere in the middle of dodging 2 million bullets and multiple enemy ninjas.\n\nFor me the last straw was in only the 3rd mission, where I finally killed all the enemies (prompting the "killed all enemies!" objective to pop up) only to get near the exit and have a ♥♥♥♥ tonne more ninjas and guards spawn in, at which point the game just took back it's "killed all enemies" objective without telling me, so when i just went "♥♥♥♥ this" and bounced out the door and onto the bike to escape, I wasn't awarded the skill point for that mission, for failing to clear all the enemies.\n\nAs it so often reminds you in the "oh so hilarious" HINTS, "THIS IS NOT GUNPOINT". No. No it isn't. This is crap. And constantly popping up "HINT: You can't turn off these hints" is not funny, it's just annoying.\n\nRonin attempts to be funny and fails miserably, because it's too busy being so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. As if the gameplay wasn't stupid enough, the game then deliberately trolls you, such as in the example above, where it tells you you've cleared everyone before spawning more in and going "ONLY JOKING!

I keep running into wall glitches where I can't kill the boss or I can't get back into the stage. It has a really sweet concept, but at the end it's near impossible to complete. It's highly frustrating.\n\nOn another note, there's something else that really sucks about RONIN. In order to become more powerful, you have to clear stages perfectly. Just about halfway through the game you'll run into instances where it's impossible to either not kill the civilians or set off the alarm.\n\nAll in all your money is better spent on Transistor. It's labeled as a stealth game, but there's very little you can do while in stealth. Besides that, there's very little you can continue to do in stealth as the game progresses. It becomes a game of turn-based "oh crap who's aiming at me now?" kind of thing. You dodge bullets endlessly, trying not to ♥♥♥♥ yourself, while at the same time trying to get kills at the same time.\n\nNeed an analogy? Look no further than chess. Think of a scenario where a computer has rooks, bishops, and knights all chasing down, that's right, your one king.\n\nYou're probably going to ask, "Did you beat the game?" No. I didn't. I'm not going to waste another few hours banging my head onto the desk because I'm apparently not practiced enough in the art of dodging random-as-heck bullet aiming.

On many occasions, when using the grapling hook to pull up to a celing, or when falling to a floor, your character will end up on the wrong side of the floor, and often be stuck in limbo, requiring you to load a checkpoint. Enemies all have a certain number of shots they can take before needing to reload, but there's no indication for how many. Which often has multiple foes trading off who gets to kill you, leaving you no option to take out anyone else.\nI did enjoy the game though, it was just a slog to get through it. The systems are fun to mess around with, and when you get the hang of it it's a crazy thing to see play out.

I got to the same point and. . .it crashed again, but in a completely different way. That makes a total of 3 crashes on this one level, two of them at the very end, all progress lost.\n\nThis is very close to being a game I could get obsessed with. The core gameplay is extremely fun--a really nice mix of action and strategy. It's just not ready to be released, yet. It's just too buggy and the controls are way too sloppy and inconsistent. A few examples. . .\n\n--Bugs--\n*The game crashes roughly once every three levels, usually while reloading from checkpoints. Expect to have your progress reset constantly, often during the final fight of a level.\n*The thing that prompted me to write this review was a moment where the game put me in a lose state, teleported me through a wall, and immediately checkpointed me. I just had to quit the game, losing all progress. This isn't the first time I've been checkpointed just after being put in a lose state by this game, but it was definitely the most frustrating, right at the end of a long level.\n*I've played under three hours and had the game crash on me around four times, and checkpoint me in unwinnable states twice. That's not counting the fact that the game simply does not run on one of my computers.\n\n--Bad Controls--\n*The entire game is about avoiding the gunfire from half a dozen guards as you jump around killing them, but the line that tells you where you're going to jump to lies. Things like colliding with an enemy will leave you in a completely unexpected location, almost always getting you killed. Expect a long and frustrating learning period as you learn\n*Hitboxes in general are a mystery, which is a bad thing in a game all about precise movement. It's extremely hard to predict where you'll be standing after you kill an enemy, or how tall you'll be standing after a jump, and getting this even a little wrong is instant death. There are fun challenges and frustrating challenges, and trying to guess which if you're going to take a step into a bullet's trajectory or not in order to stab a guard is a frustrating challenge.\n*The only way to move in a fight is jumping. This is almost okay, but there are a bunch of moments where jumping simply doesn't work. It's easy to end up in a situation where you need to get up on a ledge, and out of combat you'd be able to just climb up the side effortlessly, but because you're in a fight you have to spend multiple turns hopping around and spamming grappling hooks in the hopes that your momentum will deposit you awkwardly on the lip of the platform you're trying to get on instead of drifting you into a bullet or back where you started from.\n*Movement just feels very rough and non-generous in general. Expect a lot of the game to be taken up by guards getting knocked out of your kill range because you jumped at them wrong or just little fiddly things going wrong.\n*Stealth is baffling.

There are many examples of the game being unfair, rather than callenging. What i mean, is when playing this game, you are going to get punished for making a mistake, that certainly is not yours, because the game is misleading, or because the mechanics are inconsitent.\nYou are going to waste a turn (and probably die afterwards), because the character didnt jump the way you aimed the jump. You are going to get spoted by an enemy who is standing on the opposite side of a wall. You think you are going to be able to jump down through a platform, since you could do just that with all the other platforms that looked just like it, just to find out that it didnt work, and that you are still standing on top of the it (and you wasted a turn, which probably caused your death).\nThe fact that this game is a turn based strategy game just makes this worse, because if you cant count on consistent mechanics in a strategy game, if the rules of the game just change in the middle of it, there is not really much strategy to it.\nThat being said, i really think that the core mechanics in this RONIN could make a pretty engaging game, it just does not feel like the game has been polished enough.\nI could also make a long list of ideas for gameplay improvement, since i feel like the game needs a lot of changes made to the controls and gameplay. but i realize that this is not my game, and that this is not about my ideas, but the controls definately feel clumsy and just not right for a strategy game.\nAll in all, this game has potential, but it has a lot of holes, that a finished game should never have.\n","February 9","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A few minor changes and it could be fantastic:\n\n- allow walking around to be one of the combat actions, because it's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid that you can't sidestep easily\n- allow climbing a ledge to be one of the combat actions, because it's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid that you can't climb a ledge in battle.\n- change the controls so that you have to press another button to execute the jump, and possibly a different button if you want to jump but not collide with enemies, and another different button if you want to instead send out your grapple.\n- make the jump indicator more reliable - in battle, it is your main control, it should do what you tell it to.\n- give a ninja-sight option to go back a turn or two in battle if you (for example) ♥♥♥♥ up because the jump indicator lied to you\n- give a way to incapacitate civs, because twice (TWICE!) one saw me just before a checkpoint, and couldn't avoid bonus objective failed.","April 19","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hack computers and kill bad guys, not a lot of variation on the enemies either.\n\nThe save function is automatic, and sometimes the save points end up really bad, and you have to reset the level, this is a big minus in my book.\n\nThe story is as thin as my coffee is black, I don't know why the devs even bothered to put in the small text, it wouldn't even have mattered if they left them out.\n\n\n\nAll in all it had potential, but fell short because of mechanics, too little variation and lack of story.

Just so annoying.\n\nListen, devs. I want to feel like a badass ninja assassin. It's not a stealth game? That's fine, nobody watched those old ninja movies to see people quietly sneak around. Killing's great. So why did you make it so, so stupid? Why do I have to spend so much time bouncing back and forth between enemies, gently knocking them to the ground so they can get up and shoot me in two turns? How about, you know, letting me kill them? A room of 9 enemies who can shoot the floor? Great, just let me kill them instead of pushing them around. It's just tedious. So, so tedious.\n\nI won't describe the game, the gameplay's unique, go watch a video of it. But I will complain. You spend the majority of your time in turn-based mode, hopping around in arcs. You might think that since you're a badass assassin with a huge sword you'd use those hops to hop on enemies and stab them, but oh how wrong you'd be.\n\nYour hops are for either knocking guys over or for avoiding 4 or 5 frozen laser beams representing enemy aim. Your hopping goal is not to hop ON the enemies to stab them or break their necks or anything, no that would be stupid. Your goal is to hop in such a way that the end of the turn finds you in the air somewhere NEAR an enemy. Should you achieve that, then next turn you can actually do the killing IF, and only if, none of the other 7 enemies are aiming somewhere that'll get you killed. Knowing THAT is complicated by the fact that where you end up after making a kill is somewhat random.\n\nActually your movement in general is a little random, particularly if you bump into an enemy but also for other reasons or no reason. Where exactly the enemies aim seems to vary a bit, which for better or worse adds an element of randomness to the levels which would otherwise play out the same way every time were you to use an identical approach.\n\nWhatever. I'm sure it's a fine game if you're one of those people who find difficulty inherently fun. It's stylish and unique-ish. I just found it to be more annoying than enjoyable, and it made me want to stop playing real quick.","April 27","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there are things I both like and dislike about it, so let's begin.\n\n+ Cool art style\n+ Good Music\n+ Nice atmosphere\n+ Works well with a Steam Controller\n+ Combat is pretty fun, once you figure out how it works\n+ Plot isn't integral to the gameplay, but still is mysterious and interesting\n+ You get to be a badass ninja and slice guys in suits to pieces\n\n- Achievments don't work on OSX\n- The combat is difficult to learn at first\n- The jump arc lies to you sometimes, causing you to screw up\n- Momentum takes some getting used to\n- Grappling hook tends to glich out if you grapple too fast (you can sometimes warp through the cieling)\n- If you play a level too long, (more than about 30 mins) the game eventually straight up crashes.\n- It seems a bit expensive for a game this short. (15 levels total)\n\nSo overall, Ronin is pretty fun, but it takes a while to get used to the slightly janky physics/combat.

Just so annoying.\n\nListen, devs. I want to feel like a badass ninja assassin. It's not a stealth game? That's fine, nobody watched those old ninja movies to see people quietly sneak around. Killing's great. So why did you make it so, so stupid? Why do I have to spend so much time bouncing back and forth between enemies, gently knocking them to the ground so they can get up and shoot me in two turns? How about, you know, letting me kill them? A room of 9 enemies who can shoot the floor? Great, just let me kill them instead of pushing them around. It's just tedious. So, so tedious.\n\nI won't describe the game, the gameplay's unique, go watch a video of it. But I will complain. You spend the majority of your time in turn-based mode, hopping around in arcs. You might think that since you're a badass assassin with a huge sword you'd use those hops to hop on enemies and stab them, but oh how wrong you'd be.\n\nYour hops are for either knocking guys over or for avoiding 4 or 5 frozen laser beams representing enemy aim. Your hopping goal is not to hop ON the enemies to stab them or break their necks or anything, no that would be stupid. Your goal is to hop in such a way that the end of the turn finds you in the air somewhere NEAR an enemy. Should you achieve that, then next turn you can actually do the killing IF, and only if, none of the other 7 enemies are aiming somewhere that'll get you killed. Knowing THAT is complicated by the fact that where you end up after making a kill is somewhat random.\n\nActually your movement in general is a little random, particularly if you bump into an enemy but also for other reasons or no reason. Where exactly the enemies aim seems to vary a bit, which for better or worse adds an element of randomness to the levels which would otherwise play out the same way every time were you to use an identical approach.\n\nWhatever. I'm sure it's a fine game if you're one of those people who find difficulty inherently fun. It's stylish and unique-ish. I just found it to be more annoying than enjoyable, and it made me want to stop playing real quick.","April 27","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But what happens is the rigid timing mechanism kicks in and you cant let go during the right angle ever.\n\nThe grappling hook in general seems like a whole afterthought, it doesn't give you any prediction guides, and often doesn't make sense enough to ever be useful in combat.\nYou never want to jump, and then grapple to stay in place, since they will shoot you there.\nYou never want to jump and then grapple in the opposite direction because it never swings you backward (i guess trying to respect the laws of momentum but not in a realistic enough way to be useful)\nSo I think the only real use of grapple in combat is jumping, and then swinging spiderman style in one direction only.\n\nThe fixed time slicing destroys any real tactical possibility in the game. Your jump turns into a white and red arc. The white part is where you will go this "turn"  And you can only shoot your grapple at the exact ending of this turn. The way it should work is you should be able to lengthen or shorten this white area so that you could shoot the grapple at any point during the turn. Even with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grapple physics, you would at least have some sense of control and more options. The way it is now you have LESS options during combat than free roaming.\n\nThere are bugs where you sometimes go through walls, or don't get shot when you should have.\n\nAnd finally: The way you tackle people mid jump is never consistent so you dont know where you will land or stop moving during the jump.\n\nThe end result is not a puzzle, nor tactical, you are just jumping around randomly hoping to get a kill every once in a while.\n\nInstead of actually fixing the game, the developer chose to just put a hint in the game that says "the arc is a lie" ♥♥♥♥ off","July 3, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Sadly its too frustrating to completely have fun with it. While the combat is  moderately fun, the controls are pretty bad. Aiming the jump is harder than it should be, and I think is impossible with a controller. Also you have to do a lot of guesswork with jumping around the bullets, cause it does not show how your body will get to the point your jumping at, meaning you can never know if you will not touch a bullet when jumping. Another thing infuriating is that a couple of times i have glitch through the wall when jumping, which ins up killing me or triggering an alarm.\nWhile some people have said there is no stealth, there is small parts of stealth if you want. To get skill points you need to complete a level killing all enemies, not killing civilians, and not triggering an alarm, and to avoid civilians triggering alarms you need to stealth past them, which is can be quite fun, but again can get ruin by the bad controls.\nI really want to like this game, but there is too much holding me back from having fun in the moderate amount of fun there is in the combat.\nAlso the last level deserves a special place in hell","July 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It has a similar jumping and platforming mechanic, but is a lot more combat focused. In fact, the great combat is the game's main selling point. Combat, unlike regular gameplay, is turn based, with enemy attacks being telegraphed via tracer lines. If you, during your turn, move out of the tracer trajectories, you dodge the attacks.\n\nPros:\n+Combat is fun\n+Atmospheric soundtrack\n+Game is challenging\n\nCons:\n-Locked to30FPS.\n-The Skill system. In order to get skill points, you need to complete all three optional objectives of a map, making the "optional" objectives not so optional at all.\n-Paper thin story. There is almost no story at all.\n-Controls could use some polish. The jump trajectory is unreliable.\n-Linear level design. If you are used to Mark of the Ninja or Gunpoint, you will likely be disappointed\n-Final level has no checkpoints. Unlike regular levels, you do not die instantly, but get a 9 round countdown that refreshes each time you kill an enemy. If you kill the final boss while the countdown is active, you get the Bad End, but if you manage to kill him and escape without getting hit, you get the Good End. Combine that with the great difficulty of the final map, and it is a recipe for frustration.\n\nI really want to like this game, and if the aforementioned issues get fixed then I will adjust my review accordingly.","July 10, 2015","false","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Too often I would land next to a stunned enemy only to have to jump closer to him because I cant take two steps to get in attack range. In combat standard movement is entirely disabled and you can only traverse the world by jumping and using the grappling rope, which might be moderately acceptable except that the jump range that is pitiful and a grappling rope that is nigh on useless in combat. I would spend minutes bouncing around a room because I could stun enemies but be driven off before a killing blow. The "turns" are vague and on more than one occaision left me in a completely different position than I thought I would end in. The help tips told me nothing useful and if the message telling me that "the help tips are useful" is anything to go by they're lying to me too. On top of this is the sword enemy who I spent far too long trying to understand how to fight (because the game does not tell you anything). Turns out that jumping on them (like you would any other enemy) will only cause them to immediately kill you.\n\nThe game looks like something where you can plan your moves carefully and quickly (and bloodily) clear out a room of armed guards in a satisfying manner but it so rarely works out that way. After an hour, and the first two (of a supposed five if the game is to be believed) assassinations I've applied for a refund.","August 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Love FTL and Dark Souls, and a ton of different roguelikes.  I also grabbed this game for 50% off during the Stealth sale, so price, genre, and difficulty are not what's turning me off.\n\nRonin's problem is that it is trying to be a super tight action platformer with a turn based combat system, but the controls are clunky. (aka: the kiss of death for tight action games)  Everything your character can do is controlled by the mouse.  This is mostly fine during the turn based combat bits, but is horrid during the real time platform/stealth bits.  It means that instead of being able to swing in through a window, and tap a button to stab a guy in the back, you instead swing through the window, and have to click on a "stab" button that pops up on screen by the enemy while your character (and the camera) are moving.  This gets especially annoying when you're also using the mouse to aim your next grappling hook. (or when you need to retract your grappling hook by clicking that icon, and quickly follow it up with a stealth kill, requiring another)\n\n\nBugs were also plentiful in my short time with the game.  I was able to get my grappling hook to retract me through solid walls/ceilings several times.\n\nOne partifuclarly funny instance happened when I was trying to reach the last guard in a room before he sounded the alarm.  Was going to retract up to the ceiling and then pounce on him, but my grappling hook pulled me through to the roof.  Since there was no way to get back into the building from up there, I had  no way to reach the guard before the alarm was set off.\n\n\nDon't buy this game.

They're not lying. You are easily spotted and there's really no way, or reason, to avoid it most of the time.\nI played through the first 5 or 6 missions before getting frustrated and bored.

The way you need to get skill points to upgrade the game's hero, Jacket Conway, is tedious, put it nicely. You need to complete three bonus goals to get them, there's no other way. You need to spare the citizens, not trip the alarm, and kill all the enemies. This would have been fine if you DIDN'T HAVE THE CITIZENS BE ABLE TO TRIGGER A LOCKDOWN, and that wouldn't be as bad if the only way to prevent this was to straight up murder them. Now, perhaps I missed something here, but that seems very counter-productive in terms of allowing the player to get points for upgrades.\n\n\n\nThe clunky controls are something I can get over, once you get used to them, they aren't as much of a problem as the combat is. The regular security guards are okay, I like them. But the big swordsmen, oh they aren't much of a fun enemy to fight as they take two hits, and due to the turn-based battle system, which is something I like mind you, they get up at the end of the turn, making doing combat with just ONE involved becomes extremely tedious.\n\n\n\n2/10 I suggest this game if you hate winning.","August 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

A fun, if slightly underexplained mechanic is its combo system.  Learning to manage your combo meter to pull off your coolest moves is part of the fun.  If you want a game that let's you both control the action and makes you think about your next step and strategize I reccomend it.\n\nAs for myself I did experience a couple hiccups however.  The first is that when using the grapple gun there are some circumstance where you will end up glitching through walls.  In some places this can even cause you to restart from your last checkpoint, which isn't too bad, as the checkpoints are not too far apart.  The second is that I did not know how to activate the "limit break" ability.  I assumed that there was a "activate limit break key" that I was supposed to use to activate it, but as I played the game I came to understand that limit breaks are done automatically when the combo meter is filled.  If this was explained, I missed it.  If it was not, this could be prevented by simply stating in the brief explanation of the combo meter that when it's filled it will automatically use a limit break to give you an extra turn in combat.\n\nOverall, my experience with RONIN was enjoyable.  The combat is easy enough to pick up but still has a lot of depth.  I'm not sure if it's worth $12 but I'm satisfied with it for picking it up when it was on sale for $8 or so.","October 30, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kxon/recommended/274230/","kxon","JRPG Protagonist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kxon/","139 products in account","This is an excellent concept, and and addictive and wonderful game. It really deserves a level editor to create custom challenges though, and the story is too short. Bugs and control issues may frustrate some.\n\nPros:\nThe core mechanic is excellent. Click and drag to jump in different directions. Use special abilities and basic attacks by clicking icons that appear over the heads of enemies. A simple skill tree adds variety to gameplay. Turn based combat makes it as much a strategic game as a tactical game.\n\nRonin's visual aesthetic is excellent. Little touches throughout the levels add flavor and a touch of lore given the game's minimalist approach to story telling.\n\nLevels are well designed and interesting. Each level offers a unique set of challenges. The game tends to add 1 or 2 new mechanics per level, and introduces them very naturally.\n\nThe music works.\n\nSome in game cutscenes and scripted moments through the game, and they are used effectively to convey story and even character (e.g., the first person you assassinate).\n\nCons:\nThe core mechanic does work the way you wish it would. Almost all players will run into a situation where they are within range of a platform if they jumped directly at it. But, because the jumps always seem to use the maximum arc, and only terminate if you hit specific structures, doing a straightish jump to a platform just in reach can be impossible. Likewise, if you jump and catch a ledge, there is no option to climb the ledge on your turn: you have to jump off the ledge. As it is, the only movement available during the turn based combat is the jump. Secondly, attack animations often seem ludicrous. When attacking a nearby target, you always jump in the air. So if a bullet is overhead, instead of stepping forward and thrusting, you leap into the bullet and die. These gameplay oddities destroy, for me, he suspension of disbelief. They are jarring to the point of distraction.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the game as bugs. I have only personally experienced the "clip through ceiling" bug. I assume patches have alleviated most of the game-breaking bugs.\n\nThe music becomes repetitive after a while. It's almost always the same sound in the background.\n\nThe game is only about 4 hours long.\n\nIf you take certain alternative routes during the early missions, which have tutorial elements, you will miss the tutorials. It seems the tutorials are keyed to passing through a given space, so if you don't pass through that space, no tutorial. This is most noticeable the first time you have to use the grappling hook to get somewhere.\n\nThe pause button doesn't always pause the game in the same places the jump button will. When you jump, the game pauses while you select your jump arc. The pause button (default space bar) will also pause the game while you hold it down. But the jump button will pause during moments when the space bar won't allow you to pause. Likewise, you can't toggle pause (unless you click the jump button but cancel the jump).\n\nYou encounter samurai enemies from time to time. Unlike normal enemies, they chop you up if you jump into them. As far as I know, the game gives you no indication of this. So when you jump into one for the first time, thinking it will cause stun, it slices you in half and you die. It would've been nice to see the samurai do this before encountering the first one that you can actually fight (in the first level there is one that just patrols around, but cannot be reached. I don't know why).\n\nGame could use more cutscenes or scripted sequences.\n\nOverall:\nThe core mechanic and level design overcomes the deficiencies of the game. It is worth playing, especially at the <$10 price point. I think it would be worth >$15 if it only fixed some of the weird movement choices, and maybe added a level editor.\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turn-based combat and time freezing mechanics add an interesting twist to the genre.\nThere are a few flaws though:\n- controller support is pretty poor - I had to highly increase right stick sensitivity just to have my actions detected\n- having to restart from the beginning when you exit a level it's quite punishing given the length of levels and the amount of randomness/luck implied in each combat\n- some bugs let you unintentionally teleport through glass windows (which is cool) and slide through platforms (which is often not)\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, hoping that programmer will add patches in the future.","December 5, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

RONIN takes a more combat-focused take on the concept, using an intuitive and simple turn system that is tactical and engaging. RONIN retains a stealth sytem like Gunpoint, but I feel that it can be almost abused with certain abilities (like the sword throw/retireve, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8faF2H5YcRc for a direct example)\n\nRONIN also has some very annoying bugs that should really have been ironed out when it was in early access. Almost on-command you can grapple yourself through a wall into an inescapable room with literally no way out of. This can happen on every level, and sometimes even teleports you to the end of the level, particuraly the last one.\n\nIf you can look past this, and the rather high initial difficulty curve, RONIN is a great game with an amazing soundtrack too (seriously go listen to Swordpoint)","January 2","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprilmarch/recommended/274230/","aprilmarch","Itambé Street Station 🚉🚎","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprilmarch/","460 products in account","RONIN is a game that seeks to redifine what 'turn-based combat' means. Usually, when you hear the term, you think of JRPG style combat where people stand in place and rush each other to stab them with swords, chipping their mammoth HP before returning to their assigned positions and waiting for their next turn. RONIN is the opposite. It's about quick, mobile, fast-paced combat in which everyone can only take one hit. It's stylish and at its best it's brilliant.\n\nRONIN is also a game about infiltrating buildings, Gunpoint-style. This second game is much worse than the first game, but it would be passable if it didn't use the same controls. Moving around and clicking on icons to perform moves work perfectly during the turn-based sections, but in the real-time infiltration period just turns things into a whack-a-mole. It is not always possible to 'ghost' levels, when it is it's clearly and afterthought, and even then it feels like you missed the main event of the excellent turn-based combat.\n\nEven worse is the lockdown mechanic. If an enemy sees you, and then misses you, they'll call in a lockdown in ten seconds, unless you kill them first, or you enter their line of sight again. A lockdown will make the game slightly harder, and you only get to win a skill point at the end of a level if you fullfill three criteria, one of which is not having a lockdown called. So far so good. Except that enemies are super dumb. They will not take a single step to search you. If they see you, and you drop behind a low wall, they'll call a lockdown. If an enemy across the screen takes a short glimpse of you, they'll call in a lockdown. This means that very often during the game, instead of worrying about dying and killing enemies, I had to worry about trying to get to a small place so that a distant enemy will spot me again and cancel the lockdown. I had to do this every ten turns to stop the lockdown. I soon realized that when I screwed up and let the lockdown happen, I had a lot more fun with the game because I was focusing on dodging and countering attacks.\n\nThe game also has a very minimal story. It doesn't tell you who the protagonist is, for instance. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out in a minute; but I'm pretty certain that if this game had been released by an AAA publisher, not only would they tell you repeatedly about that, but they'd treat it as a mindblowing reveal. As it is, the story works flawlessly; just enough to give you a taste of what is happening and let you fill the huge blanks with your own imagination, if you even care to.\n\nIt's difficult not to recommend such a great game. But it's also difficult to overlook its flaws. There's even a tip in the loading screen that says it's not a stealth game, so I don't know why it goes through its motions so often if it knows it isn't one. It's like an excellent RTS game that forces you to play a race between each level, using the same controls from the RTS sections, and how you place in the race affects how much resoursces you get. Here's hoping the next game focuses more on the combat and the infiltration is reduced to a sideshow, or even completely eliminated.","October 4, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system is, once you get the hang of it, enjoyable to play around with, and the various powerups you can purchase do end up altering your playstyle.\n\nA few issues:\n\nThere isn't much variation on offer. Unlike Gunpoint or MotN, there's only a handful of ways to clear a level. You also have to kill everyone (and have no alarms raised) to get a skill point from a level, and pretty much all the levels have mandatory combat sessions, so there's no option to simply stealth through the game, which is a bit of a disappointment. You can, in certain cases, sneak around before the inevitable fight and thin the enemy forces a bit, but this isn't always an option and it doesn't head off the reinforcements that often show up.\n\nLevel design also suffers from this - there's often one way in and out of the location, or maybe two, and a clear 1-2-3 path you're expected to follow. This is a shame, because this type of game can and should offer a much larger variety in terms of reaching the objectives, so as to best make use of the stealth mechanics. Instead, it feels a little too linear.\n\nI haven't completed the game, but from what I've seen of the level design and skills on offer, there isn't much replay value. This stems in part from the above problem with variation, but also because there often isn't reason to go back to earlier levels with new skills. The skill points from each level can be unlocked as you play it the first time, and there are no collectibles or points to worry about.\n\nCombat also, especially with larger numbers of enemies, turns into a trial-and-error system, where you figure out the best opening move, then replicate it as you try out the potential avenues of attack after that, going for a new strategy on the last branch each time you die. While it's actually sort of fun to outsmart the enemy soldiers and finally get the strategy that takes them all down, it can get a little frustrating, especially given the occasional variance in jump and bullet predictions.\n\nUltimately, though, this game (for all its flaws) is a lot of fun. Playing with the combat mechanics, figuring out ways to bypass civilians or sneak up on enemies, replaying a tough section to kill all guards without letting them get an alarm out, all add up to an enjoyable experience, for a few hours at least. While it's not quite worth the asking price, at a decent discount it's a great purchase.","October 15, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BUT there is a serious bug in current version on Mac OS X. The items in the scene can be lost after playing for around half an hour. And restart this level or load last check point will make it worse and if you try to restart the game, then  your current prograss in this level will lose then you have to start the level from the beginning...\n\nAnyway, despite of this bug, this is a very interesting game. I have killed three of the five targets. The first three are not hard even if you try to complete the bonus objectives. But it does take some time for you to think about how you should arrange your operations. And of course, it is possible (at least I think) to play this game without sneaking or assassinating, but you might lose some fun of this game.\n\nBTW, I can not unlock the achievements though I've completed them.

RONIN takes a more combat-focused take on the concept, using an intuitive and simple turn system that is tactical and engaging. RONIN retains a stealth sytem like Gunpoint, but I feel that it can be almost abused with certain abilities (like the sword throw/retireve, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8faF2H5YcRc for a direct example)\n\nRONIN also has some very annoying bugs that should really have been ironed out when it was in early access. Almost on-command you can grapple yourself through a wall into an inescapable room with literally no way out of. This can happen on every level, and sometimes even teleports you to the end of the level, particuraly the last one.\n\nIf you can look past this, and the rather high initial difficulty curve, RONIN is a great game with an amazing soundtrack too (seriously go listen to Swordpoint)","January 2","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When your best option is to take out as many guards as possible before they figure out what's going on, it's exciting and tense all at once, as well as gratifying when you pull it off. The grappling hook mechanic takes some getting used to - I'd recommend a mouse and keyboard for precision - but once you get the hang of it, as well as the nuances of movement, you feel like Spider-Man with a sword. My only problem is there are a couple of jumping bugs that screwed me over, which is especially problematic for the New Game Plus mode I'm currently in the middle of which adds machine gun guards early on and changes certain enemy behavior.

It's hard to succinctly describe how this game plays. While nobody sees you, you can move freely. When an enemy can see you, time stops and a pseudo-turn-based combat system kicks in. You will see where enemies will shoot on the next turn, and you must use this turn to reposition yourself so that you both remain unharmed, and are in a position to kill one or more enemies.\n\nThe "story" in this game is very thin, despite setting itself up as a lone swordsman dismantling a conspiracy. It consists of one photograph, and the protagonist monologuing at the start of some levels. And the photo has people in it who remain unaccounted for, even taking the supplementary material into account. It's as if someone was starting to design an intricate plot and got bored 20 minutes in.\n\nCutting to the chase; the fun in this game is in methodically, a turn at a time, slaughtering dozens of people while never taking a scratch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprilmarch/recommended/274230/","aprilmarch","Itambé Street Station 🚉🚎","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprilmarch/","460 products in account","RONIN is a game that seeks to redifine what 'turn-based combat' means. Usually, when you hear the term, you think of JRPG style combat where people stand in place and rush each other to stab them with swords, chipping their mammoth HP before returning to their assigned positions and waiting for their next turn. RONIN is the opposite. It's about quick, mobile, fast-paced combat in which everyone can only take one hit. It's stylish and at its best it's brilliant.\n\nRONIN is also a game about infiltrating buildings, Gunpoint-style. This second game is much worse than the first game, but it would be passable if it didn't use the same controls. Moving around and clicking on icons to perform moves work perfectly during the turn-based sections, but in the real-time infiltration period just turns things into a whack-a-mole. It is not always possible to 'ghost' levels, when it is it's clearly and afterthought, and even then it feels like you missed the main event of the excellent turn-based combat.\n\nEven worse is the lockdown mechanic. If an enemy sees you, and then misses you, they'll call in a lockdown in ten seconds, unless you kill them first, or you enter their line of sight again. A lockdown will make the game slightly harder, and you only get to win a skill point at the end of a level if you fullfill three criteria, one of which is not having a lockdown called. So far so good. Except that enemies are super dumb. They will not take a single step to search you. If they see you, and you drop behind a low wall, they'll call a lockdown. If an enemy across the screen takes a short glimpse of you, they'll call in a lockdown. This means that very often during the game, instead of worrying about dying and killing enemies, I had to worry about trying to get to a small place so that a distant enemy will spot me again and cancel the lockdown. I had to do this every ten turns to stop the lockdown. I soon realized that when I screwed up and let the lockdown happen, I had a lot more fun with the game because I was focusing on dodging and countering attacks.\n\nThe game also has a very minimal story. It doesn't tell you who the protagonist is, for instance. Anyone with half a brain can figure it out in a minute; but I'm pretty certain that if this game had been released by an AAA publisher, not only would they tell you repeatedly about that, but they'd treat it as a mindblowing reveal. As it is, the story works flawlessly; just enough to give you a taste of what is happening and let you fill the huge blanks with your own imagination, if you even care to.\n\nIt's difficult not to recommend such a great game. But it's also difficult to overlook its flaws. There's even a tip in the loading screen that says it's not a stealth game, so I don't know why it goes through its motions so often if it knows it isn't one. It's like an excellent RTS game that forces you to play a race between each level, using the same controls from the RTS sections, and how you place in the race affects how much resoursces you get. Here's hoping the next game focuses more on the combat and the infiltration is reduced to a sideshow, or even completely eliminated.","October 4, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really deserves a level editor to create custom challenges though, and the story is too short. Bugs and control issues may frustrate some.\n\nPros:\nThe core mechanic is excellent. Click and drag to jump in different directions. Use special abilities and basic attacks by clicking icons that appear over the heads of enemies. A simple skill tree adds variety to gameplay. Turn based combat makes it as much a strategic game as a tactical game.\n\nRonin's visual aesthetic is excellent. Little touches throughout the levels add flavor and a touch of lore given the game's minimalist approach to story telling.\n\nLevels are well designed and interesting. Each level offers a unique set of challenges. The game tends to add 1 or 2 new mechanics per level, and introduces them very naturally.\n\nThe music works.\n\nSome in game cutscenes and scripted moments through the game, and they are used effectively to convey story and even character (e.g., the first person you assassinate).\n\nCons:\nThe core mechanic does work the way you wish it would. Almost all players will run into a situation where they are within range of a platform if they jumped directly at it. But, because the jumps always seem to use the maximum arc, and only terminate if you hit specific structures, doing a straightish jump to a platform just in reach can be impossible. Likewise, if you jump and catch a ledge, there is no option to climb the ledge on your turn: you have to jump off the ledge. As it is, the only movement available during the turn based combat is the jump. Secondly, attack animations often seem ludicrous. When attacking a nearby target, you always jump in the air. So if a bullet is overhead, instead of stepping forward and thrusting, you leap into the bullet and die. These gameplay oddities destroy, for me, he suspension of disbelief. They are jarring to the point of distraction.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the game as bugs. I have only personally experienced the "clip through ceiling" bug. I assume patches have alleviated most of the game-breaking bugs.\n\nThe music becomes repetitive after a while. It's almost always the same sound in the background.\n\nThe game is only about 4 hours long.\n\nIf you take certain alternative routes during the early missions, which have tutorial elements, you will miss the tutorials. It seems the tutorials are keyed to passing through a given space, so if you don't pass through that space, no tutorial. This is most noticeable the first time you have to use the grappling hook to get somewhere.\n\nThe pause button doesn't always pause the game in the same places the jump button will. When you jump, the game pauses while you select your jump arc. The pause button (default space bar) will also pause the game while you hold it down. But the jump button will pause during moments when the space bar won't allow you to pause. Likewise, you can't toggle pause (unless you click the jump button but cancel the jump).\n\nYou encounter samurai enemies from time to time. Unlike normal enemies, they chop you up if you jump into them. As far as I know, the game gives you no indication of this. So when you jump into one for the first time, thinking it will cause stun, it slices you in half and you die. It would've been nice to see the samurai do this before encountering the first one that you can actually fight (in the first level there is one that just patrols around, but cannot be reached. I don't know why).\n\nGame could use more cutscenes or scripted sequences.\n\nOverall:\nThe core mechanic and level design overcomes the deficiencies of the game. It is worth playing, especially at the <$10 price point. I think it would be worth >$15 if it only fixed some of the weird movement choices, and maybe added a level editor.\n\n","July 6, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes it can also be frustrating :)\n\nWhen you complete a mission killing every opponent and without killing innocents or causing alarm, you can level up your skills.

Maybe it's just getting used to it but the game is really designed in a way to make it incredibly hard for you to adapt to any situation it presents... And I... like this.\n\nIt is very hard to explain how RONIN works but it's a mix of real-time platforming and turn-based combat. What made the game hard for me is that I wanted to 100% all the stages, which meant no civilian kills, no alarms raised and every enemy in the stage has to be dead. Having to do all of this and keeping your sanity is very hard as the game constantly throws unfair room set-ups at you. I swear, had it not been for some of the more useful skills like the stun or the shadow strike (teleport), this game would be only for the most hardcore of masochists, and even then, they may give up on it. Having to repeat the same level over 40 times, figuring out the best way to kill everyone without setting off an alarm and keeping track of every line aimed at you or your surroundings and the one who's aiming it (could be a one shot, could be a rifle guy who fires for 2 turns or worse: a samurai that dashes through everything in his path).\n\nI will admit, I did ragequit several times, which was a big mistake since the game doesn't remember checkpoints in the level if you leave it, so i had to start over again. All of the missions are varied in terms of stage design, not so much in objectives. The level is usually "hack these terminals, kill the target, leave" and that's fine. It follows Gunpoint's example in that regard and it shouldn't be a surprise, seeing how it's from the same person, after all. And even though the game has such a high difficulty if you decide to take it seriously, and that I hated it every moment of the last few missions where the checkpoints were just unfair, I can recommend this game for you hardcore completionists and casual indie action platformer fans alike. RONIN is a game I picked up without any expectations other than a Gunpoint-like experience, but what I got was something almost completely different that was worth it all the way through. Lots of props for the level design and game overall to the dev and hoping for more 2D games from him.

This game is really good I had a blast the whole time if you clear the room just fine you get a really satisfying feeling. On the other hand it definietly needs some work not much though.\nFirst the jumping from platforms down is kinda buggy sometimes when you want to jump you just get a little hop and bullet through your head. Overall platforms are really hard to get onto while in the "Turn-mode" (thinking Wisegal lvl2). Im not sure whether it was intention but a lot of times you need to avoid the "Turn-mode" as much as possible just to get easy kills and than just finish the last 3 guys in turns.\nAlso having arrows pointing in the way the bullet is being shot at instead of just straight line would be really helpful. Diferenciating from "Machinegun man" shot, Samurai jump and normal agent shot would be also good meaning in the color of the line for example.\nTo summarize I would say Great game but work needs to be done in "Turn-mode" execution and platforms.","May 8","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All of it comes together nicely with a simple yet effective art style, music and level design. The story has a thin narrative but it does the job well enough establishing a cyber-punk samurai tale of revenge.\n\nThe controls (I used Mouse+Keyboard) were responsive and tightly tuned and they really let me sink my teeth into the finer nuances of combat such as letting bullets graze me and threading those jumps.\n\nThe game poses a moderate challenge even for a veteran gamer as it is not a simple hack+slash stealth game, but actually requires you to think ahead and attack at the right time or even the right angle. The learning curve is real and you will die until you ~GET GUD~ but not as much as these negative reviews would have you believe.\n\nThe players have all the advantages in the wonderful combat of RONIN, they only need use them!\n\nHighly recommended","May 11","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially, you're supposed to kill every single combatant in pause-based combat while avoiding detection by non-coms.\n\nIt *is* quite as interesting as it sounds, but also extremely frustrating at times due to a few design problems.\n\n1. During combat, you will occasionally end up in a position that affords no good jump trajectories (e.g., clinging to the side of the building you are assaulting). When this happens, you do not have the option to simply climb up and continue your attack, forcing you to make a bad jump.\n\n2. If you kill all nearby mooks, you snap out of combat mode even if you are in view of a farther away enemy. The moment or two you need to realize you're no longer in pause mode but are in real-time mode can cost you a perfect win.\n\n3. The single-auto-save system doesn't always work well. It sometimes saves at an inconvenient time (e.g., after a civilian has spotted you), causing you to have to replay the entire level.\n\nThese three problems may not seem so bad, but I promise you they will cause you to hate the game from time to time.

Firstly, I love turned based games. This feels like an X-Com platformer, and by God that's a beautiful mix. I really wish this was a new genre, because turn-based action feels like a massively untapped market (if you're excluding troop command war and building games from the list). Some of the skills blend so well together, such as rope swinging, throwing your sword, jumping up onto a wall and leaving behind a decoy, and then recalling your sword and watching as it ricochets into two different guards who are shooting at the hologram you dropped. That ♥♥♥♥ is beautiful, man.\n\nIf they'd worked on adding a story, fixing a few frustrating glitches and oversights, and added a few more skills, this would have been a classic indie game.

It Is KILLER frustrating knowing you have a perfect line of sight to your target and are about to make a miracle kill with a domino effect... and then you get a "bmph" noise and you only skipped 3 inches, and then get machine-gunned in the face.\n* Platform detection is also goofy - sometimes my jump-arc lets me land on a platform, sometimes not.  There doesn't seem to be a logical reason why.  Maybe mark platform surfaces during the jump-arc pause with green if they're reachable, red if not?  It sucks having to launch towards a platform you think is within easy reach, fall through... and get machinegunned in the face.\n* The pause function needs to be SPOT ON - jam space, game STOPS.  This is more a puzzle game than anything else, with a series of tight and logical moves required to defeat a level.  I don't want the pause function to only work when I"m A. not moving, B. not in the air, C. not swinging from the grappling hook.  Timing the pause is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the game auto-pauses on a dime, but you sometimes negate that and swing face first into a machine gun.\n* I would LOVE to see some kind of flowchart on your moves, to show what options are available the NEXT time you can do a thing - I know part of the fun is to jump headfirst into combat and see where it takes you, but the cheap kills are a bit too frequent if you miss a mark by a millisecond, and simply having a radius around you with icons showing what gameplay options were available would be a huge help.\n* Contextual movement trees would be lovely, as well - maybe I don't WANT to jumpjumpjumpjump kill jumpjumpjump for 20 minutes before I have enough downtime to smack that dude in the eye before getting machinegunned in the face.\n\nDon't be fooled - there are funny prompts during the game that say "This is not a stealth game - kill everything."  But if you run in guns a'blazing John McClane style, you're toast - this IS a stealth game with puzzle gameplay, more than anything else, if you want to not only succeed during the levels, but also complete all the pass/fail objectives.\n\nI do recommend this game quite a bit, it's a lot of fun and even with the INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING cheap kills, I find myself coming back - and for someone with a HumbleHoarded Steam gamelist of 500+, that's saying something.  It's tight, mostly responsive, has a great theme and feel and succeeds as a hybrid action/stealth/puzzle game.","May 8","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In-game, each time you bump and enemy or kill them you get a few points, which you can then use on your perk abilities you have at the moment. Fun concept and can be quite fun in places.\n\nHowever, not only does it crash relatively often, always erasing your progress within the level (on a Mac if that makes a difference), there are a few other very frustrating aspects of the game. Too often you find yourself in a wide open space surrounded by an unreasonable amount of baddies, and I find a few levels to be maddeningly difficult. And that's a bug, not a feature. It's this failure to actually create a pleasing game that puts me right on the fence of a thumbs up or a thumbs down. RONIN deserves its mixed review due to crashing and levels that, while cool, were not quite thought out/played enough, and it constantly drives me away from the game to go play something else more reasonable.\n\nThe soundtrack is generally enjoyable.","May 7","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the turn-based combat. It gives you time to plan your strategy but still feels action-packed and fluent.\n\nI find it quite difficult: You have to take on your opponents while making sure that you are not in line of fire of another and noboy calls for alarm. It looks so simple but requires some strategy. When everything works out as planned you feel quite good. Sometimes it can also be frustrating :)\n\nWhen you complete a mission killing every opponent and without killing innocents or causing alarm, you can level up your skills. This makes you replay harder levels where you didn't fulfill those criteria once you got more skills unlocked.\n\nThumbs up!","May 8","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I know that i haven't made much of progress in the game so if anyone who reads this review tell me if there's anything happens in the story.\n\nPresentation: It good but not amazing, I like the dark cyberpuck feel of the game, I esspecially loved the design of those futuristic Samurai enemies you fight in the game. Though the building are quite lackluster and too similar to one another and the blood often spread too thin when stabbing people making look less guresome than it should be. the music is ok, it sort-off fit the gameplay if it wasn't for the odd voices singing in the soundtrack but to me, it's really forgettable.\n\nGameplay: RONIN is like a said before a turnbased action game in a level design very similar to Gunpoint. You move in real-time with the WASD keys and use the mouse to aim and launch our mysterious ninja into windows, hung on walls and  survive mass falls just like our favouite spy-for-hire in Gunpoint. but what makes it unique from Gunpoint is when an enemy spotted you the game ssitch from real-time to turn based with youre only control is the mouse to stratigically fight agianist muliple enemies in a room. let's remember that you can only take one hit so it's important so don't go in ramboing all over the place.\nYou know I sound quite negitive so far to the game and it's because that I would have been whistling a different tune if it's wasn't for the  probelsm in the gameplay . The controls while simple can have annoying problems sometimes. what i mean is that MANY times during the game the mouse can suddenly change to feel as if it was inverted and you have to waste seconds to go to where you want to leap from WITH NO REASON. If it was a bug I'm experiencing, then why it wasn't fix the game was released in May 2015 and i bought this game in the same month 2016!!!\n\nBut let's get into the meat of what the BIGGEST problem in the game and that is that this game is FUSTRATING. No not difficult or challenging but really fustrating. Why? Well it is that since that every shot from the laser-pointed guns and one stab of the cyber-samurai's katanas will kill you, you will be doing what i call this stratagy dodge the bullet/ blade minigame as every-time you try to to kill an enemy, there will be 13 other enemies aiming their weapons at you and you'll know that you can't kill the enemy and survive an this keep going one for ever and eventually you are going to die and have to replay that section again. It so repetitive and lose the fun of being a crazy ninja and that's why i stop playing this game an hour in and request for a refund becuase I know that even i made though these sections of the game will be boring and in the end i perfer to have fun playing video games.\n\nI really don't recommend this game, for those who are still intrested in this game, I recommend by the demo as it has less enemy placement and good level design so you'll have more fun playing the game rather than buying and playing the full game.","May 11","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? Because alot of people just could not grasp the concept.\n\nRONIN is an interesting blend of platforming, stealth, turn based-strategy and action game unlike anything you have played specifically, but reminscent of many games you have. All of it comes together nicely with a simple yet effective art style, music and level design. The story has a thin narrative but it does the job well enough establishing a cyber-punk samurai tale of revenge.\n\nThe controls (I used Mouse+Keyboard) were responsive and tightly tuned and they really let me sink my teeth into the finer nuances of combat such as letting bullets graze me and threading those jumps.\n\nThe game poses a moderate challenge even for a veteran gamer as it is not a simple hack+slash stealth game, but actually requires you to think ahead and attack at the right time or even the right angle. The learning curve is real and you will die until you ~GET GUD~ but not as much as these negative reviews would have you believe.\n\nThe players have all the advantages in the wonderful combat of RONIN, they only need use them!\n\nHighly recommended","May 11","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is really good I had a blast the whole time if you clear the room just fine you get a really satisfying feeling. On the other hand it definietly needs some work not much though.\nFirst the jumping from platforms down is kinda buggy sometimes when you want to jump you just get a little hop and bullet through your head. Overall platforms are really hard to get onto while in the "Turn-mode" (thinking Wisegal lvl2). Im not sure whether it was intention but a lot of times you need to avoid the "Turn-mode" as much as possible just to get easy kills and than just finish the last 3 guys in turns.\nAlso having arrows pointing in the way the bullet is being shot at instead of just straight line would be really helpful. Diferenciating from "Machinegun man" shot, Samurai jump and normal agent shot would be also good meaning in the color of the line for example.\nTo summarize I would say Great game but work needs to be done in "Turn-mode" execution and platforms.","May 8","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Essentially, you're supposed to kill every single combatant in pause-based combat while avoiding detection by non-coms.\n\nIt *is* quite as interesting as it sounds, but also extremely frustrating at times due to a few design problems.\n\n1. During combat, you will occasionally end up in a position that affords no good jump trajectories (e.g., clinging to the side of the building you are assaulting). When this happens, you do not have the option to simply climb up and continue your attack, forcing you to make a bad jump.\n\n2. If you kill all nearby mooks, you snap out of combat mode even if you are in view of a farther away enemy. The moment or two you need to realize you're no longer in pause mode but are in real-time mode can cost you a perfect win.\n\n3. The single-auto-save system doesn't always work well. It sometimes saves at an inconvenient time (e.g., after a civilian has spotted you), causing you to have to replay the entire level.\n\nThese three problems may not seem so bad, but I promise you they will cause you to hate the game from time to time.

Absolutely fantastic concept, really poor execution.\n\nI started off with no knowledge of the controls, and was thoroughly confused when attempting to do basic movement. I am told that others got a prompt with controls, but I somehow skipped it unknowingly.\nNext, I find the escape menu that tells you some challenges. No alarms, kill all enemies, kill no civilians. Right then. I immediately find an inaccessible enemy, and, assuming I want to complete the challenge, get frustrated as I see no way to access this enemy. He doesn't count apparently.\n\nNext, the movement system sucks. It never feels like the character is doing what I actually want it to. Even when out of combat and just using WASD, the main character just doesn't feel good to control. Would it kill you to put in a "jump" button? Maybe I don't want to do a time-stopping leap across the room. I just wanna jump a few feet up.\n\nThe platforms are terrible. The actual platforms are mechanically obnoxious. You can't grab onto them, despite the game seemingly relying heavily on the wall latch system. In combat, you can't go up a wall, you are required to jump off. Can't reach that platform from the place you are at on the wall? Better try again. You won't reach the platform unless it shows the landing marker on the platform, despite how important it may be. I had a battle (right before quitting) that was just me jumping around a room for a while until I could get high enough to kill the enemies only slightly out of reach.\n\nFinally, combat. The second introduced enemy acts out of turn. Kill me immediately on his turn, fine, but I expect his turn to play before he slashes me. They don't even follow their own lines of action, which is the entire pillar of what the game relies on.\n\nAnd when I want to jump off of a platform, land on a marker behind an enemy, kicking him in the face, I expect to do exactly as the line of action tells me I'm going to do. I don't expect to jump two feet and get shot in the face, which is not what the game told me I would do.","May 16","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I know that i haven't made much of progress in the game so if anyone who reads this review tell me if there's anything happens in the story.\n\nPresentation: It good but not amazing, I like the dark cyberpuck feel of the game, I esspecially loved the design of those futuristic Samurai enemies you fight in the game. Though the building are quite lackluster and too similar to one another and the blood often spread too thin when stabbing people making look less guresome than it should be. the music is ok, it sort-off fit the gameplay if it wasn't for the odd voices singing in the soundtrack but to me, it's really forgettable.\n\nGameplay: RONIN is like a said before a turnbased action game in a level design very similar to Gunpoint. You move in real-time with the WASD keys and use the mouse to aim and launch our mysterious ninja into windows, hung on walls and  survive mass falls just like our favouite spy-for-hire in Gunpoint. but what makes it unique from Gunpoint is when an enemy spotted you the game ssitch from real-time to turn based with youre only control is the mouse to stratigically fight agianist muliple enemies in a room. let's remember that you can only take one hit so it's important so don't go in ramboing all over the place.\nYou know I sound quite negitive so far to the game and it's because that I would have been whistling a different tune if it's wasn't for the  probelsm in the gameplay . The controls while simple can have annoying problems sometimes. what i mean is that MANY times during the game the mouse can suddenly change to feel as if it was inverted and you have to waste seconds to go to where you want to leap from WITH NO REASON. If it was a bug I'm experiencing, then why it wasn't fix the game was released in May 2015 and i bought this game in the same month 2016!!!\n\nBut let's get into the meat of what the BIGGEST problem in the game and that is that this game is FUSTRATING. No not difficult or challenging but really fustrating. Why? Well it is that since that every shot from the laser-pointed guns and one stab of the cyber-samurai's katanas will kill you, you will be doing what i call this stratagy dodge the bullet/ blade minigame as every-time you try to to kill an enemy, there will be 13 other enemies aiming their weapons at you and you'll know that you can't kill the enemy and survive an this keep going one for ever and eventually you are going to die and have to replay that section again. It so repetitive and lose the fun of being a crazy ninja and that's why i stop playing this game an hour in and request for a refund becuase I know that even i made though these sections of the game will be boring and in the end i perfer to have fun playing video games.\n\nI really don't recommend this game, for those who are still intrested in this game, I recommend by the demo as it has less enemy placement and good level design so you'll have more fun playing the game rather than buying and playing the full game.","May 11","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the last mission, you HAVE to understand how to play to get the good ending, new game plus is, you gotta understand how to use your abilitites to the best of your powers. Good graphics, good audio, good design, somewhat glitchy (when the jumparc says youre going down a floor but you shimmy slightly in a direction).

When the character is undiscovered by the enemies the game plays like a platformer, when the guards find out where you are the turn based combat phase starts. The enemies start to shoot at the player and/or call for reinforcement. The combat is based around carefully planned jumps and the use of the ninja abilities unlocked completing the missions. The game can be really hard until you understand how to stealthy pick off the guards without getting discovered by the remaining enemies. Many of the most difficult scenarios can be easily resolved if you manage to thin down the number of the guards, especially the heavily armed ones. Still sometimes not getting shot is a matter of luck, especially in the new game plus where the assault rifle guard becomes much more powerful. I have enjoyed this game very much since it's pretty unique but I understand that the gameplay may not appeal to everyone. Think about buying Ronin if you are not scared of a game that may require many tries before you can finally pass a difficult section.","May 20","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely fantastic concept, really poor execution.\n\nI started off with no knowledge of the controls, and was thoroughly confused when attempting to do basic movement. I am told that others got a prompt with controls, but I somehow skipped it unknowingly.\nNext, I find the escape menu that tells you some challenges. No alarms, kill all enemies, kill no civilians. Right then. I immediately find an inaccessible enemy, and, assuming I want to complete the challenge, get frustrated as I see no way to access this enemy. He doesn't count apparently.\n\nNext, the movement system sucks. It never feels like the character is doing what I actually want it to. Even when out of combat and just using WASD, the main character just doesn't feel good to control. Would it kill you to put in a "jump" button? Maybe I don't want to do a time-stopping leap across the room. I just wanna jump a few feet up.\n\nThe platforms are terrible. The actual platforms are mechanically obnoxious. You can't grab onto them, despite the game seemingly relying heavily on the wall latch system. In combat, you can't go up a wall, you are required to jump off. Can't reach that platform from the place you are at on the wall? Better try again. You won't reach the platform unless it shows the landing marker on the platform, despite how important it may be. I had a battle (right before quitting) that was just me jumping around a room for a while until I could get high enough to kill the enemies only slightly out of reach.\n\nFinally, combat. The second introduced enemy acts out of turn. Kill me immediately on his turn, fine, but I expect his turn to play before he slashes me. They don't even follow their own lines of action, which is the entire pillar of what the game relies on.\n\nAnd when I want to jump off of a platform, land on a marker behind an enemy, kicking him in the face, I expect to do exactly as the line of action tells me I'm going to do. I don't expect to jump two feet and get shot in the face, which is not what the game told me I would do.","May 16","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was a blast all the way through. I've died countless times playing it, but the beauty was that it takes a lot of thought and strategy. Once you figure out a strategy it becomes a game of cat and mouse. It's turn based once you get into combat, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I gives you time to think about your next move. When you finally do make those correct choices, it becomes so satisfying that you want more.\n\nIf you're into thinking, action, and want something a little different. I'd definitely give this one a go.","May 23","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I decided to try it out, and was surprised how amazing it was. It has an overall similarity with Mark of the Ninja, but more non-stealth and one-shot-death, like Hotline Miami, both games that I am very fond of. The story is pretty solid, and the gameplay is challenging, but not unnecessary forced difficult. And the change of death-gameplay in the last level made me like it even more. There are of cause bugs and small quirks, that can be a tiny bit frustrating, but nothing that makes the game unplayable. And the New Game Plus mode. Don't get me started! Besides starting of with all of your strong abilities and your experience from the basic game, the challenge of the enemies moving their aim instead of just shooting at where you were.\n\nAdvantages:\n-Neat story\n-Fun and challenging gameplay\n-Nice Original Soundtrack\n-Fun level design\n-Simple, yet functioning skill tree\n-Good series potential (Gameplay, not story)\n\nDisadvantages:\n-Can get a bit difficult\n-Elevators are INFINITELY slow\n-Way too short!\n-Bug with enemies getting stuck in walls, making them unkillable and prompting them to sound the alarm (Very frustrating)\n-Closed ending, no plot for sequel\n\nSo to sum up:\nGreat game, would probably buy it for full price. Few bugs, nothing to worry about. 9.5/10","May 24","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LUCKY5HOT/recommended/274230/","LUCKY5HOT","luckyshot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LUCKY5HOT/","532 products in account","Ronin is a really interesting concept which takes familiar elements from other popular indie titles and tries to create something new and compelling, but ulitimately it fails to deliver due to frustrating controls and unintuitive behavior.  Ronin behaves like a typical 2d platformer where the player can freely run, jump and climb around the environment, but when the player is spotted by a guard the games shifts to a turn-based system where the player selects an action (jump, attack or special ability) at the same time as the AI. Many people will compare this game with Gunpoint as the games have similar aesthetics and somewhat similar movement system, but while Gunpoint is more of a puzzle game focused on manipulating the environment, Ronin is all about the combat. Ronin still feels like a puzzle as you try to trace a path through the enemy gunfire and pick off your opponents one by one, but feels very different in the heat of the moment. When you are dodging through the environment executing guards using the perfect ability for the situation you feel like a god, however due to the controls often you will find yourself stumbling directly into what should be easily avoidable gunfire. Many times the difference between success and failure feels like a mere pixel. Thankfully most of the levels have checkpoints centered around the main set pieces of each level, but there was an instance in a later level where the checkpoint was saved as a guard discovered me, removing any advantage of surprise I could leverage. I ended up quiting the game during the final level which removed all checkpoints and just watched the ending on Youtube. Overall I really enjoyed some moments of the game, but the moments of frustration were too frequent to recommend this game. If you are looking for a similar experience I would highly recommend both Gunpoint and Mark of the Ninja as similar titles with much better controls and a better overall experience.","June 4","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
