"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaded_platypus/recommended/9050/","jaded_platypus","Daedalus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaded_platypus/","235 products in account","In 2004, when Doom 3 was released, it was a glimpse into the future. The game represented a huge leap in visual fidelity and even manages to hold up well today, over a decade later. Furthermore, the sound design is unsurpassed and really immerses the player in the experience. The environmental storytelling with audio logs and emails was way ahead of its time and would be replicated in future blockbusters such as Bioshock. It is a true testament to how ahead of its time this game was in 2004 that it holds up so well today.\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing this version of Doom 3 over the BFG edition. First and foremost, the game was originally designed to have the player balance his use of flashlight and weapons. The BFG edition removes this gameplay element by allowing the player to use the flashlight and any weapon at the same time, removing some challenge from the game. The visual updates to the BFG edition are not substantial, search out comparison videos on YouTube for confirmation. This version will run perfect in 16:9 widescreen despite not having any 16:9 resolution options in the menu (requires modifying a .txt file).\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game again (last time I played was 2004). Campaign took me 11.2 hours on medium difficulty without rushing through. The campaign is much longer than many contemporary AAA FPS games. This game has held up incredibly well and is still excellent in 2015. Highly recommended for any FPS fans.","June 18, 2015","true","11.2"," 126 of 139 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","126","139","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shamanlord/recommended/9050/","Shamanlord","Pickles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shamanlord/","313 products in account","I'm going to give Doom 3 an actual recommendation because I really think it is one of the more underrated games. Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the "explore the floor" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the "spooks" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like "monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game". While there are a few "jump" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.","November 26, 2013","true","1.6"," 105 of 117 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","105","117","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/9050/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Doom 3 is a game that is very overlooked. It was Id's flagship title and features a very powerful game engine. It contained enhancements such as dynamic lighting, physics, bump mapping, portal technology among many other things we now take for granted. This was all months prior to Half Life 2 wowing us for the same thing.\n\nDoom 3 is essentially a remake or reboot of the series. It shares virtually the same premise as the original Doom, except set on Mars instead of it's moons. In a way this sort of gives the game it's own style but makes it feel less original. The aesthetic of the game was nailed very well, however the levels do get very samey after a while. For the vast majority of the game you're mostly running through maze-like corridors looking for ways to open doors. This was the first game I remember where I started to notice maze-like level design felt antiquated. I always kind of wished this game was more open and less claustraphobic.\n\nThe game is still a horror game so they introduced dark environments with enemies shuffling around them. It also took a very bold risk where the player's flashlight is a separate weapon you equip. I personally like this mechanic but a lot of people, especially at the time hated it. And it was a frequent source of ridicule for the game.\n\nThe gunplay in Doom 3 is something I never particularly liked, especially compared to it's successor Quake 4. The pistol is a joke that is never used after you get the shotgun, the shotgun is what you use for 70% of the game, the machine gun's firing sound effect makes it sound like a cap gun, the chaingun is very slow and cumbersome, the rocket launcher is extremely cool but only used on bigger enemies, and the plasma gun feels too slow to be useful. This was all corrected with very fantastic modifications but at the time I can understand why people didn't like it.\n\nIn a way that's why I recommend this game. The engine Doom 3 used allowed it to be very heavily modified. There are a great deal of very good total conversion mods for the game, and it allowed Doom 3 to live on in our collective consciousness despite the game being only "okay". I do recommend the game for it's modifications more than anything else since that is what this game is most remembered for.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552871766","November 11, 2015","true","5.4"," 71 of 88 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","71","88","5","11"

Even though it's the same story as before, it is expanded on here: there is a whole deep narrative and sci-fi lore that is both mysterious, and exciting, without really getting in the way of the gameplay.\n\nThe voice acting, while ham-fisted, is awesome,\n\nThe Writing is great, as it was written the author Matthew J. Costello, and the story feels like something out of a science fiction epic, like Dune and Star Trek.\n\nThe ambiet noise & atmousphere?\nI know there are a LOT of games with good ambiet noise, but\nD00M 3 WINS HANDS DOWN, BEST AMBIET NOISE IN ANY VIDEOGAME MADE OR GOING TO BE MADE EVER.\nThere are so manny sounds atop of sounds atop of sounds underneith sounds ATOP OF SOUNDS, some you don't even hear; they're just THERE.  This extends to the Music.  Now it may look like there are only a few songs, but what you don't realise is that the ENVIRONMENT tells the music. You can hear the oxygen cycle and refreash the room you are in, and the chiming and grunting of machinery can make for some really interesting and creative music and sound.  It's the kind of stuff that you just don't see in videogames anymore.\n\nThe horror? Well, it may be cheezy, unoriginal, & full of jump-scares (Not jump-shocks or slender BS), but it feels VERY original for the time and since Doom was scary back in the day, you can't really critique this game for trying.\n\nThe opening is well paced, and it set's the mood for the game quite well. Even though Half-Life did it first, D00M 3 does an EXCELLENT job of it too, and sets you up for the odyssey ahead\n\nThe enemy designs are awesome: All (well, 85%) of the original monsters are back, with a few new ones (Those Zombie Commandos)\n\nD00M 3 also has a HUUUUUUUUUUGE campaign length. Beating it would take roughly 12-17 hours to complete. What was that Killzone Shadow fall? only a 4 hour campaign??\n\nThe Weapons are ALL the same from Doom 1 & 2 (abiet updated ones), but you get a Machine gun to use (A good mid-range weapon), Grenades (Bouncy-Bouncy-Bouncy: hard to control but effective) & a Flashlight (Oh yeah...)\n\nThe game is VERY dark. That's one of it's selling points & why you should get D00M 3 & not the BFG edition: It's much more darker, & you can hold EITHER a flashlight or a gun. It might come off as annoying at first, but it sinks in, & it adds to the scare factor.\n\nKeep in mind this is a VERY different DooM game, up to the point where people question if it is a DooM game at ALL.\n\n\nBut whatever you may think about D00M 3, it sold more than 5.3 million copies, making it the most successful game by it's developer id Software to date.\n\nI VERY HIGHLY recommend D00M 3 to anyone who likes FPS, anyone who likes Horror-survival, & pretty much to anyone who loves video games in general.\nThis is a MUST PLAY\n5/5\n\n\n\n\nEditors Note: If you are going to play it, I highly recommend getting the Absolute HD mod for free off of Mod DB when playing this game: it makes it look a bit better, & it allows for modern resolutions without having to use the console commands.","September 27, 2014","true","97.6"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","41","44","2","2"

Doom 3 is scary, fast paced and frantic, and I highly recommend it.\nThis game is a first person shooter that has the player taking control of a Marine on Mars, who is forced to confront demons from Hell itself as they launch the space station on Mars into complete chaos; the story does not get much more complex and this, but hey, this is a Doom game, and I've never played the Doom series for story.\nThe game plays like many other games of the genre, with the player using guns to survive through each level; a simple premise, but effective, and shooting is well crafted here, considering this is what the Doom series is known for. All of the guns handle well and each kill feels satisfying and earned, and each fight will leave you feeling oddly relieved.\nThe atmosphere and sound design in this game is also quite good. Rather than hammering the player with an over the top musical score, this game prefers to use ambience to set the tone; creaks and groans of a decaying space station is far more effective at keeping the player on the edge of their seat. I found the dark environments great, as they left me in confusion as to where the next enemy would appear.\nMy only complaint would be that this game is rather short, and the multiplayer is non-existent nowadays. These are small complaints in comparison to the immeasurable quality of gaming that Doom 3 provides, and I recommend it highly to both novices and veterans of the first person shooter scene. 9 / 10","January 23, 2014","true","10.1"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

It was like some kind of alien video game from the future, that somehow accidently came out in 2004. I was convinced that John Carmack was some kind of space wizard. And it still looks great, today! The idTech4 lighting and the cool industrial "pipes everywhere!" design go hand-in-hand with each other, and it makes DOOM 3 feel visually timeless.\nAnd DOOM 3 doesn't just look good; the sound design is amazing, too. Everything from the environmental ambiance sounds, to the sound effects, sounds incredible coming out of my big fat speakers. The game even has Bioshock-levels of world-building, to make the Mars facilities feel like real environments, with amazing attention to detail.\n\nSo it's a pretty game. But hot damn, is it great to play as well! I'd call it an 'old-school shooter with modern sensibilities', as it takes a lot of the level and combat mechanics of the previous DOOM games, and puts them in a tighter, more realistic and grounded setting. The combat flows really well, revolving around quickly dispatching enemies that spawn all around you, with a variety of weapons, while sprinting around them and ducking out the way of their projectiles. It feels very satisfying, and the weapons are great too, if only lacking a bit in variety. They're mostly all just the same projectile weapon, with slightly different properties, so most of them end up serving the same function. But they feel good to use, and you also get a chainsaw, so really that makes up for everything. And you also have the flashlight, which frequently has you juggling between visibility in the pitch-black environments, and being able to defend yourself when enemies start spawning in, and you have to switch to weapons, and rely on the light of incoming projectiles to guide yourself through the combat. It's great!\n\nIf you have an obsessive and excessive love of deep-space sci-fi and first person shooters, like I do, then I could not recommend DOOM 3 more than I do. It's a good game.

The co-op mod can be a little unpolished at times but the enjoyment helds smooth over any rough patches.","July 29, 2013","true","14.2"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/recommended/9050/","varanisridari","Varanis Blackclaw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varanisridari/","74 products in account","The forefather of first person shooters as we know it saw reinvention and rebirth some 11 years after it first revolutionized (if not invented) the genre of FPS. What Id Software brought to the table was a game-changing new graphics engine that pushed real-time lighting and 3D-relief "bump mapped" textures to polygon graphics; ultimately this game made startlingly real environments to serve as the Martian horrorhouse that became the setting of what was to be not a true sequel, but a reboot of the series.\n\nDoom 3 came across as a more cinematic and survival horror-themed take on the tale of one lone soldier's struggle to contain the hordes of Hell after a science experiment let them out across an isolated research station on Mars. They vied to reach Earth where they could take a more permanent hold on the mortal realm, but with an almost academic arsenal of firepower and a few tricks, the player must drive them back, eventually entering Hell itself to seal the hole created in reality from the other side.\n\nOpen environments with color-coded locked doors and a maze-like construction gave way to linear progression through a much darker and more claustrophic base. The backtracking of the original games was replaced with a series of "boo" moments as demons jumped from every vent, doorway, and even materialize around, behind, or sometimes right on top of the player. Suspense and hair-trigger gameplay replace the circle-strafing constant-action of the originals, while a much stronger focus on story, both told in cinematics and collectable audio logs, certainly made this modern iteration of Doom more of an interactive thrill ride than before.\n\nThe sheer darkness of the game can be overcome with a little bit of config file tweaking, as can the game's orignial 4:3 aspect ratio, field of view, and resolution options (make sure to set the config file as read-only after modding or it will revert), but players of more recent shooters will cry at this game's lack of weapon shouldering or even any kind of appreciable zoom aiming. The "monster closets" get a bit old after a few hours in, and the scare factor is thus reduced, but the game's atmosphere is the stuff of legend, especially in the way it makes players choose between wielding their flashlight and seeing what's hiding in every blackened corner, or firing at those glowing eyes in the darkness and hoping whatever it is doesn't eat you.\n\nThe "BFG Edition" of this game released almost  8 years after the original adds a new episode consisting of recently-finished levels cut from the original game, but otherwise removes some of the more suspensful encounters, plus ups the enemy count, reduces their health, and increases ammo in order to make a more action-heavy shooter. These things diminish the horror feel, especially in the way the game mounts the flashlight onto the armor, so players can shoot and see in the dark simultaneously, but this I feel takes away from what the game was all about: fear of the unknown. Plus "BFG Edition" also presets the widescreen mode and higher resolutions by default, which is handy, but increases gamma and brightness to higher levels by default, and even pumps up the lighting itself in game, further eroding the horror feel. Finally, some of the original game's shadow rendering were replaced with softer techniques, which is a bummer.\n\nI get what Id Software was trying to do here with the BFG edition, but it didn't really need to be done. If the idea of optional motion blur, higher frame rate caps (120fps max),  or perhaps a bit more saturated color palette borrowed from the more-recent Rage engine, with -some- cleaned up textures sounds good to you, then maybe the BFG Edition is worth checking out. Otherwise, the original game holds up enough over time to still be a great suspenseful take on the 90's classic.","April 17","true","29.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

I mean that in a good and bad way. It's scary, yes, but it also has these horrible twisting and looping maps that are so dark it's impossible to get through. Also when you first start the game, the weapons you have make pitiful attempts to injure some of the stronger enemies like Imps, though it gets better once you find more powerful weapons.\n\nNow the good things.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original DOOM games, than YES BUY THIS! It's really fun for a DOOM fan to experience. It's awesome seeing the old pixelated monsters come to life in this game. Also, this game is truly terrifying. The darkness, and the constant demonic noises coming from your intercom make you barely have the courage to walk through the game. Overall, as a DOOM fan, I've enjoyed it. If you're new to the DOOM series, then go with the old ones, and see if you want to carry on with the epic saga of violence.","April 22, 2014","true","3.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

It's a good reboot of the original DOOM from 1993. You will recognize all the enemies from the original game. I played it in it's vanilla form and still after all these years, DOOM 3 surprised me with it's graphics. DOOM 3 is really the best looking game from 2004, it looks still today really good, even vanilla. Yeah, on some textures you can see, that it is a 2004 game, but with mods you can improve everything.\n\nThe sound is really nice. Exactly what you should expect from such a horror game. The menu theme is rocky and badass. I like that.\n\nI Finished the game after 20 hours of gameplay. A steam friend said to me, he played almost 12 hours, so I was maybe to busy with exploring the world and reading the PDAs? Anyway, it was fun. Some visual changes would be nice, but what do you expect from a base on mars? Of course its dark and alone there.\n\nI enjoyed this version a lot. I bought the BFG edition only for "The Lost Missions" and the "DOOM II: No Rest for the Living". The BFG edition would destroy some horror moments, when you are able to wear the flashlight and your weapon at the same time.\n\nI look forward to continue playing DOOM 3 with mods.","February 12","true","20.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

A lot of people are complaining about original, because it's too much darker or screen resolutions problem, learn to open settings and set your screen size, BFG dummies. DOOM 3 is very good game, it's designed to be a dark horror survival game,but BFG maked more lighter which is just not fun to be scared. BFG Edition is just full of bugs and it has Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 which are in another words broken games. BFG versions of Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 are just f*****g c**p. Why? Because they censored red crosses of health packs with pills and removed in Doom 2 two Wolfenstein levels: WW2 Nazi soldiers, flags, Hitler portraits,etc. and it reminds like non textured level from Bubsy 3D. When I played Doom 3 BFG Edition at my friend's house, I thought is this another beta versions of all Doom games?! If you wanna get all DOOM games, buy classic complete and Doom 3 pack and stay the F**K out of the BFG Edition. BTW, DOOM 3 BFG EDITION HOW I PLAYED IT I THINK IT IS ONLY FOR GERMANS ( I'm, not against Germans, btw), glitchy and non-scary and censored, because it's designed for them.

But that doesn't at all mean it's a bad game, persay. Some may lambast it for being different, but it's no DNF for sure.\n\nFor one thing, DOOM 3's gameplay takes a slower pace than the last two games in the series and benefits greatly from this change. No longer are you speeding through levels, never taking one look backwards at the scene. Instead, the game builds up it's mood to supplement it's slower action.\n\nWeapons mostly share the same functions as the old set from the originals and mostly feel like the original weapons in terms of gunplay. However, it adds a new variable in late game that rewards players for sustained killstreaks. However, the rocket launcher lose it's secondary utility in the closed-off levels.\n\nNow, the enemy AI seems rather one-note. Basic zombies merely walk at a snail's pace towards the player, making it incredibly easy to pick them off at range. Imps merely run after the player, throwing homing fireballs all the while in combination with melee attacks.\n\nBut the Z-Sec and the Commando shows that their AI at least has some competency in it's making, if they're not very advanced. They make use of cover, strafe around and make ample use of manuevers in their combat. If I could make a comparison, they fight like the HECU from the original Half Life.\n\n","November 15, 2014","true","8.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Why has it taken me this long to play through it? Probably two things, distractions from other games and the repetition that Doom 3 has.\n\nDoom 3 was made by id Software back in 2004 and it's sort of like a reboot to the original in a way since it doesn't follow the past two games. Just think of it like The Legend of Zelda as you can jump into any game at any time. No need to know any important storyline, not like there is much of a story. Doom 3 is about a scientist in Mars who has gone mad and opens a portal to hell killing nearly everbody thus you're the last marine who must stop the demons invading using the only skill you have. Starting a genicide on anything that the Pope does not approve of. There are some basic characters, cutscenes, even audiologs and emails to read which a lot of the time it's not all that interesting and the only reason to read and listen to said audiologs and emails is to get codes for supply caches.\n\nWeapons are good but not great. You have a decent variety of weapons like the shotgun, SMG and rocket launcher. I enjoyed using the Plasma Gun and the BFG was fun the three times I ever got to use it. Enemies are diverse but are hit or miss. I hate the spider ones because who enjoys shooting a bunch of #!$@ing spiders in every game ever? Also some enemies leap at you as soon as you enter a room which is both unfair and gets annoying real quick. I also found it really weird how sometimes I can shoot an Imp with the shotgun in point blank range and it'll die but the same thing happens again and it takes two hits. I could be wrong but there is something very off about it, possible poor hit detection.\n\nLevel design is okay at first, it's really creepy and some noises of screams and creaks tend to unsettle me but sooner or later it's just a matter of entering a room, demons spawning and you gotta shoot them all. It becomes dull, predictable and annoying and some areas are really cramped so dodging an Imp fireball can be at times impossible which makes it again unfair. I found that after I entered and left Hell I got real sick of it and I consider the rest of the game (2-4 hours) to just be padding it out. It really angered me when all I just wanted to do was move forward but a door says I don't have clearence and I need to find a keycard for it. It's not that the environment changes much either. For 80% of the game you'll be in a dark corridor of some kind of science facility and it leaves me wanting a bit more variation.\n\nI think this game has a lot of smaller problems rather than a couple of really big problems. It only shows the longer you play it. You can tell that Doom 3 was influenced by Half Life which is ironic considering Half Life was initially inspired by Doom. I don't think it's a bad game by any means, it's actually an alright game to play through but this wouldn't really be a top recommendation of mine. I'd go with something like Half Life or Bioshock first but that's just my personal tastes. If you're interested then it's worth a go and it goes on sale for very low often. I give it a 6/10.","May 6","true","17.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"

Yes my characters name is janitor becouse you'll spend more time with the flashligth than with your weapon drawn. anyway the game really loves ketchup, seriously there's ketchup were ever you go. On the walls, floor computers and even on the roof. you can still find some survivors who give's you their PDA (like a ipad) where they tells you (or whoever is listening) how they ♥♥♥♥ed up. you can also find PDA form dead person's that can contain a Security acces or a password for a locker with ammo, health and stuff of that kind.

All weapons are powerful (not counting the pistol ofcourse) and play a different role in terms of combat, so you can use just the plasma gun but ammo will be scarce until later on in the game. The graphics certainly have aged since 2004 but thats not to say they are bad. The game looks fantastic without any HD mods and thats a minor complaint considering its 10 years old. The game is definitely creepy, while I personally was never scared to go into a dark hallway (mostly because I have such a devasting set of weapons to choose from) there are a lot of jump scares and a lot of random sounds that make the hair stand up on your neck. Not to mention the excellent sounds they used to amp the situation youre in.\n\nDid I mention you can tear into demon babies with a chainsaw? That right there should be enough!!

Rather than having fast-paced action found in the first two games, fighting dozens, and sometimes dozens UPON dozens of enemies in large rooms, DOOM 3 stands out as being more of a horror game.\n\nIn contrast to DOOM 1 and DOOM 2, DOOM 3 is slower-paced and linear, with generally less space to move around freely and spray bullets like a madman at your enemies. You'll usually fight enemies either one at a time, or in small groups. If you like being spooked and having more than 2 guns at once, then you'll probably have fun with this game.\n\nOh yeah, the story.

The gunplay is great and the story is far superior to what I was expecting.  Many of your favorite enemies and weapons return and I found myself hooked on this game from start to finish.  That was about sixteen hours for me - an impressive length for a FPS and even more impressive that it held my attention.\n\nSince Doom is Doom, I won't go into the specifics as we all probably have the general idea already, but I will say that this is a great game that has stood the test of time.  I started playing this over a decade after it came out and it did not disappoint.  The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected, and they are still good enough that I didn't feel that it detracted from the experience at all.

I do remember seeing my friend's older brother playing this game the night it came out over a decade ago, and man did it look great. The visuals were specacular, the setting and synopsis were intriguing, and the survival horror aspect of it captivated me. Doom 3 is a very slow paced shooter, and although you can sprint around and get into a few bigger firefights, you'll spend most of your time exploring confined areas and digging through PDAs and other interactables. In most other games I would find that to be a huge turn off, but the atmosphere building is this game wins me over every time. I just recently picked up the new Doom (2016) and have been enjoying the hell out of it (badumtiss) but for very different reasons. If you want to scratch your itch for a horror/story heavy game with less twitch shooting, this will do you well.

It was a re-boot to the 'DOOM' series, abandoning open environment for the traditional jump scares.\n\nPlotYou play as an unnammed marine who has been recently transfered to the Mars Space Station run by the UAC. As you can expect, things on mars aren't as they seem and soon demons take over the station. It is your job to send these freaks back to where they came from.\n\nGameplayMajority of the game is shooting and collecting items. You have a wide range of weapons including pistol, shotgun, machine gun, grenades, chainsaw, pulse rifle. If your feeling crazy, you can even use your fists. Levels are seperated via areas on the station, with each area reached by elevator or other transport. You have both health and armor which you can replenish via pick up items. Ammo can be found in the area or dropped from foes. You face a variety of foes such as zombies, security, skulls, imps, hell knight and other foes which take inspiration from previous entries. There are also boss battles which occur in later levels.\n\nAudioMusic is excellent at instilling the dark atmosphere. There isn't much background music during gameplay, which makes you focus on the various sounds such and creaks and footsteps nearby, keeping players feeling edgy and uncomfortable.\n\nConclusionIf you are looking for a good action horror game, Doom 3 will not dissapoint.","May 31, 2015","true","16.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, the environments are well detailed, even if it's much of the same. Also, the shadows are so heavy, I feel like theres a 50 pound weight on my head whenever I'm under a shadow. It's like those damn F.E.A.R./Condemned: Criminal Origins shadows, but even heavier.\n\nThere's a bunch of audio logs and PDAs you can shuffle throughout the game for some optional dialogue/text and whatnot, as well as some codes for unlocking lockers/rooms for equipment and items.\n\nCombat is pretty fun, shoot a zombie up close in the face with a shotgun, they hit the floor harder than a slab of meat made out of brick. A chainsaw with unlimited fuel to wreak havoc, up close and personal like. Rocket Launcher that make demons go boom, and an overly expensive experimental energy weapon, the BFG 9000 that wrecks rooms clean.\n\nIt's an immersive horror FPS with demons n' ♥♥♥♥ coming out the walls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfoxden/recommended/9050/","snowfoxden","Soot Leopard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowfoxden/","85 products in account","Despite its somewhat underwhelming reputation I couldn't love this game more.\nIts true the game has more than its fair share of dark spots, but, well... I call myself a cat I guess darkness is kinda my thing. :P  I actually really like the infamous flashlight mechanic, it adds tension and fear to environments that wouldn't be particularly scary -- and in the BFG edition where that mechanic is removed, they aren't.\nThe combat is fun and fast-paced, if a bit repetitive, but the variety with certain monsters like Arch-Viles takes some of the repetitiveness out of it once you get deep into the campaign.  The boss fights are really fun with unique mechanics except, somewhat, for the last one -- and they strike a good balance when it comes to difficulty: you'll finish them without much health left but you probably won't die so much it gets frustrating.  Hard mode is very fun as it's not about hiding or taking cover -- the way the monsters spawn you have to be pretty ferocious in order to survive.\nMap design is actually not too linear, which is a good thing to see in a game even as old as 2004... levels are maze-like without being confusing, and there's a decent variation in texture and structure schemes especially toward the end of the game -- although that part could still be improved somewhat.  Coming to this as I did about 8 years after it was released this type of level design was like a breath of fresh air.\nGraphics are still beautiful even 12 years later, the monsters and especially boss designs are grotesque and disturbing, they really feel like they could be demons out of some hell.\n\nThere are a few minor quibbles I have -- just a few straighforward ones, and one or two weird ones...\nIn a 27-level campaign, a lot of the monsters only appear for three or four levels or stop appearing altogether just after the mid-point.  This seems to especially happen to the most interesting designs like a literal baby insect, the (somewhat) classic lost soul, and the... Mancubus... thing...  Even the ubiquitous Pinky Demon from the original games kinda disappears after the fifteenth map or so.  There are plenty of other monsters that appear later on but it would have been nice to see some demons from the earlier maps stick around especially when enemy variety is one of the game's strong points.\nThe weapons tend to be kinda same-ish although there's still enough variety to go around and enough situations where you do want to switch from one to the other.  You do have a bloody chainsaw if you get bored and it works well on even some of the high-level monsters like Arch-Viles, but the weapons are still a weak point.  I find myself mostly using the shotgun even when another weapon would work just as well -- it seems even limiting the amount of shotgun ammo you can find or carry (there doesn't seem to be any maximum, or if there is it's so high I've never reached it) would have gone a long way towards resolving this.  Its ammo does get more scarce towards the end of the game but so does the ammo for everything else, leaving you in the same situation.\nFinally -- and this is the weird one -- some of the monster sounds are distorted samples taken from tiger calls.  I spend a decent amount of time around tigers and these calls are, quite clearly, "chuffs" (a kind of purr) and mating calls.  I guess Pinky's a succubus now? :P  It can get pretty hard to take a hellish monster seriously when it's literally purring at you.\nInterestingly enough, the gameplay isn't the only place you can find big cat sounds in this game...\n\nAll in all this is a great game, with a lot of custom content as well that I haven't gone into here just 'cuz I've already been talking long enough.  An underrated classic, I highly recommend giving it a look if all you've heard is its reputation for dark spaces and a weird flashlight.","February 22","true","123.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I foolishly put my trust in a treacherous fart every now and again. But this was complete Chocolate Chernobyl. I haven't done that since I was 25 or so when a bunch of bacon exploded while I was cooking. Luckily for my denim leggings of Levi, they weren't equipped at the moment. My +3 sword of bad ideas and sack of scratching though...\n\nAnyway, here are the pros and cons of this game:\n\nPros:\n\n1. AMAZING graphics for the age of this game. Mods out there still available to make them even better. JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! (Or your game will look like Doom on the SNES with a bad Game Genie code.)\n\n2. Great mesh of HOLY F****** S*** swarms and "didn't I just pee ten minutes ago?" suspense.\n\n3. Actually has a plot. Kind of. I dug it. If you don't like it then you're mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. Read the Doom books too. They're not terrible like everyone says in the reviews.\n\n4. Better than the BFG edition. You can actually find mods for this version. Play them both and you'll find more differences that favor this original version.\n\n5. Has an easy level that makes the game accessible to geezers like me.\n\n6. Has a hard level that will make your nephew realize he's not as f****** cool as he thinks he is just because I HAPPEN to allow him to use me as bait in FPS's. I could "pwn n00bs like a boss" if I wanted, I just choose to not hit anything I pretend to aim at on purpose.\n\n7. Great responsive and precise controls.\n\n8. Terrifies small children so they decide to go play with Rx rattles and hair driers in the bathtub instead of being up your a** all the time while you're trying to ignore them.\n\nCons:\n\n1. You cannot eat anything with dairy in it the entire day before playing.\n\n2. You will still poop at least a little bit.\n\n3. It's so immersive you may forget there are children and/or animals in the house until after the fact when the entire place is destroyed and you wonder just how in the h*** you didn't hear any of it. Because the big screen falling onto a glass table HAD to be loud. Maybe that explains that demon that came through the window behind you then vanished?\n\nI highly recommend this game!

It's the third game in a long line of games that helped revolutionize the FPS genre. It's also the game that came out around the same time as Half-Life 2, as well as deviating from the run and gun playstyle from the first two, instead opting for a more horror survival gameplay and making lighting a central theme around it as well, has it aged well?\n\nI'd say yes. I think the initial disappointment from a lot of fans came as a result of this game not being the same as the first two, and honestly, in my opinion, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. It's a slower paced game than its predecessors that's for sure, fleshing out its story and narrative through ingame cutscenes and chracter's PDA's, similar to what modern games nowadays are doing... think like BioShock. A lot of people also had complaints with the flashlight system, which is (imo) what lends to the tension you feel throughout the whole game. If you have issues with that however, there's mods, as well the BFG edition which remedies this (which also brightens up some textures from my understanding), but in my opinion that takes away from the atmosphere they were going for in this game. They consciously made the design choice of making you choose between having your gun out, or your flashlight out to scout the darkness, the light giving you a sense of comfort while also leaving you completely defenseless while doing so. Granted, there are some moments when certain enemies will cheaply spawn behind you, or in complete darkness.\n\nThe game is also a lot longer than I remember it being, its single player campaign clocking in at around 10-15 hours, depending on how you approach things, although to be fair, I think the game starts off kind of slow, easing the player into the narrative before all hell breaks loose. The latter half of the game being very action packed moreso than the beginning.  I think this game was ahead of its time, and I feel it's not as fondly remembered as HL2, but I still think it's a great experience, and one of the last Doom games to be developed by the original id team, before the license was shipped over to Bethesda, definitely an end of an era.\n\nClosing out, I have to say I played through it with a graphics mod, to bring the graphics up to date a bit, there's several of them out there but the one I installed was Doom 3 Redux, you can find it among others over on the moddb site.\n\nI highly recommend to fans of survival horrors, and first person shooters. One of the better titles that came out during that era. Would definitely suggest playing it with an HD texture pack as well, the game holds up suprisingly well when using them.","April 26","true","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

(Google is your friend in this regard.) If you do so, the Linux installation will be independent of Steam, although it will be dependent on the CD key which is also provided by Steam. (Which is why my time played appears much lower than it actually is.) So that's a thing.\n\nDoom 3 is an excellent FPS. It is a game where most weapons feel powerful and a little bit of tactical movement will go a long way. Here's what I mean by tactical movement: I see an imp, dodge its fireball, and immediately sprint up to it and give it a shotgun blast before it can retaliate. When a Revenant fires at me, I move backwards along a tight circular path to throw off the rocket's homing capability. Generally, dodge and counterattack will be a pretty common habit within this game.\n\nWhile the weapons are pretty standard, they do their job quite nicely. A rocket will send a ragdoll flying, the chaingun makes a thunderous hail of death, the plasma gun lays down a huge volume of fire (and can even block projectiles when used by a sufficiently skilled player), the chainsaw is so effective that it kills the atmosphere, and the BFG literally destroys everything in sight.\n\nExcept for lousy model quality, I think that this game is very nice looking and has aged rather well. This is one of its cardinal sins: if a game has great graphics but not a memorable story, it will be forever branded as a tech demo because you can't please everyone with just your gameplay.\n\nAs for story, the story is basic and somewhat cliche, but I do love the character of Dr. Betruger. But if you're a story freak and possibly a cynic in that regard, then you will have a bad time.\n\nAnd this game is long to the point of being a fault. It feels like it should be over at the end of the hell level, but it just keeps going. (Granted there are some fun encounters after that point.)\n\nBy the way, don't worry about the flashlight. People complain about how you have to choose between holding a gun or a flashlight, but the only enemies you will fight when you need the light are zombies, which won't be much of a problem, and imps, which obligingly light themselves up for your convenience.\n\nUltimitately, I can't tell you whether or not you will enjoy Doom 3, but I personally think that it is a high quality shooter and that at the very least you should pick it up on sale if you have any interest at all.","February 23, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltjgpliskin/recommended/9050/","ltjgpliskin","Bowie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltjgpliskin/","76 products in account","2004 was a big year for gaming. Metal Gear Solid 3 rocked the then-developing Stealth-Action genre, Ninja Gaiden rebooted the dormant NES franchise, Silent Hill 4 sent it's series down a long, dark path (and not in a good way), and we were met with numerous first person shooters: Halo 2, Far Cry, Painkiller, Half-Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, and this gem, Doom 3.\nPart of the reason why Doom 3 was such a big deal, was the fact that it was a huge departure from the traditional Doom formula. The first two Doom games were simple, straightforward shooters. Here are the bad guys, kill all of them, get to the end of the area. It was super fast-paced, and pumped full of adrenaline. There wasn't much of a story, besides a few walls of text between episodes or levels. Doom 3 had a slower, more sinister approach. The story is much more prominent, being written by Sci-Fi author Matthew Costello. Besides infrequent cutscenes, there are also audio logs, similar to System Shock 2, which help tell the lore of the game. The game is also more horror-focused than Doom 1 and 2.

If you like both, then you gonna have a good time.\n\nPlus you get a lot of mod support.\n\nThe game may be repetitive in the long term,  but you can always finish a level or two and stopping before coming back. I suggest you to try to finish any level without quicksaving to wreck your nerves :P\n\nIf you think a good FPS needs to have samey infantry enemies (guys with gun wich you kill with guns), dogs, and homogeneized gunplay where the SMGs, Assault Rifles, Carbines, and LMGs have magically the same balistic precision, don't get this game.

Metal Gear Solid 3 rocked the then-developing Stealth-Action genre, Ninja Gaiden rebooted the dormant NES franchise, Silent Hill 4 sent it's series down a long, dark path (and not in a good way), and we were met with numerous first person shooters: Halo 2, Far Cry, Painkiller, Half-Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, and this gem, Doom 3.\nPart of the reason why Doom 3 was such a big deal, was the fact that it was a huge departure from the traditional Doom formula. The first two Doom games were simple, straightforward shooters. Here are the bad guys, kill all of them, get to the end of the area. It was super fast-paced, and pumped full of adrenaline. There wasn't much of a story, besides a few walls of text between episodes or levels. Doom 3 had a slower, more sinister approach. The story is much more prominent, being written by Sci-Fi author Matthew Costello. Besides infrequent cutscenes, there are also audio logs, similar to System Shock 2, which help tell the lore of the game. The game is also more horror-focused than Doom 1 and 2. Back then, jump scares really weren't a thing.

So this begs the question of how doom-like this game really is.\n\nSimilarities:\n\nThere is a lot of satanic and gory imagery.\n\nThe weapons are the same with a small handful of new editions being: grenades and a machinegun.\n\nThe enemies are the same (though some enemies move quicker than the original counterparts and some move slower than the original counterparts, and some are a little weaker than before.) with a few new editions.\n\nThe enemies are very predictable and once you know how they function you can use that to your advantage to take them out with the right weapon for the situation and avoid taking damage just like the originals.\n\nThere are monster closets everywhere which open when you pick up a specific item and or walk past a specific point just like the originals.\n\nYou move level to level just like in the originals.\n\nThere are still key hunts and or the equivalent to key hunts.\n\nThere are moments where it’s so dark that you can barely see anything just like in the originals.\n\nThe game still has secrets and you can find some of the weapons earlier than you would usually find weapons just like in the originals and every old school shooter ever made.\n\nDifferences:\n\nHaving said that about darkness, doom 3 is very dark for most of the game, and you have to pull out a torch separately rather than having a torch tapped to a gun, this is one of the major criticisms of the game, I don’t have any issues with it, because it’s actually a lot better than the torch in the BFG edition where you can have a torch with another weapon however it’s too far to the left and it runs out of battery really quickly.\n\nYou move a lot slower to a more realistic jog and running with a stamina bar whereas in the originals you move at 60mph all of the time.\n\nThe enemy count is much sparser and the maximum amount of enemies you will usually have on screen at once is four to eight, whereas in doom 1 it was around fifth teen to twenty, and doom 2 it was around forty, though a lone enemy in doom 3 can be a lot more dangerous than a lone enemy in the originals.\n\nThe levels themselves are a lot narrower than before though there are still some open areas here and there.\n\nSometimes you might have an actual objective to complete and you sometimes come across NPCs and these sentry drones who fight alongside you.\n\nThey have tried to have an actual plot but thankfully it’s pretty avoidable and ignorable, and at the end of the day it’s pretty much the same thing as the original plot, and there’s also an emphasis on finding codes for doors and storage cabinets.\n\nThere is a focus on horror and some little scripted sequences but that thing is subjective from person to person.\n\nThe weapon viability has also been changed around: The fists are just as a very last resort as before however the berserk power up is so rare you only come across it twice, the chainsaw is exactly the same, the torch is good against the unarmed zombies, the pistol is a last resort however unlike the originals it has perfect accuracy, unlike the first game where the shotgun is the go to gun most of the time since it has ridiculously good range and accuracy for a shotgun, the shotgun in doom 3 is only good to use at short to close range due to the large amount of spread, and it has a lower rate of fire, this gun is good to use against the weaker enemies such as the first game. (People complain that the shotgun is really overpowered in doom 3 however it’s the same as the first game in the sense that all of the enemies that can die in one hit in doom 3 can die in one hit in the originals) The machinegun is good for the medium enemies at for when the enemies are at a longer range. The minigun is a heavy weapon this time around and it is good for the heavy enemies and just any enemies though I find myself using it on the heavy enemies when they are too close for the rocket launcher. The grenades are almost useless since they bounce around too much. The plasma guns role is unchanged from the originals. The rocket launcher is good for the heavier enemies and boss fights, and finally the BFG…sadly I only find myself using it twice which are for two different boss fights, whereas in the doom 2 it is very useful for taking out a group of enemies and enemies you want to kill as quickly as possible.\n\n\nIf there’s one problem with Doom 3 it’s that you can’t switch weapons when you reload, that doesn’t sound like much and it also happens in a few other games as well, but in this it means the difference between life and death because you’ll have three or four enemies rushing at you and there’s nothing you can do about it because you are stuck in a reload animation.\n\nDon't get the bfg edition, because it ruins a lot of things in the game: it's far too bright so it basically turns down the atmosphere, there is a crappy torch that you can now use and have a gun out at the same time but it is too far to the left and runs out of battery too quickly, and it's supposed to be a HD re-mastered version of the game and it doesn't look any different, and it is very dumbed down and made far too easy to the point where the explosive barrels do ♥♥♥♥ all, there are too much health and ammo pickups lying around, the enemies do far less damage, and in the expansion pack there's even one section that was removed from the game! (That being that large room with all of the pillars and enemies in hell) Be sure to get the original version.\n\nI love this game as much as the originals though doom 2 is my favourite, this is really one of those games where you have to try it for yourself because of how polarising it is.","September 21, 2014","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its atmosphere is quite like in the older games, but with the new flashlight thing going on. Some people didn't like this feature, but for me, it was a good way to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me back when I first played it. The graphics were awesome back then and I still think they're gorgeous even on today's standards. The sound effects could be a little more "brutal". For exemple, the monster noises/ roars didn't sound like something that came directly from a hell portal, as the imp and hell knight's roar on Doom. Also the weapons didn't pack the punch like the chaingun or the shotgun on the older games. The shotgun shot noises just sound like an toy gun. And the gameplay although it's meant to be arcade like its predecessors, sometimes its dull. There are certain parts where monsters spawn exactly on the same place and if you die, you can just memorize when it'll come out and before the monster appears, you can just start to shoot on the spot to easily kill the monster.\n\nAside from those little things, some small bugs and minor gameplay issues, I'd totally recommend it. Worth the time spent, I finished this game about 4-5 times or more. Also check for the hi-res modes on google, they're better than the BFG version.","May 16","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's not until about 3 or 4 hours into the game that this game becomes Doom. I bought this game cheap on sale and decided to give it another go since playing it for the first time on the original XBOX. The game makes you think that all you're going to get is a little action in between reading emails, listening to logs, waiting through cutscenes. Well I'm glad to say that you won't. Collect all the PDAs you can find and just scan the emails to see if you can get codes to the weapon lockers so you can stay well stocked on ammo. Other than that you can pretty much ignore everything else.\n\nBy the time you reach the end of this game you will know that you've played Doom. No, you don't flip a switch or collect a key to open up multiple closets full of enemies, but enemies do spawn all around you and will cut you down quickly if you don't dispatch them quick enough and strategize your reloads well.

There are pros and cons, however, to this game.  It seems that id tried harder to create a horror game than an action game.  The original Doom games were screens filled with enemies to take out with over the top action.  Here the action is still over the top, but you fight against a maximum of 5 creates at a time at the most, and not screens full of enemies.  This changes the pace of the game and lowers the bar for the action a bit.  Also, by trying to make it scary, the levels are very dark.  This is too bad because the graphics are beautiful, but hard to see when the lighting is so low.  I would say though that the graphics compared to Source didn't age as well when compared to today's graphic abilities.\n\nHowever, this is still Doom.  This is still a game of kill or be killed and you are still a bad ♥♥♥ with a gun.  All of the old guns come back from the previous games and they feel great.  The levels are corridor levels, and not open areas, but that helps with making this more of a horror game.  The sounds are good and the music is pretty much the same as quake with a heavy metal focus.\n\nDo I like this game better than I loved the original Doom, no.  But I can't not recommend this game, as the graphics and its brand name set a standard that all other games of the future look to copy or surpass.  id did not make the impact with Doom 3 as they did with the original Doom, but this is still worth your time playing.","October 3, 2015","true","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The graphics and attention to detail all look great and the level designs are a lot tighter and have the player traversing through a lot of hallways and corridors. The campaign is ~8-10 hours long so it's a lot longer than most campaigns. During the middle it becomes a little repetitive as you constantly have to find PDAs or some item before you can open a door but then near the end the game really kicks into another gear and ends on a high note. DOOM 3 is a solid FPS shooter that also may have the player jump out of the seat once or twice!","May 21","true","8.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I remember when this was released and I was in college. All of my friends and I were sharing benchmark results, upgrading computer systems just to get better performance. I was however too cheap with my purple MX440 but I was happy nonetheless. We competed to progress through the game and it was a fantastic time!\n\nFrom this point, computer game graphics have never really exceeded to amaze, and as the last major release I dedicated time to as a pre-graduate. The game brings together a fantastic new engine compiled by none other than John Carmack. The game demonstrates no unique story, no real plot.\n\nIt's a jump scare action shooter, it feels fantastic to shoot, and the game is quite fun and looks great still today. It shows a unique side than games today seem to show: satanic themes. As you progress through the game, you'll get more powerful weapons to face more powerful enemies which are reminiscent of Doom II's demons including the Imps, Pinkies, Archevilles, Mancubus and the rest of the gang. The game itself is traditional id software and there are still many of who love id software and you won't see me complain. Id were never great at story telling - it was all about fun and innovation which they've exceeded expectations due to Carmack's efforts.\n\nThe graphics were compared to the original Far Cry in its time and I could never understand how the two compared. Sure Far cry was innovative in its time, it was one of the first open world attempts and it was generally not recognised as a good game until years later in which I still don't find attractive...\n\nPlay this game and love it, but you won't need to play it more than once unless you're a fan such as myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/12356hjhk/recommended/9050/","12356hjhk","John Murdock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/12356hjhk/","334 products in account","This game, believe it or not, is a decade old.  Even with that considered, it still looks pretty decent to this day.  I highly recommend this game over the new BFG version for a number of reasons both subjective and objective.\n\nThe objective reason is obvious, that being that sikk mod (may be wrong spelling), along with the wolfsomething texture pack make it look even better than the BFG edition.\n\nThe rest is subjective.  I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.\n\nOverall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.\n\nBack to the game and less about tech history.\n\nThis game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!\n\nDespite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!\n\nAlso while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.\n\nMultiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.\n\n\n\n","April 6, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.\n\nOverall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.\n\nBack to the game and less about tech history.\n\nThis game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!\n\nDespite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!\n\nAlso while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.\n\nMultiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.\n\n\n\n","April 6, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doom 3 still is, but it is distinctly slower, putting more emphasis on atmosphere instead. The lighting engine was very advanced for the time and it really helps to set the mood when you see huge, menacing shadows fly by the walls cast by demons running through low angle lighting.\n\nThat said, the whole game is dark. You get a flashlight, but you have to choose between equipping it or wielding a weapon. That fact has garnered a lot of flak for the game, but I didn't mind it. Forcing you to hold your flashlight at the cost of disarming yourself made simply walking down a corridor feel intense.\n\nThe majority of the game takes place in a research facility on Mars, which grants a sense of isolation. You know that you and the few remaining personnel are on your own. Inside this facility, though are a bunch of tight corridors, and that's about it. Again, some people hate that, but to me claustrophobia is another plus factor to the atmosphere. The game is meant to be intense, even when nothing is going on, and the feeling of being trapped does just that.\n\nWith the exception of reloading, the gunplay feels classic. You have to put a bunch of rounds into the enemies to kill them, and some of the larger enemies will require multiple reloads with smaller weapons. Circle strafing is a must in larger areas, but you'll have to do a lot of popping in and out of cover or tactically charge or retreat in most cases. It has the same sort of feel as Doom, just a bit modernized (for 2004) and stylized.\n\nThe game has a few flaws, though, but they can mostly just be ignored. The AI is a little lackluster at times. There are small closet-sized rooms which serve simply to open silently behind you and release an enemy. The darkness might strain your eyes a bit, so playing for a couple hours might be a bit uncomfortable. To some, the gameplay might get repetitive. But for me, the strengths far outweighed these few weaknesses. This is definitely a recommend.","November 28, 2012","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember when this was released and I was in college. All of my friends and I were sharing benchmark results, upgrading computer systems just to get better performance. I was however too cheap with my purple MX440 but I was happy nonetheless. We competed to progress through the game and it was a fantastic time!\n\nFrom this point, computer game graphics have never really exceeded to amaze, and as the last major release I dedicated time to as a pre-graduate. The game brings together a fantastic new engine compiled by none other than John Carmack. The game demonstrates no unique story, no real plot.\n\nIt's a jump scare action shooter, it feels fantastic to shoot, and the game is quite fun and looks great still today. It shows a unique side than games today seem to show: satanic themes. As you progress through the game, you'll get more powerful weapons to face more powerful enemies which are reminiscent of Doom II's demons including the Imps, Pinkies, Archevilles, Mancubus and the rest of the gang. The game itself is traditional id software and there are still many of who love id software and you won't see me complain. Id were never great at story telling - it was all about fun and innovation which they've exceeded expectations due to Carmack's efforts.\n\nThe graphics were compared to the original Far Cry in its time and I could never understand how the two compared. Sure Far cry was innovative in its time, it was one of the first open world attempts and it was generally not recognised as a good game until years later in which I still don't find attractive...\n\nPlay this game and love it, but you won't need to play it more than once unless you're a fan such as myself. Great fun, good scares that get you jumping and great feeling shooting.","December 8, 2014","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first I was kinda excited as I hadn't really touched DOOM3 since I bought x amount of years ago. I was recommended to download and use the sikkmod, which I too would recommend. Provides some nicely updated graphics and options to play around with.\n\nFirst thing I will say about this game is that it's long. Certainly long for a FPS, even more so compared to modern standards. You'll easily be playing this game for 12+ hours, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on what you like from a FPS.\nI personally found it a little too long, and according to Steam it took me 19 hours to finish this... It's a very slow paced game, which is odd for a DOOM title. Some might like that, but if you've grown up with DOOM and even DOOM II then it's a strange experience. They could easily have dropped a level or two from the middle of the game, or even had more 'traditional DOOM' levels as replacements.\nHowever, the slow pace of the game is highlighted nicely by the lighting and the sound within the game. I know some people didn't like the torch/weapon swapping, but I found it increased the level of tension within the game (however I did find it led to an increased level of bordem at times). Yet, the cheap scares and the over use of the one scare tactic do become tiresome very quickly.\n\nOverall it was an OK experience, if a little too long and not as frantic as I expected. Graphics, lighting and atmosphere are still good today as they would have been back in 2004. So credit must go to ID for that. If you play this in bitesized chunks you'll probably avoid the feeling of the game dragging on.\nIf you see this cheap in the sales, have a good pair of headphones, and turn the lights off... you're in for a decent experience.\n","January 17, 2013","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9050/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Doom 3 is a long-awaited game of Doom franchise, a dark first-person shooter and sequel to icon of FPS games. It was developed and released by id Software in 2004, after few delays and annual showcases at E3, with one of those alpha versions of a game ending up leaked. It differs in that it takes more on slower survival horror side while still remaining an old-school shooter. Even if very slow one.\nIt also got remade/remastered as part of BFG Edition deal, where it was brightened up, eliminating darkness aspect of gameplay. If you are one of those people who agree with joke that to copy Doom 3 gameplay you just have to turn off monitor screen and then direct flashlight at it, then you better check that version out instead.\nIt also was ported to Xbox. Sure thing it was cut down and simplicifed, but overall stayed true to the source. Didn't play it myself. One nice feature it had over PC version was 2-player coop, with levels being edited to fit into such gameplay. But since Xbox Live service was shut down it's not actual anymore. Sadly.\n\nAnd so after launching the game and choosing ultra-quality, while laughing as I remember my old PC back few years ago struggling with low-quality setting and even freezing, I started a new game. And was awed. By how much more ugly it was compared to clean image I had in my memories.\nYou see, the game fails to recognise memory amount on modern hardware correctly and so it sets the textures quality to the minimum. Tweaking settings in-game will not change it. Instead you have to go to game folder and edit config file. I recommend looking at PCGamingWiki site which has a good example of Autoexec file.\n\nBut the small graphical problems still remained. Perhaps it's because I tweaked config files manually, but I had a few glitches. First, corpses of non-demons (and spiders) behaved funnily when gibbed. They would start dissintegrating, then when almost finished they would suddenly go back to look same as before, just without heads, and then they just suddenly dissapear few seconds later.\nAnother rendering problem would occur after getting to the next level during gameplay, where lights/shadows will start to slowly glitch out slightly here and there. Got tiresome to restart the game after few levels. Some on other hand were complained about objects fully dissapearing, so watch out.\nAnd strangely enough game stutters here and there even on modern hardware. Some blame Steam version.\n\nNope, no widescreen by default. But people would just tweak config file and I never heard any complaining. Didn't check myself.\n\nMultiplayer community is pretty much dead, I didn't find anybody playing game. Aside from that one time where they were playing on server with some mod, but I failed to join. So I don't have vanilla experience. From what I can tell multiplayer was pretty much tucked on the game, it being a small-scaled deathmatch, with 4 players limit. Things move fast though and even keeps same shadow play as single-player game. Still, I doubt that it was all that hot.\nCommunity made a coop mod, by the way, maybe it's worth checking out with a friend.\n\nPlot follows a lone space marine, who is not same guy as that Doom guy from original. And you are this time on Mars, where UA Corporations is having teleporter experiements, with half of a staff having asian look. After a short introudction levels, hell will break loose.\n\nAnd so Doom 3, while keeping arsenal fo weapons and monster types recognisable from the original Doom games, albeit with style change, leans onto more of Survival Horror aspect. Now, mind it, it still has you run'n'gunning. Well, walk'n'gunning, as the game became much more slower-paced. You will walk slower and you will encounter far lesser enemies, somewhere like Quake 1. Which means less but a bit tougher. You will also have monsters ambushing you often, pouncing at you as soon as door opens and test your reaction like that, as well as just spawning into room. Spawn takes ages however and by the time that monster will actually teleport in you will be already aiming your shotgun up-close at the main mass.\n\nYes, it has design hiccups. But it does excells in atmoshpere and one of the main unique things it brings in is light/shadow play. As you know, engine blew everybody mind, at least in 2002 E3 event, with combination of bump-mapping and dynamic shadows, with shadow rendering the same no matter if it's level or model. While being sexily precise. While other games in the end would just put it in for farts, Doom 3 used it to enhance the style and gameplay. And boy, does it look still awesome. Not as pretty as Half-Life 2, mind it, but I really wanted to screenshot occasional room, seeing how all the monsters, bump-shaded sci-fi textures and action is illuminated. Shame that screenshot function on Steam overlay was disabled.\n\nIt also bring a thing or two in gameplay. Darkness is often covering parts of a room. You can either hold a flashlight or use a weapon, never both. As a result, you have to decide if you want to see where monster is or just shoot blindly. Actually, I pretty much recommend you to use flashlight as little as possible and never in a firefight. This way you will actually will be more effective, as you will learn to recognise monsters by the little lights they give away, whether fireballs or just their eyes, as well as recognising that monster is there by sounds they make. Most memoriable scene for me was after imp, fireball throwing medium demon, killed the only light in a room and two more arrived soon, as I had to tell away where they were by the light that their fireballs emitted.\nNo other FPS would combine both old-school shooting and survival horror aspect this way.\n\nWell, if forget that for survival horror it gives way too much ammo. Or even for standard FPS. That, or maybe that's because I opened every closet. You see, game placed a lot of devices around the levels that would show you email and audio log of some person. They are mostly there to improve backstory. And to reward players who read them developers would put closet codes into logs too. But to be honest, while amusing, they weren't exciting and it only putted away players who didn't care about those things.\nWas quite easy on Normal too. Should had increased difficulty. Hmmm.\nAlso, two lockers want you to check easter egg websites that actually was on Internet. If forget that it not redirects you to Doom3BFG site. Just search through some easter eggs website.\n\nAnd yes, it tries to scare player all the time. And to be honest, it doesn't work. Not even as jumpscares. Or maybe it wasn't intented to be truly scary. In all honesty I just recommend to immerse yourself into atmoshpere and enjoy all the freaky stuff going on, taking it as a just cool special effect. Relax and enjoy.\nGame also doesn't use music tracks, instead putting combination of ambient sound into every room. Some of those sounds were quite musical. It was a good experiement idea, but fails in this case, as I don't remember anything good. But I guess it works. Could use proper ambient track though.\n\nIt still is clunky at times, gameplay isn't as smooth as in original Doom. For example Shotgun isn't all that reliable, it can shoot in such way that every pellet will be outside of a center. Or focused on one side. Most of encounters don't last long. Melee zombies are just there to be beaten up by flashlight. It also overuses futurustic base setting, only once breaking into Hell level or such. Now, I loved taking slow and being careful in these dark rooms of UAC base, but even I grew tired toward the end. That and final boss sucks.\nAnd well, it's plainly way too long for what it is.\n\nBut in the end, Doom 3 still manages to fill the niche. But you gotta love slow-paced actiony gameplay and to appericate some shadow work. Even if it's not 2004 anymore, it still looks nice too. And just have to be in the mood to love it.","October 22, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Blaring MIDI metal and full speed circle strafing gives way to silence and methodically checking every corner for monsters. The story is surprisingly lengthy and involved, taking inspiration from the Alien films with a demonic Starship Troopers B-movie vibe. It was somewhat divisive when it originally released; the slower pace and heavy reliance on light management wasn't helped by the concurrent rise of the vocal, entitled, forum-dwelling “gamer” that was adverse to change of any kind. This backlash quickly led to a popular “flashlight mod” for the game; a cheat that bypassed the need to switch from your weapon to your light source and completely changed the nature of play. Once this “fix” was in circulation and accepted as a superior way to play the game, subsequent releases (the BFG Edition) used it as a new standard with no option to experience the game as originally intended. A decade later, it's pretty clear those people were wrong. The BFG Edition of Doom 3 is a fairly forgettable corridor shooter. This true version of Doom 3 is still fantastic and is much more influential than anyone seems to give it credit for.\n\nLighting is a central mechanic to Doom 3. While some of the character models and textures are starting to show their age, the lighting effects and art direction are still incredibly impressive. You use the “F” key to switch to your flashlight frequently; much of the game is filled with moody shadows and often complete pitch blackness. It's not uncommon to have to make a choice to either aim for a demon's glowing red eyes or lure it toward a more helpful light source, hoping you don't back into a trap in the process. It's ballsy how willing Doom 3 is to engulf the player in darkness, knowing their choice is to either be able to see or defend themselves. You can't do both. Walking through hostile environments armed with only a flashlight is it's own genre now; Outlast, Slender Man, Alien: Isolation... that disempowerment was a cornerstone of Doom 3.\n\nMost of the weapons and enemies from the previous games return: the possessed soldiers, the standard Imps, floating Cacodemons, dead-raising Revenants, towering Hellknights, and the big bad Cyberdemon. A few new ones make their appearances, notably the weak but swarming spiders and creepy winged baby things. Then there are standard zombies, which aren't much of a threat on their own but have a habit of trapping you in corners if you're not careful. They're also great chainsaw fodder. Weapons include the all-around handy shotgun, the hammering chaingun, plasma gun, a new standard if generic assault rifle, and the legendary BFG. Ammo conservation and choosing the right tool for the right situation seems more vital than ever, as weapons have a pretty clear rock-paper-scissors relationship to most monsters. And the monsters can be right aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, relentlessly chasing you down and teleporting toward or behind you. Some attacks and scripted “jump scares” seem almost impossible to avoid damage from, causing health and ammo rationing to ratchet up to true survival horror levels. Also new (though introduced late in the game) is the Soul Cube, an alien artifact that charges up by killing five enemies, which can then be thrown for massive damage and health regeneration. It's an odd weapon, but it does add an additional layer of strategy as you prioritize low ranking demons for the charge to obliterate the tougher foes.\n\nA gripping narrative and the Doom name doesn't exactly go hand-in-hand, but a surprising amount of care went into building the game's lore and the pacing is actually spot on. You play The Marine, a voiceless guy who shows up on a Mars base in the future. Almost immediately ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and the base's personnel gets a bad case of the Satans and demons start coming through portals. There's a mad scientist intent on helping the demons (or something), and the demons want to ultimately conquer Earth because they're actually an ancient race that humans have descended from. It's real campy schlock, but it's very self aware and dips into outright comedy at times, then presents truly dark and disturbing imagery in the next beat. I'd describe the tone as The Evil Dead meets Aliens.\n\nYou interact with the environments in a number of ways to solve puzzles; many of the computers can be cursored over in order to raise bridges, move machinery, or access camera or communication feeds. It's quite an impressive level of detail, mechanics that predated modern games like SOMA, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation (again...). In addition to the standard finding of keycards and badges to raise your security clearance and unlock doors, Doom 3 features another form of storytelling collectible that has become prolific enough to become a cliché: audio logs and e-mails. Now, this certainly isn't the first video game to have the player sift through characters' personal files, but the game came out well before the method had overstayed it's welcome and is still some of the best implementation I've come across. Some of the exchanges between staff are genuinely funny, and the Martian Buddy spam is a forgotten classic. Even the video discs have a distinct style and personality, and even if some of this fluff can be criticized for slowing the game down, it's optional and I enjoyed diving into every last one. It can't be understated how great (and often tense) it is to be able to listen to audio logs as you explore and fight; something other games still screw up to this day.\n\nDoom 3 holds up better than just about any other game of it's vintage I can think of. It remains super tense and oppressive, and I found myself leaning toward the screen as I played with baited breath. With a good pair of headphones and a darkened room it's just as effective (if not more so) than most modern horror games. When the bullets and fireballs start flying it's still definitely classic Doom, but the new emphasis on narrative and lore-building allow the masterfully crafted, cramped hellish battlefields to legitimately scare the crap out of you. It plays silky smooth while still feeling brutal and visceral. Doom 3 may be a different breed of Doom, but now when it kicks ♥♥♥ you might just ♥♥♥♥ yourself in the process.","January 28","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I suppose you can say Doom 3 is not an 'original' game in its ideas, but that won’t bother you once you get totally absorbed into it's environment. Like the original Doom, it has the end of level 'bosses' and you get all the good weapons right until the end when you have to battle the infamous Cyberdemon.\nThe look of the game is amazing, with fantastic light and shadows (rather more of the latter than former) and innovative use of interactive computer screens. The sound is close to perfect.\nThe atmosphere of the game is unparalleled, keeping you permanently alert. The few scenarios where the game uses psychological horror are very effective.\nOn the other hand, the game sometimes gets repetitive. Although most of the game manages to hold your interest, there seems to be a lot of "filler" missions reminiscent of older id titles: get key to open door / find an access code / etc. This is particularly the case in the middle of the game when, after an impressive beginning, you begin to feel that the game ought to advance the plot a bit or give you something else to do rather than shooting imps and wandering some uninspired corridors. It does eventually liven up a bit, but the game would be much improved by some more variety.\nSome of the combat is also unfair, with monsters teleporting directly behind you. This can get annoying, but doesn't harm the horror aspect of the game at all as it keeps you permanently on edge.\nOverall, a rather unique game which is well worth playing.\n","March 13","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The flashlight will be your friend in this game .\n\nI played it on normal mode for the first few hours , its easy , then mid to near end of the game , some areas can get big leaps in difficulty all the sudden then back to easy again . Still looks decent looking for its age (2004) . The weapons in this game are awesome and just so much fun to use (bfg gun wow! ) and even a chainsaw :O . Lots of ugly , scary looking creatures and demons to kill with all that ammo and big selection of weapons it gives you . So action horror fans should be pleased with this game for sure .\n\nThe end boss was dissapointing i thought , just a wee bit . Maybe just on normal mode it was too easy tbh . Performance wise , I never had a single issue with the game ( no crashes or whatever ) , it runs fine .\n\nDont buy the BFG edition , its not worth it . Just buy the normal/original version which is cheaper or buy the non steam version .My non steam copy only cost me £1 , and even that ran perfectly fine ( if your still able to find a copy somewhere )  .\n\nI enjoyed the game , i would deffinetly recommend it for action/horror fans. You should play through this before the new DOOM game comes out so you get a feel for what its like , if you havent played any doom game before . I would highly , highly recommend the old versions(doom 1 and 2 ) aslong as you dont get put off by very dated graphics .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/recommended/9050/","moonshinefox","[TLEG]Mana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonshinefox/","198 products in account","It was really hard for me to recommend this game initially. I had played 5-6 levels and I was getting increasingly frustrated with the game. It felt nothing like Doom, and worse still it didn't feel fun at all. Read on and I'll tell you why you should get this game anyway.\n\nFirst off: This game is old. It runs by default in 4:3 resolution. You can find several solutions to this in the forums.\n\nDoom 3 tries really hard to be FEAR, Half-Life and Doom all at the same time. It takes a more realistic, dark and gritty approach to the original Doom storyline. It replaces frantic gun-blazing and monsterspamming with dark, gloomy and "scary" corridors with fewer, more powerful enemies. This in itself is not a bad thing. After all, Half-Life was a great game!\n\nThe narrative is mostly told through voice overs or found PDAs. I kinda like this approach, it keeps you inside the world.\n\nWhere this game suffers really badly is the actual gameplay. It tries really hard to be scary and it shows. It's pretentious at best and ham-fisted at worst when it comes to the so called "scary moments" with color shifts, lights going out and comically overplayed "evil laughs" echoing through the halls.\n\nThe guns feel like pellet guns. There is no punch to any of the weapons, the sound assets for them are extremely weak and there is no satisfying feel to any of the weapons when you fire them. Enemies feel bullet-spongy and have a really annoying habit of not being present in the game world until you pass a certain trigger. This leads to excessively annoying moments where enemies keep coming from areas that you have already cleared. It's almost every single time you encounter enemies you'll have some coming from behind you. This can be cool for some panic induced fighting on occasion, but this game does it every single time and it gets old FAST.\n\nNow, with all these problems, why do I recommend it? Because I got fed up and installed Doom 3 XTRA mod. This mod updates graphics, model assets, textures and sounds to a more modern standard, but it also fixes all the problems I have with the gameplay. By giving weapons more punch and over all more satisfying oomph and sounds, it makes the shooting fun again. Sure the game is still overly pretentious with its scary "jack in a box" moments and enemies always coming from behind, but you know what? With Doom 3 XTRA I don't give a ♥♥♥♥.

I had fun shooting and blowing up spawns of satin while experiencing some of the jumpscares DOOM 3 had to offer. Having access to every weapon instead of limiting it to two is always fun to expierece because the more the marrier. Weapon progression in this game is enjoyable making players start form a lonely pistol to a BFG that kills everything in front of you because BIG F****** GUN! thats why. The plot is not simplified like the earlier titles but is still good and allows players to make a choice, a small one at that, to  send out a distress beacan or not . This choice is very minor and only effects the cutscene at the end making replaying the game for that choice not a big priority. The end boss battle feels a bit underwelming though as the player does nothing but run in a circle and wait for an item to charge up just to use it on the boss repeatedly. Finding PDA's for lore and locker codes is a great implimentation because it makes players search around the area if they want the goodies locked in that locker. Enemy variasion is good making players change tactics to tackle certain foes and introducing them is good as well. Replaying the game to have fun or experience a harder difficulty is fun and enjoyable as the game itself I feel can be played multiple times and still be fun. I recommend playing this game with sikkmod as it makes a game from 2003 look not only good but play better and smoother. Playing this game without sikkmod is okay too but the player will have to moddify the game anyway as the in game settings dosen't support 1920 by 1080p resolution. Information on the sikkmod modification and resoulution fix can be found in the forums.","March 20","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you prefer a test of your insanity buy the original and hold the flashlight and bludgeon Imps with a flashlight while screaming, "RIP AND TEAR!" and then proceed to get covered in small spiders that eventually kill you and use ur corpse as a nest.

Granted the textures can look a tad low-res without mods, but I suppose that's not so much a negative point as it is a fact of life - for a 10 year old game it's fantastic, and, true to id's style, it's still as fantastically playable as it was back then.

Most of the "horror" aspects of Doom 3 are literally just darkness, mob spawn, rinse and repeat, with the occasional jump-scare. Still, it's a solid shooter that looked amazing in 2004.\n\nI actually would NOT recommend purchasing the "BFG Edition" of Doom 3;  part of the tension that Doom 3 built was the fact that you couldn't hold a light source and a weapon at the same time - being able to illuminate the area was a risk-reward scenario.  You could find items and navigate the area easier, but you leave yourself more susceptible to enemies.  In the BFG Edition, the "Duct Tape Mod" is a part of the game entirely, so the flashlight is grafted to your weapons, eliminating the calculated risk aspect that I just discussed.  If that doesn't convince you, Doom 3 Standard is cheaper too, I guess.","December 30, 2012","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I did not enjoy it as much as Doom and Doom 2, it still is a good.  It is a decent survival horror, with some tense and spooky moments.  I also recommend ot to Doom fans, to experience the re-imagined versions of their favorite monsters and weapons.  Combat can be fun and fast paced.  It is perfect for people who have played the original Dooms, and also are fans f the survival horror genre.  Graphics were decent for the time, and parts of the game required you to think and investigate your surroundings.  Although it starts out slow, the build up is necassary for you to start feeling uneasy before the action starts.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed this game, I would have preferred a more modern rip n' tear game.\n\nNow for the not so good stuff.  Keep in mind this is my opinion.  At times, they  jus throw enemies at you for extended periods.  Sometimes they aren't even strong enemies, and it is just annoying.  For example, the little skeleton spiders just keep coming and coming, and it smetimes breaks the flow of the game.  The guns do not feel very satisfying to fire, which is a minor complaint.  The darkness is also an issue.  The game would be IMPOSSIBLE to play through without the ductape mod to add a flashlight  your assault rifle and shotgun.  The mod does not ruin the atmosphere, and it encourage use of the default flashlight because the gun flashlights aren't as powerful.\n\nAll in all, I definitly enjoyed the game, being a fan of the originals and of survival horror.  However, it gets a 5/10 because it requires a mod to have fun gameplay.\n\nWithout Duct Tape mod: 5/10\nWith: 7/10","June 25, 2014","true","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Graphical glitches and crashes to desktop are the smaller problems. However, I swear that at least ten times, the game has managed to crash my internet router. I don't know how it's happening, but I know all these bugs are at least directly correlated to how many times I load maps in the game in one sitting. Bottom line is that it's annoying, and it ruins the pacing at which the game can be enjoyed.\n\nI suggest a hard copy.

You play as an unamed space marine stationed on Mars City run by the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) you happened to arrive on the same day something extraordinary happens where scientists decide to open a portal to hell but didn't think to shut it for some daft reason and it all goes to hell literally because lost souls, imps anything evil and nasty has come out to play with your body being their toy. This game happens to take a more survival horror approach with limited ammo, non-regenerative health and satan wanting to play a few too many pranks on you in many rooms and it works for the amount of time I have played this game which I mainly played it on the original Xbox I was really petrified and even more frightend on PC.\nThis is a short review because everyone knows what Doom is.\nOverall Rating for the Vanilla version 7/10\nOverall Rating for the HD mod version 9/10","December 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The marine-zombies will get your flanks, run at you and melee strike your face, and demons would throw fireballs from all sides.\n\nGraphically it is also very well aged....doesn't look 'old' at all. Such a shame they did release the BFG edition....if you are wondering which one to get, get this version. This is the original version, the BFG version adds useless stuff and simplifies the game a lot (more ammo, less damage taken, holding the light while aiming and so on).\n\nBy editing the ini files you can choose whatever resolution you want. So there IS support for widescreen (not natively, just google and edit the necessary files).

That's especially true for the Steam version.  There are mods for Doom 3.  I recommend Cam's Gameplay Mod v2.6.  That mod will add a permanent flashlight to all guns and make the guns more effective.  Doom 3 can support high-resolution monitors if you add some commands to the autoexec.cfg file.  I've never played Doom 3 BFG Edition.  The fact that it doesn't support mods was what convinced me not to buy it.  Nevertheless, I've heard that the BFG Edition has smoother gameplay, a permanent flashlight for all guns, and slightly better graphics.","December 13, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It hasn't.\nThis is one of the most boring games i have ever played and it feels like such a slap in the face to fans of doom 1 and 2 like myself. The shooting feels so clunky, the guns sound weak as hell and combat in general just feels stiff and awful.\nIt's one of the least scary 'horror' games i have ever played and I feel no tension as i'm playing it. The only scare that works is the bathroom mirror scare in the first hour of the game. Unless you are very easily scared this game cannot be called a horror game as it is marketed to be.\nThe enemy design is so uninteresting and boring compared to doom 1 and 2 which had some of the most interesting and memorable enemy design in gaming history its just sad to look at in doom 3.\nThe pacing is awful, you are fighting like 5 ememies at a time max and that's the most tension you will get out of the game is fighting a small bunch of enemies in very tight corridors. The pacing is very slow and boring. If the game didn't have such dull and boring level design and atmosphere maybe the slow pacing would have worked but it just doesn't.\nI have used the word boring so many times in this review but that's honestly the best way i can describe the game and my experience with it.

Why? I could'nt remember why I didnt finish it back in the day. Now I've played it I remember the horror. Not the demon related kind, but the kind derived from poor game design choices.\n\nThe core "combat"  experience is just a series of sucker punches as enemies spring in your face as you open a door followed by enemies spawning behind you, this doesnt create a sense of dread rather extreme irratation as it happens over and over and over. The gun play is woeful, with none of the guns sounding or behaving like powerful weapons. Couple this with your cross hair flying off as you are hit, it's like they confused annoying and challenging.\n\nThe lighting is cool and the music is fitting but Doom 3 will be more remebered for its technical innovations rather than it's gameplay. And saying that these are all fairly standard now that leaves me no reason to recommend Doom 3 anymore.","April 26","false","3.8"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

I tried to like it for so long because the graphics, at the time, were basically unmatched, like the Doom titles before it. But even as a young lad back in the early 2000s this game was way too boring for me. The combat itself fell incredibly flat even compared to the original Doom games. Enemy bodies disappear before they even hit the ground. The guns sound like ♥♥♥♥. The level design may have gone over well in the mid to late 90s but by the time this game came out it felt anachronistically bland - basically just long metal corridor after long metal corridor. Say what you want about Halo 1's level design, at least you'd go outside and have a change of scenery every once in a while. In this game, all you do is plod around and shoot at enemies with your clunky Mattel toy gun and watch as the enemies disappear before you have a chance to see the ragdoll physics, set in a universe where light only comes in two forms -  brighter than the sun or darker than space. I suspect alot of people are projecting their love of the series as a whole onto this game individually when they praise it.","March 6","false","3.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

This is NOT a Doom game.\nRidiculously dark, in an attempt to create a tense and scary atmosphere. If you dont fancy modding the game this means hours of walking into walls essentially feeling your way round the perimiters of small rooms full of random clutter that cannot simply be walked over, but has to be kicked, tripped over and caught on.\nDepleting stamina bar means no unlimited running, seems a bit strange that someone would suddenly become too tired to jog when all manner of hellspawn are chasing after him.\nShotgun is a bad joke, easily possible to completely miss every pellet at a range of less than 2 meters. View flinch when hit is probably the worst i have ever seen in any game ever. This is not helped by the random swarms of small ankle biting monsters in totally dark corridors full of crap to trip over. These last few issues combined make this a painully bad experience.\nSome people seem to think that getting triple slapped when you cant even see what youre supposed to be shooting at is an intended game mechanic that adds to the atmosphere.

Sometimes you need\nto read Emails or listen to logs to figure out what to\ndo next, for example where specific mission-critical\nobjects are stored.\nAnd you get no help, you need to figure out platforming\nfor yourself when that becomes applicable.\nThat makes it extra fun.\n\nAnother nice thing is that many ingame objects not\nnecessary for progressing, is also interactive,\nso sometimes the object is just for fun/enjoyment,\nsometimes the object is just a red herring to fool\nyou into thinking this is the next step to take, when\nit turns out its not\n(For example, a door that never can be unlocked,\neg requires a PDA or keycard not in game).\n\nThis interactivity also adds to realism and it\nmakes the game more fun to play.\nAlso, the really nice thing is that you sometimes\nreturn to a central "hub" (so theres multiple "hubs")\nthat is specific for the chapter you played, after\nhaving collected some keycard/PDA or done\nsome objective, which makes it extra fun as\nyou get to revisit old places and take new\npaths from there. This gives you a more sense of the facility.\n\nAlso, theres a lot of puzzles that you need to figure out,\none notable example is the maintenace elevator/platform,\nwhere you are given a slight hint and you have to figure\nthe rest out itself.\nAnd the cryo storage bins puzzle is GREAT. First you\nthink its just a dead end but after a while you figure it out.\nAnd that lovely crane minigame with the toxic leaking barrels\nwas just beutiful.\n\nI could warmly recommend this instead of Doom 4.\nPut Doom 4 in the garbage bin and buy this instead!","May 14","true","6.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","0"

Situations are reused to the point you just get used to looking behind you everytime an enemy spawns infront of you and if theres one four legged beast enemy theres probably going to be another spawning after you kill the first.\n\nIts pathetically boring after you see that its just monster closets and triggers rehashed over and over and over with the same basic scenario.\n\nOf course theres the jump scares earlier in the game but after about halfway through the game you see just about all the fear you are going to get out of the game and it becomes extremely boring.The shooting feels weak and the shotguns a POS and most weapons are pretty worthless. Shotgun for close range, Plasma for damage dealing, and SMG for anyhing to far for the shot gun is what I went by. You do get access to a pistol, minigun, and a rocket launcher but they are pretty useless outside of specific situations.\n\nThe puzzles add nothing and most the time add up to finding a button and pressing the ♥♥♥♥ out of that single button or finding a keycode on a PDA in the area then typing that into a lockbox. It sucks, slows the game down and adds nothing to the mechanics of the game. My only guess is that FPS puzzles were the thing, and as HL2 was coming out the same year I guess they thought they would have to have them to compete or some stupid reason. Atleast HL2 puzzles require a bit of wit and have interesting physics to them.\n\nI won't be completing this game as its absolutely nothing and is the reason I could not care less about Doom 4.

You are an unknown marine sent to a Mars station to reinforce the troops stationed there. Recently there have been many occupants becoming ill and even dying. On board your flight is a councillor from earth to investigate the recent happenings. You are required to grab your equipment and report for duty. This is where your hellish story begins.\n\nThis game was released in 2004 and naturally, the graphics look dated. Some aspects are in HD like interactive computer monitors but most of the decals are very pixelated including your weapons which is a shame. The sound is above average with reasonable voice acting but the guns definately needed to sound like they have a heavier punch.\n\nThere is a variety of weapons from chainsaws, chainguns, rocket launchers, granades and everything in between to put to good use against the enemy. If you search out the nooks and crannies you will find enough ammunition to keep you going. The AI are generally stupid and will persue you except for the marines. Sometimes they take cover.\n\nThe story is slowly revealed to you through a bunch of PDAs the lab scientists have dropped. Not only do they reveal story plots but some will also have codes to gain access to storage lockers. Another cool aspect was having to go outside the station with a limited oxygen supply. It gives a real sense of dread of suffication. To add to the suspense you must lower your weapon to use a flash light. Some will find this a nuisanse if they just want a plain run and gun game.\n\nConclusion : Don't expect epic content from this game but if you'd like to take a crack at a classic then this would definately count.\n\nOther notes : I had problems choosing a higher resolution to play the game in. It would always crash when I chose which one I wanted. Please check the guides for a work around to get better resolutions. It involves typing commands into the console. Unfortunately you have to do this everytime you open the game. I have a G15 keyboard so I bound the commands to one of my macro keys. Minimised the annoyance.","October 21, 2014","true","25.2"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","11","0","1"

I mean c'mon people, this game came out around the same time as Half Life 2! The controls are stupid; a marine can't hold a flashlight and a pistol? Or just get some freaking duct tape? And don't talk about the BFG edition, that hardly fixed anything.\n\nMaking everything dark is not "atmosphere" people! It just blinds the player so every enemy gets a jump on you. After an hour of playing nothing surprised me, because I knew that every blind corner or locked door held a "surprise" enemy in it.\n\nThe most linear and BORING maps I have ever seen. I mean look at System Shock 2 from the freakin 90s! That entire game takes place on an industrial style space ship, which is a very similar environment to Doom 3, but each level is uniqe with a different design and feel. All of the hallways in Doom 3 are identical.\n\nFinally, one of the most annoying aspects of this game was the sound of the guns. Why do all the guns sound like toys?! The shotgun sound sounds like a bb gun; it's idiotic.\n\nAfter 7 hours of playing I looked online and saw a lot of people saying that it got better in the Hell levels, so I looked up a guide and the hell levels are only the last quarter of the game! Any game that takes more than 2 hours to get "good" is a game that belongs in the garbage. Doom 1 and 2 are roling in their graves and this piece of trash does not deserve to be called by the same name. I loved Doom 1 and 2 and I drink to their memory while I p155 on Doom 3's grave.","February 9, 2014","false","7.9"," 8 of 32 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","8","32","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4hud/recommended/9050/","4hud","|$m0k!n|-4HUD-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4hud/","102 products in account","Doom, the movie is better.\n\nI bought this game as part of some collection I think, but I never actually played it before now and it's pretty obvious within the first few hours that I didn't miss anything at all.\n\nAt best this game is slightly entertaining, at worst it's clunky, boring and stupid, which puts it somewhat below average in general. It's never really challenging, because of a ♥♥♥♥-poor AI and annoying mechanics.\n\nIn the movie all the marines have flashlights mounted to their guns. In the game you either wield a flashlight or a gun and the game is extremely dark, which means you'll be switching constantly, but what's worse is that the lighting is even worse. I find the night-blind setting to be quite annoying. I can't even see an enemy two steps away, because there is no reflection or sphere of light at all - but they can see me; always. I think it's supposed to be scary, but it isn't. It's just annoying.\n\nWhenever I get hit I am pushed back a little, which distracts my shots, but whenever I hit an enemy, with a shotgun blast or whatever they either die or nothing happens. And the enemies, all they do is sit around and wait for me, to make a leap at me when I open a door or turn my back to a dark corner.\n\nUsing grenades is just plain stupid. They behave like rubber balls. Trying to lob a nade through a window or on a step ahead or just above me and the nade bounce off the edge or a wall and back in my face nine times out of ten. I end up looking straight up at the cealing in order to lob a nade up on a level right above me. It's the worst pitching mechanic I've ever seen.\n\nThere are too many triggers. Enemies spawn from areas I've already cleaned out. Not just those that teleport in, but possessed marines as well. Every time I find armor, clips, healing or anything I suddenly got a monster in my face, that just magically appear out of nowhere.\n\nI never get the feeling that I am anything else than a guy sitting at a keyboard playing a lame shooter and everytime I get bloodsplatters on the screen I get the feeling that I've just got a view from a camera mounted on the back of my marine.\n\nMy time is pretty evently divided between killing zombies (or whatever they are, all of them) and looking for keycards, which is really too long. During the course of the game I found different keypads, which includes pointless chit-chat, audio logs and a few useful security codes, but I have to look through them all manually, which is bloody annoying, especially because the design of mail windows are so small, that I have to scroll a lot through messages. I really wish, that the game would have had some kind of intelligence, registering the keypads and just unlock all the lockers as I pick up the datapads with codes for them.\n\nThere are also audio logs with voice-recordings, but the voices are.. too whiney and annoying. It would have been interesting if there was a mystery to unravel, but it's just doom. There are a few nice voices, but voices generally suck, because they lack character, personality and point.\n\nSomehow it feels as if Doom 3 wants to be System Shock 2 with better graphics, but it fails miserably at the gameplay. There is only action and it's primitive and repetitious. Doom 3 borrows liberally from a lot of different games to create a boring, predictable and forgettable story. It really shows a genuine lack of inspiration for this game other than adding bragging rights about graphics and visual appeal.\n\nIt's a pretty fast-paced game and it's easy to quit. It's just that kind of game. Fast-in, fast-out. No addiction. I imagine I will just do one play-through and then the game will disappear in the dust of old and forgotten games. I didn't get that far. At the end it was just too boring. What a drop.","February 4, 2015","false","16.1"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","6","1","17","2","0"

It is fun for about an hour and then it just goes stale. The game is totally repetive, in the sense that the only activity you do is combat. "Oh look, demon #53. Click. Dead. Oh look, demon #54. Click. Dead."\n\nYou might say "Wait, that sounds like all shooter games!" No, that isn't true. Good shooters have a variety of weapons where each fits a different and essential role in combat. In DOOM 3, there are weapons that suck and are never used, and OP god-like weapons. Good shooters have a few abilities or combat tricks that you can use to react to enemies. In DOOM 3, the only move is click and shoot.\n\nDOOM 3 is also way to hard. Enemies spawn literally right behind you or next to you, then immediately use moves that you have no chance to avoid and/or one-hit-kill the player.\n\nPerhaps the worst thing is the complete lack of narrative. Only once did the game break into cutscene or feature some kind of dialouge. Basically, the plot is "For some reason that nobody ever finds out, a hell portal opens randomly in some mars facility. Now go kill demons non-stop for 10 hours and then you win."\n\nDOOM 3 is the worst shooter I've ever played. Utter garbage.","May 29, 2014","false","10.7"," 2 of 20 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","2","20","0","0"

The shotgun in the game is a joke. Each pellet does pathetic damage, and you can get spread that will hit the floor and the celing at a range of maybe 10 feet? It takes 2 shots at point blank to kill an Imp. Like do i really need to say anything else?\n\nEnemy AI is pretty good for the soldiers. They take cover and are a genuine challenge. Imps crawl around and don't use much strategy, but they're imps so that's to be expected. Caoco demons just sort of float towards you, which isn't really that impressive.\n\nOther than that, the game was supposed to be about atmosphere and being a horror game, which it does well. It's genuinly scary at times and presents a good atmosphere and the story isn't half bad.\n\nThat said, the gameplay is terrible due to the pathetic weapons. 4/10. Go ahead and play it, but don't expect something more than what it is.","January 29, 2015","false","15.2"," 1 of 18 people (6%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","6","1","18","0","0"

But now I have to deal with Cfgs and Edits dont seem to affect my old game at all. But The BFG Edition on the Steam Store I saw is the only game on the planet with Widescreen Support. More Convient without messing the Res to get 1920 x 1080, Not the person to always have to tamper with Configs for Res for a old game all the time.\n\nMostly the Widescreen Support is all I cared for sense I hate using Bulky Heavy Montiors that generate so much heat to play just Doom 3.\n\nThis game is great but no one uses heavy bulky boxy Montiors anymore not unless your on a vart super tight budget to own a Widescreen Montior.\n\nBut despite with no Widescreen Support the game is great if you can deal with a bigger Hud and stuff.","August 27, 2014","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've grown to change my mind, and in fact this has become one of my very favourite games. I've played this thing over and over and over and it gets better every single time.\n\nid's engine is nothing short of miraculous. The level design is tight (though sometimes unremarkable and confusing) and the player can hide behind, jump on, and squeeze through everything you'd expect. The use of shadow in the design is superior to any other game, and having to juggle between a gun and a flashlight, even though it's ridiculous, adds tension and fun.\n\nThe monsters are a loving homage to the original games. The animations are incredible and become spookier every time I upgrade my PC (especially with my 144hz monitor - it's SO fluid). They're fun to fight and id kept the important mechanic of having the player run faster than any other enemy, making movement your most effective weapon. That's the key ingredient of Doom and that's what makes Doom 3 a true sequel.\n\nIt's fun to navigate, it's fun to shoot, and every moment is full of tension and wonder as you explore. Doom 3 is a gem and I can confidently call it a "desert island game". I never seem to get tired of it.","May 11, 2014","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, partway through the game it becomes a much more generic game that lapses in its scariness. If you take away the darkness and you hold down the run key, the game is basically the same run and gun shooters its predecessors were in many sections. If you were a huge fan of the first games and this is what you like, then that's great. If you're looking for something deeper than that, then you may have to try harder to immerse yourself. As I said, the beginning definitely is everything it is advertised to be. Later in the game, though, I found myself getting very bored and hoping the game would end.\n\nMost of the enemies just jump toward you and are designed to fluster you. It's not really scary for the most part, but if you are easily scared as I was as a young teenager playing this game, it will freak you out. It becomes predictable as well. Enemies spawn in most rooms, you gun them down, then you repeat in the next room. The formula works out for a while, but by the time you get to, say, the Delta Labs, you'll be wishing the game would throw something new at you. The boss fights are exciting decent but easy, perhaps with the exception of the Cyberdemon that appears in every Doom game ever.\n\nMany people complain about not being able to use the flashlight and shoot at the same time. While it can be annoying at first, once you get good at switching it actually works pretty well. I know the new BFG edition allows you to use both, but I feel like that would kill the experience too much. It adds a new level of strategy and horror, so don't be too put off by it.\n\nThere's not much of a storyline, but there really doesn't need to be. You're just trying to survive and make it through the Mars base, eventually defeating the demonic forces, while hitting a number of objectives along the way.\n\nThe graphics are good, about what you'd expect from a game made back in 2003. The facial animations are terrible (except for the player's own and a few notable other NPCs), but the rest is decent. The mirrors actually work though!

If you have not taken the time to experience this game, you really have missed something truly epic.\n\nFirst off, do not bother with the "BFG" edition as Doom 3 is already moddable and can be converted to HD, 1080p resolution and used with a controller.  In addition, BFG adds additional lighting as part of the dynamic update which really does remove a good deal of the horror aspect from the game.  Being in pitch-black darkness and having to swap between a flashlight and weapon are what makes Doom, well, Doom.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, you will probably not encounter more challenging of a shooter if you play Doom 3 on hard mode.  Your heart will be pounding and the sight of a health station will probably make you scream for joy after certain encounters.\n\nFinally, there is a HUGE variety of monsters that you will face throughout the game, which did I mention that the game has at least 20-25 hours of solid gameplay (based on a careful, first time playthrough)?  You may get to a point and go 'hmm, I haven't seen half of these monsters in the photos/videos or that I remember from the original Doom games', only to look online and find out that after ten chapters you're not even half-way through the game.\n\nSeriously, play Doom 3; 90% approval rating","December 19, 2013","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, it manages to be a solid horror game with plenty of scares, scary concepts, and dark spooky rooms. On the other, that just isn't what Doom is. Doom is a fast-paced action game with bunny-hopping, weapon swapping, and non-stop genocidal mayhem. It's about as far from the original Doom as possible in that regard. I personally enjoy the sound design and music, though YMMV. The dark rooms are irritating to some, and while I do agree that the dark rooms themselves are an ordeal, it doesn't feel unintentional. And sure, if you want to completely remove the horror aspect of it then by all means get the BFG edition where you can hold your flashlight and weapon at the same time. But for people who accept it as a horror game, and want to enjoy it as a horror game, and also accept it as a completely different game from Doom, then it is well worth your time.

Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the "explore the floor" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the "spooks" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like "monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game". While there are a few "jump" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.","March 10, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

" is one of the most common comments i see of this game. This however is totally a matter of opinion, which varies person to person. I personally LOVE this game. There are a few bugs in the graphics here and there. But over all its a great fun, gory, (depending on if your a jumpy person, then this game WILL scare you) .. if not, well, you'd still enjoy it.\n\nWeapons are great. The pistol and machine gun make fairly crappy sounds.\nSounds like a little kids toy gun. That would be one of my complaints.\nBut thats not much of one.\n\nLevel Design is great. If you've played Quake 4, Unreal 2, Half Life 1.\nYou will be very familiar with all the metallic walls, hissing machinery.\nBig rotating mechanical arms and conveyor belts around.\nI love the interaction with computers, how your cross-hair becomes the Mouse pointer, on screens and you access files and controls through screens.\n\nA great game for any Horror FPS lovers.\nI give it a score of 8 / 10","May 12, 2011","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only played 50 minutes when I'm writing this and I'm scared to go back. Its really dark and you can't have a weapon and flashlight out at the same time making it even creepier. The beginning is slow but once you hit the point in the game where all hell breaks loose then the game becomes intense and leaves you scared. Some scares can be predicted but other are extremely difficult to see coming. One that really got me was when i was walking through a hallway and all the lights go out, no visibility and i was too afraid to put down my gun, then a monster just jumps out at me. I screamed and accidentally paused the game. I love scarey games and this one is a must, it makes you second guess on if you want to play it again. I definitely will but I'll be scared out of my mind when I click continue. Multiplayer is dead though, i went on for a while and found no games. Hopefully it will come back to life but for now the single player is just pure amazing. The game has a great atmosphere and it reminds me of the old Doom but with enhanced graphics. they aren't the best compared to now but even then it still is good and scares me. If you're trying to decide on getting this game or not i would highly recommend it. This game makes me want to get Quake and Rise of the Triad because it is old school like them. Try this game or either of those two, old school gamers won't regret it.","April 9, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The creepiness is helped by a great build-up at the start. It's a good balance between scary and action, though. Throughout the game you will make use of a PDA which is a clever way of keeping track of security keys, which will give you access to secrets and new areas, while also giving you some comical background about life on the station before the whole demonic invasion thing.","June 10, 2012","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, it manages to be a solid horror game with plenty of scares, scary concepts, and dark spooky rooms. On the other, that just isn't what Doom is. Doom is a fast-paced action game with bunny-hopping, weapon swapping, and non-stop genocidal mayhem. It's about as far from the original Doom as possible in that regard. I personally enjoy the sound design and music, though YMMV. The dark rooms are irritating to some, and while I do agree that the dark rooms themselves are an ordeal, it doesn't feel unintentional. And sure, if you want to completely remove the horror aspect of it then by all means get the BFG edition where you can hold your flashlight and weapon at the same time.

That said, partway through the game it becomes a much more generic game that lapses in its scariness. If you take away the darkness and you hold down the run key, the game is basically the same run and gun shooters its predecessors were in many sections. If you were a huge fan of the first games and this is what you like, then that's great. If you're looking for something deeper than that, then you may have to try harder to immerse yourself. As I said, the beginning definitely is everything it is advertised to be. Later in the game, though, I found myself getting very bored and hoping the game would end.\n\nMost of the enemies just jump toward you and are designed to fluster you. It's not really scary for the most part, but if you are easily scared as I was as a young teenager playing this game, it will freak you out. It becomes predictable as well. Enemies spawn in most rooms, you gun them down, then you repeat in the next room. The formula works out for a while, but by the time you get to, say, the Delta Labs, you'll be wishing the game would throw something new at you. The boss fights are exciting decent but easy, perhaps with the exception of the Cyberdemon that appears in every Doom game ever.\n\nMany people complain about not being able to use the flashlight and shoot at the same time. While it can be annoying at first, once you get good at switching it actually works pretty well. I know the new BFG edition allows you to use both, but I feel like that would kill the experience too much. It adds a new level of strategy and horror, so don't be too put off by it.\n\nThere's not much of a storyline, but there really doesn't need to be. You're just trying to survive and make it through the Mars base, eventually defeating the demonic forces, while hitting a number of objectives along the way.\n\nThe graphics are good, about what you'd expect from a game made back in 2003. The facial animations are terrible (except for the player's own and a few notable other NPCs), but the rest is decent. The mirrors actually work though! This is something most developers try to avoid, but id Software did them right!\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to people wanting a decent horror experience, but I warn that it will get repetitive about halfway through the game. If you can look past that, it is a very fun horror shooting experience!","July 16, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved how this elevator door opened, revealing some zombie-soldier, whereby I got shocked a bit and blasted his head with my shotgun. I remember my bro laughing as his brain basically popped out. About the 3rd level I liked how the lights switched off, it was completely dark! And when I blasted away with the machine gun, you could see the muzzle flashes reflect on the zombies in a rather artistic kind of way. I really disliked this game overall. But here comes the eye-opener! After completing the game, I viewed the credits and to my surprise it was only a handful of people who created Doom 3. You could even say it was almost an Indie game.

The creepiness is helped by a great build-up at the start. It's a good balance between scary and action, though.

It lacks mostly everything that made the doom games so great, levels are much more linear (still not as bad as many modern shooter) and it's less of a frantic fast paced action game and more of a slow, atmospheric horror game. There's nothing wrong with the latter of course, it's just a different approach to the series. The gunplay is solid thought there's nothing exceptional, the weapons are taken from the orginial doom, with a couple exceptions, such as the interesting soul cube. Monsters are taken from classic doom as well, which is great. It's quite a sight to see how monsters such as the cacodemon and mancubus translated into the Tech 4 Engine. The issue is the most iconic monster, the "pinky" demon is so grossly underused. I think I counted maybe 8 in the entire game? However, my biggest complain with the game is the lack of variety in the levels.

Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the "explore the floor" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the "spooks" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like "monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game". While there are a few "jump" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.","March 10, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When it first came out it was a mindblowing revolution in graphics, gameplay and atmosphere. When Doom 3, the first real "Full 3D graphic" Doom hit the scene with revolutionary graphics, the world was blown away by the capabilities of it. Sure, nowaways the graphics are standard and maybe even outdated, but back then they were awesome. As for the gameplay, its a simple shooter, blast away the enemies. In the narrow hallways with either light OR a gun, you have to survive the horrors of hell and eventually uncover the events that lead to the disaster on Mars.\nMindless shooter, but fun in between.","March 24, 2012","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doom was on more pcs than Windows was at the time of it's release.  Fuled by shareware, and college computer networks that allowed for lan games Doom and Doom 2 were like the worlds greatest virus.  I still remember the first time I saw doom in action.  It was Doom 2 to be exact.  I was with a firend at their uncles house, when i saw it on his PC.   Doom was kind of like Street Fighter 2, or Super Mario Bros, in that it changed my view on what video games could be.  I must not have been alone, because after doom, and ever since FPS games have dominated the market.  For the longest time all FPS games were called Doom Clones.   Doom and Doom 2 also happen to be the first games iever played online co-op on.  Another game changer for me.  You mean we can play together and be at our oen houses?  holy ♥♥♥♥!\n\n\nFast forward to Doom 3.  Does this game grab me like the first 2 games did back in the mid ninties?  No.  Is it the greatest FPS I ever played.  Not close.  Does it even make sense?  Why the hell do I need a flashlight, and if I do, why can't it be on my gun.  I thought this was the future.\n\nThis game gets bashed a lot because of the fact it will never live up to the original two, but over all it is a solid experience.  It has interesting enemies, and the sounds effects are fantastic.  Turn off the lights, crank the volume and ♥♥♥♥ your pants, as you are dropped through the floor into a room full of zombies (if you're lucky)  ready to eat your face.  This game has updated versions of many of the original games monsters, plus plenty of new ones. They all have a habit of trying to scare you to death so that's fun.\n\n\nI'd give this like a 8 on th 1 - 10 scale as far as FPS games go.","March 15, 2014","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've grown to change my mind, and in fact this has become one of my very favourite games. I've played this thing over and over and over and it gets better every single time.\n\nid's engine is nothing short of miraculous. The level design is tight (though sometimes unremarkable and confusing) and the player can hide behind, jump on, and squeeze through everything you'd expect. The use of shadow in the design is superior to any other game, and having to juggle between a gun and a flashlight, even though it's ridiculous, adds tension and fun.\n\nThe monsters are a loving homage to the original games. The animations are incredible and become spookier every time I upgrade my PC (especially with my 144hz monitor - it's SO fluid). They're fun to fight and id kept the important mechanic of having the player run faster than any other enemy, making movement your most effective weapon. That's the key ingredient of Doom and that's what makes Doom 3 a true sequel.\n\nIt's fun to navigate, it's fun to shoot, and every moment is full of tension and wonder as you explore. Doom 3 is a gem and I can confidently call it a "desert island game". I never seem to get tired of it.","May 11, 2014","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It lacks mostly everything that made the doom games so great, levels are much more linear (still not as bad as many modern shooter) and it's less of a frantic fast paced action game and more of a slow, atmospheric horror game. There's nothing wrong with the latter of course, it's just a different approach to the series. The gunplay is solid thought there's nothing exceptional, the weapons are taken from the orginial doom, with a couple exceptions, such as the interesting soul cube. Monsters are taken from classic doom as well, which is great. It's quite a sight to see how monsters such as the cacodemon and mancubus translated into the Tech 4 Engine. The issue is the most iconic monster, the "pinky" demon is so grossly underused. I think I counted maybe 8 in the entire game?

The old school Doom fans may not like D3's horror style of gameplay and lean toward the classic run 'n gun mechanics but D3 fulfills its own niche. Definitely choose this version over the BFG edition, as it has massive mod support. Sikkmod makes this game look better than the BFG edition, and other mods such as the LMS 4.0 (Wave survival, Custom coop) and OpenCoop (campaign and custom coop) provide extreme replayability. A ton of custom single player modded maps are also available for your choosing, most notably Tested and the Ultimate Hell Campaign. At $12 for the doom 3 + ROE pack, this is a steal, and even more so during steam sales.","December 4, 2013","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flashlight - Doom 3 is a hell of a lot darker then 1 and 2, Dont use it as a weapon though, it cant do ♥♥♥♥ as a weapon, but you need it to get through the game\n2. Shotgun\nThere is a weapon in every FPS that you will always bring out, sort of your main weapon, For Doom 3 its the Shotgun, the spread and damage on this ♥♥♥♥ is unrealistic, like seriously, Doom 3 is an FPS which wont increase the difficulty of enimes a whole much (Except Bosses, most enimes go down in 1-4 hits from the shotty) but increase the amount of enimes\nso the shotgun is a trusty pick\n3. Machine Gun (New Guy) and Chaingun (Bunching them intogether because this is already gonna be a ♥♥♥♥ing essay of a review)\nMachine Gun is not a bad as you would think, It could take down most enimes if you emptied a clip into them\nFor the Chaingun however, I think its a bit OP\nFastest Reload in the game, stuns enimes, can kill anything in the game if you empty half a clip\n4. Chainsaw\nBit Useless for Strong Enimes, but usefull for taking on Zombie Men so you consereve ammo a bit\n5. Rocket Launcher\n♥♥♥♥ing Amazing, Great Gun, Its useful for taking out groups of enimes, and for ♥♥♥♥ing over Hell knights and Pain Elementals\n6. BFG 9000 and Plasma Gun\nThe Plasma Gun is great, ammo is everywhere, packs quite a punch, if you have run out of or trying to conserve Shotty or Ammo in General, use the Plasma Gun\nBFG, the Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun 9000, This time, it has a hold down mechanic, If yoou just press the fire button, it only uses one cell and is about the same as 2-3 rockets\nthe longer you hold it, the more ammo it takes and the more puch it packs\nDont hold it for too long though, cause it explodes, such instant kill, much fail, it has a sound which allows you to tell when to fire the gun\nDislike\n1. Pistol\nCrap, Only use for Sniping and Ammo Conserving\n2. Fists\nUseless, ♥♥♥♥,\n2 Things I would like to draw attention to\nThe PDA (Personell Data Assitant) - This is amazing, you can bring up your PDA at any time by pressing TAB (By default), this contains video for you to pick up and watch, e-mails from the UAC and Sargent Kelly (Requesting you to be in Marine Command, linking with the story) you can also download e-mails from little screens, but this is pointless\nIt also contains videos for you to download and watch\nYou can also download other peoples PDA, which have e-mails containg Security Codes for Lockers, Backstory and theres one really cool easter egg invovling the PDA, also there is a reference to Quake somewhere (Another Id Software Title) Audio Logs which give backstory and PDA's will update security clearence which will allow you through certain areas\nThe Soul Cube - Brilliant Weapon, Amazing, Now, you cant just whip this out during normal gameplay  (you can get this out by pressing q, but thats not what I meant) It only works as a weapon when you have achived 5 Kills, you fire it and it does around 1000 damage (1 hitting anything that isent a Boss) and then healing some health\nNow you get this around 2/3 into the game on any difficulty level except Nightmare, because its so hard, you get the SC at the beggining of the game\nAlso, If you throw the soulcube, it will go for the bigger and stronger enemy, always\nEnimes and Bosses -\nEnimes:\nSome New some Old\nNew Guys are all bassicly the same, except\n- Big Buff Helmet Dude, whips you and if you try and go under, he kicks you which has some insanse knockback\n- Spidery Thingy\n- Machine Gun/Chainsaw Zombiemen - Zombiemen with a Machine Gun/Chainsaw\nEnimes from Doom 1/2 which made the cut\n- Zombiemen, Shotgun Sargent & Chaingun Men\n- Imp\n- Pinkie Demon\n- Lost Souls (Why Id, why?)\n- Mancubie (Cant spell name)\n- Reveneant\n- Arch Vile\n- Cacodemon\n- Hell Knight\n- Cyberdemon (Final Boss, of course, who else?)\nEnimes from Doom 1/2 which didnt make the cut\n- Pain Elemental (Would be nice If they could make the Cacodemon look less like a Pain Elemental)\n- Spider Master Mind and Aracnotron\n- Barron of Hell\nBosses:\n- Virax\nSpider like boss, pretty easy, only boss that you see more then one of, you see 2 side by side later in the game\nEasy with Chaingun\nNo Pattern, Its a "Click till you win" fight\n- Guardian of Hell\nSeen in Hell (Duh), you recive the soul cube when you win the battle, this boss you have to kill its minions flying around it and then you damage the red thing on top of him, whole battle can be done with Rocket Launcher\n- Sarge\nRemember Elliot Swann's Bodyguard, he says Sarge took his gun and then dies, Sarge is equipped with the BFG (Which is The Bodyguards Weapon) (you also take it from his Sarges Arm when he dies) He doesnt have a pattern, its a simple shoot till he dies battle\n- Cyberdemon (Final Boss)\nThis battle is intresting, the Cyberdemon cant be damaged, his bag ♥♥♥ arena that he has a big gaping hole in the middle with enimes coming out of it, which you kill to power the soul cube to use on him 4 times before he goes down\nI would of liked the Cyberdemon and Sarge to be harder, The Guardian of Hell was the hardest in my opinion, took me 3 trys though\n5. Horror\nNow, If this was a Doom 1/2 review, this section wouldent exsist, but this is Doom 3, which is Horror/FPS\nAtmosphere - Lighting is extremely well done, especially since you cant get out your flashlight when you have your weapon out\nTension - Having a ♥♥♥♥ load of enimes come after you is Tense? No, Not really, it would be in a game like.... Five Nights at Freddy's for example, but in Doom 3 its more annoying\n6. Graphics\nDoom 3 shows its age in some places but Damm\nOn a PC that cant run Minecraft at 20fps with everything turned off, I can play this at 40fps with AA on and Graphics on High Quality\nThats not bad\n7. BFG Edition\nShould you buy the BFG Edition? No\n"But, Doom 1,2,3,RoE and LM"\nfor 1 and 2, get the Classic Doom Pack, it has 1,2, Master Levels for 2 and Final Doom\nFor 3 & RoE, just buy them on Steam, LM is the only exclusive thing in it, its half an hour, watch a playthrough of it on YT\n"But Flashlights on Gun!"\nThats Bad, it ruins the horror aspect that made Doom 3 "speacial"\n"But Better Graphics!"\nIts a little bit more polish, it wont make a difference\nFinal Verdict for Doom 3: 8/10\nIts underratted as ♥♥♥♥, especially for how it has better graphics, story, gunplay and secrets","March 27, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ah... the nostalgia, I remember I had to put new specs into my old PC just to be able to play this game when I had my old junker, well... my current PC is junk too but hell, It works. I've played DOOM and DOOM 2 relentlessley back on DOS and sometimes even on emulators when I get bored. anywho back to the subject of DOOM 3. DOOM 3 in all of it's glory is based on Mars in the year 2145, around November I believe, you're a FNG that arrives onto the station, being pressented with a beautiful environment in my opinion(The game is from 2004). As you take ytour first steps up the stairs and down the hall, you hear a man say "I've gotta get out of here...", as you proceed to your Bio-Scan. After your Bio-Scan you go and meet the management and get a warm-ish "Welcome to Mars, Marine".  After a short cutscene you resume the game and go down the hallways near the bathroom where I man named T. Washington is likely to come out and greet you. You continue into the kitchen and see a worker, and two soldiers whom greet you, callIng you a newbie in the process, afterwards they say "Come back and have a drink when you have some spare time". You can stay here and pick up the PDA of Adam Berneche off of the counter, or go and play super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3, a parody arcade game in the Doom Universe, as you continue out of the kitchen and through the corridors of the Union Aerospace Corporation's hallways you'll lIkely get the feeling that sh*t's about to go down. You are greeted by another marine who raises his left arm and tells you that Sergeant Kelly wants to see you asap, you follow his directions but get distracted by a door and are coaxed into entering where you find the armory, containing a video disc, and a prototype plasma gun that the UAC is working on (Which you get to use further in the game).  You leave the room and go see the Sarge, after a brief cutscene, you leave the room and follow a robot to a door back the way you came, there's a cabinet there on the right next to the elevator that is locked with the code "396" which is mentioned in Adam Berneche's audio log in his PDA. You get into the elevator and continue, after you exit you're greeted by marine security that says "Welcome to the dungeon, Marine, the most unexciting place on Mars." He say's he's going to give you armor and a security pistol before he can pass you through, you grab your gear and he performs a radio test that succeeds, you  continue further into the level and are tempted to shoot every civillian around you just for the hell of it, two of which are carrying a PDA. You keep on moving through the level until you're at an airlock, you go through to the other sie as fast as you can so you don't die from deprivation of oxygen, You are now in a somewhat creepier, darker building. You get into a nother elevator when Sergeant Kelly radios you telling to hurry and get the scientist to get your ♥♥♥ back to Mars City, after you exit you enter one last room, where you're presented with a cutscene of you and an Asian scientist who says "Wha-.? NO, no please! I must get this communication out! They have to be warned while there is still time! You don't understand!... The Devil is real.. I know... I built his cage..", after he says so you see on the security monitors that something goes wrong with a teleporter and Hell's demons and forces begin to break loose and enter through it, flooding into Mars City and everywhere elso on the base as fast as possible, the Scientist is posessed by a spirit and tries to kill you. You shoot him and you hear footsteps at the door you came in. You reload your trusty pistol and get ready for a fight unlike any other....\n\nPros+(This is the vanilla game by the way, no BFG edition, BFG edition has achievements, remade graphics, etc.)\nGreat graphics, even to this day.(D3 was released in 2004)\nYou can run it on a potato\nGood atmosphere\nUnique, and extremely well designed enemies and introduction cutscenes to them, all of which get your heart pounding\nGood jumpscares, believe it or not....\nSolid sound design with ambient noises that will startle you\nEasy to mod the game\nGood Resurrection of Evil expansion pack\nSolid story and great ending\n\nCons-\nBoring corridors alot of the time\nLack of enemies where they're needed, and sometimes in completely ridiculous or in completely unnecessary spots\nNo old Doomguy >:(\nYou rely on the shotgun almost the entire game\nNo achievements\nExtremely DEAD multiplayer, even more dead than AVP is.\nPLEASE release one more patch with updated video options and widescreen support.\n\nI'd give the single player a 8/10 and the multiplayer a 5/10.

I would describe this as a haunted attraction where the (well costumed) actors actually attack you and you have to fight back. It's a ride, an experience and DOOM3 pulls it off nicely. The story is far from strong, but it's compelling enough and, with some imagination, can lead to more horrifying conclusions. The voice acting is good and, to reiterate, the sounds are what drives this home.

Just began to play it again and it's still great!!! It combines a great plot, classic shooter and an intense horror feel. Despite that improvements have been made in the genre since it was released (aiming down a crosshair is one thing I miss), DOOM 3 still outshines most shooters today. Far more original, nor just ANOTHER Call of Duty, far more thrilling, far more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants... In general, just far better!\n\nFor a lot of the game, you are too low on ammo to just blast away with your best gun, its dark, there are way to many corners for nasty creepers to hide behind and "oh god, please don't look in that mirror!!!". Don't buy the BFG edition, it sucks every spectacular thing out of the original. One of the most originals ideas is that you have to use a flash-light a lot of places to see what's going on, BUT you can't use a flash-light and wield a big gun at the same time... So, if you want to see, you have to lay the gun down...\n\nFlash-light vs. gun, darkness, creepers hiding behind the corners, demons appearing from behind you, whispering voices, flickering lights...

It not only looks better (and still looks great even today) but the combat is better as well. The enemy AI is better so it makes combat less repetitive, more exciting, and there are a lot of different enemies, some of which appeared in the old games (but are updated with better AI in Doom 3), and some new.\n\nWhile some weapons aren't realistic all of them are enjoyable to use.\n\nThe only thing I really hate about this game is, sadly, the final boss. It is one of the easiest if not the easiest final boss I know of. I don't know what id was thinking. It makes for an anticlimactic ending.\n\nBut don't let that discourage you. Along with Half-Life 2 (which by the way also has a very easy ending), I've played Doom 3 so many times I've lost count (not on this Steam account, though).

The game is genuinely challenging on harder difficulties, including Nightmare mode, and features excellent gunplay.\n\nSound design is masterful, as well as the game's artistic style. Everything looks and sounds right in every situation. The aesthetic of Hell in particular is particularly unnerving, you can tell that the guys who made this had a good time imaging creepy stuff.\n\nAll the guns from DOOM return, from the lowly pistol, all the way up to the devastating BFG 9000. Another of the game's strong points is that every gun, including the aformentioned pistol, feels powerful.\n\nThe monsters also return, with a few new ones, and have been given (at the time) modern facelifts. Imps are just as annoying as ever, and Hell Knights are particularly terrifying.\n\nThe game is also jam packed with lore and collectable goodies to discover. Read the PDAs of your fallen comrades to reveal personal emails and voice recordings which tell you everything about the situation, as well as other funny situations they may have been in.\n\nAll in all, DOOM 3 provides a memorable horror FPS experience which, despite its age, holds up well to this day.

An easy fix is to rename "Doom3.exe".\n\nYou're a space marine and you fight zombies and demons  in the UAC facilities on Mars and later on go to hell. Literally. Rather than the extremely fast paced shooting galleries the old Doom games were known for, Doom 3 takes a slower horror approach and it surprisingly works out very well. Play this game late at night with little to no background noise; it really gets your blood pumping.\n\nPros:\n-Great atmosphere\n-Large variety of weapons (if you're familiar with Doom, you will know which ones they are)\n-Lenghy single player campaign\n-The constant fear of enemies behind you or appearing out of nowhere keeps you on your toes\n-Slow pace in terms of completing levels, but has fast paced combat.\n-Large variety of enemies\n-Graphics hold up well for a game from 2004\n-EXCELLENT mod support ranging from custom levels, custom enemies, and graphical tweaks and uprades\n\nCons:\n-No one plays multiplayer\n-Great gameplay doesn't make up for the lack of deep storytelling\n-Too many Imps. Seriously, there are other demons in this game. I don't know why they chose Imps for everything.\n\nI would recommend this game with Sikkmod and if your computer can handle it, the Absolute HD Mod for gameplay tweaks and tons of grapical upgrades.

It has a good atmosphere, and what I mean by that it puts you in the middle of a demon invasion and there are other people. GASP! I do comapare it to Dead Space and that game put you by yourself a whole lot! Here at least you find random scientist wholed up in a corner trying not to get eaten.\n\nThe horror aspect of this game comes from jumpscares. After a while, you'll learn to run up to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and blow them with the shotty. But The jumpscares don't get tiresome, well at least for me. You expect them, but you'll never know from where, which is good.\n\nThis game also features the old health pack health system that is not present in today games, which is a shame by the way. This health mechanic makes sure that you're not just running like a muppet in the middle of an ambush from god knows where and a couple of seconds later, you are knee deep in ♥♥♥♥. This makes you think before oyu turn the corner.\n\nThe exploration is the typical go here, you need a key, get jumped by a gang of baddies, then proceed, but what makes it worth it is the audio logs. They may contain passwords, reports of things that make the PDA user ♥♥♥♥ their pants, the narration of some scientist that are just the victim of the {Spoiler] *#@$%$%^%$&$%&%$^&* and the 4325rtge45234r2 35, and that part when sdi02394q09wue. [end spoilers.] adds a layer of depth that no COD brought to the single player campaign. Hell, ( no pun intended,) sometimes it's necessary to listen to the droning of a tired out worker that just gets his stuff stolen and has to use a locker to secure his belongings and luck has it his PDA has the password.\n\n\nOver all, if you had a chance to play Dead Space, you will love this game. It does drag out a little, but then again some of today's games are too damn short to justify $60. If you get the chance, get The Ultimate Doom collection along with ROE. This game is worth the money if you're into action horror games.\n\n* Note* you will have to tinker with some files for Doom 3 to get it running 1920x1080, but its an easy fix.","August 1, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite being hard work making a sequel to the eternal classic DOOM and DOOM 2 Hell on Earth, Id software did it anyway and delivered a game quite similar to both of them, but evolved and adapted to modern graphics and gaming mechanics. DOOM 3 has it all: Imps, possessed soldiers, helldemons, flying skulls, hellbarons and the BFG. It also has a fun and scary storyline about the martian base being slowly devoured by hell due to teleporting experiments and some new elements, like the soul cube. A decent FPS game for newer gamers and a fun nostalgic game for everyone who played the original DOOM.","July 8, 2012","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would describe this as a haunted attraction where the (well costumed) actors actually attack you and you have to fight back. It's a ride, an experience and DOOM3 pulls it off nicely. The story is far from strong, but it's compelling enough and, with some imagination, can lead to more horrifying conclusions. The voice acting is good and, to reiterate, the sounds are what drives this home. If you like this game, check out the Resurrection of Evil expansion.","July 2, 2015","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a good atmosphere, and what I mean by that it puts you in the middle of a demon invasion and there are other people. GASP! I do comapare it to Dead Space and that game put you by yourself a whole lot! Here at least you find random scientist wholed up in a corner trying not to get eaten.\n\nThe horror aspect of this game comes from jumpscares. After a while, you'll learn to run up to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and blow them with the shotty. But The jumpscares don't get tiresome, well at least for me. You expect them, but you'll never know from where, which is good.\n\nThis game also features the old health pack health system that is not present in today games, which is a shame by the way. This health mechanic makes sure that you're not just running like a muppet in the middle of an ambush from god knows where and a couple of seconds later, you are knee deep in ♥♥♥♥. This makes you think before oyu turn the corner.\n\nThe exploration is the typical go here, you need a key, get jumped by a gang of baddies, then proceed, but what makes it worth it is the audio logs. They may contain passwords, reports of things that make the PDA user ♥♥♥♥ their pants, the narration of some scientist that are just the victim of the {Spoiler] *#@$%$%^%$&$%&%$^&* and the 4325rtge45234r2 35, and that part when sdi02394q09wue. [end spoilers.] adds a layer of depth that no COD brought to the single player campaign. Hell, ( no pun intended,) sometimes it's necessary to listen to the droning of a tired out worker that just gets his stuff stolen and has to use a locker to secure his belongings and luck has it his PDA has the password.\n\n\nOver all, if you had a chance to play Dead Space, you will love this game. It does drag out a little, but then again some of today's games are too damn short to justify $60. If you get the chance, get The Ultimate Doom collection along with ROE. This game is worth the money if you're into action horror games.\n\n* Note* you will have to tinker with some files for Doom 3 to get it running 1920x1080, but its an easy fix.","August 1, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read on for more info.\n\nA departure from the series' roots, the third DOOM makes itself into an atmospheric game, much like Metro. However, unlike Metro this game is not a lot of fun to play.\n\nThe best thing by far is the re-imaginations of the monsters, weapons and other entities from the original games. The climate comes just behind. Unfortunately, the combat is possibly the weakest point.\n\nAs I said in my joke-review the gameplay is about walking down maze-like corridors and stopping every few seconds to deal with an ambush. That would have been somewhat alright if not for the fact that a lot of these sections are identical. There are very few areas in the game which try to mix things up a bit. The weapons feel clumsy and cumbersome just like the movement, which doesn't help.\n\nThe only thing that justifies buying this game is the last third, which shakes up the level design of metallic corridors with hellish growth and lava. Enemies appear in groups of bigger than 2 at a time and from different angles. I sincerely enjoyed that part, but leading up to it felt tedious and I wouldn't want to do it again. Also, mods.","March 14","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just began to play it again and it's still great!!! It combines a great plot, classic shooter and an intense horror feel. Despite that improvements have been made in the genre since it was released (aiming down a crosshair is one thing I miss), DOOM 3 still outshines most shooters today. Far more original, nor just ANOTHER Call of Duty, far more thrilling, far more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants... In general, just far better!\n\nFor a lot of the game, you are too low on ammo to just blast away with your best gun, its dark, there are way to many corners for nasty creepers to hide behind and "oh god, please don't look in that mirror!!!". Don't buy the BFG edition, it sucks every spectacular thing out of the original. One of the most originals ideas is that you have to use a flash-light a lot of places to see what's going on, BUT you can't use a flash-light and wield a big gun at the same time... So, if you want to see, you have to lay the gun down...\n\nFlash-light vs. gun, darkness, creepers hiding behind the corners, demons appearing from behind you, whispering voices, flickering lights...

Doom 3 takes a slightly different approach than the previous entries in the series. The story and atmosphere play more like Half-Life than classic Doom but that's actually a good thing. Instead of just mindlessly running around shooting monsters you'll be carefully checking out every corner and room for precious health, ammo and PDAs so you can figure out what the hell has been going on. It's very cinematic. The flashlight plays a key role in this as you'll need it to see into the shadows. Players that want every first person shooter to be the same will be annoyed by this but it's inclusion kicks the intensity up a few notches.\n\nSpeaking of light this is the type of game you'll want to play with all the lights off (or not). Even over a decade later the visuals and dark atmosphere are still impressive and often just downright unnerving. The human characters are a little on the blocky side but the demons, futuristic machinery and realtime lighting do a great job in immersing you in the environment. The sound design is also very well done with very effective and creepy ambiant noises. There is some seriously scary stuff going on in the walls and air vents in this game. Headphone users be advised.\n\nNote: This is the version to buy and not the "BFG Edition" which has brightened graphics and screws up key features (flashlight is no longer selectable). Basically just a misguided cash grab. Avoid.","January 27","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it today, and I still didnt like it.\n\npositives:\n+ I LOVE the interactive display screens. I can't understand why this is not used in more games.\n+ story around the game (not main story) is quite interestiog. I enjoyed the mars history, audio logs etc\n+ graphics was great, and the light and darkness is interesting even now.\n+ level design can be good.\n\n\nnegatives:\n- what I hate most, are enemies. they are not hard, they are not strong, the AI is nonexistent. all that is going on is, that they jump at you from darkness, or spawn behind your back. that is it, all they can do. that is all the game offers. monsters just spawns around you because reasons.\n- if you recieve a hit, your screen will jerk violently, often causing you to miss another shot. even if it is weakest spider, it will kick your screen and it is just stupid. you think you will move away? wrong, most likely just spawned another impe behind your back. it is not challenging, it is just stupid and annoying and frustrating. shotgun soldier will kick you back 2 meters with each shot. machine gun soldier can be so annoying. what tought this is good idea???\n- after a while you just run trough dark areas, knowing that that enemies will jump you but stopped caring. no matter if you move carefully or run, they will jump you either way.\n- I actually hated most of the guns. don't know why, first half of the game I used shotgun (so blind you use it at ranges slightly higher then chainsaw) and machinegun (only enjoyable and accurate gun), second half I added chaingun (little less blind then shotgun) and plasma gun (super slow projectiles). 50 granades, 50 rockets and 25 bfg charges? meh, who cares. granades were specially useless.\n- for whatever reason, you can't interrupt reloading (change to different weapon) to change weapon. except shotgun\n- you have to choose if you want to use flashlight or weapon. that probably should create horror atmosphere, but it is just stupid.  you can choose, if you want to see the enemies, or shoot them. who came with that idea?\n- you have to edit cfg files to set graphical settings.\n\n\nI don't know what people see at this game. 4/10","December 29, 2015","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/9050/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","DOOM 3 is a serviceable 2004 horror shooter that just happens to be a Doom game, for better and worse. It's not quite on the level of its forebears, but it's not terrible either. At the very least, download Killatomate's Realistic Weapons mod to make your firepower not garbage. And avoid the BFG Edition - it screws with gameplay balance, and is incompatible with mods, of which there's plenty to make OG look even better than BFG. (I didn't like the BFG ports of classic Doom either: they modify the games too much and run poorly.)\n\n\nSo hey, this is still Doom, right? There's too much ammo and health lying around to really qualify Doom 3 as survival horror, so it must be. While I think the game could absolutely have used more open spaces, I don't mind the game mainly taking place in linear corridors because they are very good corridors.\n\nLot of PDAs lying around to collect though, and only like two or three female characters in the entire game - so you know this is a 2004 production. It's a shame as linear as it is, since a branching plot point (an actual one, mind) would have been a good gameplay point, not to mention a bit of a callback to the classics.\n\nThe biggest criticism of Doom 3's gameplay is that every other encounter is a cheap 'gotcha' or some sort of monster closet, most of which get predictable after a while. The originals did this too, but not nearly as much nor as egregiously. System Shock had respawning enemies; maybe that would have worked here instead.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game builds enough tension that it can get away with jumpscares every so often, and it's not like they're obnoxious full-screen "find the hidden object" crap, but Silent Hill this ain't. While I would argue Doom 3 actually pulls off its horror much better than it does its terror, that doesn't excuse the entirely scripted monster closets getting old after a whole.\n\n\nDoom 3's story is...well, it exists. For the most part, it doesn't detract from the game. You might wonder what Doom is doing with such an overt story, but really, iD couldn't not write one in 2004. Games had come a long way since 1993, and writing in games at the time was just starting to become more than a vestigial element. To illustrate my point, they've come even further since 2004 with MachineGames' Wolfenstein: The New Order - a continuation of iD's only shooter franchise that's older than Doom - having writing that actually adds to that game.\n\nAnyway. One of the two main problems here are the lack of sound effects in the audio logs, a problem I'll mention the System Shock games didn't have. The other is the fact that Dr. Betruger is by far the most corny, hokey, Snidely Whiplash-evil character in any FPS ever, and that's REALLY saying something.\n\nI don't even need to spoil the fact that he's evil because you see it coming from a mile away the moment you first see him. His name is literally German for 'betrayal'. He veers between creepy and funny nearly every time you hear him say you're DOOOOOMED!!! MUAHAHAHA!!! He's the one vestigal element Doom 3 would have been almost entirely better off without.\n\n\nThis game was honestly never going to live up to the originals. Mainly because the originals were much more progressive and envelope-pushing at exactly the right time, and were much more flexible to boot, but also because they were products of the late stage of videogaming's 'childhood'.\n\nDoom 3, on the other hand, is a product of video gaming's adolescent period. It trades those gracefully aging MIDI riffs and pixels for surplus buckets of grimness and horror, a look that while probably very fluid and good for 2004, doesn't hold up that well today without mods. It's worth mentioning though that the game's code is very well-written, and that the most taxing element for 2004 PCs - the dynamic lighting engine - is still fairly impressive.\n\nBoth of those accomplishments come with a caveat, however, in that the whole game could frankly be summed up as a long-form tech demo for the developers' id Tech 4 engine, which they later leased out to other developers. I will, at least, praise the interactive computer interfaces as being truly excellent and something I'd like to see more of today.\n\nUltimately? If you can deal with the fact that, taking everything into account, this game has kind of aged more than the originals in its series, you will find a Doom game that's still pretty entertaining at times.","March 6, 2013","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that this game is bad but I don't find the jump scares even slightly scary. The mechanics are your typical FPS back in the day and it's quite playable. The music is ♥♥♥♥ing awsome for main menu and also the ambience sound can be erie. The graphics back then looked quite good but it all looked similar since it was mostly generic corridors I was running down. I'd recommend this if you can get it cheap but it's not a good game by today's standards. BTW Windows vista/7 being not supported is a lie. Works quite well actually out of the box but widescreen resolutions require some file editing. Haven't tested it on Windows 10 yet.","May 5","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's atmosphere is very vivid and frightning at times, and eerie, kinda like System Shock 2. A lot of jumpscares in this game. I really don't care for it on PC as much as I would for Xbox or Playstation. For me on PC, some of the enemies become invisible at times and framerate begins to drop and textures glitch out. Other than that, this game is great. 8/10. I highly reccomend giving Doom 3 a try if you havn't played a Doom game before.","May 22","true","5.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Belive it or not Doom 3 did something better then original Dooms , the scare. I wasnt really scared in old Dooms but in this one there id that scare element which I love.\n\nMy biggest complain about Doom 3 is that were always in some hallway or a small room.\n\nBuy this .","May 21","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
