I'm glad it was only $0.49, and it wasn't an expensive title. I was scrolling down the mass amount of negative reviews, asking myself why it has such horrible feedback. I thought to myself, it looks like a great game! It couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. There is literally nothing to do in this game. You start, you pick up an axe, that's it. There is no GUI, there is no ESC or TAB menue. You walk around in Russia, thats it. I always made a distinction between a full feldged game, and a sequence of possible actions and kinetic, moving pictures. In this case, these are where the lines blur. This game IS a sequence of pre-generated pictures, there is nothing to do. It is basically, walking around in Siberia simulator. This game is normally being sold for $1.99, yet it is not a game, it is a pece of trash. I wish I didn't have to waste my time writing this useless review, but I want to pass my opinion, in order to amass a large population of people who agree.

That's pretty much it. Oh, sorry - and also cleverly tagged it as Early Access, so as to deflect any criticism that the "game" is little more than a hollow shell, and avoid having to refund any money:\n\nOriginally posted by "Steam Early Access":Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development.\nNote the text from the quote that I underlined - it means that Valve absolves the developer from having to fix, finish or otherwise modify the "game", no matter how broken or incomplete it is. Which it currently is.\n\nIf you are still considering a purchase, I would recommend that you at least postpone it until it gets out of Early Access, and check back then.\n\nFinally, you can check out what Jim Sterling has to say about both this game specifically, and the trend of releasing bought asset packs as complete games on Steam in general.","May 25, 2015","false","0.1"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","27","28","2","0"

The joys.)\n- Thirst and hunger don't seem to plummet too fast currently (although because of what you're limited to doing in the game this wouldn't be a massive issue anyway).\n- If you want to trip your t#ts off just drive off the end of the road and become one with the  abyss.\n\n---\n- Due to the present state of the game there really isn't a whole lot to do but walk about (more on the walking later) and have a nosey inside buildings.\n- The walking pace feels like you're being sucked into tar, it's painfully slow, though there isn't much to see at the moment so whether that's a good thing I'm not sure.\n- There is a sprint function (shift), but just don't press A or D thinking it will make you turn or strafe because currently all the left and right keys do is slow you down to a snail's pace and stop you sprinting.\n- Lots of errors* and crashes seemingly induced by walking in the wrong direction or looking at grass wrong.\n- You can't seem to store food currently so you have to just stuff it in your face the minute you find it.\n\n*I don't know why it breaks, I'm not a learned person, I don't understand game bugs and ♥♥♥♥. But the game likes breaking currently. A lot.\n\nOverall I don't see this game as a waste of my money (emphasis on the my) but I currently only load it up about once a week just to see how it's coming along. It has very little in the way of replayability and in my opinion I'm a bit baffled as to why it's on Steam in its current state. I understand the whole Early Access thing but there just doesn't seem to be enough substance currently for it even to be early access.\nThat's just my opinion though. I don't think this will ever be one of those great, memorable games but it has the potential to at least be enjoyable if the dev keeps plugging away like they have been doing.\nI may give it the ol' Caeser thumbs up once there's more to it.","May 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","0"

So expect your game to last about 10 minutes per session before your character keels over.\nIt just seems to be a collection of assets and some rudimentary game mechanics scripts at the moment nothing more.\n\nThere is early access and there's primordial access, this is the latter and not recommended.","May 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The "game" starts you in the middle of nowhere on a road. There are no indications on which way to go, or what to do next. I tried walking to the gas station, but it started to get dark, and by dark I mean the screen went black, including the UI. Then shortly after, there was red pulsing, and I died.  Reload, try walking up the vertical mountain, I get stuck in the scenery at the top, screen goes black,  then red, then I die. And repeat... Apparently this game was made using the free Unity3D engine and a $40 asset available on their site, that someone else built, and then released this as a game.

The game is also abandonware - there hasn't been an update for this game for nearly three months.\n\nValve, you have knowingly made money from this and so have the developers of this game. This is not acceptable. This is not what the Early Access program was meant to be about and instead we have this total abuse of Early Access.

However there's more beneath the surface.\nRight off the bat here's the limited controls\nRun-Shift\nCrouch-C\nPick up-E\nDrop-R\nJump-Space\nChop-Left Click\nZoom-Right Click\nI decided I would play and try The District to the fullest extent that I could. At one in the morning in a dark room with a headset audio output I cringed when listening to the loud crunches of stepping in the snow. However after the first night I found myself hearing murmurs in the air. I was standing at the Hungarian prisoner of war momument (Google translating the Hungarian and Russian text) when I noticed this new sound. Along with that I heard birds chirping. Interesting I thought. In investigating the murmurs I approached the small settlement and realized it was the radio I had seen before that was mute. It was playing (assumingly) Russian army?... Marching?..music... It suddenly played this on repeat. By my second night I found there was a specific tree type I could cut down. Woo! After hauling logs into the settlement it started getting dark, For fear of change I tried climbing into the attic of a house. I glitched up the ladder somehow and sat there for a bit. Then I heard the howling... I heard the chants of wolves over the mountain tops. I may have crapped my pants at that point. After listening to holws over and over along with Russian chants I was freaked out. On day three I found the construction site and made it my goal to build my house. After three days in game, crapping my pants, and building a house here I am. Overall 4/10. The game needs obvious improvement but for what it's worth I think It's interesting.","May 28","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can't use it in any way so you will regret picking it up as it block your view, but you CAN!\nAfter few minutes of running around (with your loyal axe in a hand) you will be stopped out of nowhere. "Oh invisible walls, haven't met one in a while" you think as you bump on another invisible wall! "Oh, that's convenient! Now I know i'm in a corner!" and you change your direction towards nothing once again...\n\nSo after some minutes having fun with invisible walls and dead empty nature you came across a village. There you have weird looking stacks of hay (in a deep winter) and some fence here and there... AND HOUSES! Omg!\nSo you slowly aproach nearby house looking through a window  if you can see something interesting. No need to say that you look as a serial killer lunatic as you are lurking around with your beloved axe. But nothing to worry about. All houses are pretty much empty. Except for one where you will find out some boxes and chairs to play with as their are movable!\n\nSo after some time bumping into boxes you decide to exit a game (using Alt+F4 as this game does not contain working pause menu) and move to a real fun that this game offers... Reading updates (which are named quite as expected 1.03 etc... BUT! these are not a versions but dates when an update came out! Not confusing at all right?). There you can see that developer is working really hard on inventory and weapons as it will come with a next update... Well atleast thats what every update says last 6 months. But good job with changing a main menu!  :)\n\nBut because you paid just €0.20 for this, you will collect your cards, hopefully sell them and move to something that makes you laugh just as much as this did...","May 16","false","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","3"

This game PLAYS bad. this game SOUNDS bad. Even in Duke Nukem: Forever, playing with ♥♥♥♥ is actually FUN! Every thing about the game makes much rather play Day One: Garys Incident... So many problems, such as being dehydrated within seconds after running, Can't jump, stiff movement, delayed movement, no story, you LITERALLY spawn in the middle of a road. There's so many more problems, and I understand this is early access, and hard to create games, but I feel like it should had been worked on a little longer before early access, or it should just be a Free to Play.

The controls are so bad, when you press Forward, you need to hold in your move key for about 2 seconds before you actually move, same with sprinting. Game also has some of the worst sound-effects I've heard in quite some time (+The clumsy walking-stomping sound is also present when in a vehicle, driving...)\nThe menu and settings is so badly translated to English you'd thing they used Google Translate. Doesn't make any sense.\nYou get a few lines of tutorial if you enter Options on the main menu. that's it. Good luck figuring everything else out.\nNow, I was unfortunate enough to get this game in a bundle (amongst other games) for $1.9.

Yes you can fall of the map,yes you can drive trucks,yes you can get sick of this game quickly,yes you can get stuck in the ground,yes it feels like the character barely even knows how to walk.\n\nMore importantly,there is no crafting option in this game,cutting down trees can crash your game,it has happened to me twice already. Yes it was kinda fun to drive off the world,yes the driving in this game actually sucks. Yes this dev seriously needs to put more work in to this game,if he even knows how to build a properly fun game.\n\nIf I thought 29 cents was worth enough to get a refund,don't doubt me for more than a second that I would get a refund within just a second,but other than that i'm keeping the game,as it will surely gather some nice virtual dust and then the dust shal add value to the game and then I will remember that this game is still not worth 29 cents as it will then end up in my virtual trash ben along with my list of super terrible games to never ever play again even if it was to save my life....\n\n-checks my list adding this games name to it-.....oh wait...this is the only game that has officially made my **** list...well then,I know to never buy another "game" from this dev ever again.\n\nSo please if you see my review,never ever ever eevveerr buy this game unless you somehow get it in a bundle with games you actualy wanted. Then you can experince the horrid gameplay just as I did...Also I did have a problem at the beginning of the game on trying get through a door...it took me five minutes to get past a door way!..oh well that's the end of this review. So please remember,this game isn't so bad that it makes it good,it's actually so bad that this game is beyond bad!\n\n-takes five minutes to get out the review door- Grrr how dare this game make doorways so difficult to get through now!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/357770/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\n- Steam Achievements in such an early stage of the game!\n\n- Steam trading cards in such an early stage of the game!\n\n- Ability to adjust view distance and depth of field!\n\n- The game has a working day/night cycle! When the game gets too dark, use your flashlight on 'F'.\n\n- Interactability with in-game items / objects (though the area in which you can do so is very tight).\n\nINDIFFERENT / MINOR BUGS:\n\n- As far as I'm aware, in the current stage, Steam Achievements are unobtainable. I didn't scour every last building for an axe or a working car though. The door-breaking achievement wasn't awarded for the first door I kicked open, so I'm guessing it may be for every last door.\n\n- Current bad Steam integration. I launch this game, and am presented with three different options. "Play The District", "Launch" and "Launch". Options one and two do exactly the same and launch the pre-loader, whereas option three gives me an error message from Steam saying it can't find the file it's trying to launch. This is *probably* going to be fixed with a bug patch, so take this with a grain of salt. I can easily see option one taking you straight into the game, option two launching the pre-loader configuration and option three being removed or replaced with a new game mode.\n\n- The 'options' menus have no option to adjust or mute the audio. This will probably be implemented in the future.\n\n- In the previous point I list two options menus. At this stage, the in-game options menu is different to the main menu option menu. Why is this? Presumably this is also an easy bug-fix for the future.\n\n- No presented control scheme other than the one that is only presented the very first time you click the main menu options.  What's really strange is that this controls screen only appears the very *first* time you open the main menu options. If you clicked through them without reading them, you're left with no way of checking the controls.\n\n- Even if you didn't miss the control screen, the functions listed on the main menu options control screen don't list all the controls. Yes, you can guess that walking would be WASD and looking would be done with the mouse, but this really should still be listed. Also, some things are completely overlooked in the controls that I have no idea about. For example, *something* comes up when you press F12. I have no idea what it is. As the Steam screenshot function uses F12, this really should be mapped to another button, whatever it is.\n\n- If you are moving at *all* when you pause the game, the pause menu spins around uncontrollably.\n\n- There's no ability to go back from the game to the main menu - The 'exit' button just closes the game.\n\n- The flashlight is quite buggy in tight spaces, though even professional games seem to have this problem, so I can't hold this against the developer.\n\n- The character has real difficulty going up stairs and moving smoothly around tight corners.\n\n- You can walk right up the mountains and out of the game world. I know this is only Early Access, but hey, I can't be the only one who tried, right? :)\n\nSERIOUS NEGATIVES:\n\n- LAG. How can you lag in Alpha Stage? I have a top-of-the-line computer, and if mine can't handle it, something is seriously wrong. For that matter, there aren't any videos, there are few audio clips and (almost) stock assets, so *what* exactly is using up all that memory?\n\n- IMPOSSIBLE play in some scenarios. There's currently a bug that seems to affect the entire game resolution. It scales along the height to match the native resolution, but not the width. This can lead to not only visuals getting terribly distorted, but an actual impossibility to play the game in certain resolutions. Go ahead and select any of the *top five* screen resolutions THAT ARE BUILT-IN-OPTIONS for your game resolution and you'll see what I mean - the main menu gets cut off.\n\n- There is something HORRIBLY wrong with the movement that I cannot quite explain. You feel like you're walking in tar, getting 'dragged down'. Switching between walking and 'sprinting' (defined very loosely) can take anywhere up to three seconds. As this talks about 'elements of survival', I'm fairly certain there will be enemies at some point. I would not want to be fighting / running away from enemies with such a delay in the change between walking and sprinting. It even takes the same amount of time to toggle between standing still to regular movement! I don't know how the developer could get the movement system so wrong in a game that relies so heavily on it! I've tried my hand at Unity, and the *default* movement is much better than this!\n\n- This 'game' is almost a direct clone of Unity's "Decayed State" pack www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/22523. The only difference is, this time you're not paying for the Unity assets, you're essentially paying for a poorly-assembled combination of them that you cannot modify in any way.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nDon't buy this game in the current stage. Perhaps it is a worthwhile buy in the future, once some of the core bugs have been resolved, but certainly not at this stage. At this stage, the developer really shouldn't have even released it for free. The concept is lovely, however, the developer sadly does not quite have the skills needed for the project they're trying to undertake. With a few extra developers working on this, it could turn into a great game. Until then, sadly, this game is best passed-over.","May 18, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/recommended/357770/","obsidian_age","Obsidian Age","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obsidian_age/","1718 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\n- Steam Achievements in such an early stage of the game!\n\n- Steam trading cards in such an early stage of the game!\n\n- Ability to adjust view distance and depth of field!\n\n- The game has a working day/night cycle! When the game gets too dark, use your flashlight on 'F'.\n\n- Interactability with in-game items / objects (though the area in which you can do so is very tight).\n\nINDIFFERENT / MINOR BUGS:\n\n- As far as I'm aware, in the current stage, Steam Achievements are unobtainable. I didn't scour every last building for an axe or a working car though. The door-breaking achievement wasn't awarded for the first door I kicked open, so I'm guessing it may be for every last door.\n\n- Current bad Steam integration. I launch this game, and am presented with three different options. "Play The District", "Launch" and "Launch". Options one and two do exactly the same and launch the pre-loader, whereas option three gives me an error message from Steam saying it can't find the file it's trying to launch. This is *probably* going to be fixed with a bug patch, so take this with a grain of salt. I can easily see option one taking you straight into the game, option two launching the pre-loader configuration and option three being removed or replaced with a new game mode.\n\n- The 'options' menus have no option to adjust or mute the audio. This will probably be implemented in the future.\n\n- In the previous point I list two options menus. At this stage, the in-game options menu is different to the main menu option menu. Why is this? Presumably this is also an easy bug-fix for the future.\n\n- No presented control scheme other than the one that is only presented the very first time you click the main menu options.  What's really strange is that this controls screen only appears the very *first* time you open the main menu options. If you clicked through them without reading them, you're left with no way of checking the controls.\n\n- Even if you didn't miss the control screen, the functions listed on the main menu options control screen don't list all the controls. Yes, you can guess that walking would be WASD and looking would be done with the mouse, but this really should still be listed. Also, some things are completely overlooked in the controls that I have no idea about. For example, *something* comes up when you press F12. I have no idea what it is. As the Steam screenshot function uses F12, this really should be mapped to another button, whatever it is.\n\n- If you are moving at *all* when you pause the game, the pause menu spins around uncontrollably.\n\n- There's no ability to go back from the game to the main menu - The 'exit' button just closes the game.\n\n- The flashlight is quite buggy in tight spaces, though even professional games seem to have this problem, so I can't hold this against the developer.\n\n- The character has real difficulty going up stairs and moving smoothly around tight corners.\n\n- You can walk right up the mountains and out of the game world. I know this is only Early Access, but hey, I can't be the only one who tried, right? :)\n\nSERIOUS NEGATIVES:\n\n- LAG. How can you lag in Alpha Stage? I have a top-of-the-line computer, and if mine can't handle it, something is seriously wrong. For that matter, there aren't any videos, there are few audio clips and (almost) stock assets, so *what* exactly is using up all that memory?\n\n- IMPOSSIBLE play in some scenarios. There's currently a bug that seems to affect the entire game resolution. It scales along the height to match the native resolution, but not the width. This can lead to not only visuals getting terribly distorted, but an actual impossibility to play the game in certain resolutions. Go ahead and select any of the *top five* screen resolutions THAT ARE BUILT-IN-OPTIONS for your game resolution and you'll see what I mean - the main menu gets cut off.\n\n- There is something HORRIBLY wrong with the movement that I cannot quite explain. You feel like you're walking in tar, getting 'dragged down'. Switching between walking and 'sprinting' (defined very loosely) can take anywhere up to three seconds. As this talks about 'elements of survival', I'm fairly certain there will be enemies at some point. I would not want to be fighting / running away from enemies with such a delay in the change between walking and sprinting. It even takes the same amount of time to toggle between standing still to regular movement! I don't know how the developer could get the movement system so wrong in a game that relies so heavily on it! I've tried my hand at Unity, and the *default* movement is much better than this!\n\n- This 'game' is almost a direct clone of Unity's "Decayed State" pack www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/22523. The only difference is, this time you're not paying for the Unity assets, you're essentially paying for a poorly-assembled combination of them that you cannot modify in any way.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nDon't buy this game in the current stage. Perhaps it is a worthwhile buy in the future, once some of the core bugs have been resolved, but certainly not at this stage. At this stage, the developer really shouldn't have even released it for free. The concept is lovely, however, the developer sadly does not quite have the skills needed for the project they're trying to undertake. With a few extra developers working on this, it could turn into a great game. Until then, sadly, this game is best passed-over.","May 18, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the town, I found a loaf of bread. An orange bar on the bottom refilled. My blue kept dropping, so I thought It would be best to drive to some nearby body of water, as the sinks didn't seem to be working. It had become quite dark at this point, and the screen began to flash red for some reason- maybe that blue bar dropping too low. I also had to look every time I turned, as if my head was detached from the body that was driving the car, so I didn't quite see when I fell off the edge of the world.I fell for sometime, but then found myself on the outside of a magenta sphere.

The developer sucks even more. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game EVER.\n\nLong version: Got the game for "only" 29 cent. And it's even not worth this much. I'm not kidding here. This game feels so broken. The controls are the worst I've ever seen. There's nothing to do, there aren't even zombies in this game. All you do is searching for food and drinks (which does NOT even spawn randomly) in a little town of approximately 5 houses, if not less.\n\nI don't believe there will ever be updates. Last update was in april 2015. But of course not! The developer is just reselling an asset pack for Unity with very few changes (and it seems the changes even made it worse!). You're a smart guy Mr. developer! Making easy money, right?\n\nBut the biggest joke are the achievements. The first one: "break a door". Nice! This one seems easy! The problem is.. the achievement does not unlock! Next achievement is: "cut down a tree". Seems easy, too! But there's no axe.. And the last one (my favourite): "Ride a car for 10km"..on a map that's 100m². Plus the car's controls are just so bad.. feels like your driving drunk. My character even broke his legs while driving.\n\nAfter 10 minutes wasted by this crap and after finally and successfully uninstalling the game, I was curious who made this masterpiece. I had a premonition.. and surprise! It's Kotach, self-styled indie developer, biggest sucker in history, russian. If I happend to knew this before, I had never bought this. So dear reader learn from my mistakes. Don't buy this game. If you ever see a suspicious game again, look if it's made by Kotach. If it's not you can safely buy it.\n\n\nEDIT: This game finally got a major update. The good thing is that the achievements got removed. Also trading cards were added. And well, it has a new bigger map, better controls, slightly improved graphics, but - it's still unplayable.","June 29, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me help you with that developer.\n\n1. Fix the Axe/Shotgun merge model glitch.\n2. Remove the stupid roadblocks in the road if you plan to have vehicles.\n3. The cars/trucks feels slippery.\n4. The graphics barely pass for a late PS2 title on "Fantastic" settings.\n5. Fix me not being able to enter some houses.\n6. Add furnature (even being thrown around) to the houses to make them more interesting.\n7. Reduce the time it takes to get hungry or thirsty, that's too da** quick.\n8. Sell this game in it's current state for $1.00, not $3.00.\n9. Fix the clunky/glitchy animations for entering vehicles, chopping down wood, etc.\n\nNow I want to help you by giving advice to advance in your development of this game and I hope to God you don't rampage the Steam forums and ban everyone trying to help you.","July 5, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I'd rather not edit old reviews, a time has come in which I regret those words.\n\nThis game is so bad, I find it hard to put into words. It's not even a game to be honest. It's not even an alpha. It's like a  pre-alpha tech demo hacked together by an intern, and the kind that is never actually demo'd to anyone because it's so bad. This game has the dubious honour of being the first (and so far only) product that I refunded on Steam. Normally I'm a fan of the "so bad it's good" shtick, but this is something else - this is a scam.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the achievements don't work. At all. I tried. So unless you want the cards, there is no reason to buy this.\n\nI am a bit mystified as to why Steam allows this to exist on their store for so long. The fact that they have not pulled this yet has significantly damaged their image in my eyes and I can't be the only one.","July 24, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
