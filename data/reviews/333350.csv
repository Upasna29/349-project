The most basic problem is that the UI is a mess and it is hard to figure out what happens each turn.  This is a shame because following the results of what your disciples do each turn is the coolness that should drive this game.  Also, lots of basic things like no way of figuring out what the special abilities of your disciples actually do and a manual that is incomplete in this and many other respects.  For a strategy game, you need facts (for example, how many disciples you can have in each age after the 1st, etc.)\n\nThere is another big reason why you should not buy this game, though.  Some people like early access games.  That's cool.  But releasing a game without disclosing that it is in early access state is dishonest.  Don't feed the liars.  Don't buy this game.","February 12, 2015","false","3.6"," 135 of 183 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","135","183","3","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nokternl/recommended/333350/","nokternl","Nokternl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nokternl/","82 products in account","-----\nTLDR Summary - Well designed and implemented, enjoyable game. It pulls me back to the 'good old days' of turn based strategy games which relied on robust gameplay over pretty graphics to captivate their audiences. Rod Humble has done a great job of putting together this game, and has brought a relatively unique genre to the table with Cults and Daggers. I've really enjoyed it thus far and look forward to playing more!\n\nDefinitely recommended!\n-----\n\nFull - Cults and Daggers is an ambitious game by someone I expected no less from. Rod Humble has a long history in both ground breaking and leading games, and moulding what is often such a controversial topic and period into a game that works this well is a credit to his industry experience and skills.\n\nWith too many games these days, I find myself missing the 'catch' that I used to feel when playing games of old. There seems to be too much emphasis on stunning graphics, amazing sounds, graphic violence or pushing people's buttons that most (not all) of these new titles seem to have lost that thing... the 'catch'... that gameplay elements that make you keep coming back for more.\n\nThis is the first thing I thought when I started to play Cults and Daggers. It was reminiscent of the turn based strategy games of old. Good but not mind blowing graphics, a straight forward interface that is easy to get the hang of and very quick to move through turns once you've played for a few minutes, and a solid but refreshing premise.\n\nThe game is played on a top down map view of the Mediterranean region, where you move your Cult's Disciples from city to city, spreading word of your Cult to the peasants, persuading the Noble born to join your cause, and furthering your Cult's influence over the region in 'positive' ways like building temples and making sacrifices.\n\nWhile you are busy peddling your ideas, keep in mind, you're not the only one with a fine idea and people who want to listen to you! Your 3 opposing Cults want the lion's share of your believer's pie, and will stop at nothing to get it!\n\nKeep your Disciples hidden away from their would be assailants, stoop to their level and assassinate them, or frame them and leave them for the angry mob to deal with... Be careful, however, as such tactics can backfire on you just as easily!\n\nDabble in the occult, call forth amazing miracles to further your cause and influence, and take over the region for the current age. At the end of the Age, time flies forward, changes come to the region and your cults, and it's time to capitalise on your expanded influence, or drag your Cult back from the brink of being forgotten (depending on how you managed the previous Age!)\n\nDo all of this, whilst containing the wrath of the Old Gods who are trying to wipe the slate clean and destroy civilisation as we know it... Don't let the evil areas unattended, lest the Old Gods have their way with the world...\n\nCults and Daggers is an easy to learn, but tough to master game where you can be happily expanding your Cult one turn, and suddenly be in dire circumstances and on the brink of your Cult's destruction the next (especially if you lose a few Disciples at once).\n\nI am really looking forward to playing this game multiplayer, and envisage an even deeper and more fun experience when I get to do so.\n\nThere is NO reason not to get this game. It's a good fun and well designed title, is very robust and playable from release, and I'm sure there will be some more great tweaks to come over time.\n\nDefinitely recommended!\n\nps. review written at some ungodly hour of the morning after playing another long session of Cults and Daggers, so it may not make as much sense as I meant it to! :)","February 12, 2015","true","48.8"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","42","52","0","0"

It's got a great premise, multiple roads to victory, and a rule set that isn't crazy tough to learn. It's surprisingly fun managing the operations of your pet religion, sending marching orders to your disciples, and preaching to or manipulating cities, and quashing the Old Gods.\n\nIt's not perfect. In fact, the events summary at the beginning of each turn is particularly horrible for such a critical part of the game's interface. It could have used a nice scrollable and easily digestible format of events that you can read through. Still, just on uniqueness of premise and solid, challenging strategic play, I'd say it's a good buy for fans of turn-based menu-driven strategy games looking for something different.","February 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It's far from it, and it really should be labelled as Early Access.  Putting this game on an arbitrary ten point scale, I'd score it around a 3.  I originally gave this game a down vote, and I do strongly urge potential buyers to do their own research and know what you're getting in to.\n\nHowever, the concept alone is something fresh and is a breath of fresh air on Steam.  The developer also keeps a close ear on the forums and is taking the criticism and suggestions offered to heart.  As long as the developer keeps putting in the effort to fix things, they'll have my confidence.","February 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Often another cult would end up with enormous amounts of faith (one of the two types of tech points) , and on on occassion my cult seemed to be wiped out during those turns. One session of the autoplay ended with several notices that I could not recruit more disciples, indicating that the AI in control of the player's side was simply spamming the recruit action for no good reason. The flipside is that the game might wind up crippling all the other cults and leave yours dominant at the beginning of the age.\n\nMy main complaint is that this is a strategy game in which a significant portion of the strategy is conducted by a remarkably clumsy AI, rather than the player.","February 13, 2015","false","3.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Yes\nHow would I rate this game? 5-6/10 ... for now, I could see it being a 7-8/10 later\n\nPros: This game has a wonderful premise.   It is pretty easy to understand the basic mechanics and like many games doesnt try to be something that it is not.  I have only played a few hours so far but I can see that there is a lot of potential replayability here.  If you like history, theology, board games and turn based strategy you should pick this game up.\n\nCons: There are map UI issues and playability issues that need to be worked out.  Following what happens every turn can get tedious.  The UI for the summary of a turn (scrolling is difficult) as well as the map UI, no high level view needs tweaking. Some scenarios need reworking, its too easy to kill off disciples with no consequences.  Also, some more story depth needs to be added.  I would love to see evils that take multiple events to defeat and more decisions that have to be made based on historical events of the time.\n\nTo Sum Up:  Overall this game has a lot of potential.  As long as the game designer and developer(s) stick with the game and keep updating it, this game has the chance to be a huge winner.  I am hoping this is the case because I have been waiting a long time for a game like this.","February 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The idea is good but the UI and gameplay needs more work. Even some simple enhancements like a more user friendly event report would lift this game a lot. The occult powers are bizarre and seem to have no attempt to balance out effort vs reward yet they could have been a really fun element of a game like this.\n\nI hope the developer would spend more time working on this game but reading his recent online post, he feels the game is complete.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/recommended/333350/","jagermaestro","Jagermaestro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jagermaestro/","350 products in account","Let me preface with how badly I wanted to enjoy this game.  I had no expectations and realized that, much like Dominions or Crusader Kings, this would take some time to comprehend.  So I gave it several attempts, read the manual (which is sparse on information, unforgivably so) and even put together a mock let’s play to see if while I was talking my way through the game it might change the way I approached it.  Unlike others here, while I don’t love the interface, its no worse than most games of this ilk.   The information is summarized for you in the beginning of the turn, and then left as a hyperlink on the map where it occurred.  Yes the game does not have the most attractive menus and interfaces, but its serviceable and at least themed consistently throughout the game giving it cohesion.  I am not exactly sure what is going on in the main menu and cult customization screens that are so taxing on my system however, as my video card fans really crank up on these screens, but I digress...\n\nThis game is almost so bad as to be embarrassing.\n\n“Cults and Daggers is a big game and somewhat overwhelming to start.” - Manual\n\nBut its not.  It’s little more than a board game that would be slightly too complex to keep track of.  Though I think with some work the superfluous “depth” could have been massaged away and this puppy could have shipped in a box with some tokens that would have been more attractive than some of the graphics on display.\n\nLet’s look at some of the “features”:\n\n“Turn based Strategy over 400 years of history.”\n\nIf you can make it that far without being bored out of your mind.  There are only a handful of actions each disciple can perform, and the lasting effect of these actions are minimal at best.  Dozens of turns worth of effort can be erased nearly instantly and there is no sense of progression.  Its really seven fortyish turn rounds with one of the laziest anti power creep mechanics I have ever seen implemented.  After each of these rounds the computer takes control of all assets and runs around like a drunken idiot... and only then can you start the next round in the aftermath.  Hell they could have just started the game this way too.\n\n“Create and customise your own Faith”\nName it.  Pick a color and hope its not too close to a computer color, or just leave it default for safety.  Then pick your one lackluster power and one disciple out of the completely random set (don’t worry, you get two more completely random followers you can’t pick when you start the game).   Don’t get attached to him or any other, they will die like flies either to murder or execution (like they should) or old age, finding a lover and starting a family or the plague (because apparently this is interesting or adds character to the world).  Don’t be confused either, these aren’t Crusader King characters that die in a humorous way and leave a legacy of disaster in their wake.   It’s a painful prick in a sagaless world to a character you probably won’t even remember the name of.\n“Procedurally generated technology tree and adventure system”\nI don’t even know what the hell this is even on the list for.  This is the worst use of procedurally generated content I have ever seen.  I assume by “technology tree” they ment the miracles, blessings and spells list which are about as colorful as the headliner at a nickleodeon.  The spells are as creative as, a small bonus to one of your stats, a small amount of silver in all your cities, converting a few nobles or… transforming into an animal (disclaimer, I haven’t tried this one, the only one that sounds interesting).  The “procedural” part must be the naming and bonus amount they apply and perhaps their prerequisites.  I would not be proud enough of this to even list it as a feature.\n.\n“In depth modelled spying system allows for deep subterfuge”\nThis is the game I guess?  You can be hidden, or found.  There are actions you can do while hidden that will reveal you… or won’t.\n\n“Complete ambient music Album "Cults and Daggers" included”\nI don’t know what this means.  Is these assets created just for the game?  I didn’t get a set of MP3s like I did with Hotline Miami.  Nothing memorable here.\n\n“Single player. Hotseat & PBEM multiplayer”\nI should hope it had one of these.\n\nThis game is shallow, way too reliant on RNG to feel strategic and ultimately feels like spinning your wheels and going nowhere.  There is no joy in winning a round of this game.\n\nTo the inevitable staunch defender:\nIf you think I just don’t get it, am not qualified or are just one of those kids these days that doesn’t know what it was like, I would encourage you to look at my library of games and playtimes.  The first game I bought was Interplay’s 10 Year Anthology and El Fish.\n\nI want this game to exist just as much as you do, but I am able to realize when someone just didn’t put all the parts together right in order to make a game this complex a meaningful enjoying experience.  This game should be in early access and is no where complete enough to justify a 30 dollar price tag.  Even for less I wouldn’t recommend it.","February 13, 2015","false","8.0"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","13","28","0","0"

The concept is fresh and the potential is almost limitless but the UI makes it just about unplayable. A simple single screen summary of what happens to each cult for each turn would really help. It's silly to be getting reports slowly scrolling by about disciples you've already been told have kicked the bucket.
