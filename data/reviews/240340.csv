This game plays the same way "Dragon's Lair" does except the story line is in outer space instead of a medieval theme.  Gameplay in this Steam version is customizable. You can play as the game was released in the arcades or you can play with visual and audio cues. There are varying degrees of difficulty and Steam Achievements to farm for as well.\n\nThis game along with "Dragon's Lair 1" and "DL 2" are basically old arcade laser disc games.  The game would play the laser disk and your game would start.  You (as the player) would have to make the correct move(s), as the laser disk played (usually an animated movie).  Making an incorrect move would start an alternative movie clip that usually showed you dying.  These Steam versions do a great job of recreating that feel.   An excellent game but ONLY BUY ON SALE !","July 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The last masterpiece to be made by the Bulth team that was any good but what a way to finish off the Franchise that started with Dragons Lair.\nSpace Ace is identical to the Laser Disc version that haunted us old school gamers back in the day by being incredibly hard to finish, mostly due to the fact that we didn't have enough coins to keep whacking in the arcade box to continue haha.\nThis is the 3rd game in the Bluth Laser Disc franchise and to say that this was the best looking game that existed back in the late 80s and 90s is a gross understatement, back then I was amazed that you could actually interact with a cartoon!\nThe game itself is not very complex (you respond to directional cues/icons on screen) but is instead entertaining and rewarding.  It makes you want to continue on just to see more and more of the cartoon antics and story, not to mention the hillarious death scenes.\nIf you are an old school gamer or liked the Dragons Lair games or you are a collector of classic games then do not miss this for your game collection, this was part of one of the biggest milestones for games during the late 80s and 90s.\nFinally for those out there like me who played this as a young teenager simply buy now and just soak up the nostalgia whilst reliving those great memories of a miss spent youth.\nAn absolute treasure!","July 20, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

You got infinite lives, so you'll beat the game in about... 72 minutes on Normal (captain) difficulity without move guide.
