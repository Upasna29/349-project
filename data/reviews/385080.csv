I realize that it's still in early access, but according to the news on the store page, full launch is expected by April 2016. It's because of this fact, and the posts indicating patches and updates that I decided that this was finally the time to take a look at it. I had really high hopes, even though I was expecting a minor glitch or two.\n\nWhat I found instead was a game that I simply cannot play. Firstly, the game does not have full controller support, as indicated. At best, it's got partial support. I was unable to start the game, or even go to full-screen, without using the mouse. The menu didn't function correctly, and it appeared as if perhaps this was one of the features that had not yet been finished.\n\nI began with the tutorial option, but it didn't work for me, so I decided to just try the play option. Again, I had to use the mouse to begin the game with "Book 1," and when the game did start, I experienced several difficulties and oddities.\n\nFirstly, the screen would waver, like a mirror image or looking through water. I have no idea if this is intentional or because of a design issue, but it made it impossible for me to see my character and what I was doing. All the while, though, this side-scrolling platformer is continuing to move, so that resulted in "sudden death."\n\nThe next thing I noticed was a sudden slowing of animations and movement on the screen. This most often occurred for me while my character was in motion or in the air in mid-jump.\n\nI attempted several times to finish the first level but couldn't, so I had the idea to see if I could go to "Book 2" without having actually finished "Book 1." It turned out that I could, though it's probably not a good thing that this was possible. Again turning to the mouse to launch the level, I made a few successful jumps, popped off a couple shots with my gun and noticed that the shots seemed to be moving much slower than they probably should. I figured that I could deal with that and just kept jumping, determined to play this game that I'd been anticipating.\n\nThis is when my screen started wavering yet again and then a very odd thing happened. I'd landed onto a lower building, but a split-second later, the building disappeared. My character remained stuck in an odd position in the middle of my screen, and everything just froze. I couldn't believe I was actually seeing what I was seeing, so I took a screen shot and then tried to restart the level.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to use any of the controls or the mouse. I hit Alt+Tab and closed the game screen, but even that didn't work. Next, I tried to close Steam, but I kept getting an error message that Steam couldn't close because Guardians of Victoria was running. With no game screen to close, and no option to force quit, I had no choice but to reboot in order to regain control over my laptop.\n\nI can't even express how disappointed I am. I love indie games, steampunk, and platformers, so I was truly excited about this game. I can see from some of the posts that the developer has had quite a struggle with this game, and I sympathize with that. Unfortunately, though, I really cannot recommend the game in it's current state. I will, however, invite the developer to reach out to me when the game is truly finished. At that point, I will absolutely give the game another try and revise my review.\n\n\n*Review written exclusively for Good Games Giveaways & Reviews","February 29","false","5.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","5"
