A nice selection of tracks and great riding physics - the reflex controls make for a very fluid ride. Most other MX games feel very stiff and lacking in comparison when it comes to the flow of reflex.\n\nBut man what a frustrating, buggy and basic online experience. Lots of glitches (some very entertaining) but most just add to the frustration. Player collision cannot be disabled, so it's not uncommon to be taken out / take out by laggy warping players, or players that are just desyncd...probaby the most frustrating thing of all.\n\nEpic MX racing when its actually working though as you react to terrain deformation and scrub your way past riders.\n- Enough to make you keep coming back for more punishment for years.\n- But at the same time, enough to make you want to snap your keyboard or smash your controller  if you are experiencing the dark side of online reflex !!! **see paragraph 2**","January 30, 2014","true","421.1"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","86","104","0","6"

The newest entry, Reflex, attempts to combine the best of both worlds: outlandish tricks and environments with finely tuned control. The result is a thrilling, yet flawed racing game. It features intuitive controls and a ton of content, but it's only worth checking out if you're a racing fan with patience, yes of course you need patience because sometimes it can be a frustrating game.","June 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","60","71","0","0"

The physics (while not perfect) offer a great experience today even though this game is five years old. You can whip & control the bike in almost any way you want. There is a big variety of tracks & vehicles as well as customization features. When you get bored of the stock tracks there is a large assortment of custom tracks that are available online. You can also get custom skins for this game (for your rider & bike). If you want to make tracks or skins there is a track & dlc creator. The online works, and what has really got me into this game is competitive online racing. I have a Steam group with currently 148 people in it. We organize races every week or so with a points system and race format. If you are looking for a good MX game with decent looking graphics, good physics and many customization options this is it! Its tons of fun. Even though the game's optimization isn't spick and spam its easy to ignore it. Plug your controller in and have fun.

I have 75+ hours on this game. From motos at the track to coming home and rippin some motos on Reflex is as good as it gets. Don't buy into those new releases from MX vs. ATV BS. THIS is the game to own if you're as involved into the sport as I am. The physics reflect that of real life, the "help me make this jump by preloading the hell out of this ♥♥♥♥♥" is non exsistent! I may have to stretch for some jumps on an actual track but never have I had the magic joystick launch me 20 ft. further than physics/ gravity allows. Although the game is a few years old and lacking in updated gear, bikes, and racers it stilll brings hours of enjoyment. Whether its off season, too nasty out to ride, or you cased that triple all of your buddies told you to huck and are now sitting at home with a broken femur reading this; this is the game to play to scratch the itch. There is also some good DLC from twisteddirt.com that gives you all the tracks in free ride mode as well as the Geico kits and some custom tracks sprinkled in. All in all get this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/55140/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","In personal opinion, MX vs. ATV is the best motocross/offroad series, after ATV Offroad Fury. Since that title is not available on PC, I made due with purchasing this game as a substitute, and gladly upheld it. The game is no more than more than a couple of career races, as well as features a solo/multiplayer free roam mode as well, perfect for if you and a couple of friends would like to show off tricks to each other, or battle it out head to head in a national series race.\n\nThe game has several vehicles to choose from, not only MX/ATV, but also dune buggies and sports trucks. Customization is a little lacking but is quite noticable as you progress through the career and upgrade your parts. Same can be said with visual customization, as there are only a few paint styles to choose from, mostly game brand (maybe they're real? I never took the time to check into it) paints for your vehicle, coming in only 4 or 5 different colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, black).\n\nHead to head can be sometimes challenging, even on easy mode the last levels seemed to be proven more skillful. I easily could beat pro mode games though, it was not too much of a challenge, since this game is aimed at a wider age group audience, the game does have challenging and non challenging areas.\n\nAll in all, the game is perfectly great for anyone who is a racing/offroad fan and would like a good game to relax and play.","December 19, 2015","true","17.9"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","28","32","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/55140/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I'm conflicted to whether I really like it, or simply like it. Trust me, there's a big difference. Either way, the game is definitely worth a look for hardcore racing fans to casual gamers looking to try something new.\n\nMX vs. ATV Reflex is an off road racing and stunt game made for enthusiasts. It's also perfectly welcoming to casual gamers with it's well rounded sensitivity (and accuracy) towards in-game accidents. I like the game, but little elements make me dislike it for not being better. The game itself is overall well put together and complimented by a welcoming and to the point visual tutorial.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is pretty respectable.The absolute first thing that bugged me was the first person view. I couldn't see the bike or handlebars until I was in motion or if the bike was bumping upwards. Going from MotoGP 13 first person to this is just absolutely horrible. It feels decently adequate but the feel of having absolute full control isn't here. To be in full control, one needs to play in third person view to completely enjoy the game and character stunt movements. My only other complaint is the steering. MotoGP isn't perfect in it's steering, but it feels quite realistic when doing so. Here, it feels choppy or sort of skippy. It doesn't interfere so much in the game play but for people looking for exact motor bike steering, it isn't exactly here. It feels like the game is caught between being an arcade game and a simulation game, such as it's unable to decide which one to be. I find that most successful racing games actually find a balance between the two, REFLEX may have just found it. They sort of force you to stay on course (and will make you respawn if you don't) but there's always a few options here and there to take your own sort of short cut off the track.\n\nAdditionally, the game is quite gripping and provides for some serious fun. The different game modes include free-roam, race, and stunt. What makes this game quite unique though is that the right analog stick looks after the body movements while the left deals with the bike. This is a fantastic addition to the game as turns can be done on a dime if done right. This also helps rotate the bike in the air while doing stunts. Jumps are pretty rewarding and landings are decently accurate and feel right when their put together back to back. There is a system that exists within the game where if your character loses his balance, you have to use the right thumb stick and push it in a direction multiple times to avoid falling off the bike. Another system to be appreciated as it keeps you on your toes.The driving scheme in general is very beautiful once you get ahold of it.\n\nGraphics are absolutely fantastic as tire, bike and body marks on the ground are amazingly drawn. The terrain deformation is astounding. What bugs me the most is the first person view. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the handle bars. Then again, I may have been spoiled by playing MOTOGP first. In addition to the bikes (and unfortunately), players cannot see inside of the buggie or the pick-up truck when in first person as well. I would recommend running the settings first before launching the actual game. Going from 30 to 60fps left me speachless. In addition to good looks, the replays offer a highlight reel which is pretty solid. Watch some solid jumps be pulled off or accidents. The tracks are also well designed and differ from one another (from stadiums to snow-y mountains). Riders sometimes will move their head and check their peripherals while riding. Sounds are pretty decent. The engines vary between bikes and the crowd will make a "ohhh" sound if you wipe out.\n\nFor future MX vs ATV games, the jerky feeling of the steering needs to be addressed. It doesn't feel real at all sometimes especially when making landings. Other times, landings to crashes are absolutely nailed.\n\nOverall a pretty good game worth buying especially if on sale. Sucks it doesn't have local co-op but it does have multiplayer if it matters.\n\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\nGameplay	A-	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B+	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B+\n\nScreenShots :\nMe, getting bumped by a truck, which is also a part of this race\n\nThe crash system is fun to abuse...\n\n...especially when the computers start going at it\n\nTerrain deformation occurs even when the riders hit the ground\n\nMore unnecessary carnage\n\nThe body impact physics are on point\n\nMinimalistic first person view. Definitely not a fan of it\n\nThis is a stunt\n\nWheelies and stoppies are possible","August 7, 2015","true","8.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

The tutorials are all based on m+kb controls, so for each one I had to spend a bit of time fiddling around with my control figuring out how to do stuff. Even then, getting the hang of controlling the rider and the bike simultaneously was a bit awkward. But once I got the hang of it...? Pure awesome. I can really feel the rhythm of the race, and it's joyous. The more I played, the more I realized how I can control every bit of motion ], and it's fluid and responsive. I'm glad I finally bought it, even if it is lacking split-screen.\n\nUpdate: After some more playtime, I've found a few things that irritate me. One is that the AI is sociopathic; while not as evident on the waypoint races, it's more apparent in the stadium tracks. The AI is determined to ride wherever it wants, and if so happens that the result is a massive wipeout with you, the AI is fine with that. The other quibble I have is that if you crash into a wall or fly off track, the game will sometimes respawn you wherever you were halfway through the crash, meaning an instant crash again, and again, and again... but overall, I find these minor issues compared to how fun the game is.","September 10, 2014","true","5.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

Its legitimately the most fun you will have in a game of this sort. Now, it may not look visually stunning, but the gameplay is simply unrivaled. The main mechanic that sets Reflex apart from just about everything else is how you can shift the rider's weight around, this allows a huge degree of control so you can pull off longer, farther jumps and more extreme landings. You can also perform tricks at anytime(when you're in stadiums the crowds go wild when you do) which adds an interesting degree of freedom and you feel like a badass. You get to play through a huge variety of races across many different locations, you also get to costumize your rider and tune your rides. Basically there is a lot to do in this game and its all well executed. A solid 9/10 from me, it loses 1 point cuz it doesn't look outrageously awesome due to occasional pop-ins, but gameplay wise its great!","January 19, 2014","true","27.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/recommended/55140/","nkdeffa","DEFFA.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/","178 products in account","MX vs ATV Reflex  is one of a motocross / off-road racing series collaborated by 3 game developers such as  “Double Helix Games, Rainbow Studios and Nordic Games”. It was first published by Nordic Games in 2010. However, only Rainbow Studios and Nordic Games have continued with the series publishing two more games in late 2015.\n\nThe game has a single-player campaign and a multiplayer which, somewhat surprisingly, still continues to be somewhat active. The game gives you a variety of vehicles including motorcycles, ATVs, UTVs, sport trucks and buggies. In order to get them you must unlock them in the single-player mode. The campaign is chapterized into a small series of races and challenges rewarding you with a different unlockable customization either for your vehicle or for your driver. You  can customize almost everything starting with the parts of the vehicles through to the visual customizations for vehicle and driver. Thankfully these do not take too much currency as you just need to beat a race or challenge.\n\nIn regards to the graphics I’d like to point out first that the settings are only accessible outside of the game and you can only choose from a number of pre-set options. Overall, the game has solid graphics including cool mud and water effects/physics but they are dated compared to newer titles. The presentation is accompanied with some cool, mostly metallic, soundtracks and a voice over who does a notable job.\n\nThe game has a good tutorial. It provides both keyboard and gamepad instructions and provides some tips. There are parts of the tutorial and tips that are not voiced and I found that this was a little disappointing as the rest of the game is voiced appropriately.\n\nI found really hard to use mouse as ascending and descending the wheel ended up with me flipping over the majority of the time without reason. I ultimately decided to play without it. I didn’t test the gamepad controls. I also found that it is hard not to have a mini map or an equal amount of signs on the off-road maps. This made me fall off the track, driving in nonsensical directions and unable to guess which way I was supposed to go,game doesn’t even tell you that you are going in to a wrong direction in off-road maps,so only way to check it is to look at your position.\n\nPROS: Variety of vehicles – (It was great having an option to switch between vehicle types (bikes, ATVs, UTVs, sports trucks and buggies)\n\nVariety of maps – (Having an option to switch between maps was great as too was the addition of the free ride system.)\n\nVariety of tricks – (Players have the freedom to pull out almost any trick imaginable.)\n\nCustomization (Being able to customize every part of your vehicle as well as every visual component including the driver was a sweet touch.)\n\nMultiplayer – (The fact that the multiplayer component of the game is alive is awesome.)\n\nEffects – (The graphics are decent but they are no longer impressive aside from the water and physics effects.)\n\nGamepad support – (The game provides gamepad support which I imagine would make it easier for the player to pull off tricks and maneuvers)\nCONS:Poor HUD, lack of minimap – (Not having a minimap or an adequate amount of signs in the off-road challenge was the most disappointing aspect of the game.)\n\nMouse controls – (The mouse control were poor to the point that I had to give up on them.)\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews. I received this game for free thanks to Steamified and the developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicKingdom_/recommended/55140/","EpicKingdom_","EpicKingdom_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicKingdom_/","253 products in account","Reflex is still king, 2016.\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThere is plenty of content to take on in Reflex. For example, there's a handful of national and supercross tracks to race on. In addition, there are also a ton of different game modes for you to have fun with such as FMX competitions, racing off-road trucks, UTV's, or buggies etc. Most importantly (for me) is that the base game has a decent amount of customization options from gear, to bike parts, and graphic kits. ALTHOUGH, if you get sick of the same old skins (as well as tracks), then go visit http://reflex-central.com/ for some mods.\n\nMoving on, I've found it quite hard to always have a perfect lap considering that the track develops lines (or ruts) the more you ride on it. In other words, every lap feels like a different approach is needed unless you can follow through with your exact line perfectly.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nWhile using a controller to play the game, you use the left analog stick to steer your bike and the right analog stick to control your rider. So if you were to ride a berm to the left, you would basically move both sticks to the left to make your rider lean into the berm. Furthermore, if you were to speed over some whoops, you would move the right stick only backwards so that your rider leans a bit back to absord the rough part of the track.\n\nONLINE:\n\nI still find a ton of racers online in 2016. Although, online gameplay is where the cons are for me. For example, racing with other races can be challenging (or annoying) considering how it appears that your opponents are bouncing around all over the track. Furthermore, there is this thing known as the whip glitch that allows you to easily clear jumps. A lot of online racers abuse this, "whip glitch" making them ultimately faster than you unless you can do it too. If you want to have a fair race, play this game online with a friend.\n\nGRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE:\n\nI'm using a 3570k stock, 780 SC, and 16GB of RAM. With that said, performance is great. Although, I can remember it being not so great when I had AMD hardware. Moving on, the game still looks great in 2016 thanks to the power of PC gaming. For example, here is one of my screenshots @ 1440p.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573126672\n\nOVERALL:\n\n9 out of 10, this game is a must have for any motocross/off-road racing fan. Do note that this game usually goes on sale on Steam for a few bucks and that's a steal! I have purchased this game so many times on Steam as gifts for others.","May 4","true","98.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The is no true story however, the game is simply win races, get new bikes and then upgrade them. Although this may sound increably bland it's not what so ever, the tracks are very diverse and the one terrain may grip well and all is good the next minute in you're in deep sand, snow, mud, etc.\n\nThe game is truely based around the players style of riding and looks, certain bikes have advantages and disadvatages, one bike may be lighter but have less topspeed vise-versa. The bikes are very customizeable, every thing from the graphics to the tires, even hubs and wheels can change colors. Diffrent tires have adv. and disadv., as well as forks,handle bars and more. Even the rider is completely customizable. All  the brands to choose are actual brands adding a sence of realizem for those of us real life riders.\n\nThe fun doesn't stop at the in game content, with some simple moding you can add user created tracks as well as create you're own with ease.\n\nTo anyone looking for a good time and a game to play with some friends in online mode (which is currenntly down) I HIGHLY recommend this game.\n(sorry for any typos)","October 1, 2013","true","144.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It isn't the kind of racing game that relies on how fast you go and how good your vehicle is, but instead is reliant on how you time your jumps and turns. It has a lot of veriety and even when you're done theres a ton of mods out there. It's a shame the series became extremely arcady and careless as far as the PC versions go.\n\nAs someone who owns an ATV and a dirt bike, I felt like this game handeled how it made those two work. Mostly the dirt bikes though, not so much the ATV's, as the ATV's are basically just the MX but with slight differences when it comes to this game.\n\nLots of pointless stuff too. If you want to complete moto-career 100% you need to race in Sports Trucks, Buggys, and UTV's which are no where near as much fun as the ATV's and MX (at least when it comes to video games), but it's totally optional stuff.\n\nAlso, this game has some very impressive physics that hold up to this day, all though the graphics themself don't really look all too good as they did years ago.","March 3","true","540.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Alive was a let down because of lack of realistic physics and variety of certain things. Reflex on the other hand is such a time passer and each race etc. has their own little exciting taste to it that just keeps you going. Don't get me started on multiplayer;') . It's a good $10.00 spent. If you enjoy those games, get this one.\n#AwesomeGame\n\nPenderBox","November 30, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GET YOUR MONEY BACK!\n\nThis game has serious issues on AMD video cards.  DO NOT BUY.  The developers refuse to address this problem.  If you have an AMD card you will experience AWFUL slowdown, screen tearing and artifacts.  The artifacts truly look as though they are DESTROYING your PC.  Absolutely NO excuse for how bad this game runs.  Nordic should be ashamed for this BROKEN game to remain on Steam for this price.\n\nI have two systems both with R9 290X cards, and on some maps with heavy "mud" the slowdown can crawl into the 5fps range.  My PC has no problems with physX because I have a GTX 670 4gb as a dedicated physics card.  That means games that were specifically designed to make use of proprietary physics code run flawlessly.  It is NOT a hardware issue, it is the absolute fault of the devs here.  It is NOT a driver issue, believe me, I have done way more than "normal" troubleshooting in a complete waste of time and you know what?  I bought this game for my son who at first was able to play through the horrible bugs but even he, being young, can't look past that anymore, and choses to just play on the "lobby" map for hours and has to quit the game and reload when it attempts to start a real map.\n\nBroken pile of garbage.  DO NOT BUY if you have ANY AMD hardware in your system.  Don't be another lost voice asking for help which will never be addressed.  CERTAINLY  do not buy another Nordic games title if you already fell for this one and got short-changed.\n\nHorrible experience, scale from 1-1 million, 0/1,000,000.\n\nEDIT 9/16/2014:\n\nIn the event the mods delete my forum post regarding this issue that I recently took up again in an attempt to fix, here is a paste of said post:\n\nCanceled my Supercross pre-order and never buying Nordic games again. Horrible company.\nI can only sit here and watch my son play MX vs ATV Reflex with it's terrible lag and video artifacts for so long until I am speechless as to how a company that is supposed to be professional can refuse to fix blatant, game-breaking problems. Support is apathetic. They do not care.\n\nMy son plays this game. As a child, who is obsessed with dirt bikes, he has learned how to play this game and embrace the absurdity. The bugs and glitches have become "just part of the game" for him. He is a child, willing to do anything to find enjoyment where all I see is amateur mistakes.\n\nHe blamed me at first, and I had to go through the motions of trying out 3 other graphics cards that didn't work just to satisfy his curiosity as for the longest time he thought it was my r9 290x and GTX 770 cards that weren't "working" right. Truth be told, he has actually learned a lot from this ordeal, and I have used the opportunity to teach him more about how computers work. He got to see dad taking apart three different systems, install three different versions of windows, so this was not at all a waste of time; Should Nordic feel proud of this? Making a game that has a myriad of problems that it makes other "problem" games seem better by comparison? Letting what I assume was to be a flagship title fester and stagnate so that only a small percentage of buyers could actually play the game without having to incorporate AWFUL graphics issues like 5 frames per second and full screen artifacts? There is no excuse for this.\n\nThankfully I've persuaded him to branch out to other racing games, and he is becoming more interested in all things motorcycle, and the Saints Row games have been providing him enough diversion to not care about the next game in this series, and I've alleviated the stress for both of us by promising him GTA V when it's released. As a gamer, I usually never go on a tirade about bad business practices in this industry because let's face it, since the 80's we've had to, by trial and error, learn how to not let little stuff get to us. If this were a game I erroneously bought for myself at any other time I would have chalked it up to a bad buying decision and a need for me to find demos or do more research before opening up my wallet. Sadly, as a parent, I did not afford myself or my family the luxury of knowledge this time around, and I've been rewarded with a 8 year old child who through no fault of his own has had to learn and endure way more than I ever thought a stupid videogame would introduce.\n\nIt's sad. Bless his heart he eventually saw that I was getting tired of having to prove to him that it wasn't dad's fault that the game was a buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥. Now he thinks he has to play the game and try to show dad that he can have fun and justify the purchase. No matter how many times I tell him it's OK, it isn't his fault, he still wants to make me happy. So I wake up on weekends hearing this game's bikes go RRRRR RRRREER and he puts on a display how much fun he's having. He plays so that I can see for a while, and I have to tell him it's OK if he does something else.\n\nThanks Nordic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. ♥♥♥♥ you for disappointing my kids. After all this time, your only excuse is that you dont give a ♥♥♥♥.","August 16, 2014","false","2.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

I love this game on the Xbox 360. So I spend my $15 on the disc for the PC. First off I have to endure starting up Steam everytime I play this thing, which has to be one of the most annoying sales pitch focused providers in all of the online gaming community. Then I try to play with my Xbox controller which works for every other game I play on my PC that uses a game pad. Ohhh woops..... seems that doesn't work for this game. So now I've payed these lames $15 for something that doesn't work. I've tried everything on the forums so far and nothing works, and why should I need to do that anyway? Shouldn't I just be able to plug in the controller of my choice and enjoying what I paid for? Too bad Nordic games or someone at Steam never bothered to see if this game actually was playable with a reasonable variety of input devices. This certainly bodes well for the new MX vs. ATV that Nordic will be putting out ...... NOT!\n\nI highly recommend this game, it's fantastic. But I would never recommend this version as purveyed by Steam.

The "Reflex" system of controlling your rider and bike seperately is a bit awkward, and it quickly gets annoying that you fall off the motorcycle every time you touch anything. The thing that really keeps me from recommending the game is that it just looks terrible. I'm not very picky about graphics and decent gameplay can justify outdated graphics, but this is just embarassing. The terrain textures are bland and flat, and the environments are all extremely uninteresting.\nI have to say I recommend playing Motocross Madness 2 instead, despite it being years older.","June 9, 2014","false","1.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

The bikes feel smooth the movement feels natural and on a good track feels really flowy. The only thing I dont like about this games riding is the way the bikes feel. The bikes feel almost like they dont have any weight. A good comparison is probably Skyrim's melee fighting.\n\nSound: Bike sounds are okay at best. They kinda sound generic but its fine for me.\n\nContent: The content the game comes with is kinda good maybe a little above average. The tracks are mainly motocross and supercross with some freeroam maps thrown in. The only reason I played this game so much is because of the modding. There are plenty of bike skins and tracks to chose from and the higher quality ones are super fun (way better than the tracks the game comes with).\n\nGraphics: I would say the graphics are ok. Obviously this game is kinda old so you cant expect much.\n\nWhy do I not recommend this game? If your like me and you wanted to build a pc based around amd stuff this game SUCKS! In multiplayer with a full lobby you can expect very bad performance. Also there are no known fixes.\nNow before you say my pc sucks I have seen many other people with this same problem on VERY VERY high end pcs.\n\nWith AMD: 4/10 Only worth the money on sale and if you only want to play modded maps in singleplayer\nWith Nvdia/Intel: 8/10\n\nIf your looking for alternatives I highly suggest MXGP <3","June 24, 2015","false","135.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

How can it be bad? Well it probably is...on a console. MX vs ATV Reflex is one sad excuse of a PC port. The game runs terribly. I can barely get 20 FPS even running on very low settings. Also the graphics aren't really that good. There kind of sloppy, and you can see where the developers added little pretties to hide the ugly monster within.\nAnother thing to mention is the cameras. This game holds the most dimwitted camera system there is. And adding the lagginess to the game makes the camera even worse. It nearly gives you motion sickness.\nThere is another thing that is bad to. The sounds. Oh my goodness the sounds! They go from making your ear drums bleed to quiet whispers with no transition. Also the developers have clearly never heard of the fact that trucks and most offroad vehicles have a thing called a transmission. The sound is just a loop. You never change up or down, so all you hear is a constant poorly recorded single engine note the entire time. It is just annoying. And as I said about the cameras, when you add the laginess it is much worse.\nNow I try to find good in everything. And I am happy to say this game does have a few things going this way, such as the amazing terrain deformation and the somewhat cool tricks system.\nBut sadly those cool features are overtaken by the badness and the little silly things that are just annoying.\nYou saw the things above, but guess what? Theres more. The developers thought it was vital to our gameplay experience to add scadily dressed line girls and a narrarator that sounds like batman. There is also use of words such as "rad" and "knarly" which is ok, but a little overdone if you know what I mean.\nNow ok, I understand the clients that they are trying to get to, such as real offroad enthusiasts like this kind of thing. But newsflash!  Real offroad enthusiasts have real offroad toys, so why would they play this silly game when they could go out (in real life) and thrash around on there motorcycle? See what I'm getting to? For us normal joes who just want to play a motorcycle game. We don't need line girls, or words of yobs. We just want to thrash around on a virtual motorcycle.\nThis fact and the horrid laginess gets this game what it deserves.\n\nRating 3.5/10\n\nAlso posted on the Do's and Don'ts steam group.

This game is incredibly lacking in content and the mechanics just don't feel right. The maps / tracks feel basic and empty. This game was developed under a very small bugit and it shows. As much I hate to admit it, this branch of the racing genre is dead, the new generation of gamers just don't care for racing small offroad vehicles.\n\nI tried to like this game, I really did, but I just can't recommend this game. I purchased this game hoping to re-live some memories of playing ATV Offroad Fury 2, 3, and 4 (yes I know it's a different series). While MX vs ATV Reflex has some cool features, to me, it is nothing but a failed attempt at innovation in ATV style games.","April 16","false","9.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Might as well go back to Mx vs Atv Unleased released for the PC many years ago. The handling and physics here are a joke. Every vehicle feels like its made of helium and proceeds to bounce around the track on the edge of control. The stunt system was just made obtuse to be obtuse, Up-Left-Down=Trick. I thought Trucks and UTVs might be fun because I could then ignore the "reflex system". I was very wrong, they are actually worse because when they bounce off the track you end up hitting trees and rocks, I was stuck between two tree limbs unable to back up and reset didnt work because I was still on track, ARGH. Just a shoddy poorly programmed dirtbike game saddled with a "Reflex system" that only serves to complicate and frustrate the rider and the quicktime hard landing event is just the final straw. I have been wrecked many times because of a small bump that flashed a random direction and I didnt push it fast enough. I tried to like this but it really fights with me, for every good there is a bad and the Reflex system just leads me to ask "Why?". I want to push up on the same thumbstick I am using to steer, its natural but with Reflex they moved it to the other Thumbstick. Unfortunately the game would have been better without it, its heartbreaking but it really cripples the fun and makes sharp/fast corners an iffy proposition.\n\nIn short I want my five dollars back. MotorCross madness is rolling over in its grave, shame Rainbow, shame. To think of the games these guys made and to have it come to this. I can only guess some pencil pusher shoved this stupid system on them and forced it by leveraging funding for the game, why else would they do it. Its hard to bury a friend but MX vs ATV you are dead to me, goodbye old friend.","February 8, 2014","false","4.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SQUIRRELEO/recommended/55140/","SQUIRRELEO","Squirrel Fiend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SQUIRRELEO/","99 products in account","Kind of disappointing.\n\nWhile this game can be fun for a little while, you will unforntatuely begin to see more an more proplems as you play. The first glaring issue is the controls. If I had to describe them in one way I would describe them as huge handful of ♥♥♥. The vechiles (mx exsbesily) can be extremly twitchy and ficle, and while this may be fun for a quick luagh or two when you first start the game it quickly become hordenus. No place is this more evident then in the races where you have to stay on the track or risk being penilised, a task made very hard by controls that seem to want to throw you off the track just for the fun of it.\n\nNext up is the sountrack. Its pretty god-awful. The entire sountrack is full on hard-rock, which normaly isn't a proplem however the songs they selected for the sountrack sound as if they took a co-wookers ipod, hit suffule, and just used all the songs that came up over a period of an hour. There feels as if there is no flow between the songs and despite being displayed over something as bad ♥♥♥ as offroading seem not to fit the action on the screen at all.\n\nThere is also the graphics proplem, simply put this game look not a whole lot better than ps2 games such as Off-Road Fury 4 (a much-much better game). Some people will not be bothered by this, and some will, I unforntaely happen to fall in the later category. When first loading the game it will look decent but out of another era of gaming entirely (think middle/early-late ps2 era). There are also texture proplems and what seems to be just bad judgement when it came to graphics design.\n\nI would like to end my review by stating that the devolper listed for this game was not responsible for it. THQ orginaly created this game (as seen by there logo everywhere in the game) and they should be blammed for this rather bad game. I hope the current owner of the license to the series (they bought it when thq went under) will be able to find a niche for the series and bring to it some new ideas and decent gameplay. Unitl then I'll be paciently waiting.","October 13, 2014","false","4.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The developers should not have listed 2 strokes and some of the smaller engine displacements in the class menu as this is misleading to gamers who have played the demo or bought the game!\n\nFrom playing the Demo I was under the impression that there were many bikes with individual handeling and engine characteristics , I WAS HANGING FOR 2 STROKE EXPERIENCE- Major flaw and dissapointment. game retail should be $15-$20.\n\nProbably best to just walk away and buy a real 2 stroke bike... why do games always fall short and leave out essential elemnts that whould make a game. would be nice to at least see a 2 stroke addon with bikes coded to replicate true power band.","April 23, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's at that point you've already lost the race and must restart just to deal with it all over again. The music is repetative and annoying. Winning races are not rewarding at all.

The game ran better on an Xbox 360 demo. The game runs very choppy on a top of the line PC yet looks like poo. There are tons of bugs ranging from minor to infuriating. The physics are TERRIBLE. Several times during races you'll hit a very tiny little bump or hole in the ground and you go flying into the air doing all kinds of flips. It's at that point you've already lost the race and must restart just to deal with it all over again. The music is repetative and annoying. Winning races are not rewarding at all. It's poor qaulity games like this that attributed to THQ going out of business. The only shred of fun in this game is riding around in the area before a race begins considering it seems to be the one place the game runs well on. Even then, it gets boring fast.\n\nNot even close to worth $19.99. Maybe .99 cents.","July 31, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can understand if you're trying to go for an arcade racer or a sim racer, but don't try to do both at the same time.  The leaning controls also suck.

Definitley.\nGame overall is a solid 9/10\nI run this on a laptop with Intel HD graphics 4400 card with a intel i3 core processor and it is on high graphics. Everything is maxed. No lag at all either. Gameplay is spectacular. Really competative and great AI. Difficulty ranges from 4 categories and I have yet to go past pro which is the 2nd hardest.\nPros:\nGreat graphics and gameplay\nWide range of customization for your vehicle and rider\nAwesome soundtrack of rock/metal\nLots of career mode races and challenges to keep you interested\n\nCons:\nFreeroam/Arcade isn't like the MX Unleashed game for ps2. You're all alone in a wide area full of hills and all. No activities and no one else unless you are playing with friends (unsure if that's even possible in arcade.). In MX Unleashed you spawned with like 7 or 8 AI riders who did their own thing in the starting area and you had all kinds of activities ranging from checkpoints to vehicle races to unlock things like helicopters and monster trucks. There was so much to do back then but now it focuses on just messing around.\n\nOverall like I said 9/10\nThe point deduction was for the arcade mode and also because it is easier to play with a controller such as a 360.\n\nHighly recomend this game at full price but if it is on sale do not hesitate to pick this up.\nAlso get this before the MX vs ATV unleashed ported game because people are having trouble running that and this game is smooth running.","November 9, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mx vs Atv Reflex looks like a game that any extreme sports fan, weekend warrior or family could enjoy. With its fast paced action, high flying daredevil stunts and free roaming what's not to enjoy. So put your helmets on and lets go for a ride!\n\nThe visuals are pretty good considering it was produced in 2011.The vehicles are pretty on par with their real life counter parts. The motos look like motos the atvs like atvs. The only true visual on a vehicle that gets me is the lack of an axle underneath the sport trucks during full compression. Its like the just have wheels. The motion blur is a nice touch and the scenery is ok.  The landscapes are massive with tons of room to play around. The land deformation is awesome with every pass through the tracks conditions change.The water however is terrible. The physics for some reason or another make it react if its a giant bowl of jelly. When racing through it it tends to engulf your character when riding something without doors. The shrubs also tend to be an issue. They seem to just get in the field of view at the right moment. I find myself running into the trees directly behind these shrubs more than enough. The HUD could have also used some attention. The lack of a circuit map, especially on the Omniraces, leaves you with trying to make the right turns at the right times.\n\nThe amount of vehicles in the game is vast. MX, ATV, Short Course trucks, Buggies and even Rhinos. You can customize them to a certain degree with physical mods such as colors, wraps, handlebars etc and performance wise with exhaust, suspension, and tires. This here is where I have a problem. Within the physical mods and performance mods you have Brand name manufacturers that anyone in the moto scene would know FMF, Yoshimura, Maxxis, but the actual vehicles themselves lack brands. There is no definitve Honda or Yamaha. There is KTM, but how come they couldn't seem to get the rest. Its not a deal breaker just annoying. When it comes to your rider though the options almost seem endless. Goggles, helmets, jerseys, boots. with multiple designs for each brand.These options ad a nice touch, but I still can't get passed my rider decked out in Troy Lee and he's riding a Dakumoto 450.\n\nThe career mode is a simple linear progression. Complete these races, unlock this, repeat. Sure there's a reason behind it. You have to complete certain series to unlock certain vehicle types to complete another series. It's just to flat and linear to actually enjoy. If they would have thrown in a career mode with the goal ofgetting sponsored and making your way through the ranks of the series I would have found that more compelling and worth continuing. Instead I find myself rinsing and repeating hoping that the A.I. will get better the more I progress. Boy was I wrong.\n\nThe A.I. in Mx vs Atv is either borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or crazy. (Depending on what they choose.) It is a reacurring issue for me to continually win races 25+ seconds ahead of my nearest competitor. Thought it was too easy and bumped the difficulty up to the highest and it's absolutely the same. Every now and then you'll find someone able to hang in with you for a little bit, but once they mess up they never catch back up. The A.I. is the most ridiculous during Omniraces which pit every vehicle type against each other. If your not in a truck or buggy be prepared to be ran over time and time again leading to frustration and the enevitable rage quit. But your not even safe then. They will run into you after you've rolled and top side down with no regard to their own position. I don't know who was in charge of A.I.,, but I sure would love to know where he learned about racing.\n\nThe games mechanics are alright, but a drastic change to the series. Your control not only throttle and brake, but also the lean left and right. This inturn is supposed to make it more challenging to race, but as previously stated the A.I. is just too stupid to captialize. All you really need to worry about is preloading for jumps and correcting the landings when told to. The trick library is pretty cool. Simplistic tricks from nic nacs to Kisses of Death are all included. However I don't really like the way to perform tricks. Up Down Right will perform one, but it's too easy to mess up and accidentally do a more time consuming complicated trick. I would have prefered if simpler tricks were to way combinations and complex tricks 3 or 4.\n\nIf want to get the most fun out of this game you'll find it in the free rides. Being able to ride around aimlesslly pulling off backflips and supermans is nice. Just dont get to a spot with no easy way down. For some reason or another when on a hard to reach peak if you eat it going down or falling off it just endlesslly respawns you were you began your descend. I advise you stick to the low grounds if you don't want to spend 10 minutes hoping you land a 100 foot drop.\n\nAll in all Mx vs ATV Reflex isn't a bad game. Yes the career is bland and the lack of real bikes and quads in a Motocross game is perplexing not to mention the pyschopathic A.I. and sometimes confusing races this game is worth a play. Atleast for a little bit... 7/10","June 11, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just awful.\n\nMy main complaint is the new dual stick mechanic introduced. While it's kind of a cool idea on paper, it's horrible in practice. Any jump of any size now naturally pulls back, and if you don't compensate, you will crash. You can't really just ride anymore. You constantly have to focus on what you're doing with the right stick (or mouse). Since tricks are also tied to the same stick (mouse), any time you try to pull off a trick, your movements will naturally throw you off balance, and making it incredibly likely that you'll crash, since the mechanic loses all of it power to change your movement the second you leave the ground, making it hard to compensate for throwing yourself off.\n\nThere are some things that I like some what. The physics were pretty good, and I was fairly impressed with the trails you make (whether with your bike, or your lifeless body after you crash) in the dirt as you ride around.\n\nI was serverely disappointed with this game though; I was hoping to go back to my old memories of the old MX vs. ATV on my PS2. If the Reflex Control mechanic could be turned off, I would love this. However, since I got this game, along with a few other games and extras from Humble Bundle for the total price of $2.50, I can complain too much. I just have to sulk whenever I pass it in my library.","June 12, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rider reaction control makes it a lot more interesting, as you can rail corners harder and control the size of the whips you thow. Career mode feels a bit short; it has only taken me 20 game hours to have one championship left before I finish career mode. However the fact that you can download custom tracks makes it a lot more interesting, and the online races a always a good way to get some laughs!","February 17, 2015","true","227.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Runs at 60fps no problem on my GTX 750. Only downside is certain graphical glitches but they aren't that frequent so far. In the mud bowl area where you learn tricks there seems to be a permanent shadow problem where a flashing shadow runs the whole width of the screen. I also saw a river shoot straight into the air and freeze while racing. Other than this it's been fairly glitch free.

If you are into moto bikes and love to ride then this is a game on steam that shouldn't be passed up when given the opportunity. Its graphics really bring you into the action. The controls are wonderful with the Xbox Controller. You can play online with friends but playing online with other people is out of the option since its dead. The gameplay is great but towards the end can feel repetitive. The cut-scenes were you get your trophy all feel the same. There is a free ride mode in a couple of areas around the world which make it fun to get familiar with the mechanics of the game. The freestyle competitions are fun and arent hard to win. You have a couple options to choose from when racing from trucks to moto bikes there is enough to keep you satisfied. You can customize your characters look, number, and jersey name.

After jumping through hoops to get it running, it still throws an error when quitting.\n\nUPDATE: Just re-installed this game to give it another chance, my review still stands. I went into arcade mode, drove around for a minute, then the entire game just went black, no sound. I also was unable to modify any game controls. It just seems like this game was "rushed" out to placate users while they worked on getting their latest games ready for release.","February 16, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall it is an o.k. game but the only problem really is that it is not well optimized.  It is a bit laggy.  But I am going to change my verdict to a positive one because they game is still enjoyable.","November 14, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
