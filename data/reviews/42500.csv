I had poor net connection at the time. Would liketo play again with friends. Also if using xbox pad.. do not check the check box for it.. as it puts a large deadzone in the controller. you can still use the xbox pad just go to joypad tab to change keys, there are some sensitivity settings in there also when changing the sticks for up and down or left and right. and also set teh to sliders to about 40 on the 3rd tab.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #49 - DogFighter\n\nExactly as you'd expect from the title, DogFighter pits you as a fighter pilot against a number of other pilots.  It's pretty much deathmatch with propellar planes, which isn't itself a bad thing.\n\nI started with the tutorial, which does a perfectly good job taking you through the various controls in the game.   The left stick controls the plane, while the right stick is used for performing different maneuvers, which include barrel rolls in either direction, a loop, and an Immelmann turn.\n\nMuch like a typical deathmatch game, you pick up powerups, which can provide both offensive and defensive capabilities.  Offensive items are activated with the right trigger, and defensive items are activated with the left trigger.\n\nThe flight model is completely arcade-like, so anyone expecting simulator level realism should look elsewhere.  But, on the flip side, the game is very easy to pick up.\n\nThe game offers some different game modes, but they don't really change the core gameplay which is to fly your plane, shoot other plans, and don't get shot down.  All of the game modes are just variations of the basic deathmatch.\n\nWhich brings me to the problem I had with this game.  You can't really have a deathmatch game without other people playing it.  And nobody seems to be playing this anymore.  Granted, this game came out back in 2010, but sadly it seems the shelf life of this game was pretty short, and people have moved on.  So, unless you fancy playing deathmatch with a bunch of bots, you are better off looking at other games.\n","January 24","false","0.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","1"

My major complaint with this game is the controls.  There are too many for a casual game like this.  Also, this game takes a lot of tweaking to respond semi-smoothly -- mouse sensitivity (never did figure out the game pad).  All in all, the maps seem pretty standard.  The planes aren't based on Flight Simulator mechanics, but I wasn't expecting that.  I kind of just wanted to start this game up and have fun.  I didn't want to fiddle with it forever.\n\nThis games needs simplification and also should be optimized for slower PC's.

Very restricted number of maps, and the single-player AI is.. well.. a little on the dumb side.  The game only gets hard when you're absolutely massively outnumbered, because then there's a decent chance that someone will try to take a potshot at you :)\n\nEven so, this game is extremely fun.  pick-up-and-play kinda fun..  Nothing too taxing.. No hard rules to understand.. just fly and shoot.  Very well recommended if you have a fair internet connection and want to have a play online.","February 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Unfortunately it is not quite as good as one could have hoped after seeing the trailer.\n\nThe trailer video shows ultra-tight multiplay fun and really fast flying! ...but in reality the speed is not there. Boost does not add much. There are also zero people online.\n\nAnd the controls: Play it with a gamepad and aiming is hell. Play it with a flightstick and the twitchy gameplay will be hell for you and your stick.  Play it with a mouse and you will get trashed in the close quarters turns. I simply was not able to find a proper control scheme that worked. Mouse was the best though.\n\nA flying arcade game can be fast and playable on multiple control types. e.g. Skydrift.\n\nIt is not an entirely lost case though. Game is probably at it's best when played with a few friends who are all of the same skill level. This could probably be quite nice LAN game among friends. But playing against the few random humans online or bots? Forget it. Not worth it even at this price.\n\n4/10","May 19","false","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

As right now, it's just a arcade game for ADHD 8 year olds.\n\nI cannot complain about graphics, it's ok, it flows nicely and such, but there is absolutely no gameplay that makes you want to keep wanting to come back to the game. Rather, after playing for 5 - 10minutes, you will want to quickly find the ESC button, quit and uninstall the game.\n\nRating 5 out of 100","December 2, 2011","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Its interesting and somewhat fun, but on Team Death Match when playing in singleplayer the friendly AI are useless unfortunately. Though Deathmatch is still fun but even on hard the AI dont really stand much of a chance against a real human. Since this game is so old though and it was a mainly multiplayer focused game the multiplayer is expectantly dead at this point. No one is online aside from a few crazed and forgotten souls in limbo.\n\nSince it is a multiplayer focused game and dead, and the singleplayer component isn't that challenging or fun I would advise not buying this game unless you have a group already interested in playing the game as you will need other people to play with to get the most out of the game. Though it is some fun to just fly around blasting bots its not that fun for a very long time.","June 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Thanks. http://steamcommunity.com/app/42500/discussions/0/405690850598851768/\n\nFirst impressions;\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOk, so this is a pure arcade dogfighting game through and through.\nNo story mode as far as I can tell; only 'arena style' deathmatch dogfighting variations, includes a number of singleplayer tournaments.\nYou earn medals based on your performance.\n\nIt's quite good if that is what you are looking for though.\nPickup 'powerups', new weapons, health packs, shields, disrupters, etc.\nCan use buttons with preset manoeuvres if you like; loop, barrel roll, 180 degree turn, etc. (sorry not the correct terminology)\n\nI would say would be really fun in multiplayer with 'like-minded' friends.\nGame does have bots, but they can be tough, especially if 5 vs 1 (lone wolf mode) etc.\n\nTook me quite a while to get my control sensitivities to how I like them as there are 4x sliders in reference to this. But putting the time into setting those paid off.\nAlso, this game has an excellent tutorial.\n\nRecommended if this is what you are looking for.","February 13","true","1.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
