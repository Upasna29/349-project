There are plenty of different maps with branching paths and titles to challenge to go through maps different ways.\n\nUnlike the 360 version, it comes with Evil Lord 30, which is a top-down beat'em'up where you summon monsters to beat up people, Princess 30 where you play a shoot'em'up under a very strict 30 second royal curfew, and Knight 30 where you protect your sage for 30 seconds against monsters.

Well let's get one thing straight, you don't have to beat every stage in 30 seconds, in fact, some stages can take up to a minute and a half to complete which is kind of false advertising  but it's still pretty fun.\n\nThe user interface could of used some tweaking, it's poorly optimized for PC. Alt + tabbing minimizes the window, it doesn't run the program in the background, so that was getting kind of annoying when I had to look up a guide.\n\nMy only real gripe about the game design is the convoluted side quests you have to do, there's no indication or explaination in game of how to get them done either, some are very cryptic as well... You'll be replaying levels twice or even three times and some of them can get incredibly obnoxious. You definitely need a guide if you're going for 100% completion on this one, you've been warned.","June 13, 2015","true","2.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","21","22","4","0"

I'm not usually a big fan of timed games, but thankfully Half Minute Hero's gimmick is easy to work around and looping time to do everything you want to isn't very difficult.  Not needing to stress about time limits is a good thing.\n\nEvery stage boils down to you leveling-up, finding secrets, buying items and killing stuff in relatively densely packed levels with little fat.  The game auto-attacks and the only real actions you have in your arsenal are using items and dashing.  The simplicity of it works really well and despite most levels playing very similar to one another, there's enough variations to keep things fresh.  There are multiple branching paths you unlock by beating levels through different means and every level has a couple of unique titles you can earn by meeting various conditions.  There's just enough to each level to warrant a replay if you're interested.\n\nHMH also has a surprising amount of content.  There's 50+stages in the main game and after beating it, different game modes unlock that are essentially mini tower defense, RTS, and shump campaigns.  These modes are very basic and honestly not that great, but they're fun enough and have the same light-hearted tone as the main game.   Princess 30 is probably the best of the bunch since the fast-paced shooting stages are the closest of the extra modes to the pace of the main game.  One important thing to know, you need to set the game to retro graphics mode to play these in their full campaign, otherwise they're just one-off stages in the vein of the main game.  There's nothing suggesting this in-game so if you're playing with the updated graphic option, you'll miss out of the full version of the modes.\n\nAs for the bad stuff, the port has some problems, like one of the stages in the main game crashing consistently if you're not playing in retro graphic mode.  So if Quest 26 keeps crashing on you, that's the problem.  Resolution options are limited to 1280x720 windowed or a stretched fullscreen.\n\nThe other main issue with the game is the equipment UI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Having to scroll horizontally though a bunch of icons when equipping stuff is really annoying and since you're limited to replaying levels only with the equipment you had up to that point, the terrible UI is something you'll have to deal with a decent bit.  The pixel graphics also look quite bad when they're blown up and used as "speaking" models.  They just take up too much screen real estate in relation to their size and look like a jumbled mess\n\nIn short, a fun, casual game that's easy to play.  It's also now packaged with the sequel game for the same price as the original by itself, so make sure to buy the right version so you get both games.","November 7, 2015","true","15.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The problem for me is that it's only kinda fun. The gameplay is kind of like a puzzle game, but when you run out of time you have to start the puzzle over from scratch. The core of the puzzle element is deciding how to allocate your precious time, and this sort of challenge really isn't mentally stimulating, it's just a bit annoying. Basically, the core gameplay mechanic of trying to manage your time just isn't quite as fun as other gameplay mechanics. Also, the game pitches itself as a parody but I didn't really find anything to be very humorous. It definitely achieves a lighthearted tone, though. I wouldn't recommend this because there are games that are more fun and less "mind numbing resource allocation" out there.","November 21, 2014","false","0.5"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

The game is about a boy who sets out to save a kingdom and, through a twist of fate, ends up making a pact with the Time Goddess to save the world...which only has 30 seconds until it explodes!\n\nThe game mostly parodies people, gaming, and most of all, the classic RPG, and it does it well. The game as a whole is really a parody, making it a point to "Grind, Grind, Grind!" when really getting to high levels only takes a few minutes. While the player only has thirty seconds to save the world, they can pray to the Time Goddess and, with an added fee, can turn back the clock. The story is expansive, and there are multiple paths and multiple endings, as well as multiple ways to go about each level (some story arcs even being surprisingly serious and tense).\n\nAnd that's just the first mode. There are several modes, some of which tie into each other. This game will last you many, many, many hours, but the best part about it is that it doesn't matter whether you want a game that's easy to pick-up and stop at any point or one that keeps you in for the long haul, because this game occupies both of those roles. Really, I feel that this game should be in anyone's library regardless of whether they like RPGs or not. It's a great game, and for $9.99 it's a steal.","February 11, 2013","true","31.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I know I did. In each level, you have 30 seconds to defeat the local evil lord before he casts the spell of destruction and destroys the entire world. Like, 30 actual seconds, so the gameplay can be quite fast-paced. You fight enemies for gold and xp/levels, buy stuff in towns, talk to people and do sidequests all in this short time limit, but you can turn back the clock by paying the time goddess increasingly large sums of gold. Very fun game, almost like a fast-paced puzzle game dressed up as an oldschool RPG. The levels are short and varied, which made it all too easy for me to lose large chunks of time to the game without noticing.\n\nThis edition of the game has two graphic modes, an "anime" style, which looks really amateurish and terrible IMO, and a "retro" style, which looks like a SNES game and is nostalgic and awesome.\n\nThe other game modes are fun, too, especially Princess 30, which plays mostly like a scrolling shmup.

The first playstyle resembles a RPG, the second is a top down action game where you play as an evil summoner, the third is a top down shooter for lack of a better term. Each campaign has at least 30 lands (levels) that have a 30 second countdown with the potential to get more time. This is a dialog heavy game with a comedy slant if you couldn't tell from the Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy in the title. I'm happy there's a one button skip everything. I didn't need to read anything, because its all so simple.\n\nThe first campaign is the main appeal. In 'Hero 30' you have 30 seconds in each land to save the world. In the first land, you'll meet the Time Goddess. For a price she'll reset the timer back to 30 seconds. Each time you need her, she charges more and more. The only time the clock isn't counting down is in the towns. If you don't have enough money to reset the clock, the goddess will still grant you a reset, but she'll repossess your weapons and the timer will forever count down to 0 even in towns. There is a world map consisting of lines and dots where the lands are.\n\nThe little lands each have a few towns, caves, a castle and a boss. The only place to explore is the overworld. Towns, bosses and caves are all single screens. Combat is automatic, your character will bump into the enemies and do damage. When time is of the essence, you can run, but that costs health. When you die, you respawn with minimal health. Sometimes its quicker to die, respawn and use the Time Goddess statues in town than risk a game over from running out of time. You can also run from combat.  When each land begins you start at level 1, but you can quickly grind your way back up with most battles giving you a level or two.\n\nBefore going into each land you can equip weapons and armor, but you won't be able to change them while in the land.  You can only buy new things to equip them in a land. Each piece of gear has its own weight, making you slower, but preventing knock back from enemies. If you get knocked back off screen from an enemy, you don't die, but the battle has ended. So it becomes a push-of-war. If you buy equipment in further lands, the game will not let you use the gear in previous lands. Other equipment has special uses like the swimmers ring which does uh.... I forget. Some weapons are insta-kills against certain types of foes, the bug swatter, the demon slaying silver sword. It makes for nice choice when replaying a lands for the 30th time trying to kill a giant sub boss far tougher than the main boss.\n\nTowns consist of single screens with many NPCs. Each land has at least two side quests. The world map highlights the name of each quest to give you a vague hint. Some of which unlock other lands. Its not that difficult. Most if not all lands can be finished in under 2 minutes. The tricky part is the two extra quests and fitting them in while beating the boss before you run out of time or money. Hero 30 makes use of time, because the 30 seconds are an entire day, so different events happen at different times. You may see the tide come in and block a path or a destructive fire destroy a town. Its a nice touch. After each land, the credits scroll by. Every time! Like you've just watched a 30 minute episode in under a minute! Then you are taken to a hint screen where four people don't ever have much to say unless you missed an extra path to a hidden land.  Some of the lands are setup in such a way that even if you beat a level your path doesn't continue without completing certain quests.\n\nThere is a multiplayer where you can compete with people online on different lands to see who is the fastest. In a fast paced game, it makes it even faster. Plus there are leader boards for each land of the Hero 30 campaign. The game will also notify you of where your Steam friend was where you are in each land. To keep pushing the pace, your friend will beat the land in 3 2 1. It will even show you their recorded ghost in the land or your own depending who was faster.\n\nThe second campaign, 'Evil Lord 30' is a top down action game that feels more enjoyable and deeper than the Hero 30. You have three spells that summon different types of creatures. Ranged creatures, brutes that bluntly melee and nimble which dodge attacks from enemy supporters. You also have the ability to push them into battle, but I never used it. Around you is a magical set of circles. The larger your outer circle, the more powerful the creatures are. The inner circle is your current magical power to make those creatures. If you get hit, the outer maximum circle shrinks. The time goddess can restore the size though. This time the goddess hides in golden barrels and takes all the money you have each time you use her. Luckily each enemy drops coins. The goal of each land is to kill, destroy or touch something.\n\nThe third campaign 'Princess 30' is the top down shooter. You are a princess surounded by your soldiers and can shoot north, south, east and west. The longer you shoot in a direction the more focused your arrows become. When you take a hit, you lose some of your soldiers, which is your firepower. When you leave the castle you dash one direction, then collect an item at the end or defeat a boss. Then you dash back. All with the 30 second timer ticking down. If you run over a red carpet, you gain time. There are even fairies to pick up for additional firepower. It felt like a fun minigame, but it was the same every time, just with different enemies. In fact all of these feel like minigames turned into a campaign. Its perfect for on the go like a PSP or DS.\n\n'Knight 30' is a top down action strategy game where you are a knight defending a sage against monsters. This fourth campaign needs to be unlocked. It can be more difficult than the others. When the mage is standing still on her own, the 30 second clock will count down to 0. Once it reaches zero you complete the area. Control wise you can grab and use the sage or other objects. You can dash, call the sage over to you and set traps such as fences, spikes, bombs and scarecrows to bait birds. When you dash it will drain your stamina. Without any stamina you put down what you're carrying. If you die, your spirit rises and will need to touch the sage before you can do anything else. If the sage dies, its game over. It is more difficult than the other modes since there is a lot to keep track of. Its interesting and employs strategy.\n\nOverall, everything feels very easy even with a 30 second timer. I never ran out of time in all 30 lands of Evil Lord and Princess. They were a breeze. For the hardcore out there, you can unlock Hero 300 and Hero 3. The 'Hero' campaigns all have a good dynamic of gold vs time, forcing you to complete each land before you can't earn enough gold to reset the clock. The non Hero campaigns feel more fun than the Hero campaigns even if they end quickly. I also have to question why the game says the 360 controller is the Ultimate way to play and then has keys for everything on screen instead of buttons.","November 29, 2014","false","13.3"," 31 of 54 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","31","54","2","5"

It tries to innovate the (action) RPG genre with a feature that is regularly used in different genres; rewinding time. You control a guy who has to save the world within 30 seconds. Yup, 30 seconds. Let me give you an example; with each level you play you are introduced to a boss. Then you're dropped into the level, populated with towns, caverns, seas, anything really. Please note that the levels are not open, but there are several ways to solve a level. Enemy encounters are random and help you level up, while also earning you money. When the timer is about to hit 00:00 you can pray to a statue in certain towns to rewind time and level up further, finish sidequests and, eventually, kill the boss. You can do this endlessly, but it costs more money every time you do this. So there's a bit of puzzling involved as well.\n\nThe graphics are (semi)-retro, and done very well, but the music and sounds are quite basic. One word though: gameplay.\n\nVerdict: a must own !\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","October 7, 2012","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You will level, gain party members, visit towns, gain equipment etc.. The usual rpg mechanics with a twist of 30 seconds to accomplish this task. If you need more time, you just need to pay the time goddess to reset time back to 30 and defeat the evil lords.\n\nThis game is still a gem on the psp and is just as great on the big screen.

I first played this game on PSP and had no idea what to expect.  HMH pokes fun at many of JRPG's long running tropes while also feeling like a pretty fun game due to its unique mechanics.  In the main game, you only have 30 seconds to beat each stage while traveling from towns and obtaining items.  Thankfully, you can pay money to extend the time, but the cost increases with each use, so eventually you'll run out of either money or time (a la real life).  There's actually quite a bit of content here, as beating hero mode will unlock other modes that span different centuries in the same world (princess, sage, knight, etc), all culminating in an epic 300 second hero mode that brings all stories to a satisfying... climax.  Oh yeah, and you can play 3 second hero mode once all that's done too.

What I expected was a hard limit of 30 seconds and a really small rpg goal, but what the game really is, is more of a standard kind of rpg with a quirky story.\n\nCombat is interesting, for sure, and the time mechanic works pretty well.\n\nWarning: there is at least one part in the story where if you listen to the navi-esque fairy, like YOU DO WHAT THE GAME TELLS YOU TO DO, you will get a game over.  This was maybe the only time I really got one aside from the final level and dude, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere's plenty of game here for a 30 second-mission dealy-o, with a lot of collectibles and objectives for each mission as well as a target time to hit.\n\nI mean, check it out.

With the name telling me I have 30 seconds to complete a mission, I thought it was going to be very easy. This is far from the case. As others have mentioned, this game makes you think strategically about when to grind, when to spend your money, how to spend said money, when the best time to fight the boss would be, etc. It's this balance while forcing you to think on your feet that makes it so interesting. Some missions you may beat the first time, others, especially the bonus missions, may take you two, or three, or even more attempts at them, but you will most likely end up loving it every time and, at least in my experience, rarely, if ever, ever give up in anger because it's that fun and addicting.\n\nWould I say it's one of the best games I've ever played? eh, not really, but it's definitely up there high on the list. Reason for this is while yes, the game is fantastic and addicting, it's also really repetitive. This is probably it's biggest, and only flaw in my eyes of the game. Now don't get me wrong, each stage is set up to give you a new challenge to get to the boss, such as monsters are absent from the map so you can't level up, an avalanche can hit you causing you to lose all your armor and weapons, etc. but at it's core, it's the same thing each level. Grind early, reset time, buy items, grind a bit more, reset time, proceed to go through the stage, reset time, fight boss, go to next stage, repeat.\n\nIf the thought of repeating the same core gameplay every stage doesn't appeal to you then I'd recommend watching a few videos on youtube or watching other people play it on twitch or something first to see if it really isn't your thing. If you can look past this flaw then you will most likely enjoy this game and for ten dollars, it's not too bad of a price if you can afford it.","July 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a novel idea and explored very well.\n\nThe soundtrack and pixel graphics are top notch and fit the theme of this game nicely.\n\nThere is a revamped new look in this version of Half Minute Hero which attempts to bring new life to the game, but it fails to accomplish this as it just simply looks awful and I switched back to pixel graphics which are far superior.\n\nTo vary it up a bit, there are various different game modes that invoke various playstyles (on rails shooter, defending etc..) which are all fun but are short and none quite match up to the greatness of the main game mode.\n\nThe story is not serious at all and is often predictable, cliche and humourous, which is what you expect to a parody of RPGs!\n\nIt is the most complete collection of Half Minute Hero - I have played the PSP version before - and this steam version has all the content from this version and then some!","September 6, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the time goddess is killed by the big bad of the story (Who has been present in every story of this game) since no heroes appeared to defeat the evil lords, it seemed everything was lost, you play as a weak knight who was revived by a sage and your mission is to find the other 3 heroes, but is not gonna be easy since evil rules the world, and your only hope is a spell the sage knows but needs 30 seconds to cast it, your job is to protect him until the time runs out\nHero 300: the finale of the game, immediately after knight 30, the ultimate evil lord is revived, existance is beginning to disappear and is the job of the hero to recruit the other heroes and finish this once and for all.\nThe game has a nice ammount of replay value, finding new ways to beat levels, or the secret path exclusive to super mega neo climax ultimate boy edition, well written and actually funny dialogue\nThe music is AMAZING, go and listen to some of its songs like the main theme, The hero arrives, To the high heavens, Melody of Happiness, Casablanca.

I played on the 8-bit graphics and beat every mode. (Execpt hero 3 but i'll get more into that Later.) This game starts off like of other RPG games. You name your hero and get tossed into a world with monsters roaming around the plains and forest. (18..17..16..) After a quick tutorial you meet the Time Goddess and are on a quest to save the world in, you guessed it, 30 seconds. Never fear because once time gets low you can run into a town and pray to a statue for more time.... for a price. (9..8..7..) What if you get bored you ask? Well there are other story lines that play differently. A Beautiful Evil Lord and a blood thristy Princess. Plus there other unlockable storys. (3..2..1..) Uh, honey I doomed the world again!\n\nJust because i didn't say anything about it doesn't mean it's not true, the soundtrack for this game is amazing! It really makes your feel like "Hey.

It's really helpful for getting around, although at the cost of your HP.\nThe Achievements for the game are either terribly hard/cryptic to achieve, or downright easy. It ranges from Simply completing 5 levels of a mode, to having to defeat the Final Boss using only the Wood Sword (The weakest weapon in the game... You do not know how much grinding is needed for that)\nIf the Multiplayer would work, I would review the community, but I can't.\nI'm not going to reccomend this game, for the simple fact the Sequel is now out on sale.

I don't like that move. The Graphics in NEO Cartoon are just... nothing like Retro.

Nice fun game that you can do in quick bites.\n\nMore in depth version;\nThis is by far one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes old school RPGs. In this game you play as a young boy who's goal is to save the world from total destruction (original plot right? But remember, it's making fun of itself.), and you only have 30 seconds to do this in before the world explodes! Sounds easy right? Well unfortunately for you, you're just an ordinary boy so this might actually become a real problem. Fear not though because luck is on your side this time and you'll soon be receiving a little help from a certain Time Goddess who will aid you in saving the world from this total destruction! Yay.\n\nThis game parodies itself and parodies itself well, it parodies all those old classic RPGs we all grew up playing and have grown to love. The game really likes to poke fun at its self, making fun of such RPG tropes like "grinding" when really it only takes a few moments to level up. It's worth mentioning that while you only have technically 30 seconds to save the world, the lovely and not-selfish Time Goddess will allow you to turn back time, with a fee of course, and with this help is how it's all done in under 30 seconds.\n\nThe story is really well done, with multiple paths and many endings, expect stages to have several different ways of tackling them, for instance you could just grind, grind and grind some more so your able to just over power the boss with brute force, or instead you can help one of the local NPCs with their own quest, who will then return the favor in defeating the boss a alternative way.\n\nBy the way, this is only the first mode of the game! There are other modes I haven't mentioned here in detail but I can assure you that those other modes are just as fun.\n\nSo that's it for my review, you have 30 seconds to get this game, unless you just so happen to know a Time Goddess, but then again Time Goddesses are not cheap so it's still probably a better option to just buy this game for a measly $9.99 or if on sale a HOLY COW $2.49 BUY IT NOW!!! Seriously you will not be disappointed with this one, there are many hours of gameplay here, and if you are someone who is looking for something that can be played in small bit-sized sessions, then this game just became an even better match for you (how is that possible!).","September 1, 2013","true","1.4"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

At least, for the first few hours.\n\nThe game has a good amount of content, but every level basically plays like the last, and it doesn't have any other redeeming to qualities to make-up for that fact (such as sharp dialogue, for example). So what you're left with might be a monotonous slog that is helped along by, at best, very average dialogue.\n\nThe game seems to go for a pick-up-and-put-down experience, and that's exactly how I tried to play it. But even after putting HMH down for a long time, and picking it up again, I always felt underwhelmed after completing a level, and always just wanted to quit.\n\nThe other modes (Princess 30 and Beautiful Evil Villain 30) suffer from the same problem, and were -- arguably -- even worse when it came down to being repetitive, and having boring-to-average dialogue. So there are no saving graces to be found there.\n\nHMH is a game that spread its novelty way too thin (imagine if Portal 1 was a 30-hour game), and as a result, eventually becomes a mind-numbingly repetitive experience. It could have benefited from being a much shorter, and sharply-focused experience.","November 26, 2013","false","7.5"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","23","45","0","2"

I know that because I had it on the Xbox 360. The reason I'm giving it a Thumbs Down is because the game is bugged for me. The map always goes to the top left, so I can't see any of the paths for the missions. Then add to the fact that there's no name changing option. And the game flat out crashes when steam cloud is disabled. I would assume there was some porting issues from the console version.\n\nWhen it works though, it is very fun, and I know that because I remember spending hours in front of the TV to beat Hero 3 Mode. (Which I did end up beating) A shame that I can't do that in PC because of bad porting.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that they would patch the game considering they have limited man power and they released the sequel to this game. Last patch seems to be back in 2012.\n\nEDIT: Well, I found a fix for the screen issue, via unplugging and plugging in my controller. The name changing can be fixed via some more complicated method of removing the game's steam cloud saves. But to be fair, that's still a hassle to do. I'll keep my review as not recommended just due to the sheer amount of issues the game has.","March 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In truth, it plays more like a multi-level time attack game: can you save the world in 30 seconds, or do you need to extend it to make the deadline?\n\nThat being said, the entire feel of the game is a bit... "whatever." Combat is automatic, NPCs do nothing when not helping you forward the quest, and the humor is perhaps a bit simple. Most of the game is bashing sticks together until you get a positive result, and optionally fine-tuning the mechanics so you can make it within 30 seconds (which can take a few tries).\n\nIt's hard to find a game to compare it to, but if you've played flash games, it's in a similar vein; simple premise, simple execution. Perhaps a bit too simple, as the game randomly throws rewards at you while not making failure threatening. There are hints that the game may have some secrets, but with the meat of the game feeling like a mess of random junk incoherently thrown together, the details don't compensate.\n\nI don't like writing negative reviews, especially not when I've only had an hour's playtime, but there's just nothing to captivate the imagination here.","November 23, 2014","false","1.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I've played it before on the PSP and it really is a good game. Its got lots of humor and unique gameplay. This PC release has new graphics but I urge you to give the retro graphics a try. The retro graphics option was how the game originally looked like on the PSP and I think it's better that way. It enhances the charm of the game, in my opinion. Plus, with the retro graphics option, this game is playable on pretty much any computer. This game is also perfect for short play sessions. Each level is no longer than 5 minutes. There are 2 challenges for each level but the game only gives you a one word hint. You can keep playing without passing these challenges but going back to each level trying to figure out how to pass these little challenges makes for great replay value.

And after you beat it the credits roll? So how in the world is this title supposed to keep your attention for more than a minute?\n\nWell to begin with there's 30 stages, and you have to save the world in 30 seconds each time. In reality each stage is likely to take you more than a minute to complete, as time is halted in town (except in hard mode) and you will likely make use of the time-reset function to buy more time.\n\nIn a weird way this game is like Warioware. You basically have a short minigame with some new rules or mechanics introduced each time.\n\nIt's... simple, and yet surprisingly stimulating. You have to make snap decisions, since, well, you have 30 seconds!\n\nOnce you've cleared the first 30 stages, you'll find even more modes of play! And if you play in classic mode, you'll find a whopping 60+ stages, as they differ from neo mode.\n\nWhen you've cleared most of the content, you open up Hero 3 which gives you all of... 3 seconds to clear the stage. It's every bit as hard as it sounds.\n\nI give this game an 8/10. I enjoyed its self-awareness and silly humor. It certainly kept me busy for 12 hours. In a good way.

But what makes this game even more compelling is its uproarious sense of humor and the splendid retro soundtrack - I rarely laugh so much while playing a game.

Each level is its own RPG, with multiple ways to finish it, multiple quests and of course multiple characters to which you can ally yourself with.\n\nIn game you have the oppurtunity to select which graphics style you prefer (Either NEO Cartoon mode or 16Bit mode). These choices will affect the game greatly, and you will want to finish this game twice just to see the different cutscenes.\n\nWithout spoiling the start of the game, I can say with assurance that once you give this game 10 minutes, you will never stop playing.

Humor aside, this is a game where you play essentially a speedrun of a distilled RPG - bad guy will destroy world, you grind, kill bad guy.  You finish one level, and the next one is the same, but with a twist (maybe you need a key, or a boat, or there's a sidequest, or whatever) but the challenge is the same- how can I get this done in <30s?  (or <1m30s, or whatever; you can get a small number of 30s time boosts on each level after the first few).\n\nUltimately, if you aren't laughing, the fact that each level is extremely simple and similar to the previous starts to grate on you.

At first glance I was super excited on the possibilities within this concept, but mission after mission, the game succeeded to frustrate me. Poorly written linear storyline and dialogues, and amateur-looking graphical mistakes (such as while in pixel art, the characters only zoom in the original sprite while speaking instead of having a more detailed art). Also, while reading it's description before buying, I was almost sure it was a roguelike, but when playing I realized it was Jrpgish. This concept seems awesome on roguelikes with all the randomness, but the scripted storyline is so weak I almost puked. Not rating 0 just because the price is fair.\n\nEdit: Oh, now it's on the "TRASH" category on my collection, along with some other terrible games.","January 31, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

To it's credit, it has multiple stories, and if you change the "graphics" mode, you are actually replaying them with completely different gameplay (and sometimes mechanics) However, all of it practically plays itself, its so bloody easy. Flash quality throughout. Now onto the humor. This is not a deconstruction of the RPG genre. It comes off as juvenile rather than a proper parody. You  feel like they aren't insiders coming up alongside you and saying"you know, for all that they see us as ridiculous, we love it". Instead you get some barf level memes and disrespect for the 4th wall.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","As of this writing my playtime is under 2 hours, but I finished it on the 360 a few years back.\n\nThe premise is pretty unique: each level has a 30 second timer and has a boss that must be defeated. In those 30 seconds you must grind, buy equipment, and solve issues NPC's might be having that are preventing you from reaching the Dark Lord (like a broken bridge). You also have optional bosses in some levels and allies that can be recruited.\n\nLuckily you have the Time Goddess on your side, and going to her statues allows you to get the timer back up to 30 seconds (for a fee). Each time you use this service the price goes up, so it becomes prohibitively expensive if you rely on it too much (you shouldn't be taking that long with levels anyway).\n\nBattles in this game are really simplistic: random encounters consist of your character running to the right with the enemy coming at you from the left on a 2D plane, and each time they bump into each other you each take damage. If you're stronger, they die and you continue onto the right, going back to the overworld screen. Grinding is insanely easy in this game, and the challenege lies in speed-running the level. There are also alternate paths in some levels that can be unlocked, so you'll be replaying a few. Each level also has 2 'achievements' of sorts in the results screen. It's a simple title, like 'Kelp Lover' or 'Stranded' that gives a hint as to what you should do to unlock it. If you're a completionist, there's a lot to do.\n\nProbably one of the best parts of the whole game is the characters and writing. It has a fantastic sense of humor that I can totally dig. Since each level is meant to be passed in under a minute or so, the scenarios don't take themselves seriously and wind up being silly, like a boss casting the spell of destruction because he has massive ears and overheard it. There are a ton more, but its been years since I played this. All I remember is that several of the scenarios are pretty funny, as is the Time Goddess. After completing the main 'game' there's also, like, 5 unlockable extra 'quests', with some having you play different people. All I remember is that the last one is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to pass, so I never did.\n\nGood game, came with the second game, so good publisher as well.","December 18, 2014","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Have this game on both My PSP go and PS vita Both with the same save file and I got 95% of the game compled so far on the PSP version(And The Only Item I need Left in This Original Version Is Balmung). Now 3 things are missing in the PC version that was in the Orginal PSP version The Goddess Room, Music Player (To get it on PSP Beat Hero 3 And I also got it), and The Another Goddess Quest (to get on PSP First you don't save the village from the Volcano from the Fire Mountain quest THEN You have to beat 108 Evil Lords (Repeats Allowed so Beat whoever mutiple time) in Total). I like how the 8 bit Graphies looks it makes the game works but the Neo cartoon Graphies just look UGLY to me And That version Is where Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30 is like There own version of Hero 30 Feels weird to me but there Ok. The Xbox version And PC Has 8 quests Thats not in the PSP version(And am Not a Xbox person Im a Playstation person). Atleast Mutiplayer is Online while the PSP version is just AD HOD. I got the PC version for free because of getting the 2nd game as a bunile (I wish it came out on the PS vita(or PSP)). In My opinion The Orignal PSP version is better. I got True Hero Overall Rank on Both Versions Still wish the 2nd game came out on PSvita (or PSP)\n8.9 PSP in my opinion I highly Recommend This Version (Need some one to play with you on Ad Hod)(Want to get the Good Equitment in AD HOD Mode) It's The Best version to me. with Those 3 things. (How Do I get The True Hero (Overall and some Quests) Rank Again If You Lose It For The PSP?) And For Hero 300 I'm Having Troble Trying to Beat That Snake Superboss On my PSPgo (And PSvita) And Don't Have it on the PC version.\n7.5 PC in my opinion I sorta Recommend This version (At least Mutiplayer is Online and I can play mutiplayer on my own) It's ok Some Changes I did not like. NOT Everything is on This Version.\nUpdate- The Alt Ending Route Is On Both Versions of PC and Xbox.-as for the Lord Haders level mess up the Count of Numbers in Qusets of Hero 30 And As For Overlord Hol I had to be over Level 60 to beat him level 65 why? (In The Original PSP Version You Have to be level 35 to beat him(My quickest time on My PSP with the Last Battle on Hero 30 is 1min and 59secs)) And This version Confusses Beast killer for Silver Spear and Silver Spear for Beast Killer FTW Why?- Enjoy! (I may Edit this Review Later. Ok?)  I Beat the 2nd Game I Writen A (somewhat) Review on it\nand For HOARD That I also Have Both Versions PSP (And PSvita Again) and PC.

The multiplayer matches, if you can get enough people them anyway, are also fun. Unfortunately, this PC port has quite a few problems. Yeah, it's a combination of the PSP and Xbox versions, but it's really buggy, the only screen resolution options are fullscreen and window mode. And the buttons seem to love remapping themselves after every few levels, forcing you to go back and remap them to the default inputs. Honestly, I would try to go for the PSP version if possible, but I suppose if you want the sequel to come out over in the west, you might as well get this version.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","As of this writing my playtime is under 2 hours, but I finished it on the 360 a few years back.\n\nThe premise is pretty unique: each level has a 30 second timer and has a boss that must be defeated. In those 30 seconds you must grind, buy equipment, and solve issues NPC's might be having that are preventing you from reaching the Dark Lord (like a broken bridge). You also have optional bosses in some levels and allies that can be recruited.\n\nLuckily you have the Time Goddess on your side, and going to her statues allows you to get the timer back up to 30 seconds (for a fee). Each time you use this service the price goes up, so it becomes prohibitively expensive if you rely on it too much (you shouldn't be taking that long with levels anyway).\n\nBattles in this game are really simplistic: random encounters consist of your character running to the right with the enemy coming at you from the left on a 2D plane, and each time they bump into each other you each take damage. If you're stronger, they die and you continue onto the right, going back to the overworld screen. Grinding is insanely easy in this game, and the challenege lies in speed-running the level. There are also alternate paths in some levels that can be unlocked, so you'll be replaying a few. Each level also has 2 'achievements' of sorts in the results screen. It's a simple title, like 'Kelp Lover' or 'Stranded' that gives a hint as to what you should do to unlock it. If you're a completionist, there's a lot to do.\n\nProbably one of the best parts of the whole game is the characters and writing. It has a fantastic sense of humor that I can totally dig. Since each level is meant to be passed in under a minute or so, the scenarios don't take themselves seriously and wind up being silly, like a boss casting the spell of destruction because he has massive ears and overheard it. There are a ton more, but its been years since I played this. All I remember is that several of the scenarios are pretty funny, as is the Time Goddess. After completing the main 'game' there's also, like, 5 unlockable extra 'quests', with some having you play different people. All I remember is that the last one is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to pass, so I never did.\n\nGood game, came with the second game, so good publisher as well.","December 18, 2014","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Have this game on both My PSP go and PS vita Both with the same save file and I got 95% of the game compled so far on the PSP version(And The Only Item I need Left in This Original Version Is Balmung). Now 3 things are missing in the PC version that was in the Orginal PSP version The Goddess Room, Music Player (To get it on PSP Beat Hero 3 And I also got it), and The Another Goddess Quest (to get on PSP First you don't save the village from the Volcano from the Fire Mountain quest THEN You have to beat 108 Evil Lords (Repeats Allowed so Beat whoever mutiple time) in Total). I like how the 8 bit Graphies looks it makes the game works but the Neo cartoon Graphies just look UGLY to me And That version Is where Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30 is like There own version of Hero 30 Feels weird to me but there Ok. The Xbox version And PC Has 8 quests Thats not in the PSP version(And am Not a Xbox person Im a Playstation person). Atleast Mutiplayer is Online while the PSP version is just AD HOD. I got the PC version for free because of getting the 2nd game as a bunile (I wish it came out on the PS vita(or PSP)). In My opinion The Orignal PSP version is better. I got True Hero Overall Rank on Both Versions Still wish the 2nd game came out on PSvita (or PSP)\n8.9 PSP in my opinion I highly Recommend This Version (Need some one to play with you on Ad Hod)(Want to get the Good Equitment in AD HOD Mode) It's The Best version to me. with Those 3 things. (How Do I get The True Hero (Overall and some Quests) Rank Again If You Lose It For The PSP?) And For Hero 300 I'm Having Troble Trying to Beat That Snake Superboss On my PSPgo (And PSvita) And Don't Have it on the PC version.\n7.5 PC in my opinion I sorta Recommend This version (At least Mutiplayer is Online and I can play mutiplayer on my own) It's ok Some Changes I did not like. NOT Everything is on This Version.\nUpdate- The Alt Ending Route Is On Both Versions of PC and Xbox.-as for the Lord Haders level mess up the Count of Numbers in Qusets of Hero 30 And As For Overlord Hol I had to be over Level 60 to beat him level 65 why? (In The Original PSP Version You Have to be level 35 to beat him(My quickest time on My PSP with the Last Battle on Hero 30 is 1min and 59secs)) And This version Confusses Beast killer for Silver Spear and Silver Spear for Beast Killer FTW Why?- Enjoy! (I may Edit this Review Later. Ok?)  I Beat the 2nd Game I Writen A (somewhat) Review on it\nand For HOARD That I also Have Both Versions PSP (And PSvita Again) and PC. Have Fun!","December 10, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It really condenses a 100 hour or whatever, JRPG experience, into like 1 or 2 minutes. Basically, it's as if Final Fantasy and Warioware had a weird baby. And it's glorious. The multiplayer matches, if you can get enough people them anyway, are also fun. Unfortunately, this PC port has quite a few problems. Yeah, it's a combination of the PSP and Xbox versions, but it's really buggy, the only screen resolution options are fullscreen and window mode. And the buttons seem to love remapping themselves after every few levels, forcing you to go back and remap them to the default inputs. Honestly, I would try to go for the PSP version if possible, but I suppose if you want the sequel to come out over in the west, you might as well get this version. It's not unplayable or anything at least.","April 13, 2013","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

There's ton of playablity in this game and some replay value as some stages have two different ways to complete it or have missable objectives that you can find in a new replay of the stage. Speed and time management are key in this game. Level grinding takes a few seconds to a few minutes so you aren't going to be playing for hours to reach level 100.\n\nAfter you beat the game there are tons of game modes that make the game different by giving you new challenges and gameplay styles different from the main hero. If you are an achievement hunter my advice to you would be to switch the game to classic graphics so you can unlock some of the achievements from the other game modes. When you change the graphics to classic to neo or vice versa the game style changes too. For example the Princess mode in neo graphic mode you rush enemies and try find certain items to save the King while in classic mode it's more of a shooter instead of rushing into foes and you have a time limit for reaching the objective to help villagers and saving the King. Either game mode you are bound to have fun and if you are fast enough you might make your way on the leaderboard. Good luck and save the future.","July 7, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Evil Lords all over the world are learning a spell that can destroy the world in 30 seconds.

You can even race your friend's to see who can finish a level faster. There's even a multiplayer mode. So this game is all around fun, but it's pretty short.

By that I mean that there are many small scenarios that you have to complete (the exact number is 30) within each mode. I'll be reviewing this game on a mode-by-mode basis, as there are four major modes: Hero 30, Evil 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30; each with their own variations, at least on classic mode. In fact, if you don't know to switch to Classic mode after you've beaten the game, you'll end up missing out on quite a bit of the game. This wasn't really mentioned anywhere - or at least that I remember - so do keep that in mind when you play through the game.\n\nTo start, we'll talk about the "vanilla mode," Hero 30. This mode consists of you traversing a given map and leveling up to the point where you can easily defeat the boss of the area. Of course, beating every single area in under 30 seconds would get tiresome after a while, so there is usually some new design concept per level. To compensate for longer levels, the game allows you to turn back time to the 30 second mark with a Goddess statue located at most villages. The fee for turning back time increases by 100 gold each iteration, and if you end up getting careless you could end up trapping yourself in a then-unwinnable situation. You kinda have to be trying to do that, though, so don't worry too much about that. Apart from that, it's pretty standard RPG fare: you can usually upgrade at least one of your equipment per map, you can carry one healing herb with you to heal should the need present itself, and battles are handled automatically with the main influence you have on the fight being that you can run in (running consumes HP, by the way) or turn back and run. Pretty straightforward stuff, but then again; depth isn't exactly necessary when your mission can be beaten in under a minute. It's also worth noting that unless you switch to Classic mode, the following three modes will be one mission long and play out roughly the same way as Hero 30.\n\nEvil 30 is, as mentioned above, pretty boring on non-Classic mode, but on Classic mode it becomes a lot more interesting. This plays a little more like an RTS than an RPG with you being able to summon three classes of allies to fight three classes of enemies (as the Evil Lord himself put it, a game of Rochambeau). Your summons become stronger the more filled up your summon ring gets, so that prevents against spamming, and this ring decreases when you get hit. This ring can be easily filled back up by going to the Goddess barrel (it makes sense kinda), but unlike Hero 30, turning back time takes all your gold, so there is an extra element of strategy to it. This one's my second favorite mode of the bunch.\n\nPrincess 30 is my favorite of the bunch, as it plays like a SHMUP. The way that time is factored into this mode is that different terrain can slow down your squad, and the more you get hit, the slower you go. Turning back time is done by "flying" over red carpets, which take a certain amount of gold per tick to turn back time that amount (I don't know the rate, but I'd guess 10 Gold/0.4 seconds in four ticks per second). It is kinda easy to get ganked by some of the bigger enemies, but that never really caused me to outright lose the match, as I had plenty of gold to get time back. Definitely the best mode of the bunch.\n\nKnight 30, however, is the worst mode of the bunch by quite a large margin. The whole mode is essentially an escort mission with the most erratic difficulty curve I've ever seen. It tries so much to be a sort-of tower defense thing, but either the strategies you can make with the items are useless or impractical, save for the Fence which is the only thing you should make ever. There's just a lot of stuff here that is either unnecessary to the game or outright frustrating to play. Unless you're a completionist, give this mode a pass.\n\nAll in all, though, I still had a lot of fun with the game. Sure, Knight 30 was awful, but at least it was only an hour or so of the total gameplay. I don't know how the hell Howlongtobeat has an average for this game of 18 hours, since I pretty much completed all the single-player stuff in a third of that time, but I still had a good time nonetheless. 8/10.\n\nStory: There actually is an over-arching storyline between the modes, so that's good. It's pretty standard RPG fare, although I think that was mainly for more of a parody angle than a lack of creativity. Also, this game is great if you've got even a slight bit of a Japanese sense of humor. Plenty of laughs to be had in here, even if some of the gags were predictable. There isn't really much else to talk about here, other than the Evil Lord being the strongest pervert. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: There's two graphical styles to this game: the "modern" tile sets and the classic tile sets. The modern looks (presumably) intentionally uninspired and kinda lazy, but that's to the game's benefit. Classic mode of course has pixel art, and the pixel art ain't bad, honestly. In fact, it's quite alright. Both are definitely good in their own ways. As for the technical side of things, of course anyone who can run at least Windows Vista shouldn't have any problem playing this game, since this is more or less a port of a PSP game, but the game handles fullscreen in a weird way. It does fullscreen to your native resolution, but it also upscales from 720p, meaning that you don't have true 1080p graphics or whatever your native resoluton happens to be. Because of this, I ended up playing windowed which worked fine, but I still would've liked proper 1080p. Also weirdly enough, the game prompts you to use a 360 controller at the start of the game, but all the commands on screen are listed as keyboard prompts. I'm sure DirectInput had a function to detect whether input was from a 360 controller or a keyboard back then, so excluding that seems really weird. Nevertheless, the two art styles this game presents are pretty good, but it is unfortunate some of the more quirky technical issues. 4/5.\n\nSound: Only music to talk about here, and man does this game have a good soundtrack. It covers quite a few genres as well, from orchestral to rock to industrial... yeah, and it's all quite good. Definitely a game worth grabbing the OST for. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about other than Evil 30 classic had the best songs of the game. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Worth your time and definitely worth more than 30 seconds.","August 19, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will need both the reflexes and the smarts to plan an optimal route to beat the clock!\n\nSpeedrunners and RPG fans will get the most kick out of this game. It's also a fantastic, fresh experience for any other players interested and well worth the few bucks it costs when on sale.\n\nI highly reccomend playing to beat the >time<, not the game. Go for the gold, and go beyond!\n\n\n30 secs to do everything sounds daunting, but you have the option to pray (aka bribe) to the time goddess and reset the clock. Kill some random monsters and you can buy yourself some leeway. This is necessary for the much larger stages and gives even casual players the oppurtunity to get through the game easily.\n\nBut you're not a filthy casual, are you? You're a huge nerd with the penchant for speedrunning! Enjoy reverse engineering the game mechanics, planning routes and equipment, executing optimal frame-perfect runs, and feeling great about yourself as you destroy your friends' inferior records. Kill those leaderboards, KILL THEM! Many levels can actually be completed under 30 secs without praying a single time. You'd be surprised how the people on the leaderboards got there. (the legitimate ones, that is)\n\n\nEXTRA DETAILS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n= Port Features/Differences =\nThis Steam version mirrors the xbox version. It is missing 1 level that is exclusive to the PSP, but has a different set of 7 stages and equipment (the time beast route). Some levels, items, and mechanics have changed as well; the wiki is somewhat inaccurate in some areas. You can play in the original 8bit style or the new neocartoon look. I reccomend neocartoon for larger resolutions. Multiplayer mode is expanded from the xbox counterpart, but unfortunately very few people are around to play it.\n\n= "60+ RPG Games and Extra Modes" =\nThe flavor text at the steam page is somewhat misleading. The game advertises itself as 60+ seperate full RPGs; its more truthful to identify them as seperate levels. The main game consists almost entirely of Hero 30 and Hero 300. Knight 30, Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and so on are advertised as "extra modes" but are in fact seperate chapters that are still relevant to the plot and serve to bridge Hero 30 to Hero 300.\n\nThe important thing to note is that the graphics you chose matter in these modes:\n\n- If you play in neo-cartoon mode, Knight 30, Evil Lord 30 and Princess 30 become very short single-level chapters. You'll play different characters with slightly different mechanics, but it will mostly be identical to hero 30.\n\n- If you play in the original 8bit retro-mode, these same chapters become completely different, fleshed out mini-games each with thier own set of levels.\n\n= Bug =\nSometimes entering holes teleport you out of the map and unable to complete the level. It may also cause the game to crash after a level ends. To fix this, you'll have to verify the cache. This glitch is prevalent in quest #22.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuest #30 (Cursed Hero) is the best level.\nAt least play through that.\nIt is a better love story than Twilight.","March 27, 2013","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Half-Minute Hero is a silly and experimental RPG developed by Opus releasing in Japan and the US in 2009 on the PSP. After weak sales on the PSP the developers gave the game a second chance on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. The game is split between 4 diverse game modes "Hero 30", "Evil Lord 30", "Princess 30" and "Knight 30" all centered around the half a minute theme.\n\nGameplay:\n\n"Hero 30" is the star of the game as it distills everything RPG down to their most basic elements. Each level is essentially a full RPG campaign where you'll start off at level one, talk to NPCs, gather info, take on quests, buy equipment, and grind your way up to the world destroying Evil Lord all in 30 seconds. Fortunately your allowed to turn back the clock for an incrementing fee of gold. This cost will eventually force you to find a quick way to complete the stage, so you'll need to move smart as the game values tactics over reflexes.\n\nBattles are automatic affairs where you and the enemy will ram each until one of you dies. Fortunately you have input through dashing which drains life so you can move faster (useable out of battle), use an item like a healing herb, and running away. Combat goes by in a flash but can be surprisingly tense as you'll have to worry whether you made the right preparations for a fight.\n\nAs you can imagine such a simplified set of mechanics requires creative level design to make the most  out of it and you'd be right. Levels are packed with content and often provide a lot of freedom in completing an objective which will likely lead to repeated playthroughs to find secrets, collect gear, and find the quickest way to complete a level.\n\nNext up is "Evil Lord 30". This mode is a real-time strategy game where you play as a Evil Lord, where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors with creatures you summon against various enemies you'll face.  There are 3 types to account for and you can summon: high damage dealing Brutes; fast Nimbles; and long ranged Shooters. You're limited in how quickly you can summon creatures by the magic circle around the Evil Lord the smaller it is the weaker the creature you summon, so keep an eye on the size of your magic circle. Its quite satisfying to watch your army of massive minions trample over an enemy force when you've gotten a hang of exploiting enemy weakness. Unfortunately the simplified control scheme tends to work against this mode as you lack any precision when commanding your minions, since all you can do is tell all minions in your magic circle to charge in a specific direction.\n\n"Princess 30", a scrolling shoot-em-up where you control a princess and her soldiers as she blasts her way through enemies with her crossbow to find a cure for her fathers sickness. The objective usually involves traveling across the stage by shooting enemies and avoiding hazards to defeat a boss or pick up an item, and make it back to the castle before time runs out. The stages will have you frantically avoiding obstacles and keeping you on your toes with some pretty interesting variety of enemies. But it can get repetitive due to having less variety in its objectives than the other modes so it's best played inter-spaced between play sessions of other modes.\n\nLastly there's “Knight 30” where you control a perpetually optimistic knight who must guard the sage who brought him back to life. There's a surprisingly strong somber atmosphere here as you desperately search for a hero who will purge the evil that infests the world, through desolate settlements and castles you've been to before. The trademark humor is still present so it never gets particularly bleak.\n\nThis isn't exactly just a set of escort mission either as the knight is too weak to actually kill any monsters, so he must depend on the sage's magic which takes 30 seconds to charge. The knight's job is to stall the creatures with anything he can his hands on such as rocks, sticks, and even his own body. He can also move the sage by either lifting him or calling him over, which will not only be necessary in finding a more defensible position. But also to get to areas that will speed up the sage's magic. This all plays on the strong level design of these stages as you need battle against new environments to keep the sage safe.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode in the PC / 360 releases and it plays like "Hero 30" only multiple players will compete over who defeats the Evil Lord first on multiplayer unique maps. Its also very difficult to find people playing multiplayer, so I have little experience here.\n\nStory:\n\nThere is actually a over-arching story tying these campaigns together which come together in fairly satisfying manner despite their simplicity. But its really the dialogue and self-aware humor that stand out as it has a lot fun with various RPG conventions/tropes. While still providing plethora of humor for those less experienced in the genre. Your constant companion the greedy Time Goddess is always good for a laugh as well.\n\nSomething to note is the surprising moments of sincerity that almost seem to come out of left field. These rare moments juxtapose with the general satirical atmosphere while using the episodic nature of stages so well, that I found them completely unforgettable.\n\nAll the story sequences are also skippable which makes replaying stages a lot more convenient.\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe game has great presentation sporting a 8-bit art-style harkening back to the early Dragon Quest games. Alternatively there's the default paper-craft graphics of the PC release which you can switch between. While its not quite as fitting it will scale better on larger monitors. The soundtrack is also fantastic sporting quality rock and orchestral tracks from a variety well-known Japanese composers (Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Norihiko Hibino, etc.).\n\nConclusion:\n\nHalf-Minute Hero is a game with a lot heart. Its clear that the developers love the  genre or they couldn't have so lovingly satirized RPGs on both a story and mechanical level so well. I heartily recommend this game despite a few misgivings I have for the "Evil Lord 30" and "Princess 30" modes as they're still good fun. The main attraction "Hero 30" will definitely give you constant hours of entertainment especially since it'll likely tug on the inner explorer/completionist in you. To top it off its an excellent value at only $10 for PC.\n\nNotes:\n\n-Important: You can only play non-Hero 30 modes in the original 8-bit graphics style in the PC version.\n\n-You can get useful hints from your caravan, so make sure to talk to them.\n\n-The Goddess Room which contained unlockable artwork and the music player was removed in the 360 and PC releases.\n\n-Stat symbols can be a bit vague. So I'll try to explain them:\nSword=Attack,  Armor = Defense, Boot = Speed, Weight = Weight, Target = Critical Hit, Shield = Evasion","April 12, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is equal parts fun and frustrating. While I like the idea of a time trial-based game, I am not completely sold on how this one is formatted. Every time you complete a mission, it seems like your stats and level is reset, and the fact that it goes to credits after every mission, then go through the intro menu EVERY TIME is really irritating and unnessecary. I'm not sold on the way the fighting sequences are set up either. With no real control over what your character does, it seems almost like an afterthought. There is also the fact that if you somehow  run out of money, you're pretty much screwed, because you can't pay the Goddess to turn back time in villages. Overall, I give this game a "meh" rating.

You can pay the incredibly frugal Time Goddess to reset the clock, but you can't do it forever. The result is a fast-paced game that cuts out the fluff and has you figuring out how to best spend your last precious seconds. The story is simple and very goofy, but effectively told. The music and graphics are both very good. Controls are bad, though... this game was ported from consoles poorly. You basically need a controller for some modes (not Hero, thankfully).\n\nThe game comes with six modes, but Hero 30 is the big draw: the rest pale in comparison. Evil Lord 30 and Princess 30 are fun distractions and don't take long. Knight 30 was okay once I figured it out. Hero 300 is the big climax, and gives you a big payoff for playing the other modes. Hero 3 is infuriating. I didn't try the multiplayer.\n\nAnyone who has enjoyed 8- or 16-bit RPGs needs to pick up this game. Other RPG and puzzle game fans will probably enjoy it as well.

I put in about 14 hours into the main story trying to collect equipment and allies.  However the game does kinda get boring after while.\n\nThe basic idea is that you have 30 seconds to grind and accomplish tasks before running back to a city and paying gold to reset the 30 second timer.  Farther into the game they start to apply certain mechanics to tweak this time reset concept, but overall each mission is the same.  Grind to level up and get gold, to buy and reset the clock ~ until you can kill the bad guy.\n\nPretty fun, but also repetitive.

There's ton of playablity in this game and some replay value as some stages have two different ways to complete it or have missable objectives that you can find in a new replay of the stage. Speed and time management are key in this game. Level grinding takes a few seconds to a few minutes so you aren't going to be playing for hours to reach level 100.\n\nAfter you beat the game there are tons of game modes that make the game different by giving you new challenges and gameplay styles different from the main hero. If you are an achievement hunter my advice to you would be to switch the game to classic graphics so you can unlock some of the achievements from the other game modes. When you change the graphics to classic to neo or vice versa the game style changes too. For example the Princess mode in neo graphic mode you rush enemies and try find certain items to save the King while in classic mode it's more of a shooter instead of rushing into foes and you have a time limit for reaching the objective to help villagers and saving the King. Either game mode you are bound to have fun and if you are fast enough you might make your way on the leaderboard. Good luck and save the future.","July 7, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the very least, you should watch some video gameplay. This game is an innovative mashup of different genres (primarily JRPG and Puzzle). If you enjoyed the PSP original, ever enjoyed JRPGs in your life, like to play puzzle games, or like quirky/innovative games... you should just stop reading and buy the game. If you're on the fence, I'll do my best to describe to you what this game is and what this game is not. I'm going to write a lot, but it's necessary to give a good picture of this game.\n\n(If you've played the PSP version before, skip to the end of the review for a list of changes made.)\n\nAs you can tell, I'm a huge fan of this game. I enjoyed it a lot on the PSP and I enjoy it even more on the xbox. I'm going to be very enthusiastic in this review since I don't think many people even know the game exists and it can use all the hype it can get. But I seriously encourage you to at least try the demo, it's such a interesting concept that I think most gamers should at least experience it.\n\nI can't guarantee you'll like it. But who definitely won't like Half Minute Hero? People who loathe solving puzzles, the JRPG concept, japanese-quirky games, or non turnbased games. People who like the genres they're already playing and don't want to try something new. People who buy it expecting it to be a traditional JRPG. People who need top of the line graphics and voice acting to enjoy a game. People who need to spend more than 60 hours on a 10 dollar game.\n\nNeedless to say, this game does not take 30 seconds to beat. It's not a 60 hour game either, but there isn't any fat... no grinding hours for items or toiling on mindless tasks.\n\n- Gameplay -\n\nThe gameplay is a JRPG stripped down to its barest elements. It is not a traditional JRPG, although it uses the JRPG elements. The game is composed of several stages that could be mini-JRPGs in their own right (complete with title screen and credits.) You start off each stage at Level 1, although you can use any of the equipment you've found in previous stages. You get into random battles to kill monsters to get money and level up, buy equipment at villages, read through walls of dialogue, complete quests to progress the story, complete optional side quests to gain allies or special items, then ultimately defeat the Evil Lord threatening to destroy the world. The twist is that you have a 30 second timer to do all this and once that timer hits 0, it's game over. But you can pay an ever increasing sum to reset the timer to 30 seconds at any village. You can also dash around to move faster and avoid random battles, but while dashing, your HP is consumed.\n\nBattles are also stripped down to their barest elements and made to go as fast as possible. Battles are viewed from the side where you and your opponents simply run at each other. You clash, damage is dealt based on your respective stats, and you repeat until one of you is dead. You can choose to dash, which eats more of your life but makes the battle go faster, or use a healing item, which can be expensive and you need money to reset the timer, or run away if you don't think you'll win. Battles are still strategic... you have to decide when you can take an enemy and you can equip items that can cause the battle to be a lot easier (such as equipping a Silver weapon that can One Hit Kill demon enemies.) They're still exciting, especially late in the game when you might finish battles with milliseconds to spare, then need to rush to the nearest village to reset your time.\n\nThe game parodies the JRPG genre and the different stages address the many tropes of JRPGs. Some stages focus around you needing to collect special equipment to defeat the big baddie, others have you do fetch quests, another has you chase your rival around, while others send you hunting for special monsters. There are 72 different stages and they're all really creative. As the game goes on, some new gimmicks are introduced. Most of the stages have different paths you can take to complete them. Sometimes you'll unlock hidden stages by finishing levels in unconventional ways. Some of the secret stages are really challenging.\n\nIn my opinion, the best part of this game is the level design... there is so much packed into each level. In order to beat the stage at all, you'll probably play the stage one to three times. To unlock the titles (you gain titles by performing certain tasks in levels), collect all the equipment, or get the top times you'll need to play the stages a lot. It's a joy to go through them. Playing through a stage is like solving a small puzzle. And you can get that satisfied feeling of leveling up in a game and overpowering your enemies.\n\nLet me explain how a stage might work. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm just making up an example, but the stages play out a lot like this. Here's what you can expect:\n\nIn your first run through a stage, you might grind for a few minutes, pay 300G to recruit a mercenary ally from a bar, complete a sidequest for him by finding a memento left for him by his deceased wife in a cave that boosts his power, grind some more, reach level 60, then finally be strong enough to take out the mini-boss and the boss. You unlock a title and completed the stage in maybe five minutes (throughout the stage you'll be stopping at villages to chat, learn some backstory, heal, and reset the timer.)\n\nBut then you play again. You grind for a bit and recruit the mercenary, but don't do his quest. You remember a townsperson in the first village mentioned something about a hidden village you ignored the first time, so you go searching for it this time. You go through a cave of monsters and find the village on a peninsula in a hidden patch of a forest. The shop there sells a demon slaying sword for 200G. You may need to grind for a minute to afford the sword, but now you can rush through the rest stage and One Hit KO the miniboss and boss. This will get you a new sword to use in future stages, unlock a title, and it took you only three minutes instead of five.\n\nMaybe you're satisfied with what you've done so far. Or maybe you want to get a lower score. Speedrunning may not be your thing, but it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the game. Even without the speed running, the stages are still really fun to go through and you can beat them no matter how good or bad you are at games. But if you want more of a challenge and want more gameplay, it's definitely an option.\n\nLet's say you looked at the leaderboard and saw people were beating the stage within 30 seconds and you want to figure out how. So you play the stage a ton of times, finding several new paths through the stage and some time shaving shortcuts. You finally get the 'Aha!' moment. You equip some armor that lets you swim, shoes that make you dash faster, and a sword that increases your base HP by 30. You don't equip a shield so you can move faster. You start the stage and dash off to a forest in the east, where there's a really weak monster that drops 230G, but no experience. Once you got the gold, you dash off to the village on the peninsula, taking a shortcut through the water this time. Because you're using the sword that boosts your base HP, you don't need to stop by any towns on the way to refill your HP. You use up all your money to buy the demon slaying sword and heal, but it doesn't matter because you're aiming to beat the stage within 30 seconds, so you don't need money to reset the timer. Now you rush through the rest of the stage, again through the water, and beat the mini-boss and the boss with a second to spare. You get nothing new, this playthrough was entirely optional, but you have the satisfaction of beating the stage in 29 seconds rather than three or five minutes. You can play again to lower your score even more. Maybe you took some wasted steps or maybe you finished the boss with a lot of life remaining and you realize you sh","April 7, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half-Minute Hero is a silly and experimental RPG developed by Opus releasing in Japan and the US in 2009 on the PSP. After weak sales on the PSP the developers gave the game a second chance on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. The game is split between 4 diverse game modes "Hero 30", "Evil Lord 30", "Princess 30" and "Knight 30" all centered around the half a minute theme.\n\nGameplay:\n\n"Hero 30" is the star of the game as it distills everything RPG down to their most basic elements. Each level is essentially a full RPG campaign where you'll start off at level one, talk to NPCs, gather info, take on quests, buy equipment, and grind your way up to the world destroying Evil Lord all in 30 seconds. Fortunately your allowed to turn back the clock for an incrementing fee of gold. This cost will eventually force you to find a quick way to complete the stage, so you'll need to move smart as the game values tactics over reflexes.\n\nBattles are automatic affairs where you and the enemy will ram each until one of you dies. Fortunately you have input through dashing which drains life so you can move faster (useable out of battle), use an item like a healing herb, and running away. Combat goes by in a flash but can be surprisingly tense as you'll have to worry whether you made the right preparations for a fight.\n\nAs you can imagine such a simplified set of mechanics requires creative level design to make the most  out of it and you'd be right. Levels are packed with content and often provide a lot of freedom in completing an objective which will likely lead to repeated playthroughs to find secrets, collect gear, and find the quickest way to complete a level.\n\nNext up is "Evil Lord 30". This mode is a real-time strategy game where you play as a Evil Lord, where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors with creatures you summon against various enemies you'll face.  There are 3 types to account for and you can summon: high damage dealing Brutes; fast Nimbles; and long ranged Shooters. You're limited in how quickly you can summon creatures by the magic circle around the Evil Lord the smaller it is the weaker the creature you summon, so keep an eye on the size of your magic circle. Its quite satisfying to watch your army of massive minions trample over an enemy force when you've gotten a hang of exploiting enemy weakness. Unfortunately the simplified control scheme tends to work against this mode as you lack any precision when commanding your minions, since all you can do is tell all minions in your magic circle to charge in a specific direction.\n\n"Princess 30", a scrolling shoot-em-up where you control a princess and her soldiers as she blasts her way through enemies with her crossbow to find a cure for her fathers sickness. The objective usually involves traveling across the stage by shooting enemies and avoiding hazards to defeat a boss or pick up an item, and make it back to the castle before time runs out. The stages will have you frantically avoiding obstacles and keeping you on your toes with some pretty interesting variety of enemies. But it can get repetitive due to having less variety in its objectives than the other modes so it's best played inter-spaced between play sessions of other modes.\n\nLastly there's “Knight 30” where you control a perpetually optimistic knight who must guard the sage who brought him back to life. There's a surprisingly strong somber atmosphere here as you desperately search for a hero who will purge the evil that infests the world, through desolate settlements and castles you've been to before. The trademark humor is still present so it never gets particularly bleak.\n\nThis isn't exactly just a set of escort mission either as the knight is too weak to actually kill any monsters, so he must depend on the sage's magic which takes 30 seconds to charge. The knight's job is to stall the creatures with anything he can his hands on such as rocks, sticks, and even his own body. He can also move the sage by either lifting him or calling him over, which will not only be necessary in finding a more defensible position. But also to get to areas that will speed up the sage's magic. This all plays on the strong level design of these stages as you need battle against new environments to keep the sage safe.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode in the PC / 360 releases and it plays like "Hero 30" only multiple players will compete over who defeats the Evil Lord first on multiplayer unique maps. Its also very difficult to find people playing multiplayer, so I have little experience here.\n\nStory:\n\nThere is actually a over-arching story tying these campaigns together which come together in fairly satisfying manner despite their simplicity. But its really the dialogue and self-aware humor that stand out as it has a lot fun with various RPG conventions/tropes. While still providing plethora of humor for those less experienced in the genre. Your constant companion the greedy Time Goddess is always good for a laugh as well.\n\nSomething to note is the surprising moments of sincerity that almost seem to come out of left field. These rare moments juxtapose with the general satirical atmosphere while using the episodic nature of stages so well, that I found them completely unforgettable.\n\nAll the story sequences are also skippable which makes replaying stages a lot more convenient.\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe game has great presentation sporting a 8-bit art-style harkening back to the early Dragon Quest games. Alternatively there's the default paper-craft graphics of the PC release which you can switch between. While its not quite as fitting it will scale better on larger monitors. The soundtrack is also fantastic sporting quality rock and orchestral tracks from a variety well-known Japanese composers (Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Norihiko Hibino, etc.).\n\nConclusion:\n\nHalf-Minute Hero is a game with a lot heart. Its clear that the developers love the  genre or they couldn't have so lovingly satirized RPGs on both a story and mechanical level so well. I heartily recommend this game despite a few misgivings I have for the "Evil Lord 30" and "Princess 30" modes as they're still good fun. The main attraction "Hero 30" will definitely give you constant hours of entertainment especially since it'll likely tug on the inner explorer/completionist in you. To top it off its an excellent value at only $10 for PC.\n\nNotes:\n\n-Important: You can only play non-Hero 30 modes in the original 8-bit graphics style in the PC version.\n\n-You can get useful hints from your caravan, so make sure to talk to them.\n\n-The Goddess Room which contained unlockable artwork and the music player was removed in the 360 and PC releases.\n\n-Stat symbols can be a bit vague. So I'll try to explain them:\nSword=Attack,  Armor = Defense, Boot = Speed, Weight = Weight, Target = Critical Hit, Shield = Evasion","April 12, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played either version, or both then you aren't missing much here.  With that said I this review (like most I suppose) are based entirely on what you believe to be important in a game.\n\nThe premise of half minute hero is that an evil lord is working a spell to destroy the world, and you have 30 seconds to grind, upgrade your equipment, complete quests and defeat the 'Evil Lord'.  As frantic as it sounds (and can be) you have the Goddess of Time on your side, but as we all know Time is Money, and she will charge you for resetting the clock - while this isn't entirely burdensome it does become expensive quickly which encourages you to move quickly through each quest.\nThe battle system is pretty straight forward requiring very little outside of keeping an eye on your health and using an herb if needed.\n\nThe PC version has three modes: Hero 30 (which is RPG based), Evil Lord 30 (revolves around summoning minions) and Princess 30 (shooting), plus three unlockable modes (which I honestly haven't unlocked yet).\n\nThe PC version also includes two graphics modes, retro and 8-bit which was released with the XBox version.  Personally I enjoy the retro look, but that's simply a matter of opinion.\n\nThe charm and replayability of Half Minute hero is in the humor, multiple branching stories, collectible titles, and equipment.  Although the humor didn't always hit the mark with me, it was still charming in it's own right and although I haven't played through the entire Hero 30 (which is the core game-mode) I did find that collecting titles and unlocking branches could become a little onerous since some of the tasks and hints can be oblique, even with assistance from your caravan.\n\nI was initially hesitant to make this purchase because many of the reviews I had read weren't descriptive enough for me (which I hope this fixes for others), but overall I would give this game an 7/10, and dispite it's shortcomings there is more than enough content to justify $9.99, especially if you haven't played the PSP or XBox versions, if you have and you're still interested I would wait until this goes on sale.","April 5, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm currently enjoying the new graphics and once I beat it, I'll replay levels with the original graphics when I go back for achievements I missed.

At the very least, you should watch some video gameplay. This game is an innovative mashup of different genres (primarily JRPG and Puzzle). If you enjoyed the PSP original, ever enjoyed JRPGs in your life, like to play puzzle games, or like quirky/innovative games... you should just stop reading and buy the game. If you're on the fence, I'll do my best to describe to you what this game is and what this game is not. I'm going to write a lot, but it's necessary to give a good picture of this game.\n\n(If you've played the PSP version before, skip to the end of the review for a list of changes made.)\n\nAs you can tell, I'm a huge fan of this game. I enjoyed it a lot on the PSP and I enjoy it even more on the xbox. I'm going to be very enthusiastic in this review since I don't think many people even know the game exists and it can use all the hype it can get. But I seriously encourage you to at least try the demo, it's such a interesting concept that I think most gamers should at least experience it.\n\nI can't guarantee you'll like it. But who definitely won't like Half Minute Hero? People who loathe solving puzzles, the JRPG concept, japanese-quirky games, or non turnbased games. People who like the genres they're already playing and don't want to try something new. People who buy it expecting it to be a traditional JRPG. People who need top of the line graphics and voice acting to enjoy a game. People who need to spend more than 60 hours on a 10 dollar game.\n\nNeedless to say, this game does not take 30 seconds to beat. It's not a 60 hour game either, but there isn't any fat... no grinding hours for items or toiling on mindless tasks.\n\n- Gameplay -\n\nThe gameplay is a JRPG stripped down to its barest elements. It is not a traditional JRPG, although it uses the JRPG elements. The game is composed of several stages that could be mini-JRPGs in their own right (complete with title screen and credits.) You start off each stage at Level 1, although you can use any of the equipment you've found in previous stages. You get into random battles to kill monsters to get money and level up, buy equipment at villages, read through walls of dialogue, complete quests to progress the story, complete optional side quests to gain allies or special items, then ultimately defeat the Evil Lord threatening to destroy the world. The twist is that you have a 30 second timer to do all this and once that timer hits 0, it's game over. But you can pay an ever increasing sum to reset the timer to 30 seconds at any village. You can also dash around to move faster and avoid random battles, but while dashing, your HP is consumed.\n\nBattles are also stripped down to their barest elements and made to go as fast as possible. Battles are viewed from the side where you and your opponents simply run at each other. You clash, damage is dealt based on your respective stats, and you repeat until one of you is dead. You can choose to dash, which eats more of your life but makes the battle go faster, or use a healing item, which can be expensive and you need money to reset the timer, or run away if you don't think you'll win. Battles are still strategic... you have to decide when you can take an enemy and you can equip items that can cause the battle to be a lot easier (such as equipping a Silver weapon that can One Hit Kill demon enemies.) They're still exciting, especially late in the game when you might finish battles with milliseconds to spare, then need to rush to the nearest village to reset your time.\n\nThe game parodies the JRPG genre and the different stages address the many tropes of JRPGs. Some stages focus around you needing to collect special equipment to defeat the big baddie, others have you do fetch quests, another has you chase your rival around, while others send you hunting for special monsters. There are 72 different stages and they're all really creative. As the game goes on, some new gimmicks are introduced. Most of the stages have different paths you can take to complete them. Sometimes you'll unlock hidden stages by finishing levels in unconventional ways. Some of the secret stages are really challenging.\n\nIn my opinion, the best part of this game is the level design... there is so much packed into each level. In order to beat the stage at all, you'll probably play the stage one to three times. To unlock the titles (you gain titles by performing certain tasks in levels), collect all the equipment, or get the top times you'll need to play the stages a lot. It's a joy to go through them. Playing through a stage is like solving a small puzzle. And you can get that satisfied feeling of leveling up in a game and overpowering your enemies.\n\nLet me explain how a stage might work. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm just making up an example, but the stages play out a lot like this. Here's what you can expect:\n\nIn your first run through a stage, you might grind for a few minutes, pay 300G to recruit a mercenary ally from a bar, complete a sidequest for him by finding a memento left for him by his deceased wife in a cave that boosts his power, grind some more, reach level 60, then finally be strong enough to take out the mini-boss and the boss. You unlock a title and completed the stage in maybe five minutes (throughout the stage you'll be stopping at villages to chat, learn some backstory, heal, and reset the timer.)\n\nBut then you play again. You grind for a bit and recruit the mercenary, but don't do his quest. You remember a townsperson in the first village mentioned something about a hidden village you ignored the first time, so you go searching for it this time. You go through a cave of monsters and find the village on a peninsula in a hidden patch of a forest. The shop there sells a demon slaying sword for 200G. You may need to grind for a minute to afford the sword, but now you can rush through the rest stage and One Hit KO the miniboss and boss. This will get you a new sword to use in future stages, unlock a title, and it took you only three minutes instead of five.\n\nMaybe you're satisfied with what you've done so far. Or maybe you want to get a lower score. Speedrunning may not be your thing, but it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the game. Even without the speed running, the stages are still really fun to go through and you can beat them no matter how good or bad you are at games. But if you want more of a challenge and want more gameplay, it's definitely an option.\n\nLet's say you looked at the leaderboard and saw people were beating the stage within 30 seconds and you want to figure out how. So you play the stage a ton of times, finding several new paths through the stage and some time shaving shortcuts. You finally get the 'Aha!' moment. You equip some armor that lets you swim, shoes that make you dash faster, and a sword that increases your base HP by 30. You don't equip a shield so you can move faster. You start the stage and dash off to a forest in the east, where there's a really weak monster that drops 230G, but no experience. Once you got the gold, you dash off to the village on the peninsula, taking a shortcut through the water this time. Because you're using the sword that boosts your base HP, you don't need to stop by any towns on the way to refill your HP. You use up all your money to buy the demon slaying sword and heal, but it doesn't matter because you're aiming to beat the stage within 30 seconds, so you don't need money to reset the timer. Now you rush through the rest of the stage, again through the water, and beat the mini-boss and the boss with a second to spare. You get nothing new, this playthrough was entirely optional, but you have the satisfaction of beating the stage in 29 seconds rather than three or five minutes. You can play again to lower your score even more. Maybe you took some wasted steps or maybe you finished the boss with a lot of life remaining and you realize you sh","April 7, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half-Minute Hero is a silly and experimental RPG developed by Opus releasing in Japan and the US in 2009 on the PSP. After weak sales on the PSP the developers gave the game a second chance on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. The game is split between 4 diverse game modes "Hero 30", "Evil Lord 30", "Princess 30" and "Knight 30" all centered around the half a minute theme.\n\nGameplay:\n\n"Hero 30" is the star of the game as it distills everything RPG down to their most basic elements. Each level is essentially a full RPG campaign where you'll start off at level one, talk to NPCs, gather info, take on quests, buy equipment, and grind your way up to the world destroying Evil Lord all in 30 seconds. Fortunately your allowed to turn back the clock for an incrementing fee of gold. This cost will eventually force you to find a quick way to complete the stage, so you'll need to move smart as the game values tactics over reflexes.\n\nBattles are automatic affairs where you and the enemy will ram each until one of you dies. Fortunately you have input through dashing which drains life so you can move faster (useable out of battle), use an item like a healing herb, and running away. Combat goes by in a flash but can be surprisingly tense as you'll have to worry whether you made the right preparations for a fight.\n\nAs you can imagine such a simplified set of mechanics requires creative level design to make the most  out of it and you'd be right. Levels are packed with content and often provide a lot of freedom in completing an objective which will likely lead to repeated playthroughs to find secrets, collect gear, and find the quickest way to complete a level.\n\nNext up is "Evil Lord 30". This mode is a real-time strategy game where you play as a Evil Lord, where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors with creatures you summon against various enemies you'll face.  There are 3 types to account for and you can summon: high damage dealing Brutes; fast Nimbles; and long ranged Shooters. You're limited in how quickly you can summon creatures by the magic circle around the Evil Lord the smaller it is the weaker the creature you summon, so keep an eye on the size of your magic circle. Its quite satisfying to watch your army of massive minions trample over an enemy force when you've gotten a hang of exploiting enemy weakness. Unfortunately the simplified control scheme tends to work against this mode as you lack any precision when commanding your minions, since all you can do is tell all minions in your magic circle to charge in a specific direction.\n\n"Princess 30", a scrolling shoot-em-up where you control a princess and her soldiers as she blasts her way through enemies with her crossbow to find a cure for her fathers sickness. The objective usually involves traveling across the stage by shooting enemies and avoiding hazards to defeat a boss or pick up an item, and make it back to the castle before time runs out. The stages will have you frantically avoiding obstacles and keeping you on your toes with some pretty interesting variety of enemies. But it can get repetitive due to having less variety in its objectives than the other modes so it's best played inter-spaced between play sessions of other modes.\n\nLastly there's “Knight 30” where you control a perpetually optimistic knight who must guard the sage who brought him back to life. There's a surprisingly strong somber atmosphere here as you desperately search for a hero who will purge the evil that infests the world, through desolate settlements and castles you've been to before. The trademark humor is still present so it never gets particularly bleak.\n\nThis isn't exactly just a set of escort mission either as the knight is too weak to actually kill any monsters, so he must depend on the sage's magic which takes 30 seconds to charge. The knight's job is to stall the creatures with anything he can his hands on such as rocks, sticks, and even his own body. He can also move the sage by either lifting him or calling him over, which will not only be necessary in finding a more defensible position. But also to get to areas that will speed up the sage's magic. This all plays on the strong level design of these stages as you need battle against new environments to keep the sage safe.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode in the PC / 360 releases and it plays like "Hero 30" only multiple players will compete over who defeats the Evil Lord first on multiplayer unique maps. Its also very difficult to find people playing multiplayer, so I have little experience here.\n\nStory:\n\nThere is actually a over-arching story tying these campaigns together which come together in fairly satisfying manner despite their simplicity. But its really the dialogue and self-aware humor that stand out as it has a lot fun with various RPG conventions/tropes. While still providing plethora of humor for those less experienced in the genre. Your constant companion the greedy Time Goddess is always good for a laugh as well.\n\nSomething to note is the surprising moments of sincerity that almost seem to come out of left field. These rare moments juxtapose with the general satirical atmosphere while using the episodic nature of stages so well, that I found them completely unforgettable.\n\nAll the story sequences are also skippable which makes replaying stages a lot more convenient.\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe game has great presentation sporting a 8-bit art-style harkening back to the early Dragon Quest games. Alternatively there's the default paper-craft graphics of the PC release which you can switch between. While its not quite as fitting it will scale better on larger monitors. The soundtrack is also fantastic sporting quality rock and orchestral tracks from a variety well-known Japanese composers (Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Norihiko Hibino, etc.).\n\nConclusion:\n\nHalf-Minute Hero is a game with a lot heart. Its clear that the developers love the  genre or they couldn't have so lovingly satirized RPGs on both a story and mechanical level so well. I heartily recommend this game despite a few misgivings I have for the "Evil Lord 30" and "Princess 30" modes as they're still good fun. The main attraction "Hero 30" will definitely give you constant hours of entertainment especially since it'll likely tug on the inner explorer/completionist in you. To top it off its an excellent value at only $10 for PC.\n\nNotes:\n\n-Important: You can only play non-Hero 30 modes in the original 8-bit graphics style in the PC version.\n\n-You can get useful hints from your caravan, so make sure to talk to them.\n\n-The Goddess Room which contained unlockable artwork and the music player was removed in the 360 and PC releases.\n\n-Stat symbols can be a bit vague. So I'll try to explain them:\nSword=Attack,  Armor = Defense, Boot = Speed, Weight = Weight, Target = Critical Hit, Shield = Evasion","April 12, 2014","true","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good thing I don't have a hard 30 second time limit to write this review otherwise I'd be broke with no equipment since I'd have to pay the Time Goddess so much.\n\nEnjoy the world of Half Minute Hero, where you play as one of several characters who are associated with a stingy Time Goddess who enjoys every bit of gold in her pockets.\n\nThis takes every single trope that RPGs implement and runs with them. All in less than 30 seconds (per stage). While it is an RPG, the RPG aspect is replaced more by a puzzle aspect and requires you to balance your gold and time to defeat those pesky Evil Lords trying to cast a spell of destruction on the world. There's a good amount of humor, and I found myself laughing almost everytime I turn on this game. There's also several game modes, including Hero 30, Princess 30, and Evil Lord 30. The game puzzles can get rather hard with all the frantic action that happens (considering you have a 30 second time limit, it's not surprising). Just make sure you can think on your feet otherwise you may be on the receiving end of the Spell of Destruction by the Evil Lord across the street!\n\nBut underneath the absurdity and the humor of the game also lies a well done story, not often seen in games. Don't think that this is a comedy through and through!\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to pay the Time Goddess (again).","February 10, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game.

I thought maybe I'd write a review on it.\nIt's a fast-paced game, but it's not unfair. There's an engine which makes it possible to complete with ease on 30 seconds (actually takes longer irl to do it, even though the game time flows just like real life time). This is possible due to the engine they added, which makes the game so interesting and it's not unfair at all, not to mention it's a genious engine. I find myself finishing the stages with spare time.\nI also find myself coming back to this game everytime to play it over and over again, either to remember the storyline (yes, I bought this game quite a while ago) or to try and get some of the achievements I didn't have.\nI think I've finished the last boss fight 3 or more times already, and it still is pretty interesting and awesome.\n\nAlthough it's hard to find players to play multiplayer nowadays, I can easily see your money being well-spent for the single-player levels only. As for the multiplayer level: If you have a friend to play with, I can easily see you both having loads of fun trying to cooperate while fighting each other to be the true hero on multiplayer. Or you could also try tagging the multiplayer levels yourself! I haven't finished all the multiplayer levels by myself because some are hard to be done alone, but by editing your starting status, it becomes easier.\n\nAlso, I highly reccommend having a controller for the game. I have a PS2 controller with an USB port, which I use to play this game. I actually haven't tried the keyboard controls, but I have a friend who uses them, and he says they're not hard to get used to and he also thinks this game is fun.","January 21, 2014","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will need both the reflexes and the smarts to plan an optimal route to beat the clock!\n\nSpeedrunners and RPG fans will get the most kick out of this game. It's also a fantastic, fresh experience for any other players interested and well worth the few bucks it costs when on sale.\n\nI highly reccomend playing to beat the >time<, not the game. Go for the gold, and go beyond!\n\n\n30 secs to do everything sounds daunting, but you have the option to pray (aka bribe) to the time goddess and reset the clock. Kill some random monsters and you can buy yourself some leeway. This is necessary for the much larger stages and gives even casual players the oppurtunity to get through the game easily.\n\nBut you're not a filthy casual, are you? You're a huge nerd with the penchant for speedrunning! Enjoy reverse engineering the game mechanics, planning routes and equipment, executing optimal frame-perfect runs, and feeling great about yourself as you destroy your friends' inferior records. Kill those leaderboards, KILL THEM! Many levels can actually be completed under 30 secs without praying a single time. You'd be surprised how the people on the leaderboards got there. (the legitimate ones, that is)\n\n\nEXTRA DETAILS\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n= Port Features/Differences =\nThis Steam version mirrors the xbox version. It is missing 1 level that is exclusive to the PSP, but has a different set of 7 stages and equipment (the time beast route). Some levels, items, and mechanics have changed as well; the wiki is somewhat inaccurate in some areas. You can play in the original 8bit style or the new neocartoon look. I reccomend neocartoon for larger resolutions. Multiplayer mode is expanded from the xbox counterpart, but unfortunately very few people are around to play it.\n\n= "60+ RPG Games and Extra Modes" =\nThe flavor text at the steam page is somewhat misleading. The game advertises itself as 60+ seperate full RPGs; its more truthful to identify them as seperate levels. The main game consists almost entirely of Hero 30 and Hero 300. Knight 30, Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, and so on are advertised as "extra modes" but are in fact seperate chapters that are still relevant to the plot and serve to bridge Hero 30 to Hero 300.\n\nThe important thing to note is that the graphics you chose matter in these modes:\n\n- If you play in neo-cartoon mode, Knight 30, Evil Lord 30 and Princess 30 become very short single-level chapters. You'll play different characters with slightly different mechanics, but it will mostly be identical to hero 30.\n\n- If you play in the original 8bit retro-mode, these same chapters become completely different, fleshed out mini-games each with thier own set of levels.\n\n= Bug =\nSometimes entering holes teleport you out of the map and unable to complete the level. It may also cause the game to crash after a level ends. To fix this, you'll have to verify the cache. This glitch is prevalent in quest #22.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nQuest #30 (Cursed Hero) is the best level.\nAt least play through that.\nIt is a better love story than Twilight.","March 27, 2013","true","36.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

With it's whacky sense of humour and retro style this game has it all, packing a plethora of different game modes that can be played in short bursts or happily eat up a few hours of your time. The premise to the games main mode "Hero 30" is different to say the very least. What on the surface appears to be a retro Japanese RPG has actually been condensed into an insane amount of 30 second missions that lampoon traditional RPG tropes. Now this premise may sound completely broken but thanks to a wonderfully helplful deus ex machina known as "The Time Goddess" (who gives our hero some leeway with his thirty second time limit) it totally works.\n\nBut that's not all! The game also has a few other modes up it's sleeve to give it a longevity boost that will keep you playing for more than half a minute. Princess 30 is a sidescrolling shooter where you play a kind hearted but borderline psychotic Princess who blasts her enemies with a semi-automatic repeating crossbow whilst being rushed around by a small army of guards. Evil Lord 30 is a real-time strategy game that puts you in the dapper outfit of the fabulous "Beautiful Evil Lord" who has renounced his evil ways so that he can grow flowers and drink tea with his newly beloved. When this peace and tranquility are threatened however the Evil Lord breaks out his summoning skills and unleashes wave after wave of monsters upon the castle's unsuspecting invaders. Knight 30 is an action game where you play as a lone knight protecting a wandering sage from hordes of monsters. The story here plays out a lot like Journey To The West (one of my favourite books of all time) which it clearly takes a great deal of inspiration from. The final two modes are Hero 300 and Hero 3 mode which are expansions upon Hero 30 mode that give you 300 and 3 second time limits respectively.\n\nIf like me you are a retro gamer then you will adore Half Minute Hero. It does help if you have a whacky sense of humour, but even if you don't I'm sure you will still be able to appreciate the way the game lampoons those classic video game tropes that we all love and grew up with.","December 27, 2012","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played either version, or both then you aren't missing much here.  With that said I this review (like most I suppose) are based entirely on what you believe to be important in a game.\n\nThe premise of half minute hero is that an evil lord is working a spell to destroy the world, and you have 30 seconds to grind, upgrade your equipment, complete quests and defeat the 'Evil Lord'.  As frantic as it sounds (and can be) you have the Goddess of Time on your side, but as we all know Time is Money, and she will charge you for resetting the clock - while this isn't entirely burdensome it does become expensive quickly which encourages you to move quickly through each quest.\nThe battle system is pretty straight forward requiring very little outside of keeping an eye on your health and using an herb if needed.\n\nThe PC version has three modes: Hero 30 (which is RPG based), Evil Lord 30 (revolves around summoning minions) and Princess 30 (shooting), plus three unlockable modes (which I honestly haven't unlocked yet).\n\nThe PC version also includes two graphics modes, retro and 8-bit which was released with the XBox version.  Personally I enjoy the retro look, but that's simply a matter of opinion.\n\nThe charm and replayability of Half Minute hero is in the humor, multiple branching stories, collectible titles, and equipment.  Although the humor didn't always hit the mark with me, it was still charming in it's own right and although I haven't played through the entire Hero 30 (which is the core game-mode) I did find that collecting titles and unlocking branches could become a little onerous since some of the tasks and hints can be oblique, even with assistance from your caravan.\n\nI was initially hesitant to make this purchase because many of the reviews I had read weren't descriptive enough for me (which I hope this fixes for others), but overall I would give this game an 7/10, and dispite it's shortcomings there is more than enough content to justify $9.99, especially if you haven't played the PSP or XBox versions, if you have and you're still interested I would wait until this goes on sale.","April 5, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm currently enjoying the new graphics and once I beat it, I'll replay levels with the original graphics when I go back for achievements I missed.

I'm not sold on the way the fighting sequences are set up either. With no real control over what your character does, it seems almost like an afterthought. There is also the fact that if you somehow  run out of money, you're pretty much screwed, because you can't pay the Goddess to turn back time in villages. Overall, I give this game a "meh" rating.

The spell of destruction is being cast and the world will end in 30 seconds. Chosen by the time goddess you become the warrior of the goddess. Though the goddess loves money above all else so every time you want to turn back the clock you'll have to pay up. Various weapon, and armor upgrades are spread out throughout the levels. Sometime the level will give multiple ways of finishing it and sometimes doing so will lead to separate paths. The run at each other combat is automatic unless you have a special item. You must find who is spreading the spell of destruction and stop him.\n\nPositive\nThe game levels play out a lot like different puzzles which is great. It makes fun of itself and the JRPG genre in delightful ways. The soundtrack is nice and retro. It offers two different graphic modes. Once you beat the main story other gameplay modes gradually unlock. It is important to note that Princess 30, Knight 30, and Evil Lord 30 are different in retro mode then in cartoon graphic mode which means even more variety. Finding all the secrets in the levels is actually pretty fun.\n\nNegative\nThe gameplay does repeat itself and it very fast paced so it can wear on you. This is a port of a port and the menu setup is not the greatest if your hoping to customize controls or options. I used a 360 controller and it worked great by default, but the button prompts always show keyboard keys. They don't explain hardly anything so you'll have to look at guides to even know what stats do for example. The human characters in cartoon mode are very bad compared to enemy design.\n\nConclusion\nIf you love combat  mixed with puzzles in combination that are fast paced this is your kind of game, but if not I suggest staying away. Though to be honest it's hard to imagine somebody totally hating this game. It's just a silly fun game.\n\nValue\nI'd suggest buying the 2nd game and getting this one free. So if you do that at the $10 mark you'll get a great value here.","May 16, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a better pick-up-and-play game than it is a game you play long sessions of. Fairly lighthearted, pretty simple in concept but each battle does try to mix things up a little. I played through the story to the end (Hero 300) and it never felt like it got "old", but I feel like there were things that could've been done better.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you run out of time... why not just reset you back to the last point where you reset time instead of making you redo everything? I feel that would've been super easy to do, but nope, gotta restart the whole thing, which is really tedious. Really this is my one big complaint, it would've made the game a lot more fun and less stressful. I can nitpick about some other small things (some of the challenges feelng like filler, flee buttons literally never working for me, the overly-strictness of hero 300 despite it being one of the longest levels in the game, etc.) but really the main problems come down to this.\n\nIf you want a fast-paced puzzle/RPG hybrid with some lightheartedness and not a looot of replayability but a decent bit of it (there's time challenges and titles and stuff that I couldn't be bothered to complete, meh) then you'll probably enjoy this, I'd probably put this game at "meh" if I had the option to but it's definitely alright enough to recommend, sure.","January 5","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a unique sort of arcadey take on RPGs. Its a lot of fun to play. I can't really say much else. Its something you have to try out for yourself. Its easy to just jump into and have fun with it.\n\nThe music and visuals were nice - I much preferred the retro looking graphics. The newer ones looked kind of bad. You can change your visual setting so no biggie there.\n\nThere were a lot of levels including hidden and alternate paths on the world map. Lots of things to gear your character out with which was cool.\n\nThere are a few different game modes, but only one of them was really good. Doesn't hurt to have the extras though I suppose.\n\nSome problems were the game being locked to 720p - If you like the retro artstyle then its no biggie and the game will look played on a monitor with a larger native res. If you like the cartoony artstyle then it becomes a problem.\nAlso, the multiplayer kinda' sucked because it had like no proper way to specifically play with friends or someone you want. It was so random. Not sure if anything relating it has been changed.\n\nAnyways, the couple flaws are easy to look past when the gameplay is so much fun. Its a fun take on a classic genre. Worth playing for certain.","March 6","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And... well, I won't spoil the fun. Just keep in mind that Half Minute Hero is not only a game where you are Hero. Anyway, half of minute It's more than enough. It's plenty of time to level up, buy some stuff and beat the main boss... with little help of someone, but you need plenty of money for that.\nThis game was one of main reasons to get PSP console. I did that, played and completed Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy few years ago and now it's avaible here, on Steam. With achievements! This reason alone was good to jump into magical world of half minute to do everything once again. Graphics, at least retro graphics, looks amazing. The characters, story, music is great. It's very fun to play. Longer or shorter sitting, it's perfect for both. Half Minute Hero is perfect way to describe a parody game.\nEarlier there wasn't deal like that but if you will buy the sequel game, you will get Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy for free. In my opinion, that's a great deal. It's a game for many hours, even more if you enjoy to 100% your games. It's something different and I love when devs come up with something original. Lately games are missing it so if you aren't scared of trying something new, then try it. I didn't regret it and I will gladly continue being a Hero, or someone else, in the sequel.","January 11","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With it's whacky sense of humour and retro style this game has it all, packing a plethora of different game modes that can be played in short bursts or happily eat up a few hours of your time. The premise to the games main mode "Hero 30" is different to say the very least. What on the surface appears to be a retro Japanese RPG has actually been condensed into an insane amount of 30 second missions that lampoon traditional RPG tropes. Now this premise may sound completely broken but thanks to a wonderfully helplful deus ex machina known as "The Time Goddess" (who gives our hero some leeway with his thirty second time limit) it totally works.\n\nBut that's not all! The game also has a few other modes up it's sleeve to give it a longevity boost that will keep you playing for more than half a minute. Princess 30 is a sidescrolling shooter where you play a kind hearted but borderline psychotic Princess who blasts her enemies with a semi-automatic repeating crossbow whilst being rushed around by a small army of guards. Evil Lord 30 is a real-time strategy game that puts you in the dapper outfit of the fabulous "Beautiful Evil Lord" who has renounced his evil ways so that he can grow flowers and drink tea with his newly beloved. When this peace and tranquility are threatened however the Evil Lord breaks out his summoning skills and unleashes wave after wave of monsters upon the castle's unsuspecting invaders. Knight 30 is an action game where you play as a lone knight protecting a wandering sage from hordes of monsters. The story here plays out a lot like Journey To The West (one of my favourite books of all time) which it clearly takes a great deal of inspiration from. The final two modes are Hero 300 and Hero 3 mode which are expansions upon Hero 30 mode that give you 300 and 3 second time limits respectively.\n\nIf like me you are a retro gamer then you will adore Half Minute Hero. It does help if you have a whacky sense of humour, but even if you don't I'm sure you will still be able to appreciate the way the game lampoons those classic video game tropes that we all love and grew up with.","December 27, 2012","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've noticed that as the game goes on, it gets really boring and repetitive really fast. I found myself unable to play it for much longer after writing this review. It felt more like a chore to complete it. No, I still don't exactly suck at it (though Knight 30 can bite me), but it started boring me to tears after finishing Hero30. There are teh classic game modes, but they just don't... feel good to play through.\n\nMaybe you'll like this, but I got bored.","February 21","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
