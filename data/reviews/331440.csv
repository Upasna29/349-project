Bosses require you to just mash the attack button (or just move into them as the game auto attacks for you upon making contact with an enemy). Since the dungeons are randomly generated as well, there is no difficulty involved aside from remembering which rooms you need to go back to. The game is Zelda inspired in looks alone, puzzles are room specific and don't get harder than moving a block onto a button or pushing all the levers in the room in no particular order.\n\nThe differences in weapons don't seem to make a large difference, until that is you find something with life-steal, in which case congratulations, you've essentially won the game. Life-steal is unbalanced in it's current state, allowing you to ignore every "mechanic" of each enemy in the game.\n\nStats and stat upgrades are also a bit unbalanced, as well as being very unclear. There is a stat screen in game, but no where does it tell you what each stat does. Strength and Dex are found on weapons, and Spirit seemingly effects your ability to force-attack, but things like Berserk or Cleave or Smite (found on some Epic Weapons) are uninformative. Achievements were previously broken, but the Developer has since fixed all but one.\n\nI would be able to recommend this game if it were, sigh, Early-Access, but in it's current state where I beat the game and New Game ++ in my third run through, where the monster and boss variety is non-existent, and where certain stats can completely break the game, I just can't. The Developer asks for suggestions in a thread on the Steam Community page for the game, but upon writing my thought out suggestions, I was swiftly ignored for someone suggesting a map be included in-game to which the developer agreed. I'm not so sure he wants to make the necessary changes to the game to make it worth purchasing unfortunately.","January 9, 2015","false","5.0"," 161 of 199 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","161","199","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskedklaus/recommended/331440/","maskedklaus","Reverend Klaus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maskedklaus/","495 products in account","It's an interesting concept, and in many ways I really want to like it. The gameplay is simple in an addictive kind of way. Move around, use one button to attack, block, use abilities...it works well, aside from the time when spells just wouldn't work for reasons unkown. There's a lot of Zelda homage here, and it moves along at a good pace, that is until it all just starts to blur together...\n\nWhile I applaud the variety of enemy visuals and attacks, after a while they all sort of became the same. I would enter rooms full of enemies and just plough right into them no matter which ones I saw, mostly due to the fact that I was just too powerful. Heck, I was so overpowered before beating the first dungeon, after a while I quit watching my health. It was never an issue after I got a few items. Never.\n\nSecond, my biggest complaint is the procedural generation. I love rogue likes, I really do. They are my bread and butter. But I just don't think the random work generation works in this game. In Zelda, it was so fun exploring, finding the hidden secrets, and unlocking paths to new and interesting places. But to make the random generation work, all this has is a huge collection of screens, with a few really easy tricks like magic mazes. Also, because so many of the screens looks the same, and with no overworld map, it was ridiculous trying to figure out where I had already been. It made finding a few of the dungeons tedious as I would walk on and on forever.\n\nThis random generation is really felt in the dungeons too. They have a Zelda feel to them, but since they have to be randomly generated, it lacks the puzzles and depth of a real Zelda dungeon. All you have to do in run from room to room, killing everything along you way, hitting every button you see, looping back around again and again, and eventually, through dumb luck, you'll get through the dungeon. Thinking never really entered into it, just the persistence to go through the same hallway time and time again for a few minutes.\n\nAll in all, this game just ended up getting boring pretty fast. It was just walking from screen to screen, killing everything I saw without a challenge. In fact, I literally killed every single boss in 2-5 seconds. Not an exageration. I just walk up to them, they would say something like "Hey, I'm gonna kill you whole bunches" then I would just hit them as rapidly as I could for a few seconds without taking any damage and they would die.  Even with endless dull wandering around, I managed to beat the game on my first try, in about an hour and a half.\n\nI understand after beating it the game keeps going, getting more challenging with each run, but honestly the idea of playing through this again in hopes of slightly more challenge with each dull playthrough just doesn't appeal to me.\n\nI really do appreaciate what this game was trying to do. The concept is awesome, and it has a lot of stuff going for it. But borring is just one thing a game should not be within the first half hour of playing.","December 15, 2014","false","1.9"," 213 of 292 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","213","292","3","7"

It has a lot of potential, all the bare bones are there, it just never got fleshed out.\n\nIt feels like an early access game, except that its not. The developer made a couple updates a few days after its release, and has not touched it since. As it stands:\n\n- The overworld map is not large and always exactly the same.\n- There are 7 dungeons to play through, and 7 premade layouts, none of which are very interesting or difficult.\n- This games idea of a puzzle is placing 4 switches in a row with a pushable rock one pixel away from each.\n- The items you find feel like nobody even tried to ballance the mechanics, so even though I think there are 10 types of weapons, only a few are playable.\n-One button does everything, which means you have to mash it and hope that translates into blocking and attacking at the same time, while hoping you dont pick up one of the endless crappy items that always drop right on top of you because if you die or move to another room before you pick your good item back up, you lose it forever. Which is needlessly frustrating.\n\nThis game really could have been interesting and fun, but it requires major updating. If there is an update, ill probably look into it. But until then this should be on the early access list, its not a full game yet. $2 or less if you don't want to feel ripped off.","January 18, 2015","false","30.3"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","90","113","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/331440/","dons20","TRUÂ±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","I sit here in shock after playing this game for about 5-ish hours. At level 123 I was about to face the final boss. I had grinded for hours for the best gear I could find, the best stats that would help me kill bosses better. I had prepared myself, I was ready, this had to work right?\n\nI approached the boss, stealthing in, critting him for well over 3k hp and hitting him relentlessly only to discover that he had taken my health down to a third and was gearing up for another attack. I barely scratched him and I had no extra life, so I charged in once more for my final attack......\n\nGame Over\n\nStory Bit Dungeon II's story is more or less non-existent, save for the fact that you are supposed to free this ghost girl from her grave. You have no name, no history, no clue about who you are and why you have to help her, but not all heroes wear capes get proper information at the start of their journey.\n\nGameplayBit Dungeon II has some of the most fun, and addicting gameplay for a 2d, dungeon crawling, RPG. I had gotten tired of the one button press, boring rpgs that had the same attack animation each time, and the enemies would die in the same way for the most part. This game changes that by automatically attacking, and allowing the player to use special, weapon-specific abilities at his command, which are tied to the resource called stamina (purple bar section). It may sound very easy, but when you face off against a horde of enemies guarding a chest or a boss who can easily 3 shot you, you'll see just how difficult combat can really be.\n\nThe controls are pretty much straightforward, once you actually figure them out that is. One button is configured to Guard/Special Abilities (a weird combo but it works). There are also buttons for the Main Menu, Stats and Inventory. This makes it a simple-enough game, with some hidden mechanics worth trying.\n\nThere are many weapons in this game, which was pretty nice overall, but I really enjoyed the ability to use any weapon I found, if I wanted to. Even though there wasn't an official class system, the game would grant you stats catered to what you were building when you levelled up. Greatswords would generally give you strength (more physical damage) and constitution (more health and stamina), while staffs would give you more magic oriented stats such as intelligence. I liked the ability to dual wield weapons, so I grabbed two daggers myself, and found the most addicting style of gameplay.\n\nEach weapon had its own special abilities. For daggers and blades, you could walk around in stealth, and you'd get an insane damage bonus for surprise damage. If you were seen, or in combat prior to this, you'd have to walk around for about 2 - 3 seconds before you'd go back to an undetected state, allowing you to deal surprise damage again. One thing that was very clear to me was that each weapon had very distinct strengths and weaknesses. This made it very crucial to identify my ideal playstyle, and test each weapon enough before sticking to them, and once decided upon, stick to it. Stealth gameplay was great for assassination on a small number of targets, but if you ever got surrounded you would most likely die. On my first playthrough, this was my fate as I realized simply building dexterity wasn't enough to survive.\n\nThere were 4 main areas in the game and around 8 or so dungeons. They were not randomized, so it was possible to memorize layouts or plan strategies for approaching them. In my experience, dungeons were my favourite places to be, as the rat-like creatures which feasted upon previously killed enemies dropped health potions fairly often and prevented me from dying. Bosses were pretty varied, and had unique mechanics tied to each of them, though some weapons were a little better on some than others.\n\nIf you died, you were allowed one respawn if you had the extra life from the ghost girl at the start. If you managed to return to the place that you died, you could pick up that extra life and repeat the process again. I loved this mechanic, as it didn't make death such a scary prospect.\n\nNegativesI didn't quite like the equip/inventory system as it took me a while to figure out that I could only have one of each type of item at a time. This made the inventory almost useless, as it was only to look at my existing items and figure out what I would aim for next.\n\nAs stated before, there was no tutorial or guide to the game so the initial learning curve was rough, and it was only after my second time seeing "Game Over" that I finally understood how the game worked at each section.\n\nAnd finally, â¥â¥â¥â¥ that final boss, I was at level 123 and I got 3 shot, wtf.\n\nSummaryBit Dungeon II is one of the most fun 2d RPGs I've played in a long time. Some people may say the first was better, I wouldn't know since I never played it. But don't let that turn you away from this game, it's definitely a fun one. If you can get it on sale, and you don't mind spending a little extra time to learn the mechanics, this game is definitely worth buying.\n\n7.5/10 on sale - Must...Continue...Grinding....\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

If you have a look at my collection, I am a huge fan of Rogue-likes, dungeon crawlers, Dark Souls, etc. While this game isn't perfect - it certainly shows an evolution from the dev's earlier work (the Kongregate bit Dungeon). Both games feature some flavor from the Souls series and Rogue-likes, and I think that if take these games and their complexity in sequence...we could be looking at a very fun formula for an indie dungeon crawler in the future.\n\nWhat I like -\n\n1. Combat: While combat is simplistic, I rather like the frantic pace.\n\n2. It borrows well: Souls elements are here - you get a shot at recovering your heart (like your bloodstain in Souls games), and leaving it in a rather precarious place in a dungeon has the same vibe as in the souls games. Perhaps my favorite Souls feature is the way that there are even quality weapons (Dex+Strength scaling) and the fact that stat scaling is at all part of the game is super fun. My favorite game series by far, so any homage is welcome!\n\n3. Loot and Gear: Loot variety is promising and will only improve over time assuming the game is supported. I found myself building a Dex character with Berserker and life steal, which was quite potent towards the end game.\n\n4. Locales and Aesthetics: Areas are quite gorgeous and dungeons (while procedurally generated and featuring very little in the way of features like traps or special mechanics) at least have a common theme and unification of art style. I enjoyed enemies that took advantage of stealth and range, and found the game to be quite fun.\n\n5. Replayability: Another Souls feature, the infinite playability of the game (i.e. when you beat it the game just keeps on going) seems interesting and I'd like to see this dev take that somewhere even cooler in a future game or modification to this one. It seems as though loot that drops at higher levels rolls affixes and then sets its stats according to item level, meaning there will always be upgrades to find (even if its just rehash of gear found at lower levels). There are enough inventory slots to make sure that finding perfect gear for each slot (i.e. affixes you like and stat distributions that are effective) will take quite some time.\n\nWhat I don't like -\n\nI think I tried to put my little quibbles in with all of my positive points, but overall I will say there just needs to be more. The developer is quite possibly on to something in terms of a style of play which is addictive, accessible, could have depth, and borrows from games people genuinely enjoy in dungeon crawling (Zelda/Souls series). A lot of fans of the Souls games are currently looking for anything at all to sate that urge until Bloodborne comes out in a few months, and since it is a PS4 exclusive this market (PC) is ripe for the taking.\n\nIndie seems to be a viable option for exploitation of that gap in the market. All this to say MORE. Perhaps try to get some DLC features patched in or propose a game via Greenlight or Early Access when you're ready for a sequel?\n\nThanks for reading!","December 16, 2014","true","7.7"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

The game is the sequel to the game bit Dungeon[www.kongregate.com] which is free on Kongregate.\n\nStory-The game apparently has a storyline, something about finding a ghost girl, KintoGames said that "Your "loved one's " grave has been desecrated. Fight through these corrupted lands, and bring peace to her soul." Okay?\n\nHUD-When I opened up the game there was no tutorial at all, the options were rather limited and there was no way to rebind the controls which is slightly disappointing as some people might like to do that.\n\nGameplay-The game is very fast-paced and there are enemies almost everywhere. The combat is a mixture of clicking and holding down the space bar which performs stamina-consuming attacks and blocking. By just walking into enemies it will auto-attack but perform a less powerful attack. Most of the time you can never really make out what's happening on the screen. It's difficult to know exactly when you've been hit and sometimes it can be rather buggy.\n\nEvery playthrough the dungeons have the same rooms and only their location is changed when you start a new game but that doesn't really save it from the rather monotonous gameplay. Each boss just feels like walking up to it and tapping away, trying to get all the damage in before the next attack starts. Each screen is just filled with a bunch of randomly generated enemies and rarely is there something to break up the standard "walk over to next screen, auto-attack for two seconds, walk to next screen".\n\nPlayers are able to equip themselves with a wide variety of weapons with different stats. You can choose to play a ranged class with a bow or get up close and slash your way through with giant hammers, swords and knives. Leveling up and getting higher level weapons is fun, though after a while it seems to get a bit boring being able to hack your way through hoards of enemies without any struggle. Here we see again the problem of the repetitive gameplay.\n\nGraphics-Visually the game is rather appealing; it's very retro-style. The wide range of wacky monsters such as giant crabs, tiny crabs, invisible mercenaries, droopy block monster things and a wide variety of other ones look really nice.\n\nMusic-The music is decent, in update 2.2 new tracks have been added which is great because it does sound very satisfying.\n\nAchievements-The achievements are rather easy to get through as they are basically unlocked by getting further through the game. 100% achievers, do not be afraid to play this game, the achievement Fiend, Wolves, Rats has been fixed in update 2.2.\n\nTrading Cards-Trading cards have also been added! This is something that has been clearly wanted for sometime and was also added in update 2.2.\n\nSummary\nPros\nâ Finding different weapons is fun\nâ Different ways to play the game\nâ Visually appealing\nâ Music is satisfying\nâ Easy achievements for 100% achievers, broken achievement has been fixed\nâ Trading cards\n\nNeutral\nâ/âCombat is mediocre, not bad but not great either\n\nCons\nâ Storyline is basically non-existent\nâ No tutorial and minimal options\nâ Repetitive gameplay\n\nConclusion\nbit Dungeon II was definitely not a bad game, it just wasn't that great either. If you are interested in the game I would recommend playing the first one (bit Dungeon[www.kongregate.com]) as you might enjoy that one a bit more and it's free. If you're still desperate to play this one, catch it on sale and give it a go. It definitely won't appeal to everyone but it was still a decent experience overall.\n\n6.8/10\n\nLiked that review?

Because I couldn't really enjoy them like I hoped to.\nYou see there are no options to raise the volume, So the sound effects of your movement and attacking and everything, Is higher than the game's music so you barely hear it.\nAnd to make it worse it keeps fading in some places, And becomes muted for a while before starting again.\n\nI think its falsely advertised in the store-page.\nI quot "The dungeons are randomly placed in the overworld, changing your experience each play through."\nOverworld is the normal world you start in and the one that has the dungeons all over.\nBut like I said before, I finished the game 4 times and they are always at the same place.\nI also died once and restarted a new game and still, They are at the same exact place. ( Check the map in the guide section)\n\nThere is the matter of the last achievement, That is stopping me and all players from getting 100%.\nTurns out its actually broken, So there is no way for any of us to get 100% which is frustrating, And the game has been around for a while and still no response or update.... this is really disappointing.\n\nThere is also the matter of the (Online-Disabled) which appears in the option menu, Apparently they had (or have) plans for it, But its been like this ever since release, Hopefully I will update this and maybe remove it if they ever got through it.\n\nAlso it says (Steam Leaderboards ) But there is no way to view it in game, If you want to see it you gotta view it through the (View Stats) tab on steam.\nI'v been told its not added (yet) so there is hope for it to come one day, But the delaying is taking too long.\n\nAlthough the game has some real good looking bosses, I'm afraid they are not as tough as you'd expect them to be.\nYou can pretty much charge and attack them until they die, If your build is slightly weak you might get killed though.\n\n\n\nSo having all that said lets tackle the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros :\n1 - Amazing game design, Great soundtracks and wonderful world and dungeons.\n2 - A huge set of weapons and armors, Enemies to kill and bosses to fight.\n3 - Good replay-value, High-paced gaming and more stuff to discover.\n\nCons :\n1 - As mentioned before, Music is great but gets covered up by SFX and no option to edit volume.\n2 - Last achievement is broken and you cant get 100% because of it.\n3 - I wont complain about the game being short, But I will about it being too easy.\n4 - False advertising random placed dungeons, And leaderboards.\n\n\nDon't fear the Cons, Seriously they are not that big of a deal, The game is still good and such an amazing experience I had while playing this baby.\n\nTl;DR\nThe nostalgia value in this game is over the roof, Cheap game so you don't need to think twice before buying it, Really fun to play and to see how far can you go without dying.\nRecommended for rogue-like gamers and those old-school fans, 8/10","February 25, 2015","true","6.5"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","26","39","3","0"

Please add the remaining life count to the campfire rest thing.\n3. Sometimes, like for example with the eater boss you are stuck in a corner and not able to move out and die pitifully.\nsometimes also happens with normal monsters. probably only happens if you have a bow.\n4. maybe a bit bigger inventory, or just being able to switch between two weapons and stuff.\n5. also it would be cool if whatever dropped would stay a bit longer, for example if I mistakenly switched my weapon with an inferior one, didnt notice and then left the room, if I could just go back into the room and get the weapon would be cool. if I walk 2 rooms and then get back to the place where the weapon would have been its ok if it would be gone.\n6. I guess its a bit too short considering that its very fastpaced.\n7. bossfights ( every boss exept his wife? was that his wife? the lighsaber ghost at the altar^^) are very easy. Update: ok it depends on equipment - or so to say luck. still they are quite easy exept wizard\ntake a sword and keep on slashing and the bosses and they die.\n8. can we get hardmodes?\n\nVampiric shield of the Devil or whatever it was called was op :D well if it procs\nI still don't know how big the game really is but hopefully it will get even bigger.\nI think at the moment the game is not yet worth the 5 euro original price but it will definitely be worth it in no time.\nI still recommend this game because its really fun :)","December 15, 2014","true","5.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

The objective of the game is simple: beat each boss in every area's dungeon to unlock the portal to kill more demons and save your girl. I finished my first "playthrough" with a game controller in around 2 hours. When you beat the game, you get sent back to where you first started with all your progress intact and the difficulty increased. The entire map is always the same but the enemies that spawn change each time you enter a room. Once you memorize the entire map, you could probably do runs in under an hour or so. Truthfully, there isn't anything else to see once you've downed the last boss. It's not much of an ending either but it plays to tell how you start over. The game is absolutely designed to be played many times over to get the best loot while seeing how deep you can go.\n\nThe battle system comes from Zelda, where A is to slash or shoot your bow and holding it down either blocks or charges your weapon. Simply walking up to an enemy will make you attack. Take your pick: dagger, 1h sword, 1h spear, 1h hammer, 1h staff, 2h greatsword, 2h blade, 2h axe, bow, spellbook, or shield. You can dual wield any of the 1-hand weapons but my personal preference is my best 1-hander and a shield for stuns on demand. I tried bows but they consume too much stamina per attack while melee weapons can be spammed and kill a boss without having to rest.\n\nLuckily, I found an amazing set of gear that just destroys everything.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357370720\nAs I mentioned, I play this game with a controller and this is the best method to play the game IMO. You can also use just the mouse or just the keyboard and WASD all the way or a combination of both.\n\nThere's some cheapness to the enemies that have fast multi-hit attacks because getting hit stuns you for a brief moment. (Edit: this issue has been patched as of 12/19/2014) It's best to attack and kill first before mobs have a chance at attacking you. The AI is slow to lock on and slow to attack so take advantage of that.\n\nThose weapons come with random stats and that's where the Diablo inspiration shows. Each item can have up to a handful number of affixes with various effects like life steal, a death strike, phase (dodge an incoming attack and teleport away), berserk, and so on. I'm a big fan of crazy loot and the system satisfies for what you can do in this game. Quality of items I've found so far: white, blue, orange, purple, red, cyan, and green. There doesn't seem to be any set pieces. You'll often loot black stones along the way and you can use these to purchase equipment from merchants. Hidden rooms also often give good stuff stashed in a chest.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357370604\nThe developer mentions some love of Dark Souls and it shows. Resting at a campfire restores your health. Sometimes, upon waking, a powerful foe may appear and pronounce "I have found you..". A nice surprise and these fights are fun but you can easily escape to the next room and they'll despawn. It would have been great if they locked you in for a minute and drop loot too.\n\nIf you die, it's game over and you lose everything. There's only one save file so try your best to stay alive. Fortunately, black stones carry over across deaths. There is however a softcore touch to this in that if you have a blue heart (you start with it), you can respawn at the last campfire you used. And if you manage to get back to where you died, you can reclaim a blue heart.\n\nThere are some other negatives:\n-There is no explanation of what all the stats and effects do. You can figure what the primary stats do but some of the effects aren't too obvious (i.e. I think of cleave as a wide arcing attack but it's merely a damage multiplier).\n-black side borders with any aspect ratio over 4:3\n-non-customizable controls (the developer may patch this)\n-utterly short, moreso if you play till just the last boss (but remember, it's designed to be played continuously till you die)\n\n8.5/10 from me. It has the makings of a great action adventure RPG with cool loot but ends up being repetitive and gets there quickly right after the "ending". However, the chase for epic loot is fun and the developer is actively improving the game so you can look forward to this game only getting better!","December 16, 2014","true","24.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You will end up hating knight sprites after playing this.\n\nI got this game gifted to me by a friend of the developer, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the seemingly-simple gameplay.\n\nIf you like rogue-likes, minimal mechanics, dying a lot, and straight-up fast-paced violence, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the detail in the character sprites and background are decent. The music and sounds are an appropriate fit for the retro theme. Whenever you pick up new equipment, it will show on your character, which is something I always appreciate. The feedback on how much damage you are doing and taking is quick and not intrusive. You can bring up your stats on the left side of the screen at any time.\n\nThe controls are very simple to pick up, and the learning curve is moderate to challenging depending on your experience with rogue-likes. There is no tutorial - you are immediately thrown into the game, but you can press ESC and read the instructions. Something very important to realize (it took me too many playthroughs to realize this, making the game unnecessarily more difficult, heh): if you interact with the campfire in front of you, it will heal you to max health. NOTE: YOU DO NOT start off the game at full health. I kept dying because I thought half the HP gauge was what you were supposed to have. Also, interact with the ghost in the beginning of your run for an extra life. I believe there is a higher chance of finding a +1up to life if you go back to the area wherever you died.\n\nThe gameplay is nice and charming, I personally prefer to play with a controller, but the keyboard works just as well. You can just move your character up to enemies to auto-attack, however, you can hold the attack button down to block and charge your special ability (dependent on your weapon equipped). Enemies respawn whenever you enter a new area, however, once you clear an area a few times, significantly weaker enemies will respawn instead. There are at least 4 different biomes (map areas), and each contains a campfire/shop, and a dungeon. You will start your runs in a random campfire/shop area, and you can walk to each biome. There are also structures in each biome that offer permanent bonuses to your stats, however, you may only select one attribute to boost.\n\nDungeons are the meat of the game - each has a very, very challenging boss at the end. You can leave without killing the boss, and this is strongly advisable because the global enemies will boost in difficulty whenever you defeat a boss. Grinding is fairly quick in this game, and you should invest in doing this before tackling a boss.\n\nRandom drops are frequent, ranging in item type (armor, weapon, rune) and quality. Staves offer you ranged attacks, however, I have not picked up any other projectile-based weapons (like bow&arrows, crossbows), so I do not know if this is included in your potential armory.\n\nThe game auto-saves your progress if you quit the game, however, only one slot is allowed.\n\nOverall, a very fun, fast-paced game. Definitely give it a try if you are into the rogue-like genre.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","December 20, 2014","true","8.2"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","34","56","2","0"

But it works amazingly. Only against a specific boss did I find any problems with the tight, frantic controls, and that seemed to be because he was perhaps programmed incorrectly. If you've ever played a sub-par game with an isometric view, you understand what I mean when I say I couldn't get around the TOP of him.\n\nAlso, the music comes and goes as it feels like, meaning most of my adventure through bit Dungeon II was bathed in complete silence with occasional bouts of BGM sheepishly encroaching as if it realized it forgot to play, before petering out again for no discernible reason. This impacted the feel of the game somewhat negatively, especially one area that I THINK was intended to be eerily silent, as the music never piped up once. It would have been amazingly creepy if the music in the rest of the game had remembered to stick around.\n\nBut, as indicated by the fact that I DO recommend this game, I think it shines through its flaws and asks for a humble price for a delightful experience. An amazing game for the price.","December 15, 2014","true","5.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I was disappointed, but I wouldn't say the game is a complete failure. There're just too many better games around and I didn't feel it lived up to my expectations.\n\nI love hardcore roguelike games and dungeon crawlers. Sadly, this game is neither one of those things, or at least fails at being them. It's the easiest, simplest, one button mashing, casual grindfest I've played in some time. Even games like Clicker Heroes have more challenging and rewarding gameplay. I finished the game within the first 60 minutes and didn't have to use anything but WASD and hold BLOCK (the game actually auto-attacks enemies, so if you position yourself face-to-face with an enemy and hold block, you're invincible - even against bosses!) and without losing even half my health. The only time I died was when I wanted to unlock the last remaining achievement, which was for dying for the first time. To my surprise, when I tried to kill myself, I actually got revived a few rooms back with all my stuff and progression! Not very rougelike, is it?\n\nI simply can't figure out how to fail or even have a slightly hard time at this game, which is making it very unenjoyable and pointless to me. The only challenging part of the game was navigating through the map, which is very chaotic, unintuitive and sometimes seems random (meaning it's NOT randomly generated, like you'd expect, but sometimes you leave a room through the top door and enter the next room through another top door, instead of the bottom one, as would logic dictate). You can't even leave breadcrumbs on your way, because every time you clear a room and leave, all the enemies and objects in it immediately respawn.\n\nI might have given up on it too soon, but what other choice did I have after finishing the game twice and getting all achievements in 3 hours? Or maybe I'm just too spoiled by games that are actually thought-through and challenging. Either way, this game seemed very cheap, buggy, extremely easy and with very little replay value.\n\nBut since I got it for about half a dollar, I can't really complain that much. At least I got some trading cards and 100% achievements out of it!","April 20","false","6.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Game plays drastically different to the first and is genuinely kind of tough. The original spent a lot of time focusing on room clearing and got very repetative vert quickly. However, exploration seems to be the main focus on the sequel and will practically throw you in at the deep end navigation wise. It's reccomended that you spend a bit of time just wandering around getting some levels and see what helpful stat boosting pick-ups, weapons and whatever else may happen to drop down to sheer luck.\n\nFans of the original game though will feel right at home in the games many dungeons, which all seem to have a slight element of puzzle solving that much, though the real puzzles usually involve trying not to get lost. Boss fights can be tough but thankfully you could be able to snatch up an extra life if you're quick enough upon re-entry of the bosses room.\n\nSome great care has been put into the overall look of the game - personally I'm a fan of the Dark World and The Black Church areas - and there's a great bit of variety in the areas and enemies in which you'll stumble upon.\n\nReccommended if you're a fan of rogue-lites, but other plays may want to stay away, as it can be wuite unfair at times. If all else fails, find a bow. Bows will pretty much carry you through the entire game.

Bit Dungeon 2 isn't too complex, but feels fun and satisfying. Development is continuing at a good pace, so older issues are being fixed. $5 USD may be a bit (heh) too high but if you are interested, I'd recommend going into the game blind for a classic experience.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, and has many mysterious mechanics, despite the simple controls for combat. Exploring the world and learning the basics with no help was refreshing and enjoyable. Fortunately, the combat is easy enough early on that the game is rarely frustrating or punishing to beginners. As you progress, enemies can become real threats.\n\nThere are definitely some flaws in the game. Combat can become a bit bland, relying on button-mashing and waiting on Stamina for bosses. Dungeons are very similar, forcing too much backtracking unless you memorize the variations. Loot drops end up being similar, with only a few weapons that got me excited. (dual-wielding lifesteal spears) The game can be beaten fairly quickly once you learn the maps and ignore side caves. There is no procedural generation.\n\nOverall it's quite good as a mixture of Zelda and Diablo, focusing on core mechanics. The chunky combat feels great, and the atmosphere is interesting. I've enjoyed the game, and I'll continue to watch for updates. It's a great deal in a bundle, and not a bad purchase at full $5 USD price.","June 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is a rougelike zelda that doesn't seems has many "unique" things to offer like binding of isaac/our darker purpose, etc. but in my first hour it is quite fun until I found out that my extra lives can't be stacked (I think I received one from the soul near the spawn place and the second is after reaching lv 20 or 25 -- I don't really remember)  I think there should be minimap or a button for map to help player exploring the area. I found it quite frustrating to find the dungeon.\n\nMy first 2 minutes -- about 2x play because I didn't understand the button (I use controller) and I don't know if we should pick the weapon from the room inside tree. but this game is very fast pace and you'll get the point after few minutes. I think weapon system in this game doesn't provide you a lot of different combination, after 4-6 tries I think shield + small weapon is balanced. I wonder why there is no slot for potion, I meant it doesn't have to be complicated RPG-like item menu, something simple like binding of isaac's/our darker purpose item would make this game more interesting than a lot of tries and error.\n\nI'm not really into rougelike -- I'm rouge lite guy, permadeath is fine as long as their upgradeable thing, but that's my preference of genre. I'm Ok with rougelike as long as it's fun and not punishing. I thought people's rating for this game would be positive/very positive, but mostly positive is underrated.

Plus this isn't an Early Access game so there is no excuse for Achievements not to be 100% working and for their to be difficulty/scale problems. Also there is still nothing new per playthrough that makes you want to actually play it again.\n______________________________\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis game is one of my favourite genres.  Rogue-like Dungeon Crawler with random item spawns and random generated monsters with bosses. However, does it live up to my favourite Genre and do it justice? No. Let me elaborate.\n\nFirstly the game has major flaws and it seems like the developers have left the game for dead (It has a 10 page Bug Thread and 90% of the bugs haven't been fixed). But without further ado, here is why I think you shouldn't buy this game.\n\nPros:\nâ¦ Random Generated Monsters and Items\nâ¦ Level up system that works\nâ¦ Awesome system to tell where you have already explored (Say you've been in a room and killed everything and come back to that room, smaller enemies will appear to symbolize you've been there already, which is awesome)\nâ¦ Unique controls that just work (You can use mouse entirely or keyboard entirely or both which is great choice. I didn't try controller, so not sure how this works).\nâ¦ Achievements are easy (You can get almost all just by finishing the game)\nâ¦ Awesome Graphics and Sounds\nâ¦ Gameplay was fun for one playthrough\n\nCons:\nâ¦ Devs seem to have abandoned the game\nâ¦ No Storyline (There is a weak one, but there is no explanation as to why you are doing what you're doing)\nâ¦ Achievement "Fiends, Wolves, Rats" which is unlocked by killing a unit is broken (Has been broken since launch resulting in you being unable to get 100% of achievements, which sucks.)\nâ¦ All Achievements don't show up as locked on "Personal Achievements" page\nâ¦ No way to remap Controls (Controls are awesome as mentioned but some people may like the option)\nâ¦ No quit on main menu\nâ¦ No way to tell how the game saves (It seems to just save upon going back to main menu, which is okay but would be better to let us know that's what happens)\nâ¦ Version Number inconsistently says 1.96 in "Update/News" but in-game it says 1.95 (This is terrible as it doesn't tell us whether or not the 1.96 update is actually released)\nâ¦ Opting into Beta doesn't do anything (Why have a Beta option but not make it change or add anything to the game?)\nâ¦ No map/way of knowing when you've completed a biome (The map isn't really needed but it would be helpful to know when you've fully explored somewhere and or completed all dungeons and killed all bosses in that biome... but instead you're just walking around aimlessly not knowing)\nâ¦ No way to tell if a Biome or Dungeon is recommended for a certain Character Level (This is lame as it doesn't set any order for you to complete biomes/dungeons and you have to figure it out yourself)\nâ¦ Items seem based on luck and not on difficulty from what you've killed or from Character Level (All enemies even bosses seem to drop the same sort of items and level items no matter if you kill the first enemy you see to a boss, they'll roughly be the same which sucks as you'd think the harder the enemy the better the drop but that's not the case. Also I was level 35 and getting level 8-12 items dropping... go figure)\nâ¦ Enemies don't seem harder per play through (I finished the game once and there seemed no difference in difficulty)\nâ¦ Short (Took me 3hours to finish the game...)\nâ¦ Very Repetitive (They try and make you play the game over once you beat it and the number of playthroughs gets added to highscores etc... but each playthrough is identicle and doesn't seem to scale in difficulty based on playthrough or character level which sucks and makes anymore than one playthrough extremely boring and repetitive. Also there is nothing unique per playthrough except the enemies are spawned randomly again, however the bosses are the same which makes it even more repetitive and boring)\nâ¦ No Cards (Why? There is potential for cards but they are not included.. it would add to the game imo).\nâ¦ Only way to see Stats is via a Fire (This is lame as you have to find a fire to view them and there is Stat Booster caves around and you can't check your stats before choosing which to boost which is annoying to say the least)\nâ¦ Biome Path Puzzles are too easy (You are supposed to talk to someone to get the directions to take to beat the path, however you can easily do it by entering the path which isn't blocked by a rock or icicle etc depending on the biome which ruins the puzzle challenge)\n\nOverall, if you like rogue-like games then this will definitely give you one playthrough averaging roughly 3hours. However, the game is very repetitive, has no storyline, you can't get 100% of achievements, the version number is wrong and the Devs have seemingly abandoned it... therefore, I'd recommend you boycott this game as there are many many more rogue-like games that are still being updated, are not repetitive and actually allow you to 100% them.","May 2, 2015","false","6.1"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","3"

It felt like "run up to bad guys and flail simulator" where I'd either kill them or die (again).  By the time I'd get enough gear to survive my health would be so low I'd get one shotted... how do I even heal? What does the space bar skill even do? I felt and feel clueless. However I can see why people may enjoy it, just wasn't my cup of tea.\n\n**UPDATE** BitDungeonII was gnawing at me; before I knew it I was poking around in game again and got a better handle on the game mechanics and beat the game. Call me stubborn.\n\nWhat I said before still stands; however you do get to heal at camfires; purple scavenging dogs in dungoens have high potion drops and mashing spacebar lets you hew through enemies. All of this deserved to be explained IN GAME.  Each boss looked cool but I killed every. single. one. JUST by running head on into it and mashing space bar.  I dumped all my stat upgrades into Str and Constitution.  I dual wielded the best one hand weapons I found. The bosses were comically easy.  The ending is whatever, basically absent, as others have said.  The overworld is fairly lackluster and uninteresting. The dark world is the same just without a map. :p\n\nAnyway, for the price it's a neat distraction but you'd be better off playing other stuff.

There's nothing hard about completion. Zelda, which this game pays many an homage to, is in comparison precise and strategic in how you have to position your character and mind attack cooldown/rate of fire to fight. This game, just wing your character in the general direction of the enemies and he'll mow down a mob automatically, scoring crits and procs and cleaves and deathblows and whatever other enchantments are on the equipment you've picked up(loot drops as often as rupees do in Zelda).\n\nI completed the game without ever understanding the purple meter - obviously the red one is health because you die when it empties but the purple empties while fighting just to recharge immediately. The weapon ability seemed to be triggerable only when it was low or empty, the character was always flashing when it was full, which was most of the game. The game was really short on explanation.\n\nWhile most enemies die more or less by running into them, the bosses all require you run into them and hit them many times, and then they die. The second to last boss, I had to run into it and hit it many times, dodge a big beam of death, then run into it again and hit it many times, and then it died. The beam of death got me a few times. I also died a few times when I first played the game, until I realized "don't fight the knights". For the most part though, the combat in the game is completely nonsensical. It's like Zelda would be, if Link's dash boots ability killed everything he came into contact with, and he could turn while running, and didn't have to do the charge animation before he begins running.\nLike another reviewer said, the bow is OP - the reason is because a lot of the enemies in the game aren't really made to fight back against a ranged attacker. It's bringing a gun to a knife fight.\n\nDespite the simplicity of the combat I won't say it wasn't fun. Dashing around the map at lightning speed to the chiptune DnB soundtrack. The toughest part was memorizing the map and realizing where I've been already, that took a bit of brain, since so much of it looks the same. I had to look in the forum for a clue as to one of the "lost woods"-ish mazes because the NPC who told me how to do the maze didn't actually tell me how to do it. The way this game is paced I feel like there would be a second gameplay mode where the character insta-dies when a timer runs out, and the timer is replenished via mob slaying. That'd give some gravity to the somewhat simple, but somewhat spacious, mazes of the game.\n\nThe original bit dungeon was slightly more fun. If only because the very experience of the game was new, and this isn't too much different. The combat in that one felt a little more precise.\n\nAnyway, 4.5 out of 5, it's a busted concept of a game, burns itself out at the speed of a flash game(which the original was), but the time spent playing it is very fun. There's a lot of content in the game, it just wizzes by at the speed DnB chiptunes.","May 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a free flash game.  I bought this game the day it came out as I felt that this game would live up to my expectations, and it has.\n\nThe gameplay very clearly uses the same solid base as the original bit Dungeon, which was very solid. A lot of niche elements (such as the music fading out during combat in new areas) are still very present, and I would say that this sequel did not lose much of its original mechanics or quirks.\n\nThe primary type of controls you use to play the game is a loose combination of positioning your mouse to change the facing of your character, using WASD to move freely, and pressing/holding left click or spacebar to attack/block. This may sound incredibly simple, and it is, but the game does require you to think carefully and quickly to prevent a swift death. I almost feel like it was a bit lazy to have the game play nearly identically to the original, but I will say that the gameplay has yet to feel stale. The basic layout of the game is a semi-randomized overworld layout you run through to find the next dungeon. The game is less about exploration and more about dungeon clearing, which was the entierty of the original game.\n\nAs far as graphics  go, the game uses a fairly good quality and consistant pixelart style as many other games have chosen to do. I give this game special props for making all equiped weapons and armor fully visible on your character, which gives you a rolling appearance based on what gear you have. The music is generally the same as the orginial, and is fitting to the game itself very well. Rescaling the game in a window also works much better than I expected, and although there are basically zero video settings, I seriously doubt any modern computer would have trouble running the game.\n\nThe main problems I see with the game as of now is that there is no overworld or dungeon maps (which doesn't bother me at all), and the game actually feels a bit too easy sometimes. I expect some sort of 'hard' difficulty with higher scaling on enemies to be implemented at some point. Also, your offensive stats are autoleveled based on your equiped weapon, and although it really streamlines the game, I would rather be able to manually assign stats, so what I have in my hands at the time doesn't influence what my character would be better at using later.\n\nOverall, the addition of more status procs, weapon types, new movement mechanics, redoing the magic bar, and better hybridization has made me happy with this game. bit Dungeon is one of my all time favorite flash games and I expect to burn a good amount of time on this game as well, if it has even close to the amount of replay value of the first game.\n\nEDIT: Difficulty update fixed some problems with the game, the developer clearly cares about the status of the game. Buy this game.","December 16, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

That's all it took me to finish the entire game without even trying. This was absolutely boring and there's no replay value whatsoever. 2 hours and I got every single achievement and finished the whole dang game with a level 74 character.\n\nPROS:\n*good music\n*slightly puzzling map system\n*zelda-esque map navigation that gave nostalgia\n*Brilliant-looking bosses and items\n\ncons:\n*fighting is extremely stale\n(melee is the way to go. Simply grab a double-handed weapon and spam space bar next to an enemy)\n*Using any other type of weapon besides melee is suicide\n*It's far too easy to NOT die (I got the die achievement last by forcing my character to die)\n*The bosses are WAY too easy. Only one I had a relatively good fight with was the final boss and even he went down without going past half health.\n*Game is far too short and has no replay value whatsoever\n\nconclusion: While this game does have some solid, positive features and is good for a short time-killer, it has no replay value and is most definitely not worth 5 dollars. I recommend that you only but this game if it has an 80% discount or more. The controls are initially confusing, but once you get them down in the first few minutes of experiment-fighting, then the entire game is far too easy.\n\nMy recommendations -\n1) Harder bosses\n2) Better combat system - including better usage of bows and magic\n3) Make the storyline more immersive. It feels like the plot from a free flash game (some of which have better plots than this game, truthfully)","October 10, 2015","false","2.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There's a pseudo-tutorial when pressing escape (not that anything tells you about it) so you aren't left totally without any information. There's a minimap showing your surrounding, so the maze-like world isn't impossible to navigate.\n\nSo that's good. However, it is far from enough. The game is still incredibly obfuscated (not even the dedicated wiki know what the stats do!) and difficult to navigate, lacking a sense of direction, and basic features (like key-binding, which is a pain with non-standard keyboards).\n\nThere isn't much to the game either. There's been some effort to make the enemies different (with some being invisibile, while other parry or use beams) but in the end you handle all of them nearly the same: run into them until you kill them, parrying when you see them wind up for a hit (or just fill them with arrows). Bosses are probably supposed to be different, but I wouldn't know, they all died easily to the same tactic of circling them while spamming attack.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are OK if you're into pixel-art, the soundtrack is tolerable, and what little of the story we get is cute.\n\n\n\nSo if you really want a Zelda remake with random loot a-la Diablo, you should give this a try.

Attacking feels weak and lacks any real power unless it's a critical, so fighting things just seems like a bunch of numbers and sprite vibrations. It's also hard to tell when you've been hit, and since there's no real hit frames it's easy for enemies to trap and kill you quickly in a loop. You also get stuck on enemy sprites too sometimes, and sometimes the enemies or you don't register damage at all even though neither of you are blocking. Blocking also feels useless since half the time you can't tell what's going on anyway in combat. Too much is based on luck, like enemy placement and block usefulness and whether or not the combat wants to work proper and be clear anyways. Those skeletons spawning on cleared rooms are nice and unique at first, like the first game, but it gets annoying fast.\n\nThe HUD tells you very little. There's no tutorial, and most of the numbers and symbols are way too small and ambigous. You also move way too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fast and teleporting between screens is very disorienting. Because it's so easy to teleport between screens, you'll often get trapped and killed quick by those skeletons guys.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/recommended/331440/","djforekast","Forekast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djforekast/","76 products in account","A Short But Sweet Retro Rogue-Like Legend Of Zelda Inspired Gamebit Dungeon II is the sequel to the popular free to play game, bit Dungeon (duh!).  After the success of their first title, they decided to create another one with some improvements here and there.\n\nSummary\nThere's no intricate story, and this game doesn't need one.  It's simply drops you into the world and you begin your run.  The actual story is that your loved one has passed away and you want to meet with her again, so you clear the dungeons, etc.\n\nI fully recommend this game, not just for the initial play through, but because you can come back to it later and play through it again if you'd like.\n\nI'm going to break this review down into a few sections so it's easy to digest.\n\nGameplay\nUpon clicking "Start Game" you'll be dropped into the game world with no armor or weapons.  If you press the "ESC" button, it will pause and bring up a menu that explains the very simple controls.  I chose to play with a keyboard because I didn't feel like getting my game controller back out (laziness).\n\nAfter beginning, you're left to gather up weapons and armor, fight enemies to earn EXP and gain levels, and wander around the overworld clearing the 6 dungeons.  Because the game's difficulty and levels scale with your own level, you can tackle the dungeons in any order you'd like.  This leaves it up to the player to choose their strategy.  I really like that aspect about of the game.\n\nAt the end of each dungeon, you will fight a boss and upon winning - receive a chest with a powerful weapon (random).\n\nYou have 1 extra life, so if you die, you lose that life - but you can pick it back up in the same position that you died.  A tactic I highly suggest doing.  If you die twice, it's game over and you start back at level 1 and the game resets.\n\nUpon clearing the overworld, you enter the Dark World, and from there you clear another dungeon, fight some bosses and clear the game.  You can actually start back at the beginning and clear the game AGAIN with the items and levels you already gained.  Meaning you can grind and grind until you get totally sick of the game.\n\nNavigation\nThis is where bit Dungeon II shines a lot.  The overworld stays the same between play throughs, but the inside of each dungeon will be different.  There is, I believe, 7 different layouts, and 6 dungeons total (correct me if I'm wrong!).  So that means that you're going to have some variation each time you play.  Of course, you'll memorize these if you play through a few times, or die a few times, but it still keeps things fresh.\n\nThe actual dungeons are identical to the old Legend of Zelda games.  I mean, they have the same look and feel, and that makes this game super easy to pick up and progress through.\n\n\nProgress\nAs I mentioned before, you earn EXP and gain levels from fighting enemies and bosses.  The enemies and bosses own levels scale with yours, so that allows you to progress through the game in any order you'd like.\n\nThe weapons, armor, and accessories you pick up also scale with your levels, so you can keep getting stronger and stronger.\n\nEach item you pick up carries some stat boosts, so you can pick and choose which items have the best stat boosts for your current play through or "skill" set.\n\nAs for the weapons, there's one handed weapons, two handed weapons, ranged weapons, and magic weapons.  It's up to you which one you use.  All of them have their pros and cons.\n\nControls\nSince I played on the keyboard, it was just WASD and then mashing the spacebar A LOT.  Some people might not care for this, I didn't mind it.\n\nGraphics & Music\nI can honestly say the graphics are enjoyable for what it is - it's supposed to be a retro inspired game.  I love the graphics, but that's just me.\n\nThe music was enjoyable, different music for different areas.  The sound effects are the basic 8 bit sounds.  I love that about the game as well.\n\n\nAchievements\nThere's 15 achievements, and I would say the average full play through from start to finish, should unlock all of the achievements.  You get one for each boss fight, and then you get one for picking up certain items, and so on.\n\n\nConclusion\nI think I covered most of the aspects of the game.  I paid under a dollar for this while it was on sale and I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nIt took me a little over 3 hours to fully complete the game and all of the achievements, granted I died a few times before I got the hang of it.  But after seeing that I'm transported back to the start of the game with my newly acquired armor and weapons, along with my levels - I can see me coming back to this game.  Perhaps even speedrunning it at some point (yes people run this game).\n\nIn closing, do I recommend bit Dungeon II?  Absolutely!  You should grab it and play the crap out of it.  Just watch the video for the game and you'll see what it's all about.  If you're into these types of game, you're going to really enjoy this title.","February 13","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are primitive, but that's what makes it so good, the pixeled-ness of it makes it so much more fun, the weapon design looks nice, as well as the armour. The game is very fun to play, but it is WAYYYY too easy, once you get a good enough weapon, which often you can get in the second room, you can basically insta-kill EVERYTHING.","February 17","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very fast paced rogue-like game, where you have the ability to enhance your character's skills and find new weapons. You learn through trial and error, and exploration, meaning the more you play, the better you get (basically the rule for most games, if you haven't catched on by now). There are very few bugs in the game and even when you do come across them, you find yourself laughing. I absolutely love pixelated games, so the graphics greatly appeal to me. The music is catchy, but it can get on your nerves if your angry at the game. The temple remind me of a mix between Legend of Zelda and A Link Between Worlds (If you haven't played those games, then I highly recommend those too), which the creator openly says the game was inspired by. For any RPG/Rogue-like gamer, I highly recommend Bit Dungeon II. It is most definately worth the 4.99!\n","December 26, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, for starters, I really like the soundtrack. It's nothing special, it might remind you of the midis that play when you're using a software cracking tool (not that I've ever done that o_o). It is high energy, changes when you get into different types of combat, and just really enjoyable. The gameplay/controls are pants on head simple. If you have a gamepad, I recommend using it. Being able to sit back and just grind to lvl 110 while just spamming X is cathartic. I like the 8bit graphics, the game does get progressively harder, and I like the different boss fights.\n\nThe Good:\n+The game never ends. This game is ALL about replay value. Since, ya know, it infinite loops. Maybe there is an end, I don't know. I'm currently lvl 110 so after another few go arounds I'll find out.\n+Easy to pick up and get into. No fancy tutorial. No tedious, "watch the intro cut scenes or read long dossiers about key characters". Just spawn in, kill â¥â¥â¥â¥. Good stuff.\n+Level Design: It shouldn't take you too long to familiarize yourself with the levels and map layout. It doesn't change. So once you do one play through, you should be good to go for the second time around.\n+Music: I like it, itâs simple, nuff said.\n+Relaxing! I wish someone would put casual in the tag. It can be challenging, but itâs just relaxing to run around pwning monsters.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Crashes are terribad: I've only had one, but if you do crash, it will start you back at the very beginning. In my case, I was back at where I was when I booted the game up for that run. Lost 40 levels and 1hr worth of time.\n-Notttt that challenging: I don't know, I just kinda run up into bosses faces and endlessly hit them. It takes less than 10 seconds to down a boss. Just get a shield, a good main hand, stun and wail on them endlessly. If you have life steal, odds are they won't down you.\n+A Point? I do wish there was SOME story.

That's about what it is, or rather, what it really wants to be. The idea is sound but in execution it didn't really grip me. The overworld is always the same, and the dungeon layouts are only random in that there's 7 of them, and the only random is which dungeon has which layout. Weapons all work mostly identically, and stats boil down to 'more damage' 'less damage' 'dodge chance' even though there's 8 different version of them. When Cleave, Chop, Crit, and Smash are all just varying forms of 'dmg multiplier chance' then I'm not very driven to find more loot or better loot. Especially when there's no elemental damage types or resistances.\n\nEnemies are basically always the same thing: either a melee or a projectile. Bosses are all identical: Projectile, summon mobs, big AoE magic attack. Combat is bump combat, where you autoattack just by moving into an enemy. You can perform a swift attack by pressing the attack button, and block or charge a special move with the block key. Special moves depend on the weapon but swift attacks are all identical regardless of your weapon, which feels like wasted potential. I admit I didn't use a bow or a book. I assume those are different.\n\nAt the end of the day, the game doesn't feel very 'roguelike' since not much is random, it doesn't feel like dark souls because the enemy and boss variety is nonexistant, and there's no combat strategy other than 'mash swift attack, back off to refill stamina' (the souls/bonfire thing is a nice homage, though.), and the diablo part falls short because the loot isnt very interesting. You want your stat for your main weapon for damage, as much crit (pick a flavor it's all the same, but Crit is the best kind of flavor due to being highest dmg) as you can get and as much dodge or armor as you can get. Done.\n\nI CAN see where it shines: Speedruns. The game's setup lets you pla it very quickly if you have it memorized, though runs would fall prey to loot RNG. So I suppose thtas points there.\n\nI wish the game gripped me more because I could legit see it being fun, but it needs  a massive overhaul and more of mostly everything: skills, magic, weapon variety, enemy variety, actual randomness, an overworld map....\n\nI will softly recommend it because this isnt the sort of game I would actively dissuade people from, but would very selectively recommend.","June 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think a better healing system needs to be in place though to balance the fact its all too easy to get hit unfairly as lose health or even die when moving between areas- at the very least health potions need to be more common.\n\nThere are a lot of positive aspects that could be built upon for a sequel since I feel this game is going in the right direction, alot of good aspects are in place such as random items and events.   Another issue with most RL games and BD2 suffers from the same problem is that items are law, you find some of the best items/weapons in the game and you are almost guareented to finish the game, RNG goddess is unkind then you'll die alot.\n\nRogue-likes are really tough to judge and review honestly since they vary greatly in difficulty and what is consider fairplay mechanics.  I've played quite a few terrible rogue-likes that are more or less for masohist players, whilst this one is better than most, it still occasionally punishes the player severely, especially on bosses with some being overly powerful - like 2/3 hits your dead.  Rogue-likes and Rogue-Lites always walk the tightrope when it comes to balance vs fun, some have become big hits and others have failed miserably - this game is not a hit, but this game isn't  bad either however I wouldn't even recommend this game at the moment, however a few patches and upgrades could make a huge difference.\n\nI think this game would benefit from a reward system so as you play, you can unlock more rewards which will help you each time you die, such as starting with boosted stats, ability to keep item(s) or starting at a higher level without making the game 'too' easy.\n\n5.5/10","September 29, 2015","false","7.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/recommended/331440/","x2Madda","x2Madda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2Madda/","264 products in account","Its with a heavy heart that I don't recommend this game.\nIt just does too much wrong for me to say otherwise and that is a huge shame!\n\nLets get the negative out first, starting with; The game explains nothing.\nWhen you first play the game you can't attack. This will probably cause your first death. You might stumble across the nearby store or you might be like me and think that is a dungeon and not a store.\nEven if you avoid that mistake, it costs 8 black coins to buy a weapon. What is a black coin and how is it different from regular coin? never told!\n\nBlack coins are just the regular currency in the game and that is fine, honestly. Money gets called all sorts in games and its not a big deal then either, but for the longest time I thought maybe money came in other colors too but it doesn't as far as I can tell. Designer just wanted to be original I guess so moving on, or rather not moving on because I almost quit when i couldn't attack anything! Let me explain.\n\nYou need money to kill things but you only get money from killing things which you cannot do without a weapon. You do not start with one and the fact the local store sells some is meaningless to you because you have no money to buy them and you can't steal them either. So the obvious thing is to run around and try to find a weapon and/or money. This becomes a SERIOUS problem because the enemy can body block you. You have no invinc frames after a hit and you can and will get stuck and get a game over before the game has even begun! Walking to a new screen also confers no invinc frames or delay on enemy spawning so you can die in a room before the room has visually spawned on screen due to enemies hugging the doorway! Bad game design choice there.\n\nIt gets worse though because to swing your weapon you tap A. You hold A to raise your shield, if you have one and you also hold A to use your melee special attack. Do you see any overlap? So the game decides for you if you are raising your shield or taking a smack to the face.\n\nThe developer also added to the steam description "inspired by Dark Souls" and I am glad it was only inspired by it because it just can't pull of dark souls at all. Which is actually kind of a shame but  I bring it up now because I feel the games lack of explaining anything is because 'dark souls did it' failing to remember that dark souls actually points out a lot of stuff and tells you what stats do!\n\nWhich brings me to problem number four if you were counting, which is what do stats do?\nI experimented and found out that Dexterity increases crit rate as well as the damage of weapons that are marked xDex with similar stats boosting damage in similar ways but any auxillary effects outside of boosting damage for the other stats is just completely unknown. What is +10 berserk and is that good or bad? Should I replace my +5 Phase with it?  What even is Phase?\n\nWhich segways nicely to proble-- you know what why even count? The game has lots of problems  so here is a helpful tip for you, when you level up your stats go up. The weapon you have equipped when you level up, dictates what stats increase! This is very important information because if you used a sword for the first 20lvs of your career and then decide "I'm going to be a mage" you are not going to have the stats for a mage. You either need to die and start again from scratch to rebuild as a mage, or you are stuck with sword and board for the rest of the game. Not explaining this to the player is unforgivable to me because players are inquisitive by nature and are going to switch weapons around only to get very rudely shafted without even knowing.\n\nSpeaking of weapons...I mentioned before how you press A to swing your weapon? Or you can just nudge enemies by walking into them to auto attack. Is this Hyglide? Is that what we have become? I mean I partly don't mind it because when I enter a new room I can kill the enemies that hog doorways (and there are many!) but at the same time it takes me right out of the game when I can kill things without actually doing anything. I feel the game should choose a method of attack and stick with it, not have both. I would be fine with pressing A for my special attack and nudging for regular attack if they ever revisit the system.\n\nOverall I am sounding very negative about the game but here is the thing. The game is good after you get over the hump of getting a weapon and figuring it all out. Its no masterpiece but I can actually stand to play it rather than getting bored and moving onto another game. It also wears the original Zelda game on its sleeve like a huge blister that it wants to show to everyone so I hope you like burning the bush or getting lost in infinity mazes.\n\nI want to touch on the good aspects of the game but even the things I like, have a negative aspect to them. For example if you bring up your inventory then the music stops. I like the music and the game already has a pause button, so it feels odd and is very noticable. You also have no inventory bag so you have to decide there and then what to take with you because when you leave the screen all items are gone, I like this because my choices have impact and weight but if i kill a badguy the loot doesn't drop straight away.\nOften I leave rooms just as the loot is spawning because there is a delay before it even spawns the animation that shows loot dropping and if I go back to get, whatever it was that might have dropped, then its gone already.\n\nThe best way to sum up the game is that it feels like a game in early access/late beta. I could forgive the flaws-- I'm lying, I couldn't, but I could be hopeful that the flaws will be fixed one day. As it stands at present however, I feel like people need to read my review before playing the game, so that they know how to play the game. I even looked for a Bit Dungeon 2 wikia and I found one...Every page was empty! A sign that people are just not getting over that inital hump.\n\nDeveloper, if you read this, put the price of the game up. Get that coin and reinvest it into this game (or a sequel) and address these issues. The game world is beautiful and despite the ambitious nature of the game (dark souls + zelda 1) the game is its own beast, but as it stands right now, it needs TLC.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","November 21, 2015","false","5.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Fail to do so and it's game over and you have to start all over again from scratch. Loot drops of varied quality, varied monsters,dungeons,mini bosses,dungeon bosses an overworld & an underworld,runes,magic abilites,etc are present in the game.\n\nYour character is tied to your weapons/armor you use so there are no character classes.Want to use a bow,axe,katana,broad sword,short sword,dagger,holy books,shield,etc ? you can. Just pick up the weapon and you can use the abilities they have.Each of the weapons come with a stat that when you lvl are you get lvl'd as you leveled up.\n\nThe controls are like Ys I + II where you run into your enemy to attack.Blocking, ranged attacks, and charged attacks can be done withouth running into a mob though.There is no ingame map but the community hub has 2 great maps you can use (and most likely will) until you get your lay of the land. The world  layout is akin to zelda 1 (if you ever played it) so you will feel a similar air,even some of the mobs are.\n\nDespite having to get used to the controls and the lack of the ingame map,this game is a nice casual gem if you want some overworld/underworld dungeoning fun with a rogue-like-lite touch.\n\nA fun game for a rogue-like-lite that can be fun.

Which way would you take a game that is trying to mash together so many greats? What do you strip away? What can you enhance about the experience? Bit Dungeon II seems a bit of a strange amalgamation, including the button-mashing frenetic-ism of Diablo, overworld and dungeons with puzzles reminiscent of Zelda, and dropping your soul when you dieâ¦ Leading to permadeath if you donât find your way back to it. Some things seem to have hit home, while others leave me questioning. Without further adieu, lets look closer at Bit Dungeon II.\n\nFirstly, I love the retro aesthetic and top-down view. The music is enjoyable, although seems to have a hard time looping since there is a rather long fade in/out for each song. The armor upgrades show on your character, which is always a positive thing when youâre grinding gear. There isnât a massive selection of armor, but having every piece show on your character is a great feeling. Especially because when you first start youâre completely naked, with nothing but a ghost-wife. You will be given a staff, shield, and a few melee weapons to choose from. The weapon animations basically consist of the weapon flipping sideways for a couple frames, and could use a lot of workâ¦ Jabbing with spear, slashing with knife, etc., although I do appreciate any attempt at all. The magic animations are much better, but still not extremely flashy.\n\nI enjoy the scope of a lot of things in the game, huge statues and bosses that make you feel like a boss yourself when you bring them to their knees. The puzzles in this game arenât really difficult, but I feel like this is somewhat made up for with the frantic fighting. I would like to see things a bit more skill-basedâ¦ Because while there are spells and skills to use, most challenges can simply be overcome with some mashing of the A button. The character feels pretty overpowered past level 10, which is fun at firstâ¦ But walking into a room and dispatching every enemy in the same way (A,A,A,A) doesnât really make for an epic adventure, no matter how much I love scraping stats.\n\nI want to like this gameâ¦ I really do. But LoZ, Diablo, and Dark Souls sets too big a precedent for this simple little button-masher to overcome. There are fantastic choices in the game, I love collecting gear to put on a fashion show, I love dropping my soul and getting smashed on the way back, and having to start all over. The bosses are good, the music is great, but the random generation of the overworld map with no actual readable map to lead the way makes me want to gouge my own eyes out. I also feel like more time shouldâve been spent on the combat side of things, and the puzzle side of things. The combat will wreck you as a level 1 melee, but with a few levels and a few items you will absolutely fly through the game. And the puzzles, wellâ¦ Theyâre just plain easy. Such high hopes for this game, and they all seem to have fallen a bit short. Itâs got some nice ideas, quite a bit of fun to offer, and is quite probably worth the low asking priceâ¦ Especially if youâre really into pressing A.\n\nSummary: A top-down button-masher adventure full of dungeons, loot, and bosses.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10 for aesthetic design and respawn mechanics. 8/10 with improved combat/puzzles.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATq6GvMyPHs\n\nFull Text/Photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-bit-dungeon-ii/","December 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

There's some great homage to Legend of Zelda (LttP specifically) with the visuals and some of the dungeon design, I guess, but that's about as far as it goes. The music isn't anything too special and while it's visually pleasing at first, there's not enough variety for it to stay interesting (there are multiple areas and dungeons with different themes, but they're essentially palette swaps.\n\nAll of that could be forgiven if the game were fun to play, and it is...for about 15 minutes. One button to attack, block, and cast spells/special abilities (from weapons/items). At a certain point, I stopped caring about what the different enemies in a dungeon actually could do and just ran into them over and over (occasionally holding down attack to block). Rinse and repeat; that's really all there is to it. The first boss was difficult at first, but every boss after him was stupid easy after the item upgrade from boss number one.There's also the huge issue of having no sort of map *at all* in a game with procedural generation.\n\nLove the concept, but incredibly boring.","December 15, 2014","false","1.5"," 29 of 57 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","29","57","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/recommended/331440/","BringTheNoiseGaming","C3LT1C W4RCRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringTheNoiseGaming/","63 products in account","With the latest explosion of independent game developers, the gaming industry has also seen a rise in retro-style graphics. Not only have "retro" games become a rather popular choice among gamers and developers alike, but the rogue-like genre has also seen a surge in popularity. That said, it's these factors that make "Bit Dungeon II" by Kinto Games an absolute no-brainer for entertainment when it comes to blending the retro feel with the "hardcore" feature of rogue-like games.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you are familiar with the NES days of old, the overall feel of the game, right from the get-go, is "Legend of Zelda." It follows the same formula with the player moving across the landscape with shifting blocks that resemble the different areas of the world map. In each of these areas, just like LoZ, there are enemies that constantly respawn upon re-entering them. Much like its predecessor, Bit Dungeon II also follows the "lacking storyline" approach as it gives no real indication as to what the player's purpose is, but that's what really makes this game so great. It draws upon this nostalgic feel, this idea that the player's imagination needs to kick in and fill in the holes, which in turn makes the experience simple but immersive.\n\nNow on to the real meat and potatoes of BD2. As the name implies "Bit Dungeon II" is a dungeon crawler. The setup, much like most of the other features, is in the likeness of "Legend of Zelda." The player needs to explore the various dungeons that dot the large world map, and in turn, seal them There are plenty of tricks and turns that will completely throw our nameless protagonist off course. Ultimately though, the player will have to solve puzzles and navigate through a maze of rooms in order to find the black "boss" key. Once found, it's time to take on the boss of that particular dungeon and conquer it, moving the player one step closer to sweet victory of beating the game.\n\nNow, this all sounds fun and somewhat like a rip-off of LoZ in the fullest, but its about to get so much better. Not only does the player have to seal each and every dungeon to beat the game, but they only get one shot to do so. Well... two, perhaps. Essentially the player gets two lives, one given at the start of the game, and one extra life to try and retrieve the bonus life given to them. If at any point the player loses both lives (dies twice), our hero is forced to restart completely over, losing all gear that was found along the way as well as any bonus stats that might have been accrued.\n\nOn that note, the true depth of BD2 comes from the RPG elements that are incorporated. Ultimately, the player is on the biggest grind of grinds just to find bigger, better, badder gear. There is a plethora of options to choose from and this gives the player the ultimate freedom to create any type of champion that their imagination can muster. From the typical critical-striking assassin to the fire-spell slinging, shield-packing, axe-wielding nightmare of a heavily armed pyro-knight... the possibilities are limitless. Each item that is "dropped" gives stats to the player and each stat governs a particular trait. Again... there is no tutorial on this, so let the imagination run wild!\n\nThis is the part where the cons come out, but honestly... aside from the slight and rare bug, here and there, BD2 absolutely delivers. Its replay value is through the roof, and although it can get somewhat frustrating at times, the very "risk/reward" model that BD2 offers is exceptionally gratifying. When it comes to dungeon crawlers/RPG/Rogue-like games, Bit Dungeon II definitely takes the cake and is guaranteed to leave you satisfied.\n\nFor more information on Bit.Dungeon II, or to buy the game for yourself, please visit:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/331440/\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to check out my other content!\n\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wBb1EsrvF6mEPTWD1d0qA\n\nBlog: http://btngaminggamereviews.blogspot.com/\n\nTumblr: http://bringthenoisegaming.tumblr.com/\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @BTN_Gaming","October 25, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unyinz/recommended/331440/","unyinz","Chebs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unyinz/","187 products in account","A decent game with too many faults that I can't overlook.\n\nThis game follows in the vein of Zelda and Dark Souls (as stated by the developers,) with an added rogue-like element. Unlike most rogue-likes, you're actually allowed to die once before your character is erased, but that probably wont help much. While I enjoyed the exploration, the rogue-like aspects are what kill this game for me.\n\nI have played other rogue-likes and am familiar with how they typically work. However, this game is not polished enough for rogue-like mechanics to provide any sort of benefit. Expect to walk in to a room only to die before the screen has even fully scrolled, and suddenly have to start over. The randomized aspects are cool at first, yet they devestate the balance of the game. I have gone through 5 dungeons being able to tank entire rooms of enemies, only to get oneshotted by a random enemy in the 6th dungeon I visited. The randomized equipment drops also tend to be either very good or very bad, with items in between being rare. This means that one playthrough you'll seriously struggle, and then next you'll be able to two-shot bosses (like I was when the "Evil Sword of the God" dropped on my first playthrough.)\n\nOverall, the rogue-like elements feel like they were tacked on near the end to make up for a lack of creativity. I realize that this is not the case, seeing as this is a sequel and all, but it definitely feels that ways. Despite their being at least a few dozen different enemies, they all boil down to pretty much either melee or ranged. I found any reaon to change my tactics, despite the large enemy variety. The randomization of the dungeons also makes them feel meaningless, as they're all just generic rooms after generic rooms. In fact, I think several of the textrues were stolen straight from Link to the Past, such as the stairs that show up in some dungeons.\n\nThis game would benefit a lot from either ditching the rogue-like elements and creating a full-on action/adventure game, or by refining the mechanics to where the rogue-like elements actually add to the gameplay, rather than annoying the player after a sporadic death.","December 24, 2014","false","12.2"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

While there is a varity of different weapons for you to work with, having a bow just turned the game into easy mode, just stand back and mash the attack as fast as possible, and every enemy, including bosses, would just melt away. Even on new game+ while still using the wimpy level 5 bow (granted with much higher stats and armor) I could simply breeze through the entire world leading up to the final boss in under 30min\n\nThe other big issue with the game is bugs, and there were a few of them. I understand the game is made by one guy, and that he's constantly working on fixing the problems, but that still has a negative impact on the overall experience. They ranged from getting stuck in walls in the overworld to the controls randomly becoming backwards (unless that was somthing intended from an enemy attack). Two of the worst occured when i found one of the hidden areas, and when i tried to leave, my character would phase through the wall, float around in the backround, and then get placed back in the secret room; This caused me too have to restart from the beggining. The other major one, and more annoying one, was when entering a room, or rarely just during combat, my character would clip into an enemy, and be unable to use his weapon, block, or even move. The only fix for this was if the enemy decided to move far enough away from you that control would be returned, or after i was killed by the enemy.\n\nAll in all I definatly reccomend the game at it's price point, but there were jsut a few things that i feel could be fixed to make the game better","January 4, 2015","true","8.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You play as a warrior who is out to kill evil demons in this top down Zelda like world.  Your goal is to rid the world of these demon like bosses in dungeons scattered around.  As you beat up enemies, loot will be dropped and you'll have to make a choice on whether to take it or not because as soon as you move off screen the loot is gone forever.  The loot ranges from weapons, shields, armor, and amulets to help you in your quest.  You also pick up coins which can then be traded to merchants for weapons, armor, or a chance to get a rare weapon.  You carry around a ghost girl who gives you an extra life and each time you die, you get one chance to get back to the place you died at and retrieve the extra life.  If you die before you get that extra life back, you're back to square one and all progress is lost.  That's where the rogue-like comes in.  The enemies can be brutal and if you're not careful you could find yourself sandwiched between knights and instant death.  That is one thing that needs to be fixed is enemy placement.  Sometimes while in a dungeon, you may enter a room and instantly be surrounded by enemies that hit for huge damage.  At that point, it's just instant death and really unfair.  Enemies should be spawned a little distant away so the player at least has a chance to react.  Also, if the Bow and Arrow seems very overpowered in the game.  Most enemies in the game need to touch you to damage you.  As long as you move around and shoot arrows you'll hardly take damage.  The game is a little glitchy and unpolished in some areas.  For instance, trying to move up towards a jump off ledge causes your character to spaz out and the jump animation to play.  I'm also not a fan of the music restarting everytime I pause the game.\n\nOverall, the game is fun to play and definitely worth the price.","January 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Artistic direction is consistent and gorgeous, with beautifully illustrated environments and visually unique bosses and enemies. Unfortunately the music does little to add to the haunting visuals, so the sense of ambiance is lost fairly quickly.\n\nDespite having several types of weaponry and various stats and effects, each playstyle archetype essentially boils down to button mashing. Combined with the completely random loot generation which seems to provide both the most basic and the most overpowered equipment with equal fervor, the player will most likely find themselves effortlessly steamrolling over even the more powerful bosses. Of course, some bosses will also utterly destroy the player, and the enemy difficulty scaling and tiny level screens mean that neither of these problems can be fixed through any player-implemented strategy.\n\nFor a gamer who loves effortless grinding for loot drops which are few and far between, this game might serve as a suitable form of "click to win" relaxation. There are also a few mechanics for which the developers can be commended. Still, the content does not justify the price of what is essentially an empty shell of a game.","May 26, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Not as in depth as NetHack, but more in depth than some of the other rogue-likes. The art style is neat. I actually found myself getting excited over finding new helmets. My personal favorite helmet being the antlered hood.\n\nMy only two gripes with the game are the relatively small inventory and the controls. I'd have really enjoyed it if I could have had a second weapon set. You can dual wield, so that is a plus. It'd just be nice to be able to carry melee weapons and switch to a staff or bow. The controls aren't all that much of a hinderance once you're used to them. On a keyboard, the block/parry and weapon charge buttons are both set to space. It works out pretty well in some cases, but in others you're trying to charge up for a special attack and you just sort of stand there in block/parry stance. Also, you seem to have to exit the game via task manager in full screen mode.\n\nI recommend the game, as it's fun and I like the art. It has a few things that could be done better, but they're not too much of a distraction once you're used to it.

Beat a set of dungeons and fight a final boss.  Dungeons are just small loops, switch 'puzzles' (more just like door triggers really) and enemies.\n\nI've played about 1.5hrs and beat three dungeons, but the game has LoZ1-forest style mazes and an NPC who tells me the solution to a maze must have generated wrong because the solution doesn't work.  It seems there is a patch planned for an overworld map (which doesn't currently exist so prepare to get lost), so maybe some new content to improve the play experience is planned.  I don't really have too much motivation to play more because the gameplay just isn't that deep and I prefer multiplayer games for timewasting as the experience is at least more dynamic.  Nothing really wrong with the game, I just don't recommend the game because there are probably better games for you to spend your time on.","August 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","5"

Do you like to fill up bars and find items with bigger numbers? Then bit Dungeon II is for you!\n\nSeriously it looks like Zelda but attacking consists of walking up to an enemy and either auto attacking or hitting the button that might let you attack if you are close enough. Unless you have a bow, then you can actually shoot.\n\nAnyway, explore the overworld, find a dungeon. It's like a Zelda dungeon without any puzzles because it's procedurally generated. Mostly it consists of killing enemies to open the doors. Stepping on a switch or 2, and getting keys. Then when you beat the boss (by walking into him until he dies) you get to grind a few levels as everything gets harder (as all the dungeons can be attempted in any order). Seriously though every single boss I beat by running into them and spamming the attack button until it died.\n\nIt's got great pixel art, but the gameplay is lacking.

Here's a quick recount of my experience (no "spoilers", though it's not as if there's anything to spoil in this game; while I'm sure it was a labor of love for the developer, it's a shallow, simple, and in my edge case, ultimately disappointing game)\n\ngame does nothing to explain itself, slowly figuring things out as you do while wandering...\nin my first dungeon, didn't really understand what I was doing yet (had just started playing)\nmust've found a white key (needed to progress within the dungeon) at some point, but left before "completing" the dungeon (retaining white key)\ncompleted the next dungeon normally (where I probably never found its white key, but instead used white key from previous dungeon; all dungeons have a "progress gate" door, opened with a white key, which you generally need to get through to find the black key to open the boss door)\ncontinue wandering, exploring, figuring things out\nat some point, found a portal; noticed eye symbols on the portal closing as I complete other dungeons\nunderstanding progression, knowing I need to find/complete all dungeons to enter portal\nfast-forward, completing all other dungeons...\ndied immediately after killing boss in my "final" dungeon (stray projectile; we killed each other)\nreturn to dungeon entrance, but it is crumbled; soul heart is in there (only way to rez if you die, and an item you need after entering portal for optional boss fight/achievement), never got the boss loot either...\nwandering aimlessly now; portal has one eye still open, know I'm missing something\nnot really enjoying myself, but figure I can at least knock out some achievements; maybe 100% it\nwander around, eventually find the first dungeon that I hadn't completed\ngo in, wander around for a while, can't find a white key to open the locked door\nfinally remember what had happened earlier\nwander around more, trying to figure out how to get a key\nrevisit old dungeon entrances and realize all dungeon entrances are crumbled; cannot enter any of them except the "first" dungeon, but its white key is long gone; cannot progress\nsummary/tldr: lost my soul heart with no way to reclaim it, and no way to get a white key to complete final (first) dungeon since I must've used a white key from one dungeon inside another dungeon without realizing it\ncannot advance, really too powerful to even die at this point; literally stuck due to poor game design\nliving hell, annoyed, wish I hadn't played this trite, skilless game\nfart/10","October 9, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So we're just gonna say no. But keep in mind I had a good amount of fun with this game for the roughly 2 hours I played.\n\nFirst off, lemme get this out of the way, I can't get past the frozen maze. I dunno if my copy/version is just buggy or something, I'm going to uninstall and redownload and update this review. But, I follow the directions the dude in the cave tells me to exit the maze (ala, original Zelda), it won't let me progress. I simply keep repeating the maze never moving forward. I've restarted multiple times and there was no fix.\n\nOn the topic of replayability, once again I don't know if its an issue only effecting me, but the map just doesn't change at all. When I go into a rogue like game, I expect a big difference in the game on new playthroughs. I was expecting something closer to Binding of Isaac, but instead the only difference was (Possibly) slightly different dungeons, different item drops, etc etc. If you know where the caves are on the overworld, you're free to casually stroll and pick up all of your stat buffs before even walking into your first dungeon.\n\nNot that you need to. Grab a bow or an axe, and you're going to rip right through the game like a hot knife through butter. I originally started off using a staff, and enjoyed the challenge of the game for a while... That is, until I walked into a dungeon room with very unfortunately placed enemies who immediately gangbanged me without a chance for me to fight. My next character had an axe, and every enemy died near instantly, including bosses. Just spam the quick attack and they get wrecked.\n\nThe enemies were incredibly similar in tactics. Waddle towards you, maybe shoot an arrow or magic attack. Charge them and they die, it doesn't make a difference. The bosses suffered the same fate. They looked different, but there were no differences in strategies for killing them.\n\nThe game was fun enough. But because I couldn't progress it's flaws became apparent super quick. It's not balanced, with some weapons providing an incredibly easy runs or a horribly unfair experience. It became stale quickly, wandering the exact same overworld moving down slow moving and easy enemies became boring fairly quickly.\n\nWould I pay 5 dollars again? Nope. If it had multiplayer? Still probably no, which is a rare thing for me considering I absolutely LOVE co-op games. I'd rather spend a few extra bucks for increase replayability, such as Binding of Isaac.","December 15, 2014","false","2.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

If it had unlocks, a stat system or let you keep something when you died then i would have no problem with this game and probably invest more time into it but since there is no reward or goals i can't recommend this game which is a shame because i really like it and it has massive potential.\n\nEDIT: I have found out that there is in fact a leaderboards which can be located within the achievement page but for what ever reason it doesn't always seem to register my score and the fact it's not in game means it's easily over looked.\n\nAlso having played the game more now i can tell you that this game is not a roguelike as it sells itself on being; it is infact a roguelite. The over world is not randomised how ever your spawning point is and so are the dungeons (I think) so if anything i would class this game as a 'hardcore ARPG' rather than a rogue game.","December 19, 2014","false","14.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

The game looks like Zelda but it doesn't feel like Zelda. It was fun for 2 hours but i think i wouldn't recommend it, i will try to list some of the stuff that was annoying:\n\n\nControls:\nWhen i first started playing the game i got killed on the second screen, i tried again, i died on the second screen again. I stopped playing and went to the forums and tried to figure out the controls. It is weird to use one button for blocking, attacking, picking up items, interacting with NPC and pretty much everything else you can do in the game.\nAfter figuring out the controls, they kinda worked. Kinda? Well you hold down the A-Button (on the xbox gamepad) most of the time because that is the way you block in the game. After you block the enemys attack you release the A-Button and press it again to attack yourself, if an enemy dropped an item however you often pick the new item up by accident, if it is a weapon it will often result in taking damage. The game would probably be a lot better if blocking, attacking and picking up items would use different buttons.\n\n\nDifficulty:\nWell after figuring out the controls, i managed to kill 3 Bosses in my first "real" try and i died on the 4th one. Most normal enemies are a one-shot and the variety isn't too big either. You enter a new screen while holding down the A-Button run in the middle of the screen and oneshot most of the enemies, and you repeat that about 10-50x until you can fight a Boss. The Bosses aren't much different than normal enemies, they have a lot more hp, do a lot more damage and shoot more projectiles than normal enemies but they don't seem to require much strategy other than the usual block and counter-attack.\n\n\nItems/Stats etc,;\nWell i got a ton of different items, they have levels and qualitys and stats but if you have 2 items it isn't easy to figure out which one is better. For example weapons have a damage stat, an attribute bonus, they have different move sets and some weapons can be dual-wielded while others can't.\nIt is confusing but it didn't seem to matter much since i was one-shotting most enemies anyways. Also annoying that weapons despawn rather quickly and it is impossible to enter secret areas twice as a result i lost a couple of items that i wanted to use. Also i have to mention bows, it seems that you cannot block with bows and sometimes enemies spawn right on top of you and some enemies can perma-stun you if you can't block, it seems that bows are not viable as a result of that.\n\n\nMap?\nThe game has no map, some of the screens look very similiar, i'm pretty sure that i spent a lot longer in some areas than necessary because i got lost.\n\nBugs\nI died and killed a Boss at the same time, if you kill a Boss the dungeon entrance disappears and i couldn't get my sould back. As a result i had to play the game on 1-life only after that point. I still managed to kill 2 more Bosses after that until i finally died to the 4th Boss.\n\nThat should cover most of my thought abouts the game.","January 5, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/331440/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3252 products in account","Bit Dungeon II is an action rpg rogue-like and hell lets also throw in there souls-like. Yes souls-like is a thing now. That means it is LIKE Dark Souls / Demon Souls.  The game is developed by KintoGames aka a fella who likes to call himself Alien.\n\nRecently we did a developer interview on one of our affiliate partner channels (twitch.tv/indie). Alien is a huge troll. Thus we had a great time. It makes total sense that he would make a game like this as these games often TROLL the player.  The video is currently being edited and will be up on site before long.\n\nThe first few things we noticed about the game was two very important things. Mobs respawn when you change screens, and you can full heal at the campfires you find.  You explore what seems like an open world that is partial randomly generated.  By that the overworld is the same. However the dungeons are randomly placed through out it.\n\nLoot is random as well. It almost gives a feel of the classic arpgs such as Diablo or Titanâs Quest.  The art style of the game is pixel art and is ultimately what drove us to the game to begin with. Very  nice art style and very well done . The screen transitions and game play itself is very reminiscent of playing the older Zelda games.\n\nEach weapon style has hits main attack and then a secondary special ability. Some weapons can be dual-wielded and some are two handed. You can find caves which grant upgrades to stats so be careful what you choose. As you kill you gain what appears to be soul orbs. You can use soul orbs as currency at certain points of the game should you find them to purchase more stats or rare equipment.\n\nEach dungeon has a gigantic boss to defeat and the bosses are pretty unique and fairly difficult. However a ton of fun. The most important part of the game that stands out isâ¦ One soul. You die once, and have a chance to retrieve your soul. Should you fall againâ¦ Perma death. GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER!\n\nThe games soundtrack is fairly decent but I found it to get fairly annoying if I played in very long sessions. Still the soundtrack fits the game very well and that happens few and far between in gaming these days.\n\nThe game is single player but I would love to see them add online mp or coop at some point.  It also has leader boards and steam achievements and here is to hoping for some steam trading cards. In all this game is a lot of fun and for the price of 4.99 it is a must buy.  We also want to point out that it is playable on Windows and MAC.\n\nI had a ton of fun playing the game. Even more so during our chat with Alien. It was very amuzing. There were so many times I was fighting a boss and glanced down for just a second to read chat and ended up dead! YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥S! It takes a lot for a developer to make a game that is meant to kill you but keeps people playing it. This game does that!\n\nhttp://www.thedrastikmeasure.com","February 13, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Like everyone is saying, you walk into the opponent to auto attack and you can do more damage by pressing RMB or A on the controller.  You basically just spam it until your stamina is depleted.  Killing bosses consists of literally standing in place and doing this over and over with very little moving out of the way of projectiles.\n\nA few things I found annoying:\n\n-When you enter a new room in a dungeon, you are facing the door and not the room, leaving you open to attack.\n-The same button is used for pretty much everything on the controller.  A blocks, uses a special attack, and basic attack and picks up items.  So, many times you will be spamming attack and accidentally pick up a new item and equip it when you didn't know what it was.\n\nThere is a map that was added and for good reason.  BD2 desperately needs this as running around after you've cleared a few dungeons gets tedious.  You are supposed to beat all the dungeons on two lives.  So it's sort of a rogue-lite if anything.  The developer pretty much took inspiration from Dark Souls as when you die, you have one chance to retrieve your soul. If you die again, game officially over and you lose all the levels and gear you've accumulated.\n\nThe major draw for me initially was the way the gear looks even in pixelated form.  You can actually make your pixel avatar look pretty badass.  Things like capes will show up on your toon after you equip them.  Epic weapons look pretty unique too.  You will pretty much always want to equip 2 handers as they do the most damage.  1 handed epic weapons usually only drop after killing a boss, but they're supposed to be random so that may've just been my terrible luck.\n\nFor a 5 dollar game...BD2 is worth it.  It's a good lunch break game to just whip out if you're at home and play for 20 minutes.  Other than that, it get's extremely boring as most playthroughs look the exact same.

I like the "japanese bits" - and I pretty much hate the Diablo-stuff.\n\nThe game has a weird control approach allowing you to directly move/evade but a sort of semi-automatic combat that rubs me the wrong way. I imagined this would be a real hack'n'slay, but instead you attack automatically and can "quick attack" by tapping the button. Hold it too long and you will block, hold it even longer and you will charge a special. It is all somewhat confusing and honestly doesn't play all that great because, thanks to the Zelda-visuals, you barely have any animations going on - making it kinda hard to tell what is happening and how far whatever that is actually reaches. Resulting in a lack of control. I would say it feels almost like somebody broke the bump-system from the first Ys games and mixed that with Zelda-movement.\n\nGameplay consists pretty much entirely of grinding stats and finding loot - everything else is as barebones as it can be; this includes story/characters as well as dungeon layouts and attack patterns. Loot happens to not adjust to your level - so enjoy finding that level 6 rubbish when you are almost level 40. Enemies on the other hand do scale, eventually negating any sense of progress and development as all that is ever changing are the amounts of damage you inflict on enemies but your character doesn't really feel all that powerful (in fact, after the level 15 threshold he actually starts feeling weaker instead as everything takes much longer to kill). It's got perma-death, too - but you are allowed at least one mistake (more if you retrieve your "heart").\n\nOverall, I don't like the direction this game got going on - less random crap, more arcade-ish / direct combat and actual "handcrafted" challenges / more classic Zelda-gameplay would have to be in bit Dungeon III to get me interested. As it stands, bit Dungeon II doesn't offer much that I find engaging - which is a shame cause the visuals are decent and the music is pretty good too.","December 19, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obstinate_arrow/recommended/331440/","obstinate_arrow","Obstinate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obstinate_arrow/","261 products in account","bit Dungeon II has a little bit of Zelda, rogue-likes, and Dark Souls in it.\n\nThe action is fast, spammy combat, with some unique controls. Walking into an enemy causes a slow attack. Tapping A controls both parrying and quick attacks, which draw from a voluminous pool of stamina. It's unclear why you would ever want to use slow attacks, since quick attacks cause dramatically more damage, and as a bonus you might accidentally parry enemy attacks in the process.\n\nEnemies consist of melee enemies, some of which have tough shields, and ranged enemies. They almost universally have a single-frame windup, followed by a single-frame attack. You can see the inspiration from Dark Souls here, but it doesn't translate. Since the animation doesn't show attack progress, and since there is no cost to blocking as long as you want, there's little point in timing the enemy's attack. Plus, most enemies can be killed long before they actually manage to land a hit.\n\nMore generally, the game did not feel difficult enough. On my first play-though I became godlike far too quickly -- within about ten minutes. I felt like I was cutting a bloody swathe through enemies made of paper, which is very not-Dark Souls/Zelda/rogue-like-y. I killed several of the bosses before they were able to make a single attack. And while I died to some once before I learned their attack pattern, I never felt like I was in danger of losing my second life.\n\nThe lack of a map is also a problem with the maze-like quality of the overworld. Zelda 1 may not have had a map (I don't remember), but its overworld is more varied and easier to remember. At some point I lost track of what I needed to do next, and that's when I stopped playing. Not all things about the eight bit era are good things.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice attempt, but not a game that held my attention. I don't recommend it.","December 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/koopee/recommended/331440/","koopee","Mabish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/koopee/","440 products in account","First of all I'd like to say I like these sort of games, but I currently feel that buying this game was a mistake.\n\nThe controls are really weird - you just walk towards the enemies and the game swings your weapon for you, this makes the game feel really weird, especially at first. You get used to it fast, but I don't see why the dev decided this was better  than having a separate button for attack.\n\nThe second bad thing about this game is the deal breaker for me - sometimes (quite often) when you enter a room you instantly get hit by monsters, or a big monster might even block you from moving which means that you will 100% sure take damage and theres nothing you can do about it. And if you are not strong enough to kill the monster right away you might just die.\nAlso sometimes monsters dodge or ignore your damage so even if you're just meleeing easy monsters that you know you can one shot, you often end up missing the hit and taking some damage.\nSure the latter can be avoided by being extra careful against even the tiniest guys but in this game a new set of monsters are spawned everytime you enter a room - even if you had already cleared that room previously.\n\nApart from these things, it's a fun little game and the price is very affordable so definitely check back on it later, but I wouldn't recommend buying it as it is.\n\nI'll give this game another shot later and hopefully I can recommend this game to others by then.","December 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/331440/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","tl;dr: The game feels unfinished, unpolished and offers only very mediocre hack & slash gameplay. Also, it's not even close to being a rogue-like as one of its user-defined tags suggests.\n\nThe game feels very unfinished.\nVery little variation in zone graphics: The first screenshot (desert zone) shows you pretty much all the objects used to decorate the desert area, excluding the handful of enemies running around there. This makes the areas very dull.\nThere is no story: You bring the soul of some bint to a grave in some dark demon world dungeon for no reason what so ever. A game like this doesn't necessarily need a story, since usually these kind of games make up for it with addictive and enjoyable gameplay. This one completely misses the mark on both.\nBoth enemies and bosses are dull and too similar.\nIt makes one tiny attempt at a puzzle (two mazes in the game, completely identical except for the movement combination). Now this game doesn't need puzzles, but if you're going to include them and they are bad, it is to the detriment of the game.\nThe game feels very unpolished.\nSome walls allow you to jump down a ledge if you run into its northern edge. However, if you run into its southern edge it still makes the jump sound despite not having you jump up.\nCollision with obstacles bumps you back, rather than halting movement. This makes movement feel and look very amateurish.\nThe controls are mediocre. I simply don't understand why blocking, activating a special attack, and the normal attack are all bound to the same button. I also don't understand why moving into an enemy automatically triggers you to do your normal attack. If you're going to copy Zelda: A Link to the Past, then also copy its combat system to some extent. Oh, I almost forgot: picking up gear drops is also bound to the attack button. This means you can pick up a mediocre item while attacking and not notice it until you leave the level. Every item despawns once you leave the level, so there is no way to get it back.\nShops are pointless: There are a bunch of shops that offer static items that are only good when you haven't gotten any equipment drops yet. There are only three shops worth going to. The first two offer random loot of a certain item rank, and the last one restocks some stat boost runes as you gain more levels.\nThe game is ridiculously easy. I have defeated all the bosses except the last one by standing in front of the boss and spamming the attack button. The boss usually doesn't even get a chance to do anything, but the things it does are hardly worth experiencing anyway.\nWhen you go from one area to the next, you spawn too far into the new area. This results in awkward positioning and monsters reaching you before you can assess the area and respond. This is probably why the dev included an auto attack when you run into monsters, but this one doesn't work if you wield a bow. The only way to prevent getting damage this way is to spam your attack when you move from one area to the next.\nDungeon graphics resemble Zelda (A Link to the Past) graphics. The 5th (last) screenshot on the store page points this out, and it touches the border from homage to blatant plagiarism.\n\nDoes the game have anything good to offer?\nIf you can get over all the flaws mentioned before, you get a game that primarily focuses on equipment grind. You find items with different stat bonuses to finetune your character, and you gain stats each level based on the kind of attacks you used. The monsters level along with you, but do this in a rather strange fashion. Monsters I could one-shot when I first met them suddenly took a lot more hits after I finished a dungeon. The loot is random and there is no inventory to save your items. You carry only what you have equiped and leave the rest behind. You also don't have any consumables.\n\nIf you are attracted by the "rogue-like" tag, then I must disappoint you. The game has no procedural level generation (at least, the areas look so much alike it's hard to say. Starting a new game drops you at a different area, though, but on my third game I got the feeling this is the only random part of the level generation), no turn-based gameplay, and there is no tile-based movement/graphics. This game offers perma-death, but gives you extra-live(s), and it has randomized loot. Perhaps this is what the definition of rogue-like has boiled down to.\n\nI wish I bought wanderlust instead.","December 17, 2014","false","2.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

One button mechanics only work when you only have one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mechanic instead of four to work with.\nIn terms of actual review, this is so clearly just a direct port from android/iOS that it's not even funny. How do you move? Left mouse. Attack? Left mouse. Block? Left mouse. Special? Left mouse. Buy something? Left mouse. Enter doors? Left mouse. Pickup/use items/bonfires? Left â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mouse! Yeah, you can use other controls, but the other controls are just as cluttered and don't even work as well. You could also use Spacebar to attack/block/charge/move/open/buy/pickup/use, but why do that when left mouse is so much more convenient? You can also, of course, use WASD or a control stick for movement, but it doesn't stop your mouse from moving you when you do, and it stops you from attacking in any reasonable direction you want to, so it's actually utterly pointless! I mean, there's only almost fifty usable keys on a keyboard and always at least three or more on a mouse, why would anyone even think of using them?\nSo, no, unfortunately, this isn't actually a game that people can play reasonably.

Those looking for a classic Zelda 1 style gameplay like this game advertises will be disappointed. Firstly, there is not actual attack button. Attacks happen automatically by moving into enemies, you have no choice of target, and sometimes they seem to just randomly not work. There is a "quick attack" option, but it uses up magic for some reason and it sometimes fails to hit. On top of that, your block button is the same as your attack button, which is also the same as your charge attack button., which ultimately ends up with the player accidentally using all of those functions without any real control over whih one happens. The Charge up abilities also appear to only function sporadically and none of them are very useful. Even the Axe's whirlwind ability, while useful in the beginning, is quickly outshadowed by normal auto-attacks in damage after only a few levels. I just can't get past the controls. They're awful. I can't even figure out how to fight effectively to make it past more than one boos, all of which appear to be the exact same but with different sprites. The art style got me interested in the game, but after playing I'm left very disappointed.","January 22, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would've felt okay about it if it were just an Early Access game or something. It's not awful at all, just needs "more." More content, more polish, more design consideration.\n\nThis game has a nice retro art style but the game feels a bit bare, and the formula got old very fast for me. Rogue-likes need to have a lot of interesting randomisations so that they're fun to play through again even after you just died the room before the final boss; I didn't see anything like that in this, so to get back where I was up to was just looking like work.\n\nIt feels like this game was ported straight from a mobile app, and noting that it's available on Android & iOS, that's probably the case. The player is a slave of the One Button to Rule Them All: walk, attack, block, power attack/cast. All of this is "click." Yes, that does mean that you'll not irregularly walk face-first into enemies you're trying to attack from range.\n\nVery little variety in enemy AI. Aside from the theme change in the few different areas (forest, snow, desert, dungeon), there's very little graphical variation between rooms. They all feel the same, so it's not interesting to try to explore whole areas.\n\nThe 2 bosses I fought were very easy and, I suspect, bugged. Giant Skeleton didn't move for most of the fight.\n\nLevel up system is uninspiring; just a few automatic stat increases, no customisation other than what gear you wear, so I didn't find myself even thinking about how much exp I was getting or if I should grind.\n\nNoted that when I searched "bit Dungeon," I found the free-to-play Flash version, which actually looked more polished and controlled better, and that annoyed me after spending $5 on this.\n\nSo, in summary, here's what I think could use work:\n- Fix the control scheme so that it feels accurate and responsive\n- Work on the AI, especially of the bosses but also the behaviour of the little monsters so that they're uniquely challenging\n- Spice up the level up system\n- Add more graphics, interesting things, events into the world so that it's worth playing through again after dying. Otherwise, as someone else said, it doesn't work as a rogue-like and is better off having that element removed entirely!\n\nOtherwise, congrats on the Steam release, and I'll be interested to see how this game evolves. :) Sorry if the review is harsh, but when you say you draw inspiration from games like Diablo & Dark Souls, I expect to see some of those elements in the game other than just resting at fires, so it's a very bad point for comparison!","January 23, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dungeon location, and dungeons themselves remains the same for all gamethroughs, up to a point that I can pretty much play this game blindfolded. Room-swapping screen movement is terrible - you will pretty much take free damage to face, if not blocked.\n\nEquipment loot varies a lot - from 'totally useless' to 'oh god i got it at lvl 2 and i can just hack my way through the game from this point'. There's nothing clever about stats, nothing interesting about armors and weapons, besides hammers scaling with faith.\n\nRespawn and 'second chance' system is something new. It isn't actually doing anything but making an excuse for not fixing screen-swapping nearly unavoidable damage. It doesn't make this game any easier - it makes it bearable.\n\nFighting system is garbage. All you have to do is run into enemies, and sometimes - if you didn't get good loot - click on them. Done. It couldn't be any easier.\n\nLevel design:Level design is lacking pretty much everything - you get:\nIcy, forgotten,  something plagued area!\nSpooky forest with spooky ghosts!\nDesert with giant insects!\nPurple land with purple Striders from Half-Life 2! RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.\nThere's a locked last level, unlocked after going through all dungeons. It's spookier than the forest, more plagued than Africa and icy area combined, with more irritating enemies than Middle East and desert all together. Also, caves.\nEverything here just screams 'lazy', but what would you expect after a 5â¬ game (Hint - more)?\n\nBosses and enemies:Oh God, here's a good one. I guess omnipresent knights are supposed to be like Black Phantoms from DS. If so, they fail in that role.\nWant a quick hint on how to defeat all bosses? Just click them to death. Simple as it sounds, it's true. There's little to add to this game.\n\nOverall look:Good time killer, terrible game. Doesn't live up to its description.\nDon't buy it, unless it's for on a discount.

The lack of any map ensures you'll spend a lot of time wandering around, and it's probably the single biggest sticking point of the game that I can think of.  Other than that, most dungeons had similar or identical layouts, and trekking back to a dungeon after a death turns into a chore when you're not positive which way to go.  After about an hour my mind started to glaze over because the game starts to numb you - each screen looks similar, contains similar enemies, and must be handled in a similar way.\n\nThe game's concept is great but it will quickly get old unless something is done in a patch to revisit some of its weaknesses.  I can't recommend the game for its full retail price, but if you're OK with paying 3 dollars or so to wring out about 2 hours of fun, then you'll have a good time.  After spending about 2 hours in the game I have no desire to continue playing it - the rogue-like elements are far from deep and the inspirations from Dark Souls and Zelda do not significantly change or improve upon aspects of those games. Instead, the very clear inspiration it takes from other games leaves these borrowed mechanics feel shallow in comparison to their use in the titles that made them classics.","December 22, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will say it does have some faults though.\nThe general gameplay is a roguelike 2D zelda style. You don't have a story really but you have an overworld with dungeons spread throughout and a few very basic random events that can happen such as being attacked when healing at a fireplace. Enemies and bosses are mostly simple but some have special attacks that must be avoided and you'll randomly find dungeons where enemies are harder than you may expect.\n\nOverall the gameplay is addicting and fun. Many of the items can have cool stats that allow you to do fun setups with your character. The thing the game truly suffers from is how simple the controls are. This is due to it being a game designed for phones. You can use your keyboard to play which is a simple WASD and spacebar setup however this can be annoying when your attack button is the same way you pick up gear. I have often dropped my items on accident. This is worse when you don't realize it and move off the screen and anything on the ground vanishes. These are things that can be fixed though and hopefully will be.\n\nAnother thing is imbalance. The bow is absurdly overly powered. If you don't want to make the game too easy I suggest avoiding it. If you want to get further into the game then pick one up. Using the spacebar you can spam the bow many times before running out of energy.\n\nAnywho for the low price the game is very much worth getting, and I find it more enjoyable on the PC with the keyboard than on the phone with the touchscreen.","December 22, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upon loading the game, you feel like you're in for a fun, difficult, nostalgia-inducing treat that will keep you hooked for hours. Sadly, this isn't necessarily the case. bit Dungeon II is fun for the first 15 to 20 minutes of playing, but it quickly wears thin of its flare. One button to attack, block, and perform special abilities while you explore dungeons that are vastly the same as the previous.\n\nThe description of bit Dungeon II mentions Dark Souls, a brutal third-person game where death is inevitable and unforgiving; I expected the same experience from bit Dungeon II. While you may have a similar experience while playing with sword and shield, you'll find that archers are ridiculously overpowered. It's too easy to just sit in a corner, where monsters won't even notice you, and then just spam arrows into their backs. When using a bow, even the bosses become a cakewalk. The only downside to using a bow is the boring downtime you have while waiting for your stamina to regenerate. Fully depleting your stamina for the first time while fighting a boss introduces an interesting element when you notice that your tiny dungeon crawler is moving at half speed. This is easily remedied by quickly shooting four arrows at your enemy and then moving to a safer position while your stamina regenerates. However, even when using a bow, you're prone to being swamped with monsters when entering a new map. More than half of the time you go to a new map, you're placed on top of enemies that can quickly rid you of all of your health if you don't act quickly.\n\nAfter defeating a boss, you're taken back to a familiar overworld with the same, old faces ready to claw your guts out. Exploring in this game becomes a bit tedious. Many paths will lead to dead-ends, and there's no map or guidance of any sort to even point you in the direction of your next mildly-exciting dungeon. While exploring, dungeons, combat, and bosses may be lackluster and bland, you can always have a good time searching for more loot, which is randomly generated; as a wise man once said: it's like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get.\n\nOverall, this game is bland and has very little excitement to offer. However, it is cheap, and if you love endless roguelikes with random loot, this one may be one to pick up at some point.\n\nPros:\nEasy to play\nRandom world\nRandom loot\n\nCons:\nBoring\nRepetitive\nNo map\nOverpowered archers\nEasy bosses","December 22, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And you can take the dungeons on how ever you want to.\n- The items allow for a nice mix up and with the good amount that drop over one game play it is fairly easy to find enough equipment to change from something like a mage to a swordman.\n- The music fits the game perfectly and helps with making the game that more enjoyable.\n- There is also some random encounters when you rest at camp fires making it rather interesting whether some physco is going to be next to you when you wake up.\n\nAnd now for the negatives:\n- The movement system can be a little buggy as you collide with the enviroment REALLY easy making you an easy target for enemies sometimes.\n- The music will cut out when you get into an area with enemies which is all the time meaning that hlef the time your playing the game there is any music (and it's soooo good too so it's a real shame).\n- There is no tutorial at the start or even anywhere in the menu to review the control scheme so my first 5 minutes of the game was trying to figure out how to actually play it.\n- Now I know that this game is meant to be a bit like the first zelda with no map... But it becomes really frustrating at some points, like when you are trying to find a fire to rest next to but oh that's right there no god damn map to use so by the time I find a fire nearly all my health is gone.\n- And laslty if you go melee into a boss fight it becomes really easy as you end up walking to the boss mashing the space bar (that's special btw) allowing me to hack the boss up in less than 2 minutes.\n\nThese fixes I'm sure will be coming but the game is still very enjoyable even with the problems that are still lingering in the game.\n","December 15, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you need to realize is that Zelda took years to make, it was so well developed that no other game can compare to it for that very reason. With that being said i find it unrealistic for people to try and compare it to a $5 game. I'm not trashing this game in any way by saying that, what I'm saying is that for what has been put into it, I feel like it exceedes my expectations. I played the first game and the second one has improved leaps and bounds. The early issues were just fixed this update, and I'm very glad that the maker is concerned with the flaws in his product, you can even look on the website to see the amazing and great things they have planned. (http://kintogames.com/) This game is worth far more than $5, for the content I would expect $10-$15 especially with what they are adding in the future. I can play hours on end of this game finding all the hidden things it has to offer. The best part is that no playthrough is ever the same thanks to the random weapon drops. I can get an OP weapon at the start and have no trouble finishing it but next time if I don't get that, the entire thing changes. This game is great. This game also should not be played with anything but a controller, it gives you the best gameplay possible.

I will say it does have some faults though.\nThe general gameplay is a roguelike 2D zelda style. You don't have a story really but you have an overworld with dungeons spread throughout and a few very basic random events that can happen such as being attacked when healing at a fireplace. Enemies and bosses are mostly simple but some have special attacks that must be avoided and you'll randomly find dungeons where enemies are harder than you may expect.\n\nOverall the gameplay is addicting and fun. Many of the items can have cool stats that allow you to do fun setups with your character. The thing the game truly suffers from is how simple the controls are. This is due to it being a game designed for phones. You can use your keyboard to play which is a simple WASD and spacebar setup however this can be annoying when your attack button is the same way you pick up gear. I have often dropped my items on accident. This is worse when you don't realize it and move off the screen and anything on the ground vanishes. These are things that can be fixed though and hopefully will be.\n\nAnother thing is imbalance. The bow is absurdly overly powered. If you don't want to make the game too easy I suggest avoiding it. If you want to get further into the game then pick one up. Using the spacebar you can spam the bow many times before running out of energy.\n\nAnywho for the low price the game is very much worth getting, and I find it more enjoyable on the PC with the keyboard than on the phone with the touchscreen.","December 22, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone else had said in the reviews, get bow, win game. He was right on. The bow is a game ender and once you have it you will win. The only thing I can say I disliked about the game is how when you go through a door, especially in the later levels, the enemies swarm the door and stun you over and over again until you die. Then you lose all your gear and have to start over, at the start, with nothing. Last area is not easy to get to and you have already gathered the best gear in the game, which you cannot regain, makes it almost impossible to get back where you were. And that the same button does everything, although nice and east, you pick up weapons on accident when using the bow, and you walk to the next area before you realized what has happend. Annnd you just lost that bow you worked so hard to get and replaced it with a level two stick.  If this game is on sale for a couple of bucks buy it, if it's full price, wait.

Dungeon location, and dungeons themselves remains the same for all gamethroughs, up to a point that I can pretty much play this game blindfolded. Room-swapping screen movement is terrible - you will pretty much take free damage to face, if not blocked.\n\nEquipment loot varies a lot - from 'totally useless' to 'oh god i got it at lvl 2 and i can just hack my way through the game from this point'. There's nothing clever about stats, nothing interesting about armors and weapons, besides hammers scaling with faith.\n\nRespawn and 'second chance' system is something new. It isn't actually doing anything but making an excuse for not fixing screen-swapping nearly unavoidable damage. It doesn't make this game any easier - it makes it bearable.\n\nFighting system is garbage. All you have to do is run into enemies, and sometimes - if you didn't get good loot - click on them. Done. It couldn't be any easier.\n\nLevel design:Level design is lacking pretty much everything - you get:\nIcy, forgotten,  something plagued area!\nSpooky forest with spooky ghosts!\nDesert with giant insects!\nPurple land with purple Striders from Half-Life 2! RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.\nThere's a locked last level, unlocked after going through all dungeons. It's spookier than the forest, more plagued than Africa and icy area combined, with more irritating enemies than Middle East and desert all together. Also, caves.\nEverything here just screams 'lazy', but what would you expect after a 5â¬ game (Hint - more)?\n\nBosses and enemies:Oh God, here's a good one. I guess omnipresent knights are supposed to be like Black Phantoms from DS. If so, they fail in that role.\nWant a quick hint on how to defeat all bosses? Just click them to death. Simple as it sounds, it's true. There's little to add to this game.\n\nOverall look:Good time killer, terrible game. Doesn't live up to its description.\nDon't buy it, unless it's for on a discount.

I would've felt okay about it if it were just an Early Access game or something. It's not awful at all, just needs "more." More content, more polish, more design consideration.\n\nThis game has a nice retro art style but the game feels a bit bare, and the formula got old very fast for me. Rogue-likes need to have a lot of interesting randomisations so that they're fun to play through again even after you just died the room before the final boss; I didn't see anything like that in this, so to get back where I was up to was just looking like work.\n\nIt feels like this game was ported straight from a mobile app, and noting that it's available on Android & iOS, that's probably the case. The player is a slave of the One Button to Rule Them All: walk, attack, block, power attack/cast. All of this is "click." Yes, that does mean that you'll not irregularly walk face-first into enemies you're trying to attack from range.\n\nVery little variety in enemy AI. Aside from the theme change in the few different areas (forest, snow, desert, dungeon), there's very little graphical variation between rooms. They all feel the same, so it's not interesting to try to explore whole areas.\n\nThe 2 bosses I fought were very easy and, I suspect, bugged. Giant Skeleton didn't move for most of the fight.\n\nLevel up system is uninspiring; just a few automatic stat increases, no customisation other than what gear you wear, so I didn't find myself even thinking about how much exp I was getting or if I should grind.\n\nNoted that when I searched "bit Dungeon," I found the free-to-play Flash version, which actually looked more polished and controlled better, and that annoyed me after spending $5 on this.\n\nSo, in summary, here's what I think could use work:\n- Fix the control scheme so that it feels accurate and responsive\n- Work on the AI, especially of the bosses but also the behaviour of the little monsters so that they're uniquely challenging\n- Spice up the level up system\n- Add more graphics, interesting things, events into the world so that it's worth playing through again after dying. Otherwise, as someone else said, it doesn't work as a rogue-like and is better off having that element removed entirely!\n\nOtherwise, congrats on the Steam release, and I'll be interested to see how this game evolves. :) Sorry if the review is harsh, but when you say you draw inspiration from games like Diablo & Dark Souls, I expect to see some of those elements in the game other than just resting at fires, so it's a very bad point for comparison!","January 23, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it isn't all bad. The basic ideas are fine, the dungeon designs are nice and the one life system is "interesting". I say "interesting" because if you die twice you lose everything, but don't necessarily have to start over completely.  You probably will though, because in this game your gear is the only thing pulling your through each dungeon. Losing your gear in this game is like having your stats reset in any other game. Continuing is pointless because you're not going to get far.\n\nNow for the bad parts. Firstly, saying the controls in this game are simplistic is like saying Michael Bay enjoys explosions. You move with WASD and attack/pick up items/whatever with space or the mouse. Some of you might have already figured out the problem. Having every action linked to the same key makes this game a clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ from hell. If you happen to be on an item while trying to attack, you'll go into an infinite loop of picking up the item, dropping your equipment, picking up your equipment, dropping the item and picking up the item again. When it happens in a dungeon it pretty much guarantees you're going to die. Killed by bad controls and a crappy pair of +3 Dodge boots.\n\nThat's another problem. The majority of the items you get in this game are junk. Sure, when you're starting out a crappy pair of boots is better than nothing, but unlike other games those crappy boots never stop appearing. It literally gets to the point where you'll use the same equipment through the entire game because the game won't give you anything better (or anything else.) There's no progression and almost no diversity. And to remind you, ITEMS ARE LIKE STATS IN THIS GAME. Sure, sometimes you get lucky and get a "good" item, but even then there's almost no diversity. The last time I played I got the same "epic" helmet (stats and all) five times in a row in five different locations.\n\nHere's another problem: combat. Combat in this game is basically a drunken, anemic slap-fight against a boxer. The feel of your character's attacks ranges from hard and deadly to limp and sloppy. Some enemies will go down in one hit with the right weapon (reference the above paragraph), but others will literally brush your attacks off like you're nothing to them. It's ridiculously unsatisfying. More so due to the fact that combat in this game boils down to button mashing. There's no strategy, no rhythm, just repeatedly mashing space until everything is dead or you go into an item pick up death loop.\n\nSo to sum up: the controls are atrocious, the combat is weak and the item distribution is a game killer. I can appreciate what this game was trying to do (make a Legend of Zelda style game with RPG and rogue-like elements), but the flaws killed any fun I would have had with it right away. Which, frankly, is sad because I could have had a lot of fun with it. The best part of this game, I suppose, is that I only spent around three dollars on it.","April 20, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/otchron/recommended/331440/","otchron","Otchron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/otchron/","560 products in account","bit Dungeon II is a Dark Souls take on The Legend of Zelda(1986). There are various bonfires with a few having merchants in the same screen.  There are 6 dungeons and a final dungeon consisting of two separate parts. There are 9 main Bosses and one hidden one, the Ice Golem. I have yet to find out what slaying this one does. On my second play through I noticed hidden rooms in bushes, but nowhere else. The enemies have great designs, though my favorite is the lanky, four-eyed monsters in the cursed forest followed closely by the dungeon cats. These cats show up in rooms you already cleared to tear at the remains of the fallen.\nThe over-world is quite small compared to The Legend of Zelda. Contrary to the main page, the temples are not randomly placed on the over-world. The dungeons themselves are fairly short and the bosses are simple and easy. I just stand there and hit them until they die, usually within 30 seconds. I have only died once at the hand of a boss. In fact I have only died 4 times total and have only one game over. The game is fairly easy and it only gets easier with high end gear. Since the loot is all randomized, I found unique items halfway through and passed on most everything else.\nWhen first starting the game, there is a ghost of a woman who gives her soul to you for an extra life. If you die, you can return to the place of your death and reclaim her soul, very much like Dark Souls.\nThe second play through let me keep my gear and since the enemies donât seem to increase very much in power, and the dungeons were exactly the same, there is very little replay value. I am currently on my third play through.\nThe game itself is short, a good 90 minutes long, if you donât rush. Overall the game is a pleasant experience and worth the time for at least one play through. The 4.99 price tag is just about right, and I would strongly encourage getting it on sale or in a bundle if you are interested but are hesitant to get it full price.","February 14, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your objective is to take the spirit of your loved one to her grave, and to do so you'll have to kill a bunch of bosses in their dungeons, reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus in theme except there are also ordinary enemies and minibosses.\n\nGame world:\n\nThe game is set on an unchanging overworld map with dungeons that randomly pick from a set of designs to give a feeling of variation, taking inspiration from Souls for the bonfires scattered around where you can regain health and check your stats. The random generation is therefore not very significant.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe combat is rather simple but not mindless: your character auto attacks when it bumps into enemies, but at a mouse click, key press or button push depending on what you're playing with they can attack instantly at the cost of some stamina. Holding down this key allows you to block attacks also at the cost of stamina, and perform a charged attack with your weapons. There's not much challenge to fights as the enemies and bosses are rather easy to figure out, and your greatest danger is underleveling or lack of good equipment.\n\nThe permadeath mechanic takes inspiration from Souls: the soul you're transporting is your only extra life, and you drop it at the place of your death. If you cannot retrieve it, your next death is final and you must restart, keeping only the coins you collected which can be used to purchase items at shops you must find yourself.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game has charming "retro" pixel sprites graphics which work pretty well. There's not much animation to the characters but not much is needed either.\n\nReplayability:\n\nThere is NG+, and if you enjoy collecting rare equipment or trying out different weapons and builds there is some replayability in this for you. The game itself is short. By the time this review was written I had completed my first playthrough after somewhere around 5 restarts, mostly late in the game. The game itself would only take around an hour to complete.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a nice enough timewaster on a mobile platform. Outside of a mobile however, it is far too simple and with little challenge or replayability unless you enjoy farming for items (Borderlands fans, this is for you.) It was clearly ported to PC (the port works fine) and while it is a fun little past time, it's up to you if this is worth having it on your PC. I personally recommend getting this for your phone instead.","April 19, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun to do a few runs through the game and put it into increasingly difficult modes, but then I hit a wall.  As with many randomized games, the design does not adjust to the difficulty scaling.  In bit Dungeon II, you'll find there are certain dungeon rooms that are very small and you can spawn into a horde of enemies that simply one-shot you with no opportunity for you to react.

There are various bonfires with a few having merchants in the same screen.  There are 6 dungeons and a final dungeon consisting of two separate parts. There are 9 main Bosses and one hidden one, the Ice Golem. I have yet to find out what slaying this one does. On my second play through I noticed hidden rooms in bushes, but nowhere else. The enemies have great designs, though my favorite is the lanky, four-eyed monsters in the cursed forest followed closely by the dungeon cats. These cats show up in rooms you already cleared to tear at the remains of the fallen.\nThe over-world is quite small compared to The Legend of Zelda. Contrary to the main page, the temples are not randomly placed on the over-world. The dungeons themselves are fairly short and the bosses are simple and easy. I just stand there and hit them until they die, usually within 30 seconds. I have only died once at the hand of a boss. In fact I have only died 4 times total and have only one game over. The game is fairly easy and it only gets easier with high end gear. Since the loot is all randomized, I found unique items halfway through and passed on most everything else.\nWhen first starting the game, there is a ghost of a woman who gives her soul to you for an extra life. If you die, you can return to the place of your death and reclaim her soul, very much like Dark Souls.\nThe second play through let me keep my gear and since the enemies donât seem to increase very much in power, and the dungeons were exactly the same, there is very little replay value. I am currently on my third play through.\nThe game itself is short, a good 90 minutes long, if you donât rush. Overall the game is a pleasant experience and worth the time for at least one play through. The 4.99 price tag is just about right, and I would strongly encourage getting it on sale or in a bundle if you are interested but are hesitant to get it full price.","February 14, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple where it needs to be complex where it counts. I like the random loot and enemies. Mowing down enemies is satifying in this game. I will say the difficulty spike at the end really throws you off. In the beginning its average difficulty. Then you get good gear and its easy but you can still die if your not careful in dungeons. And then at the end this difficulty shoots up with no warning. kind of unfair the first time around but still fun.\n\nMy only problem with this game is the lack of documentation on how anything works. Even the wiki is incredibly sparse. An explanation of weapon stats would be great. Also your level doesnt seem to matter much because everything scales to your level. So why have them at all. Even equipment level doesnt seem to effect the stats much.

Especially for people who go into rogue-like looking for a challenge, as that's not what you'll fins here, though as far as I can tell there are some obscure achievements to be found if that happens to be your thing.

The lack of any map ensures you'll spend a lot of time wandering around, and it's probably the single biggest sticking point of the game that I can think of.  Other than that, most dungeons had similar or identical layouts, and trekking back to a dungeon after a death turns into a chore when you're not positive which way to go.  After about an hour my mind started to glaze over because the game starts to numb you - each screen looks similar, contains similar enemies, and must be handled in a similar way.\n\nThe game's concept is great but it will quickly get old unless something is done in a patch to revisit some of its weaknesses.  I can't recommend the game for its full retail price, but if you're OK with paying 3 dollars or so to wring out about 2 hours of fun, then you'll have a good time.  After spending about 2 hours in the game I have no desire to continue playing it - the rogue-like elements are far from deep and the inspirations from Dark Souls and Zelda do not significantly change or improve upon aspects of those games. Instead, the very clear inspiration it takes from other games leaves these borrowed mechanics feel shallow in comparison to their use in the titles that made them classics.","December 22, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone else had said in the reviews, get bow, win game. He was right on. The bow is a game ender and once you have it you will win. The only thing I can say I disliked about the game is how when you go through a door, especially in the later levels, the enemies swarm the door and stun you over and over again until you die. Then you lose all your gear and have to start over, at the start, with nothing. Last area is not easy to get to and you have already gathered the best gear in the game, which you cannot regain, makes it almost impossible to get back where you were. And that the same button does everything, although nice and east, you pick up weapons on accident when using the bow, and you walk to the next area before you realized what has happend. Annnd you just lost that bow you worked so hard to get and replaced it with a level two stick.  If this game is on sale for a couple of bucks buy it, if it's full price, wait. If you played Zelda as a kid, it's worth it, if not, save your money.","December 24, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not as giant as is claimed in the description\n\nI had some expectations of this game and would have liked to see it updated more often, since I had been active in the in discussions, but am sadly disappointed at the lack of effort going into fixing it.\n\nI hope this has been informative and thank you for reading.","June 23, 2015","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a good variate of enemys and you have to learn what moves each has has when fighting. The minibosses are easy but I can see why they have made it this way (might have been my weapon). But on the other note, I have to say some of button lables are weird and the only way to know what to press is if you hit esc. when playing. Another complaint is that I don't know how to heal my self during battle. Over all I'd give it a 7.6/10, would miniboss again.","April 6","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/331440/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A simple and easy action-adventure RPG/dungeon crawler. Good enough pixel graphics and animations, barely any story, not much variety in puzzles/levels. Plays like a simpler Zelda with dungeons filled only with enemies, buttons, and door keys. Press every button and kill every enemy in a locked room and eventually you'll reach the end. One of the only puzzles was the 'endless maze' type of puzzle where there are multiple exits and you just go to the exit that doesn't have the bush next to it.\n\nIt's pretty good for power trips because once you power up above the difficulty curve you can just walk into most enemies and you will automatically kill them. Level ups come pretty often. There's one button to attack, charge attack, & defend. I didn't like using mouse (because you need to move the mouse cursor to face the enemy) so I just used keyboard for both positioning (and attacking always goes in the direction you face). Instead of WASD+mouse I used arrow keys + space but it may be possible to use a controller instead. It's a simple enough game to play in windowed mode while watching something else on the side.\n\nDeath is pretty forgiving as long as you stay in areas you're strong enough to get through. When you die you leave behind an extra life token. If you die before you retrieve it then it's game over. Otherwise you can die as many times as you want as long as you can retrieve the token each time. However, I've read that the final boss removes your extra life (so only one try) so be prepared for that.\n\nI liked lifesteal + constitution/defensive stats just so it would be easier to not pay too much attention.\n\nI ended the game at level 74 and went from a Lvl 19 Vampiric Sword of a God to a Lvl 32 Vampiric Spear of Death and skipped all other weapon drops. Once you beat the game you start again from the beginning with all your items and coins but I stopped playing so I don't know if there's anything different.\n\nOther random thoughts:\nDon't allow yourself to be surrounded, it's the easiest way to die\nSometimes you can see cracks in the wall that you can go through for a chest with a random item.\nThere are purple enemies that spawn in dungeons after you return to a cleared room. They often drop hp regen potions (so you can farm them to regen hp) though it seems like the regen effect doesn't last when you change rooms.\nIt's probably worth saving 300 black coins for a cave that sells 300-coin chests with random items. I wasted my coins on the 30-coin chests that had items I didn't even pick up. Only spend coins on other vendors if you're having trouble at the moment and need an upgrade. (Though by the time you farm the coins you'll probably be a high enough level to overpower the enemies you had trouble with)\nThere are a couple sound effects that seem very similar to mario sound effects\nI would have liked:\nA way to see the full map (not just the minimap)\nTo know how things worked in-game (how much do stats affect your power, what does everything mean, what stats are better to choose, difference between things (like Cleave vs Super Cleave)\nWorth a look if you like simple zelda-like RPGs and like to power trip. It may be a little more difficult if you aren't a seasoned gamer but I'd say you can always grind to beat the power curve and then power-trip to the end.","October 3, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can beat it in two hours or less if you're not dum dum like me and *SPOILERS* you don't waste your ghost spirit while trying out the controls  *END OF SPOILERS*.\nBut if you are not an achievement maniac like me, then even while being a dum dum, you can beat it in 2 hours. When I understood that mashing space is your key to victory, everything became so easy...  I killed the last boss in 2-3s. Which is awkward and I hope devs will fix all this.\nPros:\n- Zelda-like game with the elements of rogue-like games.\n- Several weapon types with lots of different stats, which do something and you kinda can see that with random numbers appearing.\n- No complex controls.\n- Awesome boss music.\nCons:\n- No map. I mean there is a mini-map, but the world is way bigger than that and it becomes hard to know where to go next.\n- Lots of different stats, but there are no explanations. So you don't know whether to get a weapon/armor or not.\n- Some mobs like knights are a huge pain in the â¥â¥â¥. They are harder than bosses. I hate them.\n- Damage between monsters varies too much - from scratching to "omg where did my half of hp go?".\n\nTo summarise, this game can be fun for those few hours and for 5 euros it is really worth it.","September 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty much like what I just said above.  You'll explore a randomly generated map, happen upon dungeons to be solved and bosses therein to slay. For those that played Super Metroid on the SNES back in the day, and remember how defeating bosses are like keys in a lock to a door to a final area, you will find that homage here.  The game has a great rate of progression. Greedy loot based gamers, those that enjoy Diablo, will enjoy this game very much.\n\nPros:\nRogue-like risk vs. reward gameplay.\nRetro graphics, but not too retro as to cause your eyes to bleed. The sprites are done beautifully, Zelda SNES style.\nAwesome Chiptunes music. Very entertaining videogame/chiptunes style music. I turned off my own music just to enjoy it.\nTiered loot system. Mimics MMO's and ARPG's with its loot system. I.E. "Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic"\nLots of Character/Gear Stats that can be influenced by your gear and by powerups you find in game. Allowing you to build your character the way you want (Dark Souls style)\nNew Game+. The game instantly starts over on harder difficulties with scaling gear drops each time you beat it.\nGreat variety in items and gameplay.  The pacing and progression allow enjoyment in the face of repeating the game.\nCons:\nControl issues. Controls can seem to get hung up or glitch out every now and then. And directions aren't all that clear for such simple controls.\nInventory management.  I feel like a few slots of inventory should be allowed. And again, the controls with the inventory can cause issues mid combat as you accidently pick up a weapon when you were trying to block.\nLack of information. Stats aren't explained. Unique stats aren't explained.\nLack of abilities. You can attack with melee, or ranged. That's it. No special spells. No utility items.\nBoss fights. They are alllllll the same. Except for maybe the final boss.\n\nSummary:\nBit Dungeon II is great if you just want a game to jump into without any wait time, and want instant gratification.  You'll have a few rounds of learning how the game works, and its mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to just keep playing.  Seeing the influences of old great games from SNES days mixed in with influences from legendary games like the Dark Souls series is awesome. It doesn't try to hide it, and it embraces something great. The devs need to worry about adding some features for long-term play like adding unique abilities or spells, otherwise combat will get old.  And for crying out loud, tell me what my stats mean. What does this epic weapon with a special attribute do? Anyways.  A great indie-retro game.  The result of someone taking a few great ideas, not complicating the project, and refining it into something many gamers can enjoy.\n\nHighly recommended.","September 21, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Latsu/recommended/331440/","Latsu","Latsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Latsu/","417 products in account","bit Dungeon II is a very simple Rogue-Lite Dungeon based RPG which was likely developed with Mobile Touch/Mouse as the main control method.\n\nDon't think that a Mobile port is always a bad thing, in fact, this game actually pulls off the mobile port somewhat right because it doesn't charge a ridiculous price like many other mobile ports.\n\nThe game is likened to the original Zelda title because of how the game is set up. There is no tutorial to tell you what to do and many people would be irritated with that fact, I actually liked journeying throughout the world trying to figure out what to do. I've gotten to what I assume is the final boss a couple times. The difficulty really depends on what drops you get because the game at its heart is a Rogue-Lite Dungeon RPG. You progress from dungeon to dungeon and fight each boss until you can get to the Final Dungeon. Sometimes you will have good runs and sometimes you will have bad runs.\n\nThe game is a little buggy but it seems that a lot of the bugs I use to experience have been patched in the past few months and that pleases me a lot to see a developer patch and support their game post release on Steam, because all too often I see games that could be very good just left as abandonware on Steam.\n\nbit Dungeon II will remain a game that I will play periodically because of how enjoyable it is. If you enjoy Action RPGs with permadeath you will enjoy this game.","November 22, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/recommended/331440/","Azba","Azba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/","663 products in account","Let me preface this review by saying it's going to be very heavily weighted towards negative points. That said, I would still recommend the game for its price, especially on sale. I got it for $1 and I'm more than confident I got my money's worth out of this game. It is FAR better than many other free or $1 games I've played.\n\nbit Dungeon II is what I'd describe as an action-roguelite. It's halfway between a twinstick shooter and an RPG with roguelike elements tacked on (most prominently, permadeath.)\nThe game immediately throws you in the deep end. First you see the title screen, then from the moment you hit "play game" you're more or less on your own aside from some short instructions if you figure out how to pause the game (ESC key.) NOTHING is explained clearly. You have to figure it out on your own. In a way I feel like this was sorta a good thing, since many roguelikes do the same, giving you nothing but a list of key binds and maybe a general overview of your objective.\n\nPROS:\n+The game is well polished for its price, and well worth it on sale.\n+It features "8-bit" (note the quotes) graphics which look pretty nice for what they are. I've seen a lot worse in more highly priced games *cough*Teleglitch*cough*\n+There's a wide variety of equipment to be had, and there's a lot of different designs for each piece. They are all represented correctly on your character sprite too, which I think is super neat. There's a lot of games out there like this that don't bother, or will only show weapons/shields on the character.\n+I like the way the game starts with dropping you in the deep end of a story that is never really fully explained. You'll have to make guesses as to what's going on, which I personally find pretty interesting. I cannot say the same for the way the game drops you in the deep end of its mechanics though.\n+There's a few different classes of weapons which all have their own combat styles, more or less. Each relies on a certain stat (or two) which means you'll have to decide what stats you want to focus on and can make it painful when you have to give up a rare weapon due to not having enough points in its particular stat.\n+You can play this game one-handed, either one hand on the keyboard or one hand on the mouse. It's pretty simple.\n+Combat is fairly straightforward and easy to learn.\n+It's "open-world" so there's some exploration to be had. Not sure if the map is somewhat randomized each time because I did literally everything there was to do in the game on my first run.\n+The game scales as you progress story-wise, meaning that you can grind for the next dungeon if you want and it won't scale until you've beaten the current dungeon. This, IMO, is a good thing unlike certain other games which continually scale to attempt to keep the game challenging and therefore defeating the purpose of levelling up to begin with.\n+The game is infinitely playable, it loops and continues scaling until you die for real. Technically this is a good thing, I personally find that kind of replayability extremely dull but eh.\n+Enemies are randomized every time you enter a room, and corpses are permanent in dungeons. This becomes pretty neat when certain corpse-eating enemies start appearing and getting stronger the more corpses you leave behind in a dungeon.\n\nCONS:\n-The game is too easy. I literally beat the whole game and got all the achievements in one run, my first run. It would be MUCH tougher if you did not have the "second chance" life token, but unfortunately you NEED to keep that on hand to beat the game properly.\n-The game is pretty imbalanced.\n--Some weapon types are clearly better than others, apparently due to how the damage is calculated which is never made clear. Weapons that use more than one stat to determine their damage always seem to be better. This also happens to coincide with the fact that you can use a shield or spellbook with the two weapon types that let you do that, which makes spears and knives much better overall, especially since they also hit faster than the two-handed weapons. Probably. I didn't try staves.\n--Some enemies are complete pushovers, whereas others will remain tanky no matter how far you get into the game. There's not really much in between the two extremes. The tanky ones, as a result, also tend to be the ones that do the most damage.\n--I found the majority of the bosses to be FAR easier than hacking through the dungeon to get to them. In most cases, the small bands of enemies and attrition from working your way through will wear you down much faster than the boss.\n-The game drops you in the deep end and nothing is explained. You could well end your first run by not investigating the nearby cave at the spawn point and picking out a weapon, since you cannot fight without one.\n-The combat is very simple, which makes it a little uninteresting. All you do is walk into enemies to auto-attack them, and you can press spacebar/left mouse to spend MP to attack at will. What this turns into for the melee weapons is "mash spacebar to win" except for a few enemies who will tank that.\n--Holding the attack button is meant to charge up for a special attack, but it was pretty inconsistent and did not always work. That's also the same command for blocking, which also did not seem to always work.\n--Bows make a complete embarassment of most of the bosses, not least of all the final boss who lazily followed me around the room while I popped off shots until it died - it fired a grand total of 4 projectiles so clearly it was meant to be able to retaliate at range, but it didn't try.\n-There's a few puzzles but they're ALL really easy to solve.\n--The mazes may initially be confusing but there's a VERY obvious clue as to how to solve them in every single maze. On top of this there are NPCs who will outright tell you the solution.\n--There's a few "push the blocks onto the buttons" puzzles but none of them are actually challenging at all.\n-The game makes a point of saying that you lose EVERYTHING when you die, equipment, levels, everything. However you get to keep your money, which can be used to buy some pretty strong equipment if you know where it is.\n-No save function, so you have to beat the game in one sitting. The game is actually kinda lengthy so you'd have to leave it on when you're busy.\n-Enemies respawning every time you leave a screen and return can get annoying, especially when a lot of them can turn invisible and block your path/surprise attack you.","December 22, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is very little in the way of directions or guidance but such instructions are unnecessary except for the little tips on controls you can find by pressing the ESC key. In order to make it windowed, press ENTER.  moves with WASD keys, attack with mouse, special attack with SPACE, hold down mouse to block. Simple.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what my purpose in the game is other than killing enemies and defeating dungeons in different areas that are designed around a certain color palette and elemental theme (forest, jungle, nether, ice, desert, etc.). Thankfully there are no puzzles in this game when it comes to progressing forward in the dungeons, you just have to hit every button you find, pick up the keys, unlock the doors, and keep moving.\n\nMy first run through I got to level 3 before dying. Second time was similar, as was the third and fourth time. The fifth time, however, I got through the game once and then died at Lvl 83. As you can see, it's very easy to master and the only thing stopping you from progressing is failing to pick up stronger gear that are color-coded for your convenience in regards to overall rarity and strength. White -> Blue -> Green -> Purple -> Orange -> Red. Funnily enough, White, Blue and Purple were the most commonly found in my fifth playthrough, while Green was just as rare to find as Red. Funny, eh.\n\nBonfires are spread throughout the lands and offer both a full restoration of health and a quick look at your stats. They have unlimited uses, which is awesome. Another thing to mention is that you will not lose all your accumulated moolah when you die as long as you don't delete your save. You do start from the beginning at Lvl. 1 with no armor or weapons, but you are seamlessly reintroduced to the beginning with some weapons being located right next to your respawn point, which allows you to get back into the action.\n\nThe bosses were fairly easy for me: Just get up close and keep wailing on them. As soon as I found a strong enough 2-Handed Axe, Hammer, or Sword I abandoned the shield in favor of pure power. I also avoided magic staffs and bows because they take up much more stamina/magic than simply swinging a sword, even if you have to get up close and personal with enemies. It's much like Hotline Miami where foes don't bother you if you just get in there quick and hit them before they hit you. They're also scaled to your level so you won't encounter the problem where you're getting barely anything for experience when you kill an enemy that you first met at the beginning of the game; everything is still a threat but much less so if you paid mind to upgrade your gear.\n\nIt's very fun and the achievements are very easy to get; in theory you could get them all in one persistent playthrough.","February 3","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This, combined with the first flaw, produce frustrating results, I lost a good weapon because I accidently picked up a different one without noticing and left the room, leaving me to my doom.

A game that seems like it is meant to feel big, but does not deliver in what it wishes to portray. You play as a dungeon crawler who, I presume, is trying to get the soul of a woman back to her body(?). I did not complete this so it's all off of what I believe the game wanted me to do. it's much like any other dungeon crawling game. Enemies! Weapons! Magic! Bosses! And where there is an over saturated market, there is a demand for uniqueness, and this game simply doesn't give the player that, not even for 5 bucks.\n\nThe weapons become recycled as well as the magic(which is rarely as useful as the melee weapons so no use in character differentating), there's only 4 different landscapes to explore so the enemies in these places become very boring, almost irritating, to look at. The combat system is not even a system you dont even have to press a button if you dont want to, just run into enemies and it hits them for you. Never a fan of that really. Finally, the bosses. the "bosses".  Every single boss operates the exact. same. way. Nothing different! No twists! No critical, fast paced moment of "oh â¥â¥â¥â¥! How will I get around this?" Just hit hit hit dead treasure chest great. What is any great dungeon crawler without unique, interesting, totally terrifying bosses?\n\nTo make a long review short, there are MUCH better games in the genre that are much more worth your 5 dollars.","July 1, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the controls will lock up when the randomized loot is generating), but overall the bugs do not ruin the experience.\n\nGear is also nearly 100% random, with the only exceptions being certain basic gear vendors, so planning to level up your character a certain way from the beginning may ultimately cause more harm than good depending on the RNG.\n\nFor your first few attempts, try to be fluid in your character build, trying out all of the different weapon types and deciding on your preferred playstyle, then attempt a true build once you understand how the character building works.\n\n::FROM THIS POINT ON I WILL BE WRITING A SHORT PRIMER ON CHARCTER BUILDING. FEEL FREE TO STOP READING IF YOU PREFER TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT ON YOUR OWN::\n\nThe character building is surprisingly deep, despite the simplicity of this game.\n\nLike in the original Grandia, each weapon type is linked to two or more stats(daggers are dexterity weapons, great axes are strength weapons, staves are intelligence weapons, etc), so if you level up while using a weapon with a particular stat focus, then your character will gain additional points to that stat(all weapon types increase constitution as well).\n\nThe Souls games influence much of bit Dungeon 2, but in terms of character building, the Souls series influence is apparent in the weapon damage scaling.\n\nWeapon damage is improved based on the stats that are attributed to it(these appear on the bottom of each weapon's stat description, annotated with an asterisk*), so a weak dexterity weapon like a dagger will generally be far more effective on a character with high dexterity than a much stronger weapon that does not use dexterity to scale its damage.\n\nOf course, you can find an off build weapon that is powerful enough to outclass build centric weapons, but these should be avoided during early leveling if you have already increased a particular stat upwards of 50 points, since focussing on a new stat after that much investment may impede your character's growth, and keep them from getting strong enough to stay competitive as enemies get stronger.\n\nFinal note: Every enemy in the game scales with your character's level, and you can level your character well beyond level 100.","May 3","true","12.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Depending on how what weapon you hold when you level up, you will increase in the relevant stat. E.g. Axe is for Strength and Constitution, like a Barbarian. Staff is for Intelligence, like a Mage. Daggers are for Dexterity, like a Rogue.\n\nI'm giving it a pass because it's cheap on Bundlestars. $3.99 when I bought it.

Pretty much like what I just said above.  You'll explore a randomly generated map, happen upon dungeons to be solved and bosses therein to slay. For those that played Super Metroid on the SNES back in the day, and remember how defeating bosses are like keys in a lock to a door to a final area, you will find that homage here.  The game has a great rate of progression. Greedy loot based gamers, those that enjoy Diablo, will enjoy this game very much.\n\nPros:\nRogue-like risk vs. reward gameplay.\nRetro graphics, but not too retro as to cause your eyes to bleed. The sprites are done beautifully, Zelda SNES style.\nAwesome Chiptunes music. Very entertaining videogame/chiptunes style music. I turned off my own music just to enjoy it.\nTiered loot system. Mimics MMO's and ARPG's with its loot system. I.E. "Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic"\nLots of Character/Gear Stats that can be influenced by your gear and by powerups you find in game. Allowing you to build your character the way you want (Dark Souls style)\nNew Game+. The game instantly starts over on harder difficulties with scaling gear drops each time you beat it.\nGreat variety in items and gameplay.  The pacing and progression allow enjoyment in the face of repeating the game.\nCons:\nControl issues. Controls can seem to get hung up or glitch out every now and then. And directions aren't all that clear for such simple controls.\nInventory management.  I feel like a few slots of inventory should be allowed. And again, the controls with the inventory can cause issues mid combat as you accidently pick up a weapon when you were trying to block.\nLack of information. Stats aren't explained. Unique stats aren't explained.\nLack of abilities. You can attack with melee, or ranged. That's it. No special spells. No utility items.\nBoss fights. They are alllllll the same. Except for maybe the final boss.\n\nSummary:\nBit Dungeon II is great if you just want a game to jump into without any wait time, and want instant gratification.  You'll have a few rounds of learning how the game works, and its mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy to just keep playing.  Seeing the influences of old great games from SNES days mixed in with influences from legendary games like the Dark Souls series is awesome. It doesn't try to hide it, and it embraces something great. The devs need to worry about adding some features for long-term play like adding unique abilities or spells, otherwise combat will get old.  And for crying out loud, tell me what my stats mean. What does this epic weapon with a special attribute do? Anyways.  A great indie-retro game.  The result of someone taking a few great ideas, not complicating the project, and refining it into something many gamers can enjoy.\n\nHighly recommended.","September 21, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is fast-paced, unforgiving and random. You may become filthy rich and powerfull in 1 second and then, lose it all in another second. Explore the dungeons, look for more powerfull items, artefacts, weapons, solve puzzles, defeat bosses. It's pretty fun.\n\nIf you are into randomly generated levels and games like "Hammerwatch" and "The Binding of Issac", you are going to love this one. I'd say it's a solid 8/10 and I do recommend it.","September 20, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can beat it in two hours or less if you're not dum dum like me and *SPOILERS* you don't waste your ghost spirit while trying out the controls  *END OF SPOILERS*.\nBut if you are not an achievement maniac like me, then even while being a dum dum, you can beat it in 2 hours. When I understood that mashing space is your key to victory, everything became so easy...  I killed the last boss in 2-3s. Which is awkward and I hope devs will fix all this.\nPros:\n- Zelda-like game with the elements of rogue-like games.\n- Several weapon types with lots of different stats, which do something and you kinda can see that with random numbers appearing.\n- No complex controls.\n- Awesome boss music.\nCons:\n- No map. I mean there is a mini-map, but the world is way bigger than that and it becomes hard to know where to go next.\n- Lots of different stats, but there are no explanations. So you don't know whether to get a weapon/armor or not.\n- Some mobs like knights are a huge pain in the â¥â¥â¥. They are harder than bosses. I hate them.\n- Damage between monsters varies too much - from scratching to "omg where did my half of hp go?".\n\nTo summarise, this game can be fun for those few hours and for 5 euros it is really worth it.","September 20, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not bad.\nbit Dungeon II was worth the playthrough. The game had a simple combat system, that let you focus on exploring the bitland world and finding cool loot along the way. The different classes have simple abilities that you change based on your weapon. The rpg based stats determine how much damage you do with each weapon, and how much of a special attribute such as crit you obtain. I enjoyed the layout of the map, and the set up of the bosses. Dungeons made me think a little bit with their mazelike nature. Zzzzzzzz. The bosses. Zzzzzz. The bosses really weren't very interesting. The creeps along the way to the bosses are, with some of them appearing out of nowhere or shooting magic missles. Most bosses are defeated just by dodging during the missle cycle, then mashing spacebar while they aren't attacking. My Dex playthrough proved to be WAAY too easy once I obtained the bow and arrow. The first runthrough can be completed in about an 2 hours if run perfectly. There are lots of little secrets to how the game works, that should be found out on your own, but the puzzles are infuriating, so I'd like to offer a tip IF YOU WANT IT.  The mazes can be solved by finding a wisened man or elf who tells you the way, but funfact, just go where there isn't a pillar. That usually solves the puzzle.  Overall the game was pretty decent. This game has replayability if you get really into it, but I was content with being done after the first playthough. Pick this game up on sale. IF not, be understanding with the short runtime. This adventure has very little story, but definitley has feeling. I enjoyed my playthrough, but will likely never play the game again.\n\n~Zee","April 18","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no tutorial to tell you what to do and many people would be irritated with that fact, I actually liked journeying throughout the world trying to figure out what to do. I've gotten to what I assume is the final boss a couple times. The difficulty really depends on what drops you get because the game at its heart is a Rogue-Lite Dungeon RPG. You progress from dungeon to dungeon and fight each boss until you can get to the Final Dungeon. Sometimes you will have good runs and sometimes you will have bad runs.\n\nThe game is a little buggy but it seems that a lot of the bugs I use to experience have been patched in the past few months and that pleases me a lot to see a developer patch and support their game post release on Steam, because all too often I see games that could be very good just left as abandonware on Steam.\n\nbit Dungeon II will remain a game that I will play periodically because of how enjoyable it is.

If you're familiar at all with min/maxing for DPS and high-drain, the learning curve will be practically non-existent.\n- You can do a complete run-through in about an hour, if you're about your business and the RNG gods smile upon you (i.e. you get the drops you need when you need them).\n- The simple scenario design and the settings are excellent: just really, really good art design and direction throughout. I enjoyed every environment in this game, which...I mean, that's saying a lot.\n\nHere are three things that I didn't like:\n\n- The sound design is garbage: from the idiotic, try-hard EBM chip-tunes to the arbitrary compression and processing on the blips and bloops (seriously: if you worked sound design on this game, you are definitely doing it wrong: play a Jun Fukuda game and try to learn something), I'd say the whole thing is pretty much a tear-down. There are no redeeming aspects to this game's sound design. I hope someone reads that and it hurts their feelings.\n- A little more variety in the main character's gear would have gone a long way: the hats are cool, but all other armor looks the same (all boots, for example, are just color-swaps with all other boots).\n- I played the game on my Xbone gamepad. Generally, the experience was flawless, except for the bits where I had to navigate menus, e.g. the start and pause menus. I kept doing stuff I didn't want to do because of bad layout or unclear button functions and that could probably use a little clean-up.\n\ntl;dr Definitely play this game: you will have an awesome time.","March 10","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat system is simple (as in walk in to someone and mash the space bar or left click), but some fight will need to be thought out a bit, like my favourite boss, Leontocephaline. This is boss in so definitely not enfuriating that you can't kill him before he does his very underpowered move where he fires a laser that kills you in a couple of seconds. Other than him, all the bosses don't feel too strong and overpowered and the loot that you get in the chest after them will always be decent. It can be a little boring when you get a strong weapon at a low level, but that doesn't happen very often.\n\nIn my opion, the only bad thing about the game is that you can't expand the map at all, but I would expect that to be added in eventually.\n\n\nAchievements\nI am a reliable source because I 100% complete the game, which to be completely honest, isn't too hard. 12/15 of the achievements you will get by just killing the final boss and the other 3 are kind of easy to get. You should atempt the dying achievement as soon as you start so that you don't have to end a good run later on. Finding an epic quality weapon should just happen eventually. After killing a boss, you will get a black chest in the next room that guarantees a puple or higher rarity item. After one of the last 2 bosses before the final boss, a red chest will drop that is guaranteed to contain a red item. Remember that epic quality is red and it has to be a weapon. The other achievement makes you kill 100 of the purple dogs that spawn in dungeon rooms that you have cleared. This one will also happen eventually because you will end up going between 2 rooms and killing the Fiends that spawn for health potions.\n\nConclusion\nAn amazing game that deserves the attention of more people. If you're a scrub with a bad PC, I think there is a moblie version that is like a quid or something. Doesn't get repetitive ever and is almost always fair with RNG and enemy spawns.\n\n\n10/10 would get killed by Leontocephaline again.","November 9, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I play it all the time. So when I saw BD2 i had to buy it of course.\nFirst impressions were good. It's not the same as the first game, but still enjoyable and much more varied.\n\nMy first problem is that other then in fortresses, i didn't find a way to regain your health, only by killing the purple demons who appear in rooms you already killed everyone in. If you are just running around outside as you most likely are, there is no way to replenish your health.\n\nAnother problem is that often you manage to click and change your weapon to one that's just laying around without noticing it.\n\n\nThe bigest issue though is that it's buggy.\nOften when you walk around the screen keeps jutting and shaking as you go, and I'm not sure if it's only on my PC or everyone finds this, but often when you pick up a weapon, the associated special attack doesn't work well. (sometimes it works on one screen and stops working on the next)\nThis wouldn't be that big a deal, but I accidentally switched my ice hammer off for an ice cube.\nThe ice cube didn't reside in the weapon slot, but still i couldn't carry it at the same time as I carried my weapon.\n\nSo i accidentally picked up the ice cube that was right next to the door and then left the room... Returning instantly I found my 25+ atk weapon has disappeared, and I was left with an icecube that had NO powers. I couldn'T even get out of the sewers/catacombs under the fortress as I had no means of attacking. This is a huge issue because of course i was forced to let the monsters kill me and go back from lv 19 or 20 to lv 1 and start the game over.\n\n--------\n\nSo can I recommend it?\n\nIt is a really nice looking game if you like the art style. It is in the same style as Bit Dungeon, just way more varied, more in depth and less repetative. It has a nice variety of style through the overall map, and it's procedurally generated meaning you'll have different worlds every time you start a new game.\n\nIt is also kinda buggy, The controls are a bit weird, not very responsive, sometimes I click an enemy to hit it but my guy just walks there, or I am in the middle of a bunch of monsters, my special attack doesn't fire and even if I'm clicking I'm just changing my weapon to the one right next to me and just get mobbed and killed in seconds. Also I found no way to replenish your life outside of fortresses.\n\nHonestly, If I wasn't such a huge fan of Bit Dungeon I probably wouldn't like it that much.\nSo I'll recommend it but only half heartedly. Only buy this if you really really like the style!\n\nIt's been out on steam for over a year now, I hope these bugs will get fixed soon so I could give it a higher score.\n\n----------\nEDIT:\n----------\n\nI have to make a slight edit.\nAfter some more playing, I found that there is a way to heal, by finding campfires. Still the game did not explain this at all so I feel my mistake wasn't that big.\n\nAlso what is a huge no-no in these games, you don't even heal when reaching a new level.","January 15","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game that seems like it is meant to feel big, but does not deliver in what it wishes to portray. You play as a dungeon crawler who, I presume, is trying to get the soul of a woman back to her body(?). I did not complete this so it's all off of what I believe the game wanted me to do. it's much like any other dungeon crawling game. Enemies! Weapons! Magic! Bosses! And where there is an over saturated market, there is a demand for uniqueness, and this game simply doesn't give the player that, not even for 5 bucks.\n\nThe weapons become recycled as well as the magic(which is rarely as useful as the melee weapons so no use in character differentating), there's only 4 different landscapes to explore so the enemies in these places become very boring, almost irritating, to look at. The combat system is not even a system you dont even have to press a button if you dont want to, just run into enemies and it hits them for you. Never a fan of that really. Finally, the bosses. the "bosses".  Every single boss operates the exact. same. way. Nothing different! No twists! No critical, fast paced moment of "oh â¥â¥â¥â¥! How will I get around this?" Just hit hit hit dead treasure chest great. What is any great dungeon crawler without unique, interesting, totally terrifying bosses?\n\nTo make a long review short, there are MUCH better games in the genre that are much more worth your 5 dollars.","July 1, 2015","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really did. But sadly, this game feels more like an early access game. Despite it only being $5 I think that still may be a bit too much considering how unfinished this game seems. Not to mention that it is also a bit buggy.\n\n-The combat system feels rather slow, clunky and can get confusing sometimes depending on the weapon.\n-The different maps are rather small. Sometimes there will be too many enemies spawning at the same area not leaving   much room to be able to see or move.\n-There are also times where I may accidentally end up walking into the next area while in combat because the area is so cluttered with the environment or even enemies.\n-Like I said before the maps feel cluttered.\n-I've found several weapons that are useless with no stats.\n-Boss fights are too easy and feel somewhat meaningless and the enemies tend to get redundant.\n-Sometimes I'll be unable to move or attack an enemy. I'm pretty sure that's a bug.\n-There isn't an options menu.\n-There really isn't much of a story to be explained.\n-The game just plain feels like it's not even complete.\n\nThat's just a fraction of what's wrong with the game. Although, I will say that I do like the soundtrack. Sadly you can barely hear it while in-game and there are no settings to adjust the volume. In fact, there isn't an options menu. You just play the game. If you need to find out what the controls are just press escape(or start on a gamepad) and you'll be presented with a black screen that tells you what keys(or buttons) does what. I did like the concept of the game, though. The execution could've been done much better.\n\nWith this all being said. I will say a few good things.\n-The soundtrack is quite nice.\n-I do like the Zelda-esque design.\n-The pixel graphics are nicely done.\n-Concept of the game was interesting to say at least.\n\nI don't hate the game as it is entertaining to some extent. But I don't really much care for it either.","June 27, 2015","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not bad.\nbit Dungeon II was worth the playthrough. The game had a simple combat system, that let you focus on exploring the bitland world and finding cool loot along the way. The different classes have simple abilities that you change based on your weapon. The rpg based stats determine how much damage you do with each weapon, and how much of a special attribute such as crit you obtain. I enjoyed the layout of the map, and the set up of the bosses. Dungeons made me think a little bit with their mazelike nature. Zzzzzzzz. The bosses. Zzzzzz. The bosses really weren't very interesting. The creeps along the way to the bosses are, with some of them appearing out of nowhere or shooting magic missles. Most bosses are defeated just by dodging during the missle cycle, then mashing spacebar while they aren't attacking. My Dex playthrough proved to be WAAY too easy once I obtained the bow and arrow. The first runthrough can be completed in about an 2 hours if run perfectly. There are lots of little secrets to how the game works, that should be found out on your own, but the puzzles are infuriating, so I'd like to offer a tip IF YOU WANT IT.  The mazes can be solved by finding a wisened man or elf who tells you the way, but funfact, just go where there isn't a pillar. That usually solves the puzzle.  Overall the game was pretty decent. This game has replayability if you get really into it, but I was content with being done after the first playthough. Pick this game up on sale. IF not, be understanding with the short runtime. This adventure has very little story, but definitley has feeling. I enjoyed my playthrough, but will likely never play the game again.\n\n~Zee","April 18","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay needs to be updated tho, it needs more things to do also, the common problems I find are loot disappearing when you leave a room (when you have an item that boosts your run speed you sometimes run out of the room during combat and your dropped loot will be gone), as well as items being too easy to pick up accidently. This, combined with the first flaw, produce frustrating results, I lost a good weapon because I accidently picked up a different one without noticing and left the room, leaving me to my doom. Other than those small issues which im sure will be updated, this game is actually really fun and I highly recommend it for those who love dungeon crawler and 8-bit-ish graphic games like this.","April 6","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the controls will lock up when the randomized loot is generating), but overall the bugs do not ruin the experience.\n\nGear is also nearly 100% random, with the only exceptions being certain basic gear vendors, so planning to level up your character a certain way from the beginning may ultimately cause more harm than good depending on the RNG.\n\nFor your first few attempts, try to be fluid in your character build, trying out all of the different weapon types and deciding on your preferred playstyle, then attempt a true build once you understand how the character building works.\n\n::FROM THIS POINT ON I WILL BE WRITING A SHORT PRIMER ON CHARCTER BUILDING. FEEL FREE TO STOP READING IF YOU PREFER TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT ON YOUR OWN::\n\nThe character building is surprisingly deep, despite the simplicity of this game.\n\nLike in the original Grandia, each weapon type is linked to two or more stats(daggers are dexterity weapons, great axes are strength weapons, staves are intelligence weapons, etc), so if you level up while using a weapon with a particular stat focus, then your character will gain additional points to that stat(all weapon types increase constitution as well).\n\nThe Souls games influence much of bit Dungeon 2, but in terms of character building, the Souls series influence is apparent in the weapon damage scaling.\n\nWeapon damage is improved based on the stats that are attributed to it(these appear on the bottom of each weapon's stat description, annotated with an asterisk*), so a weak dexterity weapon like a dagger will generally be far more effective on a character with high dexterity than a much stronger weapon that does not use dexterity to scale its damage.\n\nOf course, you can find an off build weapon that is powerful enough to outclass build centric weapons, but these should be avoided during early leveling if you have already increased a particular stat upwards of 50 points, since focussing on a new stat after that much investment may impede your character's growth, and keep them from getting strong enough to stay competitive as enemies get stronger.\n\nFinal note: Every enemy in the game scales with your character's level, and you can level your character well beyond level 100.","May 3","true","12.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Your progress only shown on a minimap, so a mental map is pretty much needed for navigating through the maze-like world. Creature variation is good enough. They mostly behave the same way, but there a few special units needing different approach.\nThe gameplay/combat however is so simple, that there is no real way of being good at this game. There are a few actions aside from walking into enemies and auto-attack them, but in a rogue-like where you can die and lose almost everything there is not enough control. Boss fights are poorly developed. You just have to have proper gear and basically run into them until the special attack kicks in and the boss dies.\nEnemies level up with you (at least that is what i think anyway) so there is no reason to grind for xp. Items can be collected, these are the things which can make a difference, but drops are extremely random (after i died the first time on level 43 i found a legendary lvl17 staff in the open after a few minutes at level 6, the best weapon since I played the game). There are rooms scathered in the world where you can pick a stat bonus for yourself, when you level up you gain stats automatically. Black coins can be gathered from chests and fallen foes, which can be carried over through "incarnations". I recently found a room with epic chests which can be opened via coins. There are also lesser starter items available in these "shops" available on the cheap.\n\nOverall, bit Dungeon II is an enjoyable title for a few hours, worth a try if you already have it, but it cannot be taken seriously in the end due to its random nature. This is one of those (nowadays pretty frequent) occasions where features were so simplified that in the end it hurts the game itself. I would say the game is too casual, does not build upon skill, still it punishes you for being "bad" at it.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 6.0/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nGameplay: 5/10\nSound: 6/10\nReplay Value: 6/10","May 8","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
