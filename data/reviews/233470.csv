Perhaps that is the point? Evoland feels fun at times, of course it does. It lives off your nostalgia, being the sole reason you should play it  but more often than not it simply name checks. It strives to imitate the plus points of the great games but fails to evolve as one itself.\n\nEvoland is a good game to journey through and revisit memories if you get it for less than five dollars.

The first half of the game is all about unlocking more and more features, which is implemented very well, and would have made a great game if they'd stuck with it. But as soon as you unlock "3D" the game just becomes alternately a bad zelda clone and a bad FF clone. The concept of "unlocks" goes out the window, in favor of "whatever gimick we feel like giving you for a short while, then taking away".\n\nThe puzzles requiring you to switch between different "eras" are briliant. Pity that this idea was so sparingly and arbitrarily applied.\n\nBottom line: A great set of ideas looking for a better game.","November 26, 2013","false","3.6"," 417 of 557 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","417","557","0","8"

There's even a Diablo level thrown in for good measure. Evoland is quite literally a walk through RPG history, starting with black and white 8-bit and ending with 6th gen level graphics. Nintendo's infamous "rule of 3" is in abundance, as are the frequent turn based FF/DQ battles. The game has a few bugs, and hit detection on some things is a bit off in the Zelda segments, but it's hardly game breaking. I have to stress that the game is short and has little to no replay value, but it's still well worth it for fans of the old school.","June 23, 2013","true","4.5"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","68","77","0","0"

As you continue through the game, you'll unlock new mechanics and new graphic modes which resemble the next step in the genre's evolution - hence the name "Evoland".

Yet, that's what I experienced with Evoland, an RPG that bills itself as a "journey through the history of action/adventure gaming".\n\nEvoland exists more as unrealized potential than as a genuinely good RPG. The gameplay/story elements it gets right are amazing, but it also has many problems that keep it from being a standout in the genre.\n\nThe game itself takes heavy influences from the Final Fantasy games. You start out as an random knight in a forest, quickly gaining the ability to do basic things like walk in different directions, fight enemies and learn more about the plot (which is only there for the sake of an achievement joke). From there, you meet a young girl who aids you in your journey and you both set off to defeat the evil lord who's trying to take over the world. Pretty standard stuff.\n\nMore than anything else in the game, the plot (and by proxy, the introduction and jokes about various RPG concepts) is really only good for the first hour. Many of the gameplay elements fall apart the further you go into the game.\n\nChief among them is the random battle system. Not only is it incredibly annoying (you get attacked every few steps on the world map), but there's no real purpose for any of it. You can attack or heal, and you gain levels that give you more HP or magic power, but this doesn't translate to the rest of the game. There are three distinct battle systems - the standard RPG turn-based system, a Torchlight-inspired hack-n-slash with a health globe, and a Zelda-esque dungeon mode with heart containers. None of these systems have anything to do with each other, and there's no point grinding in the overworld.\n\nThe same goes for the collectibles you find. There are gamecards (based off Triple Triad/Triad Master from Final Fantasy) that are scattered throughout the world, but their purpose is never clear until halfway through, and playing games with them is pointless. There's a powerful magic attack that unlocks after a boss battle, but you have to wait a very, very long time to use it, and its only use is to kill trash mobs. You get a bunch of items dumped on you during the hack-n-slash dungeon, but most of them don't do anything at all, and the minimap you gain in said dungeon doesn't even work half the time.\n\nIt's frustrating, because when the game is firing on all cylinders, it's a wonderful experience. There was a moment where I was trying to figure out a puzzle in a forest, seamlessly switching between 2D Zelda-style graphics and a full 3D realization of the same forest, and marveling in awe at how fluid the transition was. Likewise, there are some amusing jokes and throwbacks to games like Final Fantasy VII and VIII that had me smirking as I played.\n\nThe best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you find a new chest, and open it for a random surprise. This runs the gamut from increased graphics to gameplay changes, new weapons and more. It's that sense of pursuit for the next unlock that drives my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also enjoyable, and the constant belittling of the main characters by NPCs is quite amusing, especially when you can't speak to adults in the early game until you eat a magical seed that inexplicably causes you to age a decade and become an adult.\n\nIn the end, I felt that Evoland was a great experience in spite of the problems associated with it, and I'm excited to see what the developers will bring to the table for the sequel (also available on Steam). The evolving gameplay and charming characterization is what sets this apart from a lot of other RPGs.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, if only for the first hour.\n\nFor more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!","September 17, 2015","true","2.7"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","54","60","3","1"

A nostolgia trip that takes you through the best of top down adventure, RPG and turn based battles. What is actually here is a brief parody game poking fun at itself and tropes across two decades of game genres and technological advances.\n\nTo my dismay, Evoland bluntly tells you, you're in this era of RPGs. I guess its meant for comedy, but I just didn't care for it. You'll unlock different eras of games and different technologies, such as sound effects, music, 16 bit graphics, high definition textures, 3D battle systems and so on. Its all part of the joke. You'll see all the stereotypes and tropes here and the game will be quick to point them out to you so that you'll understand its a joke.\n\nEvoland has great graphics, and some gameplay elements that would make for a great game. This feels like a good tech demo since every era is so brief with no depth. I can understand paying $5 if they use this engine to make a real full fledged game, but you'll breeze through this game with no challenge. I would say its the perfect game for kids, but with so much hinging on nostalgia, kids might not understand.\n\nYou'll play in top down Zelda segments, using a sword to cut down grass, bombs to blow up walls and arrows to transfer fire between lit and unlit candles. Eventually that top down will turn into a 3D version of itself which you can switch between using crystals. Its a nice system that I would have liked to see a lot more of if not be its own game. There are Final Fantasy 2 style towns, random battles and turn based combat, but there is no depth to combat. Its all turn based fighting where your main character has no skills. The secondary character has spells, but nothing lost for using the spells like a traditional turn based RPG would have. Eventually the old school RPG updates itself to be 3D later on in the game.\n\nEventually, you'll find a Final Fantasy 8 style town. After that you'll find a Diablo styled dungeon with gold, health orbs and loot dropping on the ground for you to collect. It felt like a button mashing chore to get through it. Nothing intelligent to the gameplay, just button mashing.\n\nIn the game you'll collect gold, cards and stars, but other than that, there's not much going on. There is little need for gold since there is barely anything to buy. The stars just go to an achievement. The cards lead to a Final Fantasy 8 inspired mini game that is nice to play where your cards have numbers on each of the four sides of the cards and you lay them down in a grid of 3 by 3 to determine who has the most cards once you've thrown down. It is a great feature to have and they went the extra mile to include it.\n\nWith that said, the game just feels so hollow, all style, no substance. There is no storyline twist, such as an evil wizard devolves the land once you've easily breezed through the evolutionary eras. I knew how far I had progressed based on what evolutionary stage I was on. It just felt disappointing. Since there is no depth, the combat is really just tedium if not button mashing. The focus was on making the game feel like the other games we know and love.\n\nAs a comedy game it missed its mark with me in the 3 hours it took to complete it. There were definitely highs and boring lows. If it was more difficult the game wouldn't be fun after the laughs wear off. I've gone through it twice now and disliked it more the second time.","March 27, 2014","false","8.5"," 186 of 264 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","186","264","0","8"

Obviously influenced by The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Diablo, there's a lot to love in this indie gem. You'll traverse the annals of video game history as you move from early 8-bit games through 16-bit and 3D, gaining little bonuses along the way that poke fun at RPG stereotypes. I smiled on more than one occasion at the humor in the game, and I was always looking forward to the next technological progression of my character.\n\nIn a way, Evoland presents as a haphazard combination of themes. On the one hand, you have the excellent unlockable tributes to video game history. You unlock the ability to enter houses, you gain the ability to fight, and you'll be able to fight random enemies. All good, and all evenly and comically presented. However, the game eventually becomes a casual RPG with a light story that features frequent testaments to the major moments in RPG classics. While it is a little jarring to have your little world suddenly begin to be fleshed out, it makes sense mechanically and keeps the game moving.\n\nAs you journey on through this adventure, you'll play a collectible card game, solve Zelda-style puzzles, find optional collectible items, and enjoy many different modes of play. Evoland is something special, and anyone who looks upon the roots of RPGs fondly will enjoy this nostalgic love letter.","December 28, 2013","true","5.1"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","67","84","0","3"

What it turned out to be was a short, extremely underwhelming mishmash of classic games, dumbed down to the point where all of the enjoyment of the originals is gone.\n\nHow can one make a game that is part Zelda, part Final Fantasy, and part Diablo that sucks? Well, take 5 minutes worth of Zelda gameplay, make the controls slightly less responsive, and stretch it out for 30 minutes. Final Fantasy? Have 3 - and only 3 - different types of enemies that require the same amount of attacks to kill whether you're at level 1 or 5. And imagine Diablo with no difficulty and pointless item drops.\n\nThe whole game is an exercise in redundancy, filled with stolen famous one-liners from games we love, only to be regurgitated out of the context that made them memorable in the first place. Had the game been much, much longer, with more variation in enemies, items, and, well, basic gameplay, Evoland could have done well.","September 26, 2014","false","2.1"," 119 of 167 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","119","167","8","0"

But that doesn't mean it was bad. On the contrary, it was, for the most part, pretty enjoyable. Evoland shows the history of game design (limited exclusively to adventure games) from it's very beginnings, but disappointingly stops short of modern day. This made the game surprisingly short, but they weren't kidding when they said 'A Short Story'. My major gripe with it, is that it's not the evolution of adventure games as much as it is 'The Evolution of The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy Games'. There's obviously more to adventure than that, and even though those two are both superb series in themselves, the spotlight could have been cast to others. And the fact that those two games are featured so predominately kind of makes the slight reference to Skyrim and League of Legends seem out of place.\n\nBut aside from the limited scope, that limited scope is done fantastically. Since this is a game about gameplay evolution, new mechanics and features are introduced constantly. But their introduced so seamlessly that it feels natural. You never have to take a pause to read instructions or do a tutorial, you just get it. That's where the game shines. It sets out to show gameplay evolution, and that's what it does. If you're an veteran of video games, you'll enjoy being able to relive some past experiences that you just don't get in AAA titles today. But, if you're a veteran gamer, then you'll be annoyed at some just as you smile at others.\n\nWant to continue reading for a more in depth review?

With good intentions, it pays homage to the evolution of the video game industry by allowing the player to travel through iconic RPG of the past. However, behind the cute references, Evoland is severely lacking in content.\n\nGameplayThe majority of the advertised unlockable features (improved graphics, sound, or combat) happen at the beginning of the game. After that, the player is forced to battle through ♥♥♥♥♥♥ renditions of Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, or Diablo. 95% of the items you encounter are completely useless and combat boils down to two commands: "attack" or "heal". To boot, the level-up and currency system does nothing (read: nothing), making the random encounters both intrusive and useless.\n\nVerdictWith some fumbling around, I was able to personally discover / beat all the content to the game in a measly three hours, including the main story and all secret unlockables.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/233470/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Evoland is an Action RPG that takes the player through the history of gaming in a thoroughly humorous and nostalgic experience. Unlike most RPGs, the game is focused less on character development and leveling up and more as a humorous experience designed to bring a smile to the faces of veteran players as they progress through the various ages of the RPG, taking in the sights and bringing up fond memories. Packed to the brim with endless references, it’s clear from the start that Evoland was made with the utmost love for games of time gone by and provides an authentic experience throughout.\n\nEvoland is a game with a lot of charm, not least due to its sincere parodies of aspects such as the linearity of open world games like Final Fantasy, complete with a suspiciously named substitute called “Kaeris”, who specializes in magic asks our hero (and the player) politely to help her save her town.  Of course the player is forced to agree as to set into motion the events of the game. The humor makes sure that the player knows that this is clearly a game made from the heart and not once do the references feel forced or contrived. What will appeal most to gamers are the faithful replications of games like Final Fantasy and Zelda. Beginning the game with nothing more than the ability to move right and with Gameboy era graphics, the player soon, “unlocks” features such as SFX, 3D graphics and HD textures which are used uniquely as an aspect of the gameplay, becoming more advanced as the player progresses through the game. It’s hard not to raise a smile when switching from 2D to 3D within a matter of seconds and such use of visuals and sound is nothing if not innovative, helping to immerse the player into a game that reads like a history book of the gaming industry.\n\nThat’s not to say that the game is perfect by any means, as there are several flaws that stick out as surprising, considering the obvious care to detail within the game. Factors like the lack of a sprint unlock came as a surprise considering just how expected it is in line with the other unlocks, and in certain parts of the game, it comes across as a very much needed feature which lack of inclusion can only serve to puzzle players. The switch to Diablo-like gameplay for a dungeon is very much less polished than the rest of the game and it’s not rare to find yourself shouting out in frustration as you try to adapt to gameplay so clearly not replicated to the high standards of the battle systems for the Final Fantasy and Zelda sections. That’s not to say it’s bad by any means, but the high standards laid down previously by the game serve only to emphasize just how annoying it is to have to deal with the clunky controls that are introduced and the dungeon will have players pulling their hair out in frustration as they die many a death trying to come to terms with the controls.\n\nThe balance of the game also works against it as the various unlocks, arguably the most intriguing parts of the game, are largely completed within the first third. It’s hard not to feel that they should’ve been spread out further throughout the game, as you find yourself wanting to spend more time immersed within the 2D world, which is soon eliminated to make way for 3D, proceeding to make up the bulk of the rest of the game. That’s not to say the 3D sections are any less impressive, it’s just the enjoyment of the game as an interactive history of gaming is over all too quickly and leaves the player crying out for more. Such weighting to the first third of the game can also be seen in its references, which gradually decrease as the game goes on. Early in the game everything the player interacts with has a witty remark or object leading to several genuine laugh out loud moments whereas the latter stages lack interactivity leading to a loss in the charm that the game possesses as the game becomes an almost straightforward RPG.\n\nEvoland is a unique game in that it’s impressive to see the scale of references and care to detail that is present within it. Despite several surprising flaws, it’s not often in a game where one can relive some of the greatest game-playing experiences from Final Fantasy and Zelda in a couple of hours and the combination of the two games is almost seamless in their execution. Nothing less than a love letter to the games of yesteryear, Evoland will delight players both old and new as it takes them on a journey of nostalgia through a loving send up of the best games of years past.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","23.6"," 43 of 62 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","43","62","0","0"

It has a LOT of problems. But overall I feel as a concept it does work well and did educate me into the story of RPG games.\n\nI will start by explaining all the problems I found with the game.\n\nCombat This is probably the biggest problem and will put the most people off buying the game. The combat is incredibly boring. In evoland you have 2 different combat styles. Turn based or normal 8 directional combat. The turn based combat is basically like in games like pokemon except with absolutely no depth to it. By the end of the game you only have the choice of 2 different attacks and a heal ability. The attacks don't do any kind of special effects. Each enemy only has one attack and they don't do any kind of special effects. Then the other combat system is just as boring. It basically consists of spamming the attack button and that is it. You have 1 combo that gets activated also by spamming the attack button but that's it. You also have the choice of using a bow and bombs later in the game but you probably won't be using these. Overall the combat is just not fun in the least.\n\nRandom encounters There are sections of the world that when you explore you get random enemy encounters. Again similar to pokemon when you are exploring in grass. These sections are very common and will probably be where you spend the majority of the game. The problem is that you get way too many of these random encounters. You probably get them once every 10 or so steps. Attached to these random encounters is the incredibly boring turn based combat. I found myself extremely angry with the game all while exploring these sections.\n\nStory There is a kinda very lackluster story. It won't catch your attention at all really. The story is basically that you are rescueing a village from an evil attacking it. But the game's main focus isn't really in the story.\n\nLength I completed the entire game in just over 3 hours. Not incredibly long really. I would have liked more. It just seems to be over when you are just starting to get into it!\n\nCheckpoints Very bad placement of checkpoints. The final boss fight is the worst example of this. The checkpoint is placed just before the cutscene with talking to the boss meaning that everytime you die you get the experience of listening to what has to say all over again. Oh how fun! It took me a lot of tries to complete the boss so this annoyed me a lot! Another example is when exploring the dungeons. So when you die all your progress saves ,like enemies dead and doors opened, but you are spawned at the beginning of the dungeon. Why? I have no idea. It just seems like making you do meaningless exploring all over again. And the dungeons are fairly large. On top of all this the game takes you to the main menu everytime you die. There is no reason for a game to have to do this!\n\nBut this game does have some merit despite all these annoying issues.\n\nConcept So the concept of evoland is to show the progression of RPG's over time. This includes every element annoying as it may be. This is one thing that it does well. I learned a lot during this. The game evolves as you play. You pick up chests that progress the game through the eras. It gives a great oversight. This is probably the reason that I managed to continue playing despite all the issues and just about redeems the game.\n\nSoundtrack There aren't too many songs in evolands soundtrack but what it does have is good. I love the main menu music in particular. They even have different styles of the same songs such as 16-bit or modern RPG style. The only is that since there are few tracks it can get a bit repetitive after some time.\n\nSo if you think you are ok to put up with all the annoying issues of evoland then go ahead and buy it. You will find a game that does actually teach you a lot about the progression of RPG's. If not then you may be best with picking up evoland 2 instead which seems to be a great improvement from this. I am currently beginning to play through that myself and will have a review coming in the coming weeks. It doesn't follow on from evoland 1 either so your fine with skipping it.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","August 31, 2015","true","4.5"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","26","34","2","2"

Evoland puts you on a quest to save Evoland and you along the way you unlock tons of stuff by opening chests, it can be higher quality soundtrac, the key to move left, 3D graphics, pixelated textures, you name it, it can be pretty much anything a game needs in order to be a game, if that makes any sense whatsoever. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is amazing, specially the turn based battle theme along with the victory theme which remind me alot of Final Fantasy VII. Let's be real though, the combat is pretty clunky and you might get annoyed due to the fact that when you're travelling you get a battle every 5 seconds. Evoland is not a really good game the way I see it but the way it was executed based on the "unlocking stuff mechanic" (excuse me for my english) and the nostalgia that it brought to me I think that's all it needs to redeem itself and be worth the time to play it, it's a fairly short game, 3-4 hours. That said, if you're a fan of RPGs and have been playing those for a few years you should totally play Evoland, you might like it and you may not still, I think it's worth the risk.","December 7, 2013","true","3.0"," 36 of 52 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","36","52","0","0"

One of those games I didn’t put down until I was finished.\n\nSo before I actually get to the game stuff, I want to point out a couple of things.\nThe first being that this game seems like it’s a lot better when played with controller. After playing for a short while I tried to use mine and it didn’t work. I had to fiddle around with the files to actually get it to work. Which was mildly annoying and brings me to the second thing. After I fiddled around with the files to make it compatible, the Steam overlay stopped working. Which meant that Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time (hence the pathetic 39 minutes) and I could no longer take screenshots. Which I would of liked to have been able to do.\nEither way, I reversed what I did in the files after I finished the game to take a “100% yay me I did something pretty pointless” screenshot. So I’m fairly happy.\n\nGetting back to the game, I thought it was a lot of fun.\n\nI was pretty impressed with the whole aspect of the game’s graphics and features evolving as you played, it gave the game something quite unique about it yet they still managed to keep the story interesting enough that I didn’t just feel like I was just getting a history lesson.\n\nThe humour was quite good, the text seemed rather sarky at times and us Brits love a bit of sarky. There is a lot of game references involved in this game and it made it all the more charming for me on top of everything else it has.\n\nI think I was expecting this game to be shorter than it was. I’m not 100% sure on how long I actually played it seeing as Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time. But I feel like I got a good while out of it. So it’s always nice for a game to feel like it lasted.\n\nAfter I finished the main game I continued playing for achievement purposes. After what felt like a few extra hours, I managed to find and do everything for the 100%. I would say it’s a very easy one to perfect so no worries achievement hunters!\n\nAll in all I really liked this game, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that has a slight love for these style games or even just gaming in general. I’m not really sure what the label is for them, but the “handheld Pokémon-style RPG games” is what I’m going to go with.\nIt was a fun adventure game and I look forward to trying the sequel.\n\n\nTL;DR : Although might need tampering with to get a controller to work, this game is a lot of fun. It has great graphics, of which evolve throughout you playing, a decent story, a lot of game references, sarcasm and charm. I would say this is definitely worth a go. Especially if you like this genre of game.\nIt’s a fun little game to play through and an easy 100%.\n","September 7, 2015","true","0.7"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","25","34","4","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/233470/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1455 products in account","Evoland is as much a small parody as it is a game of it's own. It borrows heavily from other RPG games and classics (such as Final fantasy and Zelda), meaning mostly that it mocks them in that loving parody way. The game story is pretty... simple. Big evil destroying world, you must go and defeat it. Along the way, you evolve... not in power, though you do get to level up.\n\nThe selling point of Evoland is the "RPG through the ages" bits. You start off as a pixelated character in a plain world with no enemies, and as you find chests, you start earning things. Such as enemies, the ability to level up, town citizens, pixels, and yes, 3D with nothing, then textures, and finally HD definitions. Combat is both action based and turn based; during world map encounters you will have turns, and during dungeons you will be fighting real time.\n\nThe game also has one card minigame for your enjoyment. While the story is nothing to call home about, the evolving aspect of the game is fun. The graphics, even when you're just playing your pixel form, are really quite cute and very well done. The world is nice too, although the puzzles/level design/secrets are not really too difficult and everything was far too visible. I don't think they were meant to be difficult, though. The music I was not a fan of, however, it evolves as you do as well and seems to match the game perfectly, so thumbs up on that. The story is also very short and the replay value is really null unless you want to go back and do 100% achievements (which are also not terribly hard to get, but I frankly couldn't be bothered to go search for them).\n\nThe parody aspect also makes it fun if you love these type of games and have a good sense of humor (see quote above and on image below for an idea of the type of humor). Actually, this was the one thing that made me rate it so high - I had great fun discovering all the chests that made the land evolve and gave me things that had funny captions, or talking to townies and seeing what they would say.\nI do have to say though, the battles do get a bit annoying after a while, and once you've unlocked everything and seen all the world has to offer, there's really little reason to keep playing, too.\n\nThere's not much else to say about this game.\nDid I have fun? Yes! Exploring was fun, fighting was meh (there's really not much you can do, just attack and heal). I will full on admit I quit halfway through the last boss not so much out of frustration, but because there was really little else to do but beat him.\nDoes it get boring if you take it seriously? Also yes. Don't even bother grinding your levels, it will not make a difference.\nIs it worth full price? Don't think so.\n\nFinally, if you like this type of game and get it on sale, it might be a fun little game to spend some time on for a funny, nostalgic ride into the past. Otherwise, I would recommend you pass.","July 8, 2015","true","3.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The gradual upgrades you get to the art style, perspective and gameplay are a charming tribute to games of old like Zelda and Final Fantasy to name a couple. Once all that is out of the way, however, it becomes a bit of a slog. I get that the random encounters and story cliches are also there  for the sake of paying tribute, but a little of the former goes a LONG way and it quickly becomes annoying (especially when you pretty much have no need to level up for the final boss). As for the latter, I would've liked a little bit more done with it rather than just a basic retread (if it went full deconstruction of the genre this could've been amazing). Still, the art style is pretty, there are some clever puzzles involving switching back and forth between gameplay modes, and the in-game card game was enjoyable.\nWorth a look, but I won't blame you if you give up after the first splendid couple of hours.","November 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I beat the game with something like 87%.\nA neat concept that leans more "overly referential" than "love letter."Why don't I like this game? When I go to play a classic RPG, I think it looks beautiful, but now I want to play it on an emulator because without the option to speed up the game I just feel like I'm wasting my time.\n\nGames used to have more of a public stigma and were often called a "waste of time." For some reason Evoland doesn't want to move past that, but, intentionally or not, it seems to imply that /this/ is the pinnacle of gaming. These loathsome turn-based battles wherein I'm not scared I'm going to die from facing four enemies, no, I am scared of the animation of four different characters, which means each. One. Hits. Then. You. Attack. And. Oh. You. Didn't. Kill. It. So. Let's. Do. Another. Four. Attacks. For some reason Evoland stops in this weird middle-ground of floaty combat, dull puzzles, and poorly written dialogue. Evoland fails because it's either too scared to critique or because it doesn't realize we all grew up, and I don't know which is sadder.\n\nPerhaps worse, is that this was a perfect chance to play with genre tropes and yet Evoland decides to mimic tired mechanics.\nWho is this for? I don't know. If you like Big Bang Theory's or Family Guy's referential "humor" and you like Zelda and FF7 then I guess this the game is for you. This "humor" is encapsulated by the annoying "beeping" sound when you get to critical health. The game even points it out. "Remember how annoying that was in Zelda?

But don't be fooled, the facade begins to fall apart within the first 20-30 minutes. A game pitched as a delve into gaming history very quickly unveils its true colors as a simple list of tired references to "gaming culture" with a few lines from movies thrown in for variety. Even if you can handle the completely unsubtle references (the earliest and most glaring one being the retrieval of the buster sword, where they literally say "doesn't this look familiar?" with a straight face) the game doesn't stand on its own in any fashion.\n\nThe art is uninspired.\n\nThe multiple battle systems suffer every issue from miserable and unfair hit boxes to simple math miscalculations for damage. It pretends to be Zelda, Diablo, FF, and more, and yet pales in comparison to the most rudimentary of battle systems (I wrote a more complex system on my graphing calculator back in 10th grade math) and has zero loot system whatsoever.\n\nThe RPG system is literally nonexistant save for 3 items you can buy in the first hour. It pretends to have progression but the numbers don't effectively change anything as the whole game scales directly to you.\n\nThe puzzles are long, boring, and unforgiving in required precision at times.\n\nThe bosses are tedious and boring, even worse than the 20-year old counterparts they are rehashing.\n\nThe random battles do nothing but draw out the length, and trigger frustratingly often.\n\nThe writing is sad.\n\nThe plot is nonexistant (references=/=plot).\n\nThe ending is anticlimactic.\n\nAnd to top it all off, there's the option to use a gamepad, but it is never mentioned, let alone recommended, and without it, you are limited to 8-way movement, making much of the game much harder than it already is.\n\nI know this was originally part of Ludum Dare, but trying to pitch this for $10 is hilarious. Even at $1 I don't think it's worth playing simply because it intentionally disrespects your time by dragging things out.

Pushbutton switches? Okay, walk over one and then never see one again. An enemy you defeat by bumping into a hole instead of attacking? Great, you've got it, moving on now...\n\nEvoland never does anything interesting with any of the mechanics it shows you; it just points out that they exist and then hurries you on to the next mini-achievement or lame fourth-wall-breaking gag. I suspect the developers do this because they realize the gimmick of the game runs thin fast, and they're just trying to get you through it mercifully quickly. Hopefully, they reason, you'll be too distracted by the next flashy graphical effect to realize the game is all smirking irreverence and no substance.\n\nThis attitude reveals that the devs don't understand why the games they're aping are great. People didn't like Zelda becuase it had 8-bit graphics, a sword that you can cut bushes with, and  the ability to move from one tiny corridor and cramped room to the next. They liked it because the world was expansive and interesting, the combat was challenging but fair, there were actual puzzles where the solution wasn't immediately obvious (because, haha, the JOKE is that the solution is obvious, get it? Isn't this a fun way to spend your time? Haha!)\n\nEvoland isn't a good game, and it's not even a good homage to actually good games, because it merely mimicks the surface of classic gaming. This game is the kind of mass-produced soulless single-severing Nostalgia™ that you see on ThinkGeek or LootCrate.

Opening treasure chests grants you access to other features, features frequently seen in other RPGs, like 3D mode, loot and NPCs. That all sounds amazing, right ? It is, but the game lets you unlock all the features way too soon. Halfway through (the game lasts about 3 hours, 5 hours max if you want to collect everything) you've seen everything there is and the game starts focusing on the story (if you can call it a story). I was a bit disappointed by that, because the things that made the game so original became unoriginal and uninspired near the end. The random battles were especially starting to annoy me, since it triggers every few seconds and it's not always clear where to go. Like I said, it's something you see a lot in other RPGs, but in Evoland it backfires. A 3 hour game shouldn't become boring that soon.\n\nGet it when it's on sale.

You're too busy getting frequent upgrades to the graphics, sound, gameplay, and the UI. Unfortunately, this means there are few left to find for the majority of the game. In one dungeon, you transition from top-down Zelda style gameplay to Diablo. This even includes equipment which do absolutely nothing to your character. Oh, and this system is completely gone after that dungeon. There's no real reason why. The final boss is fought back in the top-down Zelda style, but performs quite poorly. You're stuck with 3 hearts, no manner of pausing, and you can only use your sword instead of bombs or a bow. Those upgrades you found throughout the game? Can't use them for absolutely no reason. Not even a BS reason like dropping them. You just can't. The boss is simple, but inconsistent in movement. This is compounded with framerate issues that I didn't have until that fight. It's frustrating to have a small opening to attack, but the framerate jumped, so you broke a sprinting record.\n\nI loved the concept and was hooked from the start...until they made it clear that this 3 or so hour game was made by people with only 30 minutes of good ideas.","April 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

Many reviews already cover problems with Evoland's execution, but several problems that affected me include:\nTwo types of collectibles, stars and cards. Understandably, there is no record of which stars you have collected, but there is no reason why there should not be a record of the cards you have collected, as they are used to play an in-game card game.\n\nImmensely high frequency random encounters. An extremely poor game design choice, the random encounters occur after no more than 5 seconds of walking in the overworld and take a long time to either fight or run from.\n\nSub-par saving system. While it can be an important part of the design of a game when saves are allowed, Evoland does not seem to be a game that aims to punish you through lack of saves, yet it does. Namely, on one of the mid-game bosses you can die on the way back to town after his defeat, which is entirely possible if you simply try to run from fights on your way back to town due to the aforementioned high frequency encounters (as one may very well do, as the game is rather boring anyway). After dying on the way back to town you will find yourself having to repeat the boss battle. As the battle is one where you are scripted to die, you will try to just die as fast as possible until you find out that you actually had to make it rather far in the battle before you die or you get a game over screen instead of story progression. Frustration thereby abounds. Honestly, the save system is adequate enough in any location except this particular boss, but is aggravating enough on that boss to have warranted a large chunk of this write-up.\n\nVery possible to softlock your game. As happened to me, it's not difficult to land the airship you get for overworld transportation towards the end of the game (which finally bypasses the random encounters!) in an area where you can no longer get back into the ship. Not a deal breaker if it was only a luxury, but it is actually required to make it to the final boss. Ultimately, this game does do a bit of what it aimed in terms of telling a tale of the history of video games, at least in the RPG genre, but several major errors with design really make it an overall unpleasant experience. For those looking at Evoland for a 100% achievement game, it will likely not be the most fun you've had perfecting games, but you will find it managable in about five hours if you remember to keep track or remember the locations of the stars and cards you have collected.","June 21, 2015","false","7.5"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

It's also funny in some little references to other games or persons from the video game and internet culture. Though positive points about this game end here.\nFirst of all, as I said, the price ; for a game 3-4 hours long, ten euros is too much. For the same price you'll find games like Terraria on which you'll spend hundreds of hours. Spot the difference.\nThen, what shocked me the most is the complete lack of personnality of that game ; it looks like Shiro Games wanted to put as many references as possible, so much that there is nothing in this game who makes it stand out from others, apart from the obvious fact that you evolve across history (though it IS fun and kind of addicting at first, it quickly gets completely useless). The gameplay has nothing special (since it's just a copy and paste of other games, with all the actual interesting stuff gone), the characters are plain annoying, moving around is painfully slow, and... Good lord, can this game be more boring? In fact, it feels more like a very long tutorial then an actual game, and I think that's what makes it the exact contrary of fun. Past the very first zones, you quickly start thinking "Hey, when's the true game gonna start?", and all you get is a very synthetic and really bad version of good gameplays, which you don't even have time to enjoy.\nApart from the failed gameplay, the thing that angried me the most is THE FINAL BOSS. As of now, this is the worst final boss I've ever seen, adding a huge difficulty spike right at the end for free and gratuitous rage. Three phases, all more and more horribly, ridiculously, horrendously annoying, for a disappointing end. After a game full of video game puns, you'd expect a little cutscene, something to make you feel AT LEAST like you've achieved something, even if it contains a terrible joke.. Too bad ; you get nothing but credits. Thanks for the effort.\nAs a rating, I won't recommend this game. Or at least not when it's at full price ; it'll keep you from extreme boredom for a few hours.

It's a mixture of Zelda new and old, and the entire Final Phantasy series.  Even a little bit of Ys.  Evoland includes a small bit of everything in the RPG series from NES to playstation 2.  It even includes a little bit of the hardware side in way of virtual hardware upgrades (ie. better graphics, better dvd drives, upgraded soundcards...)  Evoland is a overall decent game well worth a it's short play through time.\n\nCombat wise you start in a top down Zelda/Ys style gameplay, hacking and slashing mobs away.  You then transition into Final Fantasy style combat (turnbased with similar menus) and then into newer age Zelda gameplay.  It's very fluid in doing so as well.\n\nGraphics slowly upgrade throughout the game from simple 8 bit, to 16 bit, to 32 bit 2D, to 32 bit 2.5d (prerendered backdrops), and lastly to 32 bit full 3d.  It transitions fluidly and even lets you head back into previous areas to experience them in their updated new age qualities.\n\nThe game is rather enjoyable, being someone who's played through the original games it's mimicking.  My younger sibling who hasn't played much any of them didn't enjoy it however.  No word on their review though.  However, being that I've enjoyed it, you can expect 3-5 hours of gameplay out of it, more if you want to get all the achievements and items.\n\nIf you've played the games it mimics, I highly recommend picking it up on sale, if not outright.","June 20, 2013","true","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

We are playing it to experience our own experiences again. And if you're too young, then you'll get a chance to see what some of us suffered through in our willingness to enjoy a great story.\n\nThe game handles almost everything well except for a few things.\nWhen movement is mostly free and open, the airship can only go up/down, left/right.\nWhen features have been unlocked, sometimes they don't work in previous areas: mini-map, hp-meter\nBut the most important issue that plagues this game, is the controller support. This game essentially requires it, but semi-hacks are required to get controllers working. This is not a good solution. I had to give the game and pad detection program admin rights in order for it to recognize my Logitech Gamepad. Similar stories abound in the Discussion forums.\n\nAside from these issues, this game is fun to play, and going after the achievements is not the horrible grind it could be.\nThe game actually helps you with the two hardest ones by giving you clues to the location of things you are missing. <3\n\nHopefully the developers will get the gamepad nonsense sorted out before they release Evoland 2, but if you haven't played Evoland it is definitely worth it.\n\n8/10 (Primarily because of gamepad issues & backwards compatible upgrades)\n\nP.S.

This is by far my favorite part of the game, it's fun, humorous, and is reminiscent of early NES-SNES games. More things elements pile on, such as a partner, NPCs, shops, and currency.\nEventually you gain the third dimension. However, that is when I feel the game takes the most risks, and also the experience starts to dampen. The first official dungeon in the third dimension is frustrating, the combat is slow and ineffective at some points, requiring you to run away, or face having to start over the dungeon. This is probably the most frustrating part of the game, but alas, you get to the boss. The boss is unexpectedly difficult for first-time players. Afterwards, you re-emerge in a new area of the overworld, with new enemies, and HD graphics.\nAfter this, the experience is still slowly dampening.. There is a small required side quest. If you bought an item called the "Fast CD player", this side-quest is much less time-wasting. Without it, the game creates fake loading screens that are nothing but unnecessary.  After this, you access two of my favorite areas of the game, an area where you use crystals to change from 2-D to 3-D, which works as a time puzzle. In this area you gain the bow, which is very useful here, but not anywhere else.\nAfterwards, we visit an area which both parodies Diablo and useless items in video games, such as an item that grants +300% damage to walls. Around here I should mention the humor. Evoland, is a very witty game. Making lots of jokes and some of its areas are parodies of other games.  I should also mention that whenever you gain an element, a small text box appears and says a short joke, or a relating commentary of some video games.\nThe final boss is interesting; it uses mechanics of other games, and puts them into one boss. However, one flaw with this fight is your character's speed. At every other areas in the game, your speed is perfectly fine, but here, you sometimes make the fight too easy or too hard.\nThere is one minigame, Double Twin, which I find to be great fun, it is a card game, requiring you to use the cards you have found all through the game. Double Twin has around 4 levels, which are all different in their own way, with the opponent using a different deck of cards every time.\nI feel lke $10 is a little much for a 4 hour game, but the creators did go for quality and humor for the entirety of Evoland. It is a fun game, I actually recently finished my second playthrough, which I felt was more of an achievement run. The game does have its flaws, but it also has its great moments. Evoland earns a 7/10.\n\n","July 10, 2014","true","9.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Giving plenty of nods to well known classic games that set the bar for games of their time, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. If you've been a long time gamer, and looking for a trip down memory lane, then look no further than this series... Though I have heard that the sequel to this game does it better.\n\n=Complete Review=\n\n=The Story: 2/5= Sadly, for as innovative as the game itself is, there's not much in terms of Story. You play as Clink, who is one of the few remaining members of the Order of the Dragon Knights, a group who roams the world aiding those in need and vanquishing evil. As things have been peaceful, there's not been much for the Order to do.\nBut, with a uprising evil, and monsters flourishing in the world, there's once again need for a hero. And, being named after two already well known heroes, it's obvious who's going to fit the bill here.\n\nSo sadly, it's a pretty cut-and-dry formula. Even their sort of plot twist near the ending kinda didn't come off that surprising, given who the two main characters are kinda named after. Still, they at least get a two for trying to have some semblance of a story here, as opposed to having none.\n\n=The User Interface: 2/5= This is, yet another area that is unfortunately lacking. Aside from what's typically on the screen, such as health (once you unlock it) and swapping weapons (again, once it's unlocked) there's literally not much you're going to do with it. They have a sort of stats and item menu, but there's not much you can even do with it. Still, as lacking as it is, it's at least there. Granted, I can't really name a game where you have no sort of interface to work with...\n\n=The Gameplay: 4/5= Ahh yes, one of two of the main boasting points of the game. The gameplay, if you're a long time gamer, will definitely seem very nostalgic, as it starts off in a playstyle very akin to the old 2D Legend of Zelda games. And through advancements and progression, eventually upgrades to a older Final Fantasy RPG style, before advancing to a 3D action adventure feel, with the overworld being that of a Final Fantasy 7 styled RPG combat system with a single area being reserved for a original Diablo style of combat.\n\nAnd while, it doesn't bring anything overly new in those styles, It manages all of this while managing to be fully functional in each playstyle and in the same game at that. Which, getting all those functions to work smoothly in one game is impressive alone. Not only that, there are a few puzzles that use switching between 2D and 3D to overcome, which is a pretty neat idea that was executed fairly well.\n\n=The Graphics: 4/5= Like the gameplay, this was another selling point of the game. Not because the graphics are like, next generation or anything like that. But because the game improves the graphics through progression. Starting out as a black-and-green LCD-esque display a la Gameboy, and later on advancing to that of 3D chibi-ish graphics akin to, but not up to the standard of the Final Fantasy DS remakes.\n\nAnd, just like the game play, the graphics are done well, and seem to have been seamlessly integrated in to the same game, and even switching between 2D and 3D is managed well with only little delay. Which, is quite impressive on it's own.\n\n=The Music: 3/5= The music isn't anything that would be the kind you'd be listening long after you played the game, but it doesn't downright suck either... But, it's also clear what games' tracks they're parodying as well. But given it also advances as you go through the game, and from what I remember, it compliments the Atmosphere of the game as well, it at least deserves a even score.\n\n=The Atmosphere: 3/5= It's basically your typical RPG Atmosphere. There's forests, grasslands, caves, deserts, and places where you know just from the look of things, that intense stuff's going to go down. Sadly, there's no nice snowy lands to see in this game. Which is a shame, as I'd have loved to see how they would have handled it. But, from what I recall, the music supports the atmospheres pretty nicely.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\nInnovative idea that was pulled off fairly well.\nVarious gameplay styles integrated well in to a singular game.\nAtmospheres are done decently, with music and tone to match setting.\n\nNeutral/Your Mileage May Vary\nThe entire game is primarily made to appeal to one's nostalgia of older games.\nThere is a LOT of parody content, even the main characters are parodies.\nGraphics and Music improve with game progress.\nA LOT of things to collect up.\nPlenty of achievements.\n\nCons\nPretty poor storyline.\nNot really much of a UI.\n\n\n=The Conclusion: 5/10= This is another one of those games that I wish Steam had a neutral rating, as it's just too hard to make a solid call on this one. As I did find quite a bit enjoyment in the game, I will have to list it as a positive instead of a negative. There is a lot of content that is a sort of your-mileage-may-vary on if it's the kind of game that you'd enjoy or not.\n\nIt is definitely the kind of game to pick up when it's on sale, as it is sadly pretty short with little to no replay value. If you're a retro game lover, then it's definitely a game that would be worth it to purchase for you. But if you prefer graphics and newer model games to the old, then this game won't really do much for you.\n\nI hear the sequel has improved by leaps and bounds over the formulae presented by the first, and I do look forward to playing it and reviewing it some day. But, for now, thank you for reading my review.","January 16","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The real time battles can be frustrating at times and the turn based battles seem lackluster in a game with so few items and so little to gain from turn based combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/recommended/233470/","Valerie-Valens","~★PetSquirrel★~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Valerie-Valens/","647 products in account","When it comes to humor, gaming humor is about as low-brow as it gets, as it consists on not so much jokes or satire as it is a vapid stream of obvious and shallow references. Evoland is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek love letter to classic jRPGs. Unfortunately, as a love-letter, is is a flaccid and unflattering presentation, and as a piece of gaming humor, it doesn't do much more than ape Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy 7 and Diablo.\n\nOne of the defining points of this game is that as you play through it, you collect systems that slowly update the game's graphics and gameplay, giving the impression of the game evolving through the ages. Unfortunately, of all the systems they aped for the gameplay, this game somehow manages to make them less compelling than the original material. From the janky hitboxes for the top-down gameplay system, the overall lack of enemy variety, the annoyingly high encounter rate for the random turn-based battle encounters, to the Diablo-style loot that does absolutely nothing. (Which completely misses the mark because almost every loot item in this type of game adds something new to the play style.) In fact, when the world opened up near the end of the game, I was so daunted and irritated by the tedious and frequent random encounters that I would have put the game down for good if if weren't for the fact that I am literally one fight away from finishing the game. There are a couple of good things I could say about the gameplay, and it involves the dimensional swapping mechanic, and the action RPG bit of the final boss. (Which is still not as exciting or compelling as the boss fights from Ys Origins, and lacks the dungeon crawling action that is often associated with them.)\n\nThe story is the weakest point of the game, which is ironic since it's supposed to be an RPG that is a love letter to RPG games of the past that had a lot of imaginative and epic stories. In fact, it is one of the most creatively bankrupt RPGs I have ever seen as far as stories go. It is very little more than copying the tropes set by classic RPGs of the past, and the fact that the title and the world is called Evoland should be indicative of this, and that isn't as bad as it gets, believe me.\n\nThe only really good point about this game is that the music is really good. On their own, they would be really fun to listen to, and I really wish that the soundtrack was more varied than it was.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? No. Even if it's on sale for less than a dollar, I cannot really recommend this game because it is not only priced more than it is worth, it is also very taxing on your patience as it does nothing with the premise that is compelling or less aggravating than it was in the old games, nor does it do anything fresh, inspiring or funny with the premise, story-wise. All it does is remind me how much I hate random encounters, and how I am glad that some modern jRPGs got rid of it for something that lets players initiate battles themselves.\n\nSave your time and money. Use it to buy and play the actual old-school RPGs like Ys, Titan Quest, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Half Minute Hero, The Carpe Fulgur Collection, or even Final Fantasy. They would be far more worth your time and money than this vapid piece of gaming junk.","May 12, 2014","false","3.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

First zelda is colored.\nWhy did this game take Diablo-style? "Hack & Slash" style like Diablo is not typical style of JRPG.

Evoland takes you through the "evolution" of the genre with ideas and mechanics taken from titles such as Zelda, Final Fantasy, and even Diablo. It's really clever, original and quite accurate, as it shows not only how the games changed from the gameplay standpoint, but also on the audiovisual level.\n\nThat said, on its own Evoland is not a great game. It's simple, linear, often tedious. About halfway through you unlock the "final" graphics style, but there's still a lot to do. At this point the game starts to drag on, as none of the combat systems is fleshed out, enemy variety is very small, levels are hard to navigate without a map, and the story is basic and straightforward.\n\nI'd still recommend it as a cute and funny experience. Any person familiar with some of the old-school RPGs will find a lot of references here.

It is inspired by many well known titles such as Diablo, Final Fantasy, Zelda and more. Evoland lets you play through the "evolution" of the graphics, gameplay and features of all of these games mashed up into one very well made RPG. You play as the protaganist of your choice alongside the sidekick/healer of your choice as Evoland allows you to name these characters. Starting off in a 2D (black and white) sidescroller you embark on a quest to find chests which contain fragments of a finely polished and more modern RPG. From the first level to the final-boss fight Evoland is full of fun and adventure with many interesting branches into different regions containing stars and Double-Twin cards which are well worth grinding for if you are an achievement hunter. Evoland is overall an innovative treat to add to your library and with a well-deserved sequal it is definitely worth getting.\n\nPros:\n- The evolution is a wonderful idea and has great implementation\n- Stars and Double-Twin cards are a great addition to keep people playing for longer\n- The "Ruins of Sarudnahk" level drops are very humorous and a great part of the Diablo theme\n- Story is well written and has a smooth and well-executed build-up\n- The "Time Travelling" using the crystals to complete puzzles is challenging and a fun way to get some of the final chests\n\nCons:\n- Evolution happens slightly too quickly and compactly in the beginning compared to towards the end\n- Hitboxes are broken for certain enemies and sometimes for the final boss\n- No way to know exaclty which Double-Twin cards and stars you are missing until the end of the game\n- Random monster encounters happen way too frequently to a point where it can get annoying to have to leave a region before you have the airship\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nImmersion - 8/10\nGraphics - 7/10\n\nOverall rating - 7/10","November 15, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Play your way through an evolving game world that begins as basic as an NES game and ends up as advanced as an NES game with the graphics of a playstation 1 game. Combat evolves from basic "press A to slash your sword" into final fantasy style turn based combat that that boils down to "press A to slash your sword...on your turn". The story offers no explanation as to the changing game landscape and playstyle and opts for a trope heavy "evil wizard in a dark tower torturing the countryside" plot that really adds nothing to keep you invested in playing the game. I had to muscle hard to pay attention through just a few hours of gameplay. It seems like the developers got so excited to run with their core idea of an evolving playstyle game that they ran right past the part of development where they make the game fun or interesting beyond the original idea.\n\nThe only potentially redeeming quality is if you are an extremely nostalgic person who misses playing great NES, SNES and PS1 games and wants to tumble through those same types of games without having to worry about becoming emotionally invested in characters, environment, story, or even exciting or challenging gameplay. But if you wanted to do that then your time would really be better spent on playing one of those older games instead, cause this will leave you yawning instead of satisfied.","March 7, 2014","false","1.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It starts off with high hopes for itself, unlocking different technologies and gameplay mechanics, but never uses these in any significantly clever way. You unlock SNES-era graphics before fighting the first boss, and 3D immediately after, without exploring any of the pre-3D game eras in any depth, reducing the "Evo" part of Evoland to a lame gimmick.\n\nThe game itself is a shallow parody of RPGs, where the only tactics you have during the Final Fantasy sections are "Clink attacks, the girl heals". There is no strategy involved, just pure grinding. Even when you get an attack spell for her, it's completely pointless, as healing will make you untouchable. The Zelda parts are better programmed, but suffer from a lot of technical issues, such as poor telegraphing of enemy attacks, camera angle issues, projectiles blending into background objects (such as fire over lava), poor telegraphing of trapdoors (that will instantly fall away when you are close to them, rather than at a distance where it is comfortable to react to them), and a lack of reach on your weapon, which barely covers one player length.\n\nIn general, the camera is too tightly shot, making the player character huge in comparison to the screen, leaving the player to feel claustrophobic even in the most cyclopean vistas. The enemies have very poor attack patterns (the red wizards in particular, whose attack comes directly after they teleport with no antipatory action, and their teleporting away comes directly after that). The final fantasy sections have the random encounters ramped way up, and with no strategy for dealing with the enemies, it becomes boring and grindy almost as soon as you realise there's no way to defeat said enemies apart from bashing them with your sword.\n\nThe Diablo area is a huge mess, using the Legend of Zelda mechanics to bitterly jab at Diablo's loot-centric and many-enemy mechanics. It is clear that the game designer doesn't like Diablo, and hasn't played for more than ten minutes. The only way to complete that area is to stay back and use the otherwise pointless combo attack, which locks you into attacking straight in front of you without invincibility frames. I would have liked to have seen a spinning attack, since the game cribs on Legend of Zelda in every other regard anyway.\n\nThe final boss is a boring slog, again, too fast and not telegraphed enough for it to feel natural playing against it.\n\nThe game had potential, but squandered it by not having any decent game mechanics, or a story that wasn't slapped together in five minutes to brainlessly parody Final Fantasy. If you watch the trailer you've practically got everything the game has to offer.\n\nStay away from this non-game.","July 30, 2014","false","3.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

And it really uses that idea effectively early on, but then it just gets dull.\n\nYou start of with very minimal black and white graphics, and from then on you progress throughout mechanics and innovations in gaming over the years. It's really engaging and interesting! You slowly increase the graphics from 8bit to 32 and so on. You unlock these features through the opening of chests. And it's a really nice feeling when you stumble upon one, and get to see the big improvement. - It's really satisfying.\n\nBut then about midway through it attemps to have a story and it's own unique gameplay.

At one point you come into a cave - and your goal is to find a crystal to save your companion's village.

So instead of finding a treasure with new equipment you might find a new view perspective or resolution upgrade. Other than that Evoland is constantly switching it's gameplay mechanics between Zelda-like adventure and classic turn-based JRPG with a few minigames and puzzles here and there. Lore of the game is not so original yet interesting and fun. The story, characters and locations are all paying an ultimate homage to the Zelda and Final Fantasy (VI and VII) games and everything is presented in very genuine and entertaining way. If you haven't played any of those games I wouldn't recommend the game to you since the references are main source of amusement for players.\n\nGameplay is very casual and the game takes between 4-6 hours to beat and complete so don't expect to get engulfed to the long story with evolving characters.

It would have worked better as a flash animation or Youtube video. It has some laughs. The transitions between the eras look good. The nostalgia factor is there. But its major failing is that it's the sort of game that thinks simply mentioning a trope and winking is enough.\n\nThe hero's a Cloud/Link mash-up named Clink. He meets a healer girl named Kaerith (spoiler). The bad guy's named...Zephyroth? Something like that. You start off as a kid. You get a huge sword. You meet a guy with an airship named Sid. You end up in a village where everyone's afraid of some nearby environment that's begun to show signs of corruption. And the list goes on and on. It never does anything interesting with these tropes, or comments on the bygone era beyond, "That was silly, eh?"\n\nEvoland features basic versions of turn-based, adventure and ARPG combat and lasts longer than it should. In the end, it feels like an exercise more than anything. As in, if it wasn't about 3 hours long, I would have quit an hour into it.\n\nKnow what game's actually successful at what Evoland tries?

This is the premise. The game play changes between Legend of Zelda like free roam fighting and associated (actually quite nice) puzzles involving arrows, bombs and "time travelling" mechanic, and Final Fantasy / Dragon Quest style game with frequent random battles. There's also a scenario where the game goes full Diablo for a short while.\n\nWhile initially entertained, I grew utterly bored after a short while into the game because of its low difficulty level and the lack of story. Granted, the latter is (albeit true-to-form) introduced only later into the game and built upon for a mediocre tale heavily inspired by Zelda / FF games. The boredom only wore off after meeting the villain for the first time. With the fast-travel by airship and an in-game guy assisting with finding of the collectables I was finally enjoying myself again. I could have sworn I had fully cleared several previously visited locations but instead found some nicely hidden puzzles.\n\nLasting only few hours and providing mixed amounts entertainment, I'd advice getting it on a sale.

The game's beginning is unbelievably charming, with a simple mechanic: gameplay evolves, bit-by-bit, slowly adding color/music/new mechanics, changing how the game looks and plays every few minutes. However, the last two hours or so, the game suddenly runs out of new things to try and just tries to be Final Fantasy 7, including unavoidable, uninspired JRPG battles (where your characters have only three or four abilities at most) that never really lead to any sense of progression, making them feel more like a chore than a core part of the gameplay. Somehow, this four-hour game (being generous) manages to feel longer and more drawn-out than many console RPGs I've played, simply due to changing its mind what kind of game it wants to be partway through.\n\nThis game could have been great, but in the end all it can do is imitate what came before and hope greatness ensues from referential humor and "classic" gameplay. It doesn't, because the game fails to understand what made old games appealing and doesn't capitalize on its few original ideas as well as it could've. One of the greatest disappointments in my Steam library.","December 9, 2013","false","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the short time I've played so far, it has reminded me of old NES style RPG's, through the 16-bit era and on to full blown 3D.\n\nCovering Adventure and RPG style games, the game draws heavily from the Zelda series and the early Final Fantasy games. At certain points in the game, it plays out as a Zelda-like dungeon crawler/puzzle adventure game, and almost seamlessly transforms itself into an RPG with Active Time Battle systems!\n\nThe artstyle is beautifully reminiscent of early 8-bit games, all the way through to late DS style Zelda Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks animation, and the music evolves with the graphics.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this is a must-buy for any Zelda or Final Fantasy fan(boy/girl).

You start out on a monochrome screen where you can only move in one direction, and slowly unlock more and more elements of the game such as sound, color, Mode-7, and eventually full 3D HD, as if you were traveling through the history of video gaming. The only thing it really misses is the text adventures, but I'm willing to overlook that.\n\nHowever, there are quite a few problems this game runs into. In its attempt to include as many elements of video games as possible, it has both hack-and-slash and turn-based RPG parts, and neither of them feel particularly polished - there are only very few attacks you can use in either of the situations. Similarly the game's story doesn't feel completely developed, and by the time you start to really get into it you're already at the final boss battle. In the RPG section, your characters never learned any new attacks through level up (at least to level 10, as far as I grinded up to) and there was no way to avoid random battles in the turn-based section of the world until the very end.\n\nHowever, I still enjoyed this game. I enjoyed watching the world getting built up around me, and there were some Easter eggs and moments in the story that I thought were at least somewhat good. If you enjoy playing video games from different eras, this game is definitely worth a look.","September 6, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics start out poor and gradualy advance to better 3d models as advertised in the discription but then stops at around the 2007 era, This was a bit of a let down as the game goes from whats advertised to following a weak and short story with 2d, simple characters. even when one dies I really couldnt have cared less. While I would recomend this game please get it on sale as I did because it, in it current condition is not worth £6.99 or even the cerrant 3.49 asked for. While I hope to see this game advance further I would still find it hard to replay but seeing all the nice changes do make it a fun charming place to spend a few hours. It also\nhas a nice few nods to other games like Mario waste lands and Clouds sword from FF7\n\nOverall score 5/10\nMusic            6/10\nGraphics       7/10\nWould play again: Not until further updates\n","December 29, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I fear a lot of the game's more clever moments might be lost on anyone outside of that age group, but I'd recommend it nonetheless... so long as you've at least played Final Fantasy VII, haha.\n\nIt's clunky at times, combat is often dull and just there to be there, but when the game has a good idea it's usually a great idea. I don't want to say too much, but one dungeon threw me a curve I was absolutely not expecting and I loved every minute of it.\n\nStandout points to me: the game's absolutely gorgeous 3D art, as it evolves through various styles reminiscent of 32-bit RPGs, to something more Dreamcast/PS2-like in its conclusion, and a very clever, very satisfying final boss battle that reminded me more than a little of Brave Fencer Musashi in some ways.","April 3, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now. Seriously, go try Skyrim or Final Fantasy. This is not the game for you.\n\nIf you're looking for a short, silly RPG with intresting gameplay, stay here. Evoland might be up your alley. Evoland's plot is not deep and sort of silly. It also uses a lot of cliche. Deliberately so. Again, this is not supposed to be an RPG that will offer great, amazing plot and hours of gameplay. This game gives tribute to those older RPGs that will be forever. Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, etc. It will do that while taking you through video game evolution. It's a short game. It will take you 3 - 4 hours to complete the main storyline. However, if you play it with the right attitude, it's great.\n\nPlay, however, expecting an RPG that offers hours of gameplay with a deep storyline, and you will be disappointed.\n\n6/10.

The game's beginning is unbelievably charming, with a simple mechanic: gameplay evolves, bit-by-bit, slowly adding color/music/new mechanics, changing how the game looks and plays every few minutes. However, the last two hours or so, the game suddenly runs out of new things to try and just tries to be Final Fantasy 7, including unavoidable, uninspired JRPG battles (where your characters have only three or four abilities at most) that never really lead to any sense of progression, making them feel more like a chore than a core part of the gameplay. Somehow, this four-hour game (being generous) manages to feel longer and more drawn-out than many console RPGs I've played, simply due to changing its mind what kind of game it wants to be partway through.\n\nThis game could have been great, but in the end all it can do is imitate what came before and hope greatness ensues from referential humor and "classic" gameplay. It doesn't, because the game fails to understand what made old games appealing and doesn't capitalize on its few original ideas as well as it could've.

The game lacks the character growth you would expect in an RPG since your experience points really don't matter.  You pretty much switch between 3 gametypes (2d Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo) without your player progress continuing to the next sequence.  So for example if you battled and gained experience during the Final Fantasy segments it doesn't transfer when you play the Diablo segment.  This wouldn't be such a big deal; but the overworld portions have lots of random enemy encounters that feel tedious without the benefit of any real player progression.\n\nOverall though, if you have fond memories of NES through PSone era RPGs you may enjoy the game for the references alone.

If it sounds gimmicky, well, that's because it is.\n\nThe reason the gimmick doesn't wear thin so fast is that the game's constantly shifting gameplay manages to keep itself fresh for a longer time. There are Zelda inspired levels, Final Fantasy, Diablo... This is, however, a double-edged sword: the game will often not develop certain mechanics enough, reducing them to button-mashing. Turn-based combat is the most egregious example of this.\n\nOverall, I can say I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and I'd recommend checking it out.

At that price it is worth it. At full price? Not so sure.\n\nEvoland is a nice piece of nostalgia for anyone that played the old Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Dragon Quest games. And I'm talking way back, like starting with the originals in each series. There are references abound, making for some good fun.\n\nThe gameplay is what you would expect from this genre, though very thin in depth.

The game's beginning is unbelievably charming, with a simple mechanic: gameplay evolves, bit-by-bit, slowly adding color/music/new mechanics, changing how the game looks and plays every few minutes. However, the last two hours or so, the game suddenly runs out of new things to try and just tries to be Final Fantasy 7, including unavoidable, uninspired JRPG battles (where your characters have only three or four abilities at most) that never really lead to any sense of progression, making them feel more like a chore than a core part of the gameplay. Somehow, this four-hour game (being generous) manages to feel longer and more drawn-out than many console RPGs I've played, simply due to changing its mind what kind of game it wants to be partway through.\n\nThis game could have been great, but in the end all it can do is imitate what came before and hope greatness ensues from referential humor and "classic" gameplay. It doesn't, because the game fails to understand what made old games appealing and doesn't capitalize on its few original ideas as well as it could've. One of the greatest disappointments in my Steam library.","December 9, 2013","false","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game lacks the character growth you would expect in an RPG since your experience points really don't matter.  You pretty much switch between 3 gametypes (2d Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo) without your player progress continuing to the next sequence.  So for example if you battled and gained experience during the Final Fantasy segments it doesn't transfer when you play the Diablo segment.  This wouldn't be such a big deal; but the overworld portions have lots of random enemy encounters that feel tedious without the benefit of any real player progression.\n\nOverall though, if you have fond memories of NES through PSone era RPGs you may enjoy the game for the references alone.  I don't regret my time playing it, I just wish it wrapped a better game experience around the trip down memory lane.","January 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If it sounds gimmicky, well, that's because it is.\n\nThe reason the gimmick doesn't wear thin so fast is that the game's constantly shifting gameplay manages to keep itself fresh for a longer time. There are Zelda inspired levels, Final Fantasy, Diablo... This is, however, a double-edged sword: the game will often not develop certain mechanics enough, reducing them to button-mashing. Turn-based combat is the most egregious example of this.\n\nOverall, I can say I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and I'd recommend checking it out. I can see the points being made by "No" reviewers, though, they're definitely not wrong.

The throwback to the 80's, I believe, is interesting. It really makes you appreciate the progress that has happened in the last few decades. Honestly, it was eye-opening, as I didn't grow up in that era. It was fun seeing the game itself grow.\n\nStill, despite the humor and nostalgia, Evoland doesn't really offer anything new. The story is rather short and can be completed in 3-4 hours. I honestly do not remember the story. What I do remember is that I went through dungeons, found the hastily created boss, beat him once, then again in another form. The combat is boring; it's either slash, drop a bomb, or try to aim at moving enemies. There's nothing original about it. Combat in 3D mode is LoZ while open-world combat is classic FF mixed with 3D character models. It's basic, to sum it up.\n\nAll in all, I suppose I'd recommend it. The Steam achievements are fairly easy to 100%, and if you're stuck, there are 3 wonderful guides to finding everything. However, it is rather short.

It uses those 2 rather well though, allthough the random encounters felt far too frequent. You unlock new graphics etc. by opening chests zeldastyle.\nTo get 100% you will probably need a couple more hours without google, since the game is pretty good at hiding goodies or even entire areas and at locking them behind puzzles. Without any sidedestractions id say you will beat this in 3 hours at most though.\nThere isnt a reason to go 100% other than the sense of achievement either, since the game isnt exactly keen on giving away cool stuff, which is also part of what bothered me: I beat your little mini cardgame with 10 cards, in every difficulty I dont WANT the other 13, I dont WANT another hidden star, i want some cool kind of equipment.\n\nThe music is pretty decent sometimes but mostly just gets the job done. Perhaps I entirely missed so many hidden audial messages in the music, aside from the expected 8-bit to 16-bit etc switch, but in case I didnt I think it would have been decent to think of something there, since this tries to represent the evolution of games and boy did music evolve with it.\n\nGraphicwise it is pretty cool that they added quite a few layers between first and final graphics (with jabs at "HD" versions of stuff from the past that still looked like crap), but I still feel like they could have done more steps in between, and the final graphics look kind of ugly in my opinion as well. Going fruther than that would have also enabled more steps in between.\n\nThe story is absolutely not worth mentioning, it wont be why you played this, same goes for character development etc.\n\nAll together I love it though, it is full of hidden references, it copy pastes gameplay from the other games in ways that work well and I love the idea in general, very decent for a part 1 gonna play part 2 now and hope a lot of things improved. Is it worth 10 dollars though? Hmmm that depends on if "well that was kinda fun" as a result after 3 hours is worth 10 dollars to you.

Totally inspired and changes based on your completion of the game. I don't want to give too many spoilers, so just experience it yourself.\n\nGraphics: Pretty good. It's amazing to see the evolution of how far gaming has come since the old days. This game does a great job of showing how good game development has gotten. While they aren't the top of the line graphics, I have to say that at the end, I was quite impressed with how good it had gotten.\n\nPop-culture and cultural references: I love when games put in references to other games, developers, mention jokes that you would know and the like. It was quite fun to discover the little easter eggs and see what they had to say. Schrodinger made it in here...haha. That's all I'll say, but great job to the developers of this game to read their audience correctly. While some things are "adapted" from games like Diablo, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and many others, it's still rather enjoyable to play in the same style, even if some of the characters and enemies have names that are strikingly similar to the enemies in other games. Though...it does add a familiarity and nostalgia to the game, so I think it fit well.\n\nAll in all. A pretty sound game. I wasn't sure how it was going to play as I was buying it, but like I said before...I'm really glad I did.

I fear a lot of the game's more clever moments might be lost on anyone outside of that age group, but I'd recommend it nonetheless... so long as you've at least played Final Fantasy VII, haha.\n\nIt's clunky at times, combat is often dull and just there to be there, but when the game has a good idea it's usually a great idea. I don't want to say too much, but one dungeon threw me a curve I was absolutely not expecting and I loved every minute of it.\n\nStandout points to me: the game's absolutely gorgeous 3D art, as it evolves through various styles reminiscent of 32-bit RPGs, to something more Dreamcast/PS2-like in its conclusion, and a very clever, very satisfying final boss battle that reminded me more than a little of Brave Fencer Musashi in some ways.","April 3, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clocking in at about 5 hours (optional areas included), Evoland tries to cover a lot of content without delving all that deeply below the surface on any given playstyle.\n\nA very large chunk of the game takes on the form of a 3D turn-based (well, ATB) RPG and this is by far where Evoland suffers the most as random encounters are excruciatingly frequent and rarely do fights consist of more than spamming normal attacks and sometimes tossing out a party heal. Enemies themselves each only have a single attack, missing is surprisingly frequent if you don't grind a bit, and there is no way to use heal items outside of combat.\n\nThe other major part of the game, the 2D and 3D top-down Zelda-inspired areas, fairs a bit better, but not by much. You'll fight the same small handful of enemies (skeletons, not-octorocs, not-wizrobes, and a whole lot of bats) from the beginning to the very end in these areas with one or two other enemies appearing here and there. Most of the puzzles in the game are found in these segments, but like most things in Evoland, they rarely provide much of a challenge and often overstay their welcome.\n\nOther aspects of the game simply come off as rushed or otherwise unpolished. There are stars to collect, and some are even well-hidden, but they only give an achievement. There are cards to collect, but there doesn't seem to be any way to view them outside of the card game. The card game itself is somewhat similar to Final Fantasy VIII's Triple Triad, but you are given five cards at random from those you have collected, meaning that it is actually better to actively avoid collecting too many of the weaker cards early on. Some of the writing is clever, but most of it consists of running through RPG cliches and making references for the sake of making references, such as by naming mushroom-shaped enemies 'Zoombas' and having a character named 'Sid'. Of the several optional dungeons in the game, none of them ever pay off with a neat new abilitiy or an optional gameplay evolution or even an optional boss and instead only reward more stars and cards.\n\nEvoland does do a fantastic job of gradually changing up the graphics from start to finish, and both the graphics and the music are impressive at that, but it just doesn't carry this same sense of passion across to the actual gameplay mechanics. Usually, once a new genre or evolution of a genre is introduced the player is handed several new gimmicks to go along with it in rapid-fire succession and then it simply stagnates, as though the jump from 2D to 3D gameplay was the only major innovation to ever happen to RPG's. Players will never get useful things like visible enemies replacing random encounters, interesting things like skill trees, amusingly useless innovations like switching rows in combat, or even many basic functionalities like the ability to block or to use items outside of combat in the RPG sections or the ability to quickswap between items in the Zelda-like sections.\n\nAt the end of the day, Evoland has a creative, fun concept which carries it for about half an hour before it falls flat on its face and never really recovers because it simply doesn't run anywhere near far enough with it.","March 30, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Clocking in at about 5 hours (optional areas included), Evoland tries to cover a lot of content without delving all that deeply below the surface on any given playstyle.\n\nA very large chunk of the game takes on the form of a 3D turn-based (well, ATB) RPG and this is by far where Evoland suffers the most as random encounters are excruciatingly frequent and rarely do fights consist of more than spamming normal attacks and sometimes tossing out a party heal. Enemies themselves each only have a single attack, missing is surprisingly frequent if you don't grind a bit, and there is no way to use heal items outside of combat.\n\nThe other major part of the game, the 2D and 3D top-down Zelda-inspired areas, fairs a bit better, but not by much. You'll fight the same small handful of enemies (skeletons, not-octorocs, not-wizrobes, and a whole lot of bats) from the beginning to the very end in these areas with one or two other enemies appearing here and there. Most of the puzzles in the game are found in these segments, but like most things in Evoland, they rarely provide much of a challenge and often overstay their welcome.\n\nOther aspects of the game simply come off as rushed or otherwise unpolished. There are stars to collect, and some are even well-hidden, but they only give an achievement. There are cards to collect, but there doesn't seem to be any way to view them outside of the card game. The card game itself is somewhat similar to Final Fantasy VIII's Triple Triad, but you are given five cards at random from those you have collected, meaning that it is actually better to actively avoid collecting too many of the weaker cards early on. Some of the writing is clever, but most of it consists of running through RPG cliches and making references for the sake of making references, such as by naming mushroom-shaped enemies 'Zoombas' and having a character named 'Sid'. Of the several optional dungeons in the game, none of them ever pay off with a neat new abilitiy or an optional gameplay evolution or even an optional boss and instead only reward more stars and cards.\n\nEvoland does do a fantastic job of gradually changing up the graphics from start to finish, and both the graphics and the music are impressive at that, but it just doesn't carry this same sense of passion across to the actual gameplay mechanics. Usually, once a new genre or evolution of a genre is introduced the player is handed several new gimmicks to go along with it in rapid-fire succession and then it simply stagnates, as though the jump from 2D to 3D gameplay was the only major innovation to ever happen to RPG's. Players will never get useful things like visible enemies replacing random encounters, interesting things like skill trees, amusingly useless innovations like switching rows in combat, or even many basic functionalities like the ability to block or to use items outside of combat in the RPG sections or the ability to quickswap between items in the Zelda-like sections.\n\nAt the end of the day, Evoland has a creative, fun concept which carries it for about half an hour before it falls flat on its face and never really recovers because it simply doesn't run anywhere near far enough with it.","March 30, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It uses those 2 rather well though, allthough the random encounters felt far too frequent. You unlock new graphics etc. by opening chests zeldastyle.\nTo get 100% you will probably need a couple more hours without google, since the game is pretty good at hiding goodies or even entire areas and at locking them behind puzzles. Without any sidedestractions id say you will beat this in 3 hours at most though.\nThere isnt a reason to go 100% other than the sense of achievement either, since the game isnt exactly keen on giving away cool stuff, which is also part of what bothered me: I beat your little mini cardgame with 10 cards, in every difficulty I dont WANT the other 13, I dont WANT another hidden star, i want some cool kind of equipment.\n\nThe music is pretty decent sometimes but mostly just gets the job done. Perhaps I entirely missed so many hidden audial messages in the music, aside from the expected 8-bit to 16-bit etc switch, but in case I didnt I think it would have been decent to think of something there, since this tries to represent the evolution of games and boy did music evolve with it.\n\nGraphicwise it is pretty cool that they added quite a few layers between first and final graphics (with jabs at "HD" versions of stuff from the past that still looked like crap), but I still feel like they could have done more steps in between, and the final graphics look kind of ugly in my opinion as well. Going fruther than that would have also enabled more steps in between.\n\nThe story is absolutely not worth mentioning, it wont be why you played this, same goes for character development etc.\n\nAll together I love it though, it is full of hidden references, it copy pastes gameplay from the other games in ways that work well and I love the idea in general, very decent for a part 1 gonna play part 2 now and hope a lot of things improved. Is it worth 10 dollars though? Hmmm that depends on if "well that was kinda fun" as a result after 3 hours is worth 10 dollars to you.

The throwback to the 80's, I believe, is interesting. It really makes you appreciate the progress that has happened in the last few decades. Honestly, it was eye-opening, as I didn't grow up in that era. It was fun seeing the game itself grow.\n\nStill, despite the humor and nostalgia, Evoland doesn't really offer anything new. The story is rather short and can be completed in 3-4 hours. I honestly do not remember the story. What I do remember is that I went through dungeons, found the hastily created boss, beat him once, then again in another form. The combat is boring; it's either slash, drop a bomb, or try to aim at moving enemies. There's nothing original about it. Combat in 3D mode is LoZ while open-world combat is classic FF mixed with 3D character models. It's basic, to sum it up.\n\nAll in all, I suppose I'd recommend it. The Steam achievements are fairly easy to 100%, and if you're stuck, there are 3 wonderful guides to finding everything. However, it is rather short.

The concept for this game is very unique and is executed very successfully, the game takes the player on a journey through video game history starting from the basic 2D graphics from years ago to the 3D graphics we have today. This game is not particularly difficult and could be considered a hand holder for the player but it is worth playing to watch as it shows how video games have evolved. The combat of this game is a very simple turn based system and can be rather boring at times. This game does have its flaws but at the same time it is very unique and has some good features most games lack. I rate this game 7/10. I suggest you do your research on this game before spending your money because it may not be for you, some will enjoy this game and others will not.\n\nEDIT\nAfter playing this game a little longer I noticed some rough patches and some bad spots. When walking around you will sometimes get attcked every few seconds which gets very very annoying and the fact that each battle takes a long time to finish is an even bigger pain in the ♥♥♥. Another bad point is that if you are walking around and happen to die then you get sent back to a checkpoint miles away from the place you died meaning you have to go through a whole laod of ♥♥♥♥ again and again.","February 1","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, in the open worl combat if you lose 1 our of 3 hearts, then during the turn base battle system, you will have 1/3 of your health missing.\n-Random encounter was too much for me, but I do see how this is necessary due to small maps.\n-Mana. Need mana for them spells. Make the game atleast a bit more challenging/interisting.\n-Potions and Phoenix Downs were kind of pointless.\n-During the turn base, your character's speacial attacks were only available until the last moment of the game. It kind of teased you, then it just became pointless.\n-Overall, more fine-tuned turn base system (this can mean a lot of things, but I think you'll figure out as you play)\n-Needs to be more challenging, or atleast have a difficulty setting. I know that this game isn't suppose to be hardcore or anything, but still...the grinding was boring.\n-You can move diagonally (eventually), but can't shot an arrow or swing a sword diagonally.\n-SFX for stepping does not match character steps. Probably not the biggest concern, but it bugged the hell out of me.\n-Pause button.\n-Disperse stars and cards more\n-Little kid in village running in circles keeps pushing you if you're in his way. So while talking to the card game guy at certain spots, the little kid pushes you away. Pretty far for a runt. Makes me want to punch him!\n- For a game about the evolution of gaming, make more refrences to other game since that's one of the heavy details going for the game.\n\nI understand that I have more cons than pros, but hear me out why I recommend this game.\n\nSummary:\nI would like to call this game more like a simple adventure than a game since I found no challenge in the gameplay or combat. However, this "simple adventure" does its purpose and illustrates the evolution of gaming. It's funny and had an appropriate art style. My favorite part was when the game went into a dungeon crawler. Overall, I would like to have seen more effort in fixing the small details listed in my con list to make this a more polished game.\n\nRecommended:\nBuy this game when it's on sale since I find $9.99 a LITTLE too much money. $6.99 would be a better price.\n\nIf you have anything to add to my 'Pros' and 'Cons' list, mention it in the comments and I will look them over then edit them into my review.\n\nThanks!","September 2, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay actually feels a lot like DLC Quest where you open new chests to unlock new graphics and abilities, the early ones being almost trivial.

It sure is one and the ability to fit story in an ever changing eviroment is what makes this game great. It's terribly hard and it's not terribly easy. I haven't beaten the game yet as I write this review but I can say the concept is amazingly interesting and the minigames such as the Card game you can play versus npc's makes it feel less like a single player game and a lot more like your standard top down view mmorpg.\n\n(Somewhat Cons)\nI'm uncertain if the game will have much more costly items as you move along in the game but I felt asthough the loot you were given (Glis and Exp) was much too high as combat lasted up to 30 seconds versus normal encounters and 2 minutes againts bosses. When you add in your first combat partners ability to heal you and herself this gives you and unlimited supply of HP and the ability to simply farm for hundreds of thousands of "Glis" (The games currency) without any worry of dieing.\n\n(Somewhat Pros)\nThe game gives you a very clear depiction on how games have evolved and managed to smoothly tell a story within that evolution and adabt to those changes as the game moves along while still making sense. And with minigames on the side the game never gets boring and the gameplay rarely gets repetitive as its constantly changing.\n\nWhat would I do differently with the game?\nI would of added note bubbles that tell you what controls do what as you move along as it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to leave the game. I'd also add in a map function like what many horror games have that will show you a map of the game or dungeon but will only show you area's that you have been in. It would make navigation throughout the world much easier.\n\nMy opinion is based off of 1.7 hours of gameplay to which in those 1.7 hours I made it to the point in the game where we meet our first companion uncle for the first time. Those who have played will know what I mean by this. So yes talk my opinions litely as i have not unlocked the complete evolution of the game yet ad it is possible that what I recommend wil be unlocked by playing further into the game.\n\nI do recommend this game to those interested in experiencing a game that gives you a gameplay style from the first ever pokemon to the modern Diablo 3 Style games.\n","September 10, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A second playthrough confirmed that I'd missed an area. It's full of parodies and inside references, and is superficially similar to DLC Quest, but very different. The boss fights are tough, but not too tough, just tough enough to be extremely rewarding to defeat. It's funny, but not overly silly, and I totally recommend it.","October 31, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are suitable for the time periods of when each generation of the games it imitates are out and there's a lot of references to other games throughout the adventure. Even having not played it for several months now, I can recall references to Mario, Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo and others besides. The soundtrack is equally as engaging to the nostalgic senses in the brain and it feels like it enhances the experience that you get when you play through it.\n\nUnfortunately...it doesn't quite have much of it's own two feet beyond that. The gameplay is often an imitation of it's inspiration - and often a very limited experience of what it's imitating - and has far too much crossover for any one influence (or even it's own design) to actually cement itself as an overarching gameplay foundation. For those not floating on the nostalgic waves, this can make the game feel disjoined and maybe scattered in it's design, as if a clown was juggling too many balls to do the fancy tricks other RPG games can do to greater effect.\n\nThere have also been some issues that I recall from my last experience of it (hence the 12 hours of playing) where I lost access to my airship through a world map issue and had to restart from the beginning to get full achievement completion. And where item collection doesn't become a habit of face-hugging every wall looking for that one invisible area where it might be hiding, the other time-waster is the puzzles. I will admit, the puzzles sometimes can be pretty challenging to work out and do require some measure of thought, but others bordered the line between tedium and simplistic and a few were essentially efforts to get from A to B taking as little damage as possible.\n\nFor those who remember having their chunky white Game Boys in-hand in their teenage years or loved some of the original elements of Final Fantasy, this may be worth the few second-hand DVD's you'd get instead of this game simply on the nostalgic vibes it brings, but even then it may be better to just play the games this one imitates due to the imitation being the game's only strength - and not even that strong with very limited ability set to use. For everyone else, see what the reviewers are claiming this game reminds them of, read up on the games this one imitates, play those instead: You are more likely to get an immersive experience from those than this scripted love song to them.","May 8, 2014","false","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For most of the game, Evoland isn't sure whether it wants to be a Zelda clone, a love letter to Final Fantasy 7, or a history lesson on RPGs. Like I said, some of the mechanics in the game are interesting, but ultimately it doesn't come together, and much like when I collected the 30 stars to get absolutely nothing, at the end of the game, I thought: "Well, what was the point of that?"

But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.\n\nThe turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.\n\nThe action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.\n\nOverall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.","January 10, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story a boy who starts off in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2D evironments. But as he evolves, so does the world.\n\nFirst let me tell you what this game is:\n\nThis game is for fans of Zelda and Final Fantasy type RPG's. It basically shows the evolution of RPG's, and how they start boring and 2D, to a great 3D environment. In this review I'll be giving the brief description, plot, creativity, graphics, sound, who's it good for, how enjoyable it is and the verdict. Each part of the review I will rate it out of 10 and then at the verdict, I'll give the overall score which will be an average.\n\nDescription:\nTitle: Evoland\nRating: Not Rated\nPlatform: PC\nGenre: RPG\n\nPlot:\nNow like I said, this game shows the evolution of RPG's though still has a plot. You start of waking up and exploring the land. As this is the evolution of RPG's, this game starts off 2D and black and white. But that soon changes to colour, then 8 square movement, then soon 3D, and HD. I love the idea of that. Everytime you open the chest a new improvement happens to the game. But as you trek further into the game, you'll realise that some of these upgrades you were given, were given way too early. And by the end of the game there's barely any chests. The plot is about a boy who finds out that he is the key to saving the world of Evoland and treches through the small villages and the tricky dungeons. Thats all there really is about the plot. There is a little bit of twists and turns but not a lot to make me like the plot. What did make me keep playing was how every chest I opened I was excited to see what happened to the game. But as their are fewer chests later during the game its hard to keep playing.\n5/10\n\nCreativity:\nWell, this game is centered around the evolution of RPG games, as a video game! Hell, the game ain't perfect but this idea is EPIC!\n10/10\n\nGraphics:\nYes, this game starts off with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. buts its supposed to give ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics to tell you how RPG's were back then. But as you open more chests, the game turns more modern and just the same to the graphics. The graphics are pretty good though there are some frame rate drops.\n7/10\n\nSound:\nI haven't played this game in a while, so I can't remember the music that much, but all RPG's are expected great music. Now this music is pretty good, but, (yes I know this is an indie game) compared to other RPG's, the music stands nowhere near.\n6/10\n\nWho would like this game?\nThis game incorparates two of the most famous RPG styles. Adventure and turn-based. When I mean adventure I mean Zelda style. And when I mean turn-based I mean Final Fantasy style. Now this game incorporates both, (and a bit of puzzles too), to make a pretty good game. Though who is it good for? Well if you don't like RPG's then you'll hate this game. But if you like RPG's, definitely try this. Its nowhere near those great RPG games like Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim. But you will be satisfyed, Definetely if you are curious on how RPG games evolved. But like I said, if you dont like RPG's, don't even consider this game.\n\nHow enjoyable is this game?\nThis game is best enjoyable at the start, definitely at the start, its so fun adventuring, waiting for the other chest and then the how screen just turns into something different. The end can get quite bland though as nothing new comes and it gets really boring. I have to admit, I haven't finished the final boss fight. I just can't be stuffed.\n5/10\n\nVerdict:\nFans of RPG games will like this. There are some downfalls, but the start will suck you in and I hope that you do play it, even if you can't be stuffed playing the end.\n\nPlot: 5/10\nCreativity: 10/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 6/10\nEnjoyability: 5/10\nOVERALL: Buy this game only if your sure you will like it (6.6/10)\n","February 14, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a history lesson, and a game, and a nostalgia trip.  Many of the negative reviews seem to say that the game is short, and yet also tedious.  Both are true - to a point.  The game advances through stages of RPG gaming history; at some point, yes, random encounters do come in to play.  But it isn't exaggerated.  It isn't over the top.  It's just there, because that's the point of the game.  Yes, game developers have generally moved past this in philosophy of design, yes, it has become an outdated concept - but the point of this game is to go through the stages of what an RPG is and was, and so it does that.  It was frustrating to play through the game trying to obtain everything, to backtrack and collect all of the secrets.  But it was also rewarding to accomplish.  You don't have to do it.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an RPG, this isn't your game.  Don't get it, don't play it.  But if you love RPGs, and if you want something fun and lighthearted to reflect on the games you already have played and enjoyed?  This is the perfect game for you.

It's a great hidden gem! This game truly shows the journey role playing games have taken over time. The action is one of the main reasons why it can be called a gem. By creating alluring zones, enemies, and bosses with constantly shifting combat. The art is another factor of why this adventure is so entertaining. It changes along with the times while retaining it's own style. In my opinion replayability is why you really play a game, evoland practically defines the word replay! Don't go  buying it just yet because of course there are flaws.  Evoland has a fine story, but thats not really what it is about. The collosal fall of this game, the length.

The story a boy who starts off in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2D evironments. But as he evolves, so does the world.\n\nFirst let me tell you what this game is:\n\nThis game is for fans of Zelda and Final Fantasy type RPG's. It basically shows the evolution of RPG's, and how they start boring and 2D, to a great 3D environment. In this review I'll be giving the brief description, plot, creativity, graphics, sound, who's it good for, how enjoyable it is and the verdict. Each part of the review I will rate it out of 10 and then at the verdict, I'll give the overall score which will be an average.\n\nDescription:\nTitle: Evoland\nRating: Not Rated\nPlatform: PC\nGenre: RPG\n\nPlot:\nNow like I said, this game shows the evolution of RPG's though still has a plot. You start of waking up and exploring the land. As this is the evolution of RPG's, this game starts off 2D and black and white. But that soon changes to colour, then 8 square movement, then soon 3D, and HD. I love the idea of that. Everytime you open the chest a new improvement happens to the game. But as you trek further into the game, you'll realise that some of these upgrades you were given, were given way too early. And by the end of the game there's barely any chests. The plot is about a boy who finds out that he is the key to saving the world of Evoland and treches through the small villages and the tricky dungeons. Thats all there really is about the plot. There is a little bit of twists and turns but not a lot to make me like the plot. What did make me keep playing was how every chest I opened I was excited to see what happened to the game. But as their are fewer chests later during the game its hard to keep playing.\n5/10\n\nCreativity:\nWell, this game is centered around the evolution of RPG games, as a video game! Hell, the game ain't perfect but this idea is EPIC!\n10/10\n\nGraphics:\nYes, this game starts off with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. buts its supposed to give ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics to tell you how RPG's were back then. But as you open more chests, the game turns more modern and just the same to the graphics. The graphics are pretty good though there are some frame rate drops.\n7/10\n\nSound:\nI haven't played this game in a while, so I can't remember the music that much, but all RPG's are expected great music. Now this music is pretty good, but, (yes I know this is an indie game) compared to other RPG's, the music stands nowhere near.\n6/10\n\nWho would like this game?\nThis game incorparates two of the most famous RPG styles. Adventure and turn-based. When I mean adventure I mean Zelda style. And when I mean turn-based I mean Final Fantasy style. Now this game incorporates both, (and a bit of puzzles too), to make a pretty good game. Though who is it good for? Well if you don't like RPG's then you'll hate this game. But if you like RPG's, definitely try this. Its nowhere near those great RPG games like Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim. But you will be satisfyed, Definetely if you are curious on how RPG games evolved. But like I said, if you dont like RPG's, don't even consider this game.\n\nHow enjoyable is this game?\nThis game is best enjoyable at the start, definitely at the start, its so fun adventuring, waiting for the other chest and then the how screen just turns into something different. The end can get quite bland though as nothing new comes and it gets really boring. I have to admit, I haven't finished the final boss fight. I just can't be stuffed.\n5/10\n\nVerdict:\nFans of RPG games will like this. There are some downfalls, but the start will suck you in and I hope that you do play it, even if you can't be stuffed playing the end.\n\nPlot: 5/10\nCreativity: 10/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 6/10\nEnjoyability: 5/10\nOVERALL: Buy this game only if your sure you will like it (6.6/10)\n","February 14, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly. It definitely took some work and have some nice aestethics at times. Yet, what a complete blunder both as a game and as a tribute to games. Can't say it any more nicely.\n\nNow, let's start picking this game apart. It becomes obvious from the first minutes, that this game was made with sole purpose of referencing and tributing old Action-RPG games (from 8 bit up to Diablo 1, as far as I gathered). Now, that in itself isn't a bad idea and leaves some room for leniancy when judging it as a game. Still, you cannot do sloppy job here.\n\n1) First and foremost, I personally found references to be... dull? I get what they mean, I get what they are referencing, but realization is simply uninspired. Like "hey, remember how good it was to actually have a heart healthbar in Zelda?". Well... yeah, I guess. So what? And this "so what?" remains unanswered till the very end. This is not some complete and independent game, where "tribute" serves sole purpose of Easter Egg. You built this game around the very notion of tributes. You can't simply reference the games and leave it at that. Simple reference can't replace gameplay, it can't be entertaining on its own without YOU, as a developer, MAKING it entertaining. Make witty remarks, push old mechanic to absurdity, demonstrating how flawed it was (or maybe better than modern?). Take your cues from "Bard's Tale" made in 2005. It seriously lacked in gameplay, but still kept player invested, because it provided witty remarks non-stop. It didn't simply reference "oh, in Diablo stuff drop from mobs". It referenced "hey, remember when you got your rare armor from wolf? Isn't it kinda funny how wolf actually carries something worthless to itself?". It didn't simply reference, it scrutinized, studied, demonstrated how silly and funny those things that we accepted before were (and many still are!) about Action-RPG games. Not simple notebook containing notes about old, but a full fledged monologue from developers to player, through their game. Monologue which more often than not felt like dialogue.\n\n2) Very bland and primitive gameplay. Yes, I know, I stated above that in this case some leniency may be given. But not THAT much, as per my opinion. You reference random encounters from Final Fantasy and what not? Well, okay. But why, for the love of all that is living, are you making them so boring, so dumb, so mind numbingly NOT FUN. It is one of the most controversial points of jRPGs in itself, the boring grinding, 99% fights which don't require ANY input other than mashing single button. You didn't simply reference old games. You presented some elements in the abhorent and repulsive way. And then FORCED player to play in this framework. What the hell? You can't claim you're demonstrating how boring random encounters are when you force player through them for 1/2-3/4 of the game. It completely misses the point. Either do those mechanics in an entertaining manner or refrain from pushing them onto player for the majority of the game. Take your cues from "Cthulhu saves the world", made not too long ago by indie developer. Yes, they to reference a lot of jRPGs, mostly jRPGs. But they also bring to the table a very solid and intresting mechanic into random encounters. Moreover, they introduce "random encounter limit" for each location, when after certain number of battles you are no longer forced through those fights with those enemies. You still can farm using specific option in character menu and people don't feel punished for retracing their steps and checking every corner for secrets. This is what this game should've been about. You reference old games and present solid entertaining mechanics from them while you're at it. You cannot force down the throat mechanics, that are much worse than even those you reference in the first place. And we're talking about Final Fantasy, the mother of all "boring and uninspiring" random encounters, the epithomy of the problem both in days of old and modern age. Yet even in those games certain steps were taken to ensure at least some interest and diversity. When you introduced Babamut in your game, it was a point where you should've made him a "one-button-win-them-all" ability, which would allow to travel the world and wrap up the remaining secrets. Yet even there you introduced ~5 real minute timer. Real minute. For crying out loud... why this? What purpose does it serve? You consider that at that point ANYTHING from random encounters can actually pose a threat to player big enough that it will make fight not trivial? You're wrong, your random encounter mechanic is too flawed and too primitive from the beginning. You can't exactly make a challenging fight when your character can do only two things - hit or heal. Literally.\n\n3) While the rest of the references and mechanics aren't AS bad as those described in second point, they are too bland and uninspired most of the time. This game, while trying to reference many others, falls flat at each and every one of the attempts. It never begins to come close to NES Zelda in terms of combat, it never begins to come close to Diablo. Puzzles and trap sections are way too primitive and boring, so much that I actually couldn't remember any of the location and basic order of rooms right after leaving it. It was THAT boring. Yet there was intresting mechanic, with time changing. If only developers focused on this mechanic, made it more pronounced and built game around it. But no, it mostly serves secondary purpose in some of the puzzles. The rest is a mesh of "hey, we tried to make X reference, but kinda stopped at the very beginning". I understand, that it would be way too hard to make many good games inside one game. Don't. Make ONE good game and shift its mechanics slightly to represent your references. You'll be surprised how much being subtle and precise will enhance your points. Consider it an uncanny valley of sort, sometimes small changes are much more pronounced because you can compare it to almost same thing.\n\nIn the end, I cannot recommend this to anyone. Two games I mentioned above, "Bard's Tale" and "Cthulhu saves the world" provide much bigger impact. And even without them this game is too bland to be both the reference book and an enjoyable game. I sincerely hope that developers will try their hand once again, but this time put much more effort in concept and basic mechanics.","June 14, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

The Zelda parts in the overworld are fine, with no great complaints from a gameplay perspective, but the complete lack of any story, character or tension really takes away much motivation to play a "just fine" game. I enjoyed the era-switching puzzle but it lasted about ten minutes and was never seen again, presumably to make room for more random encounters! The actual Zelda dungeons are pointless, with puzzles you never need to use your brain to solve and the same three enemies over and over again. The traps deserve special frustrating mention as the hitboxes are enormous and they're almost impossible to dodge. Stand on a square and pray you'll make it.\n\nThe Final Fantasy parts are just plain bad. You get a buster sword, you get a female companion to match your complete blandness, there are MILLIONS of random encounters - it's designed solely to make you think "hey, I remember this from that other game!" without any expectation of enjoying the game on its own merit or identity. There are NPC towns, airships, every character is an unhidden clone of an existing RPG property, and an airship. Not much else to say, because there's not much else to the game.\n\nThe thought of having a game build up from the classics into the modern era is a wonderful idea, and one that I had high hopes for with this one, but it's used sparingly after the first fifteen minutes of the game as the chests give way to generic stars and a bizarrely shoe-horned in card game (more Final Fantasy referencing, I'm told). The few good bits are over far too soon and the bad bits stretch on and on. It's like being stuck in a conversation with someone who won't stop talking about high school: it's fun to reminisce, but hasn't life gotten so much better since then? Aren't there better things to talk about?\n\nIf you're the sort of person who loves Zeldas and Final Fantasies and hasn't played a new game in ten years, then feel free to pick this one up and have three or so hours of references (not reference jokes, just references) pumped into you. If you're the sort of person who watched Epic Movie and couldn't stop giggling at a character named "Captain Jack Swallows" there'll be enough humour here for you.\n\nBut if you're the sort of person looking at the fresh indie titles coming out lately and marvelling at just how much games have grown and matured since you were a kid, skip this one and play some more Spelunky, or Binding of Isaac. I know I will!","November 29, 2013","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Seeing the game evolve from something very simple, into a 3D based game was pretty neat. Too bad everything else about it was very basic. The combat has pretty much no depth to it, and it feels very simple. The puzzles are all based on jokes usually. The boss fights are also nothing special. The random encounter rate is way too high and it feels like you get into one every few seconds.

Well, some dialogs are not so bad. Problem is the world upgrades end very soon and 2D/3D focuses are too rare and similar. And other parts of the game (story, quests, fights) are too primitive and boring. Especially those JRPG-style fights - they are far too frequent and repetitive. Evoland greatly lacks content and at least a few more interesting ideas. Really sad to see such good idea lost in such mediocre game.\n\n------------------------------\n\nКлючевая идея игры (2D/3D-трансформации игрового мира и "апгрейды" графики и геймплея в целом по мере прохождения) - это единственный плюс, который приходит на ум. Ну, некоторые диалоги неплохи. Беда в том, что эти "апгрейды" быстро заканчиваются, а фокусы с 2D/3D слишком редки и однообразны. Остальные же элементы игры (сюжет, квесты, сражения) крайне примитивны и скучны. Особенно пресловутые схватки в стиле JRPG - они ну очень уж часты и шаблонны. Evoland катастрофически не хватает наполнения и ещё хотя бы пары интересных идей.

In Evoland you go through the different ages of video games; from 2D to 3D, and even through different styles of games like Diablo, Zelda and Final Fantasy. It sounds pretty cool right? However I was very disappointed with the game.\n\nMy biggest problem with Evoland is that everything is so simple. The games Evoland are referencing are fairly complex (like Zelda and Diablo) but since Evoland lacks depth these sections quickly lost their charm and became a massive grind. Relying on the occasional funny reference to keep you playing.\n\nThe worst offender was the Final Fantasy section. This area has timed battles, but the the main character can only attack and heal which made these sections so frustrating to play. There's no summons, leveling up or any of the depth that FF has (you can't even heal OUTSIDE of battle). Depth is what makes Final Fantasy fun. Like think of the difference between a level 1 and level 50 character, now you're forced to play as the level 1 character for the entire game... yay?\n\nNext the story... it sucks. Early on it's fine since stories weren't a big focus back then... but it never improves. You only ever get 2 party members and by the FF section the story is still "the bad guy is doing bad things, kill him". I wish the story went completely wacky and over the top (as FF's are known to do) but it never puts in the effort to improve it. The game is also filled with unmemorable and bland characters which doesn't help.\n\nThe rest of the game handles fine. The music's nice with some good tunes, the controls are smooth and the artstyle changes with the different eras of gaming (from 2D to full 3D models). For anyone wondering these changes happen after you find them in a chest.\n\nEvoland relies on nostalgia and witty remarks over good gameplay and story. You might find a funny reference, but at the end of the day the game is so shallow that it just feels like a waste of money. I finished it in two and a half hours and I would not recommened Evoland.","November 28, 2013","false","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Eventually the game turns 3d, and that's the end of it.\n\nThe art style nails what it tries to do, which is replicating RPG games throughout the ages. I do think that it's good for what it is, but the need to replicate it makes the art-style boring.\n\nSound 6/10\nThe music in Evoland is mediocre through the entire game. There aren't any memorable chiptune tracks in the earlier part of the game, or any epic battle songs in the later part of the game. Honestly I had to google the soundtrack and listen again while writing this to make sure that I wasn't talking out of my ♥♥♥♥.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe gameplay is slightly above average. There was hardly any depth to the gameplay since they had to shove so many different combat types in the game. They started off with a style similar to The Legend of Zelda (Yes, the first one!), then they moved over to a typical turn-based J-RPG style, similar to the older final fantasy games or the pokémon games. The second reason as to why there is no depth is that the game is so shockingly short. I beat the game over the course of approximately 3 hours and I played quite slowly and looked for secrets.\n\nTime/Money: 4/10\nI beat the game over the course of 3 hours (as mentioned above.) and bought it for the full 9,99€.

This all comes in a quick burst however, and you quickly stop discovering anything "new", leaving the remaining few hours of gameplay as a cheap Legend of Zelda clone with some Final Fantasy elements and a brief Diablo-like section.\n\nAt points the game pokes fun at the early days of video games, mentioning the shallow plots and 8-bit music. However, this seems to be a cheap shot, as (even if intended) Evoland has awful plot and music, and even the sound effects that you "unlock" are pretty terrible. As for difficulty, even the game's "completionist" achievements, collecting stars and cards, are mindlessly easy which leaves a rather empty feeling of accomplishment upon finishing everything Evoland has to offer.\n\nIf Evoland had continued on as its first hour does, and provided the promised journey through the history of early video games, there would be a bit of potential here and could even make for a quick, fun and interesting game. As it stands though, there's little here beyond the first section, and we're left with a rather boring and pointless offering.

Here are a few of them that the game indulges:\n\n1. One-hit game overs - You're in this mode at the beginning of the game.  Add to it that you're on a grid and so are the randomly-moving enemies, and it's a recipe for disaster.  I died at least 3 or 4 times, starting the whole game over every time, before I could reach the first save point.\n\n2. Really annoying low-health sounds - I get it that we're supposed to be careful, but come on.  It sounds like the alarm clock from hell, and I had to actually shut off the sound when it came on.  Don't believe me?  Search for it on YouTube and listen for yourself.\n\n3. Backtracking - Notice that chest that seems impossible to get to?  That's right, if you want to get 100% completion, you're going to have to backtrack a LOT.  You only get certain skills later in the game, and will have to head back to earlier areas to use them to get all the collectables.  The game world isn't massive, but the random encounters will be fighting you every step of the way.\n\n4. Loading screens - Yeah, yeah, reading data from disks on the PS1 was a tad slow, I get it.  But don't give us artificial loading screens at every one of the four area transitions in a town, and especially not in a town with...\n\n5. Multi-layered fetch quests - We need bombs!  That guy probably has some! "Well I used to, but not anymore.  Go talk to that gal."  ...and you finally get the bombs FIVE PEOPLE (and even more loading screens) later.\n\n6. A lack of mid-boss checkpoints - Figure out the boss's first stage, only to get stomped flat on the second?  Too bad!  You get to fight the entire thing all over again.  (I normally wouldn't complain, but the second stage is essentially random and requires a lot more luck than skill.)\n\nWhile interesting at least in concept, it doesn't stand up in practice.  Aside from the interesting time travel puzzle and the surprisingly functional Diablo section, it's all incredibly boring and tedious.  You're much better off playing the games it borrows from (2D Zeldas, Final Fantasy VII, Diablo), than this mess.","October 18, 2014","false","3.7"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

There is little challenge in the turn-based sections of the game as your partner has a heal they can spam for literally zero mana. There are some spelling errors which while don't really distract from the game has a whole, I find it odd there wasn't a higher quality control on the script.\n\nThe Zelda-Esque areas are more enjoyable, although all the puzzles are transparent and all the enemy are frustrating as your sword has a delay.\n\nController support is not fully implemented, which seems odd for a game like this. You can use a controller, but you'll need to map your buttons in the options.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is enjoyable, a neat little commentary on how far gaming has come. No replay value, although they tried to force some by hiding collectable "stars" throughout the world. (No thanks)\n\nAs a game?

The only sections I found fun in the slightest were the boss of the sole Diablo section, and very small parts of the Zelda pieces. The Final Fantasy mechanics were not enjoyable at all. It has you spamming the Action button to select your main attack, and then repeat until all the enemies die. The random encounters are especially annoying because of this.\n\nThere's also a lot of questionable design choices. For instance, when you die, you go to the main menu. Rather than just get a normal game over screen. The saving is left to odd save points that end up just costing you unnecessary time. There's a lot more that I don't want to type out, though.\n\nIn addition, past the first few areas, the writing is god awful. It doesn't seem to follow proper grammar, and if it does, then it's doing an extremely poor job of writing in general. First few areas had funny text, but none past that.\n\nAll in all a poor game.

While others think that the concepts became switched up mid-game and misapplied, I feel as if it has a linear progression to it. The game starts off, with the very humble begginings of how video games started. Then, you must collect upgrades which takes you on a trip through video game history, showing milestones we have achieved through time with things such as; better graphics, different point-of-views, and combat systems. It heavily references to Zelda and Final Fantasy, calling for some fine nestalgia. For the price The game is more than worth it, especially if you like upgrade games with adventuring mechanics. It's just whatd you expect out of a $10 game, but with a tad more captivity. Sure, they could have implemented more to the rather short game, but I feel to them it was more than just a game, it also traversed you through the history of video games itself and to me, was a very fun experience.","April 24, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its sole selling point is of course the gradual unlocking of basic game features meant to mimic the growth of genres over the decades. Unfortunately it gives up on this gimmick after surprisingly little gameplay, gameplay elements come up once or twice at best, only the Zelda-esque segments are at all fleshed out (and even then, you only get a grand total of 2 items and 4 significant mechanics... including those items), the writing is barely even worth calling a parody with so little effort put into it, and the game comes to a screeching halt after the second town. The jRPG side of things only ever features 3 spells/skills, no MP, and no strategy whatsoever. How this can be called an "homage" or an "affectionate parody" when the creators can't be bothered to achieve a tenth of the gameplay complexity of even the original Final Fantasy is beyond me.\n\nOh, and when the selling points say "Revisit the starting area rendered in full 3D or explore the overworld with your own airship!" they only mean the very first dungeon-y area you start out in, not the first officially recognized dungeon, and not the first town. The game makers couldn't be bothered to render those in 3D. (And the world you get to "explore" on the airship is TINY.)\n\nWith such a lack of content, coherency, consistency, features, affection, or even effort, the only favorable way I could describe this is "a tech demo," and it is certainly not worth its full price of $9.99.","January 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you absolutely loved Final Fantasy 7 and old school Zeldas, and you find this on sale, you can probably expect to get your money's worth.\n\nYou'll likely get 6-10 hours of gameplay, with no replayability except possibly to show a friend the first hour of it which is a very interesting look back into the history of game development.","January 10, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Gameplay is pretty shallow, and while the references to game culture and RPGs of old is fun at first, it starts to wear thin really quick.\n\nA simple example is this. You open chests to unlock "features", for example, moving left or right, or up and down, to music, experience points and every other improvement, gameplay or graphical throughout the game. However, you eventually gain 3D graphics and a camera zoom in for when you open chests. When you reach this point you can only open chests from a specific side, and have to wait for both the player's animation and camera animation to stop to continue the game. This is after having chests that opened instantaniously and didn't pause player progression. This is just one example of how something wasn't throught out past the initial concept, and the game seems to be full of these. after about 45 minutes of play and two dungeons I was incredibly bored and felt like I had seen everything the game had to offer.

It hits nostaglia to many RPG gamers, and even gamers that arent quite as avid. As you play the game, it progresses from an old fashion, to a more modern taste. For example, you start off with no colors, then you'll advanced into a more graphical setting with color and such. It evolves, as the game may suggest, it changes from a retro aspect to an advanced taste, whether you are in a Final Fantasy perspective, Zelda perspective, or even Diablo!

The problem with Evoland is that it tries to be a game in itself; A very lengthy, monotonous, repetitive game where the 'evolutions' happen infrequently, inconsistently, incompatibly, and generally do not enhance the gameplay experience. The problem is that all of the evolutions and references to RPG classics are highly watered down. If anything, I would describe Evoland as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized version of otherwise good games. Don't get me wrong; the trailor for the game looks exciting and is the reason why I purchased this game, but the excitement stops there. Within minutes of playing, I already feel the dread of doing the same thing over and over and over again. The turn-based battles are inconsequential in that all the of money and experience you earn amounts to nothing important, and does not give you an edge in the game. The majority of the game is a primative take on Zelda 1/3ish, containing substantially fewer features than the original. If this game were significantly shortened in length, or if the puzzles weren't boring, repetitive chores, or if the gameplay experience was actually enhanced rather than watered down in relation to the referenced RPG classics, then I would recommend this game. But no; I'm afraid that this game was a complete waste of time. Out of obligation, I completed the game in five hours and unlocked the majority of the achievements (the rest would have been easy to attain if I felt like doing more repetitive gameplay), but honestly, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered playing the game if it were given to me for free. I wouldn't play the game if I were paid $25 to play it; those five hours of my life are much more precious than this waste of time.","November 26, 2013","false","5.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberatingbitches/recommended/233470/","liberatingbitches","SNAAAAKE!??","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberatingbitches/","123 products in account","The game is really dull; simplified to the point that even people who haven't played Zelda or FF would be turned away from sheer boredom. The game touts it's gameplay and the ability to visually travel through gaming history, through the styles of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo and more. But the game leans so heavily upon it's gimmicks that when the gimmicks don't pan out, the game collapses in on itself. You start out in a Zelda-esque level and you have to unlock movement, sound, scrolling, color, art style and much more via chests. At first it brought out the nostalgia and was endearing to see someone poke fun at the absurtiy that was the sheer volume of items you had to collect and find to progress in the Zelda franchise.\nBut when you have to unlock everything through chests like peoples, towns, even the creatures you have to fight, the joke gets old; quick. As soon as you finish collecting all the abilities and few treasures that you can collect with those newfound abilities (you collect stars that are useless and cards that can be used as a FF rip-0ff card game called Double Twin), you move to the overworld in the style of Final Fantasy. You unlock those monsters and you will trigger fight events in the overworld section and certain dungeons from that point on. Which gets annoying quick because you they happen often and I mean often. So much to the point that I can't accurately discribe the distance from the first level to the first town in pixels or time, but I can in fight events. About 7-16. And the distance between the two isn't large; the whole everworld is the size of an average FFVII dungeon.\nWhy did the developer do this? Simple; to balance out the time you play Zelda style and FF so it's somewhat even. To put it into perspective, There are Two towns, 3 main quest dungeons, 3 secret dungeons, 3 quest areas and one secret area. If you did strictly the main quest, the areas are all Zelda style and take a few minutes to complete, one dungeon, and the boss fight. these would take up maybe 20-30 minutes of total gameplay. The towns are FF type and you skirt through the first on in seconds maybe 5 minutes if you really explore it, you move to the dungeon ahead which takes up 5-10 minutes because of how many fights you trigger and  the only other town you skirt right through in about the same as the first town. So with dungeons and areas alone, maybe 20 minutes max you spend doing turn style based combat. If you tried to find all the collectables, you'd add on another 20-60 minutes for Zelda style combat based on if you have already unlocked the airship (which is owned by Cid, another FF rip-off). So you spend most of the game playing as a Link clone rather than you do as a FF clone, even though to travel to different levels, you have to travel through the overworld which is all FF combat. But there are so few enemy types and all but one uses melee and they spawn so often that you end up trying to run away. There is only one Diablo level (a main quest dungeon) but its another button masher that you can complete in 5 minutes or less.\nThe music and scenery have vary few variations. Added to the boring gameplay, this helps to further decrease any desire to continue playing.  The plot is just "Hey im a Cloud clone and you're an Aerith clone. Oh noes, its an evil being named Zephyros. Oh noes, he killt you! I am mad and you die now, Kay? The end". No effort was put into making the game interesting or good, just to look pretty.\n\nWith that said, would I recommend this game to anyone? Only if you are some sort of Youtuber or if you use it as some sort of oddly specific social game in where you play bad games with and objective such as "Who can play the longest with out quiting from boredom" Or "Who can spot the most references"  as a drinking game. Kind of like some Youtubers who have played Mario Kart 8 and the objective was to place first. If you didn't, you would drink some sort of alcoholic beverage. That's the only time I would recommend this game. It was a great idea, just executed poorly and without any enthusiasm.","February 14, 2015","false","6.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It feels a rushed, half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to make use of a cool concept.\nA major fault of the game is simply in the amount of content; it says that it will take you through history of gaming. Yet the only thing it delivers on is having a couple of sections kinda like Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.\n\nIs that all the gaming history there is? What about some point and click? what about real time strategy?\n\nThe other problem is the quality of the limited amount of content. Throughout the 2-4 hours of the FF section of the game, you have literally 0-1 spells. And the amount of times you will randomly encounter enemies is absurd. You will sit there spamming left click as the repetitive battle animations play for the same 2-3 enemies in the game. The difficulty in this section is either stupid-hard because your survival is based on your luck not encountering a random enemy. OR stupid-easy because you have a spell that will heal you more then enemies can damage you, so you can just spam it and live through anything.\n\nThe Diablo section has only 1 button. You spam it three times to do a slightly more powerful move. You do this for about an hour after which you leave this section. ...Yup that's it.\n\nThe Zelda Section is probably the best it offers so alright puzzles and some actual non-receptive crap content. However this section is less then 1/3 of the game. Not to say this section is "good" just not as horrendous as the others.\n\n\nAll in all, worst game I ever played. Literally painful to play.

But it's ABOUT the nostalgia factor, so rather than be a game that can stand on its own, it makes itself feel like every game it "showcases," just not as fun. Its most unique feature is a point in the game where you can shift between the "past" and the "future" to make it through an area, which was enjoyable! But that's literally the only unique feature it has. The rest is a lackluster adventure that is blatantly inferior to every game it pays homage to.\n\nIf there's one good thing Evoland does, it serves as an example when games choose to be retro, thinking that it would be simple, and put no thought into just what made it simple and fun.

A game of evolving Adventure/RPG elements through the times would be a great idea if executed nicely, yet this one fails to deliver on a challenging game with actual evolving of mechanics, both in gameplay and actually evolving. It seems to only ever try to be Zelda or Final Fantasy, with only one instance of it being Diablo (which played exactly like the Zelda sections only with more enemies and money drops). It only switches between the first two, and the plot is pretty much an abridged Final Fantasy VII after the initial area. Even the second character you can play as is named Kaeris. You can guess what happens to her before the end of the game.\n\nThere is a fine difference between a homage and a game with references everywhere, and I'm afraid this is more of the latter.

Evoland is unquestionably that. It conjures memories of the all-time greatest RPGs, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and Dragonball Z.\n\nYes, that is definitely all of them. No other RPGs have ever been significant.\n\nI can't help but gawk at the lack of content. This is supposed to be an homage to the history of RPGs? This feels like I paid for a tour of an art museum, and was shown three rooms before being thrown out onto the street. The laziness shows through at the seams. They didn't even bother arranging the small amount of content they had into a full map, instead clustering every location together and then filling three-quarters of the world with impassable mountains.\n\nThe length of the story is also a disappointment. Part of the problem might be that it does the job of reminding you of other games too well, or at the least, too bluntly. Despite the fact that many great RPGs can be completed in a single sitting, this game fails to acknowledge those games at all, choosing instead to constantly reference series that create the expectation that both the storyline and the difficulty curve will be slowly, patiently built up. However, since this game is so short, that doesn't happen. The endgame remains pitifully easy, and the "expected" RPG scenes play out in quick succession without bothering to give you enough context to make anything matter.\n\nIt doesn't even work as a parody.

Literally that is all this game is.\n\nIt starts out all interesting by going through the motions of evolving controls, graphics, sound and all that before just completely ripping off the two aforementioned with a very minor Torchlight-esque sectionette and Triple Triad card game (without even a catchy BGM to go with it). Also a nod to UT's announcer with text kill streaks popping up and a Minecraft item. Still, thats barely a handful of games.\n\nGranted, its quite impressive for a small indie team to pump out but it was perhaps too big an undertaking for them to utilise to its full potential. Its too quick to climax, forgets what it was doing and then just proceeds to end on a low. Much could have been done if it continued its tongue-in-cheek parodies while exploring other genres, even if it kept its Zelda/FF overworld, there could have been multiple dungeons covering them like it did with what it claimed to be Diablo but felt more like Torchlight.\n\nLike a firework; this game provides wonderful anticipation when lit and a grand display upon exploding but the only way to know its all over is when you hear the distant "thunk" of it hitting the ground in the distance.

It feels a rushed, half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to make use of a cool concept.\nA major fault of the game is simply in the amount of content; it says that it will take you through history of gaming. Yet the only thing it delivers on is having a couple of sections kinda like Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.\n\nIs that all the gaming history there is? What about some point and click? what about real time strategy?\n\nThe other problem is the quality of the limited amount of content. Throughout the 2-4 hours of the FF section of the game, you have literally 0-1 spells. And the amount of times you will randomly encounter enemies is absurd. You will sit there spamming left click as the repetitive battle animations play for the same 2-3 enemies in the game. The difficulty in this section is either stupid-hard because your survival is based on your luck not encountering a random enemy. OR stupid-easy because you have a spell that will heal you more then enemies can damage you, so you can just spam it and live through anything.\n\nThe Diablo section has only 1 button. You spam it three times to do a slightly more powerful move. You do this for about an hour after which you leave this section. ...Yup that's it.\n\nThe Zelda Section is probably the best it offers so alright puzzles and some actual non-receptive crap content. However this section is less then 1/3 of the game. Not to say this section is "good" just not as horrendous as the others.\n\n\nAll in all, worst game I ever played. Literally painful to play.

But it's ABOUT the nostalgia factor, so rather than be a game that can stand on its own, it makes itself feel like every game it "showcases," just not as fun. Its most unique feature is a point in the game where you can shift between the "past" and the "future" to make it through an area, which was enjoyable! But that's literally the only unique feature it has. The rest is a lackluster adventure that is blatantly inferior to every game it pays homage to.\n\nIf there's one good thing Evoland does, it serves as an example when games choose to be retro, thinking that it would be simple, and put no thought into just what made it simple and fun. While it may be funny, that isn't enough to justify a four hour slog.","November 28, 2013","false","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A game of evolving Adventure/RPG elements through the times would be a great idea if executed nicely, yet this one fails to deliver on a challenging game with actual evolving of mechanics, both in gameplay and actually evolving. It seems to only ever try to be Zelda or Final Fantasy, with only one instance of it being Diablo (which played exactly like the Zelda sections only with more enemies and money drops). It only switches between the first two, and the plot is pretty much an abridged Final Fantasy VII after the initial area. Even the second character you can play as is named Kaeris. You can guess what happens to her before the end of the game.\n\nThere is a fine difference between a homage and a game with references everywhere, and I'm afraid this is more of the latter. Kind of disappointed.\n\nPick it up on a sale if you want something to do for three hours, but it isn't something you need to get to remember the old days. You aren't missing anything by passing it up, and there is no replay value after you have completed it unless you want to go achievement hunting.

That doesn't mean it's a bad game by any stretch, but don't expect an epic journey that will last you for hours upon hours.\n\nEvoland takes us through some of the gaming we remember from our past (or have seen on YouTube, if you're not old enough), of course it is rather quick to upgrade us from very, very simple combat and graphics to more clean-looking 3D with better combat options (but certainly still not good in any way for a prolonged period of time).\nWhile people love to be nostalgic, who'd like to actually be stuck with something old?\n\nThere are some amusing puzzles if you're interested in gathering all of the stars and/or cards, but it could easily be more - and that's coming from someone who is absolutely braindead when it comes to puzzles in games. In addition they have a game within the game, which is simple, yet frustrating if you get stuck with the bad cards.\n\nOverall, if you're just planning to rush through the game, you can probably do that in ~an hour (or less, I'm not sure), and as such the game might not be worth the money for you.\nIf you however is like me, and want that little bit of nostalgic feeling while taking your time to go through the game, find all the extra bits and just be very casual about it, I would highly recommend it.","June 7, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That doesn't mean it's a bad game by any stretch, but don't expect an epic journey that will last you for hours upon hours.\n\nEvoland takes us through some of the gaming we remember from our past (or have seen on YouTube, if you're not old enough), of course it is rather quick to upgrade us from very, very simple combat and graphics to more clean-looking 3D with better combat options (but certainly still not good in any way for a prolonged period of time).\nWhile people love to be nostalgic, who'd like to actually be stuck with something old?\n\nThere are some amusing puzzles if you're interested in gathering all of the stars and/or cards, but it could easily be more - and that's coming from someone who is absolutely braindead when it comes to puzzles in games. In addition they have a game within the game, which is simple, yet frustrating if you get stuck with the bad cards.\n\nOverall, if you're just planning to rush through the game, you can probably do that in ~an hour (or less, I'm not sure), and as such the game might not be worth the money for you.\nIf you however is like me, and want that little bit of nostalgic feeling while taking your time to go through the game, find all the extra bits and just be very casual about it, I would highly recommend it.","June 7, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.\n\nI'd give this game a 7.5/10.","June 21, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, there are little puzzles that take a little thinking, but this one won't wear you out and if you have the slightest bit of tenacity you can probably finish the game in less than 2hrs.  A lot of people will tell you that this is a great portrayal of RPG games from FF1 & old Zelda to FF9 & newer Zelda.... and it is, if you want the most general feel of those games.  The problem is that there is no real feeling of accomplishment in this game, due to the lack of challenge, lack of any clear story, and shortness of the game itself.\nThe final achievements to strive for, collecting all the items and money ("glis" based off the FF series) don't seem worth the striving.  The null-challenge battles you'd have to go through to save up 50K glis would be more annoying than satisfying, plus there are NO ITEMS in the game to spend your money on.  The char's lvling up means nothing.  If you're looking for the Diablo-like play in the game, don't get your hopes up because the one little map that is supposed to be Diablo-esque provides as little as the rest of the game--after all, the equipment and gold serve no purpose... there's no character building anywhere in this game.  The one cool feature was the challenge element of going forward and backward in time to circumvent obstacles.\nThis game is more like a short film to annoy you and make you laugh than it is an actual game.  If you are judging this by some other perspective than a game, then maybe it's okay.  However, if I had access to a time machine, I most definitely would go back in time and not buy this game.\n","January 29, 2014","false","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But I can't. I mean, it is not bad, and at worst it is still worth your attention. Unfortunately Steam's review is completely binary, so stick with me for a moment:\n\nThis game idea is great, it should be distributed in any game school as a good sum up of how games evolved and how its design did. The game's strongest point is the graphical changes, and it truly shines when you have to switch them to complete a task, if it was that for the entire time, it would truly be a remarkable master piece, I mean that.\n\nBut the developer had in mind that once all the graphics were set, it should try to be parody of Final Fantasy VII and Zelda, and all I could say is "GOD! THIS IS BORING!".\n\nIt does bring some bad habits along for the ride, like far away check points or you not being 100% what to do, but this isn't a problem as the combat.\n\nNow, I like turn based combat, Dofus, FFT, or a more similar example, Pokémon and Digimon DS/Dusk & Dawn. But here it was just an annoyance, a shallow gameplay that starts as a funny reminder to a disappointing "Oh, we're really going to go with this?", I really was playing at an automatic mode I didn't realize I had a sequence break of getting the second part of an amulet before the first! I was quoting Yathzee the whole time I was in the overworld:\n\n"Bloated, unwieldy, menu-driven combat: select ability, select attack, select target, wait 5 seconds for the character's brain to start working, repeat. How about we just walk up to the enemy and press one button that bonks him on the head? Or am I missing the point?"\n\nSure, the point is to say "it was once like this", but it doesn't bring you any satisfaction to it, the story is shallow too for the same reason, but the story at least wasn't there only slow me down. It made me question if it was so boring back in the day and I just don't recall.\n\nWhat is more disappointing is the last boss you fight twice (a spoiler for your own good, believe me), where you can't beat him, so you might just as well not heal so you won't waste money on it.\n\nLater on when you have a fight with it on real time, it reminded me of a Klonoa boss fight, only worse, so my childhood probably wasn't a boring waste of time, YAY. The boss is boring, you don't know much what to do and when you figure out you REALLY get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because with the mechanics they gave you, it would be a LOT more fun, yet no, you can only hun and hit melee, makes you wonder why they didn't at least give you Sonic's speed.\n\nYou could drop bombs so the hands could crush it and take heavy damage, you could swing the sword on the eye and then use the crossbow to hit the ball it took 15 minutes for you to confirm it was important because you couldn't see it.\n\nI dropped the game on the final boss because I was just too bored. AND THE GAME ISN'T EVEN THAT LONG! It shouldn't be able to do that! It did had a creative mechanic once you got all the graphics, and I would never think of it, it was REALLY clever, but they threw the concept down the window.\n\nIf you think you can handle it, by all means buy it, because the idea behind it is really good and I think the developers deserve some credit and I would totally buy a sequel . They just need to figure out that they need to polish the thought that they can be their own thing while referencing game story, instead of aiming for a bad parody.","June 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The pacing of the evolutions is poor, leading to an early string of flashy improvements followed by long stretches of dull gameplay that would have failed to entertain back when final fantasy clones were a quasi-legitimate genre. When it comes to references, the game tries to stick its finger in far too many pies, with Mario Bros-themed monsters in one area and Diablo gameplay in the next. The game offers weak satire of some RPG gameplay tropes while remaining absolutely true to others, compromising the humor of the former and presenting itself as blind to the faults of the latter.\n\nI mean, it's not a BAD game, it's just a highly inconsistent presentation that overstays its welcome. If the dungeons were a bit shorter, the combat just a bit flashier, and the writing a bit more clever, this would have been absolute gold. But as presented, this grab bag of references won't be much fun for anybody not looking to reminisce about a highly specific subset of console games from the 90s.","June 14, 2015","false","7.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberatingbitches/recommended/233470/","liberatingbitches","SNAAAAKE!??","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberatingbitches/","123 products in account","The game is really dull; simplified to the point that even people who haven't played Zelda or FF would be turned away from sheer boredom. The game touts it's gameplay and the ability to visually travel through gaming history, through the styles of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo and more. But the game leans so heavily upon it's gimmicks that when the gimmicks don't pan out, the game collapses in on itself. You start out in a Zelda-esque level and you have to unlock movement, sound, scrolling, color, art style and much more via chests. At first it brought out the nostalgia and was endearing to see someone poke fun at the absurtiy that was the sheer volume of items you had to collect and find to progress in the Zelda franchise.\nBut when you have to unlock everything through chests like peoples, towns, even the creatures you have to fight, the joke gets old; quick. As soon as you finish collecting all the abilities and few treasures that you can collect with those newfound abilities (you collect stars that are useless and cards that can be used as a FF rip-0ff card game called Double Twin), you move to the overworld in the style of Final Fantasy. You unlock those monsters and you will trigger fight events in the overworld section and certain dungeons from that point on. Which gets annoying quick because you they happen often and I mean often. So much to the point that I can't accurately discribe the distance from the first level to the first town in pixels or time, but I can in fight events. About 7-16. And the distance between the two isn't large; the whole everworld is the size of an average FFVII dungeon.\nWhy did the developer do this? Simple; to balance out the time you play Zelda style and FF so it's somewhat even. To put it into perspective, There are Two towns, 3 main quest dungeons, 3 secret dungeons, 3 quest areas and one secret area. If you did strictly the main quest, the areas are all Zelda style and take a few minutes to complete, one dungeon, and the boss fight. these would take up maybe 20-30 minutes of total gameplay. The towns are FF type and you skirt through the first on in seconds maybe 5 minutes if you really explore it, you move to the dungeon ahead which takes up 5-10 minutes because of how many fights you trigger and  the only other town you skirt right through in about the same as the first town. So with dungeons and areas alone, maybe 20 minutes max you spend doing turn style based combat. If you tried to find all the collectables, you'd add on another 20-60 minutes for Zelda style combat based on if you have already unlocked the airship (which is owned by Cid, another FF rip-off). So you spend most of the game playing as a Link clone rather than you do as a FF clone, even though to travel to different levels, you have to travel through the overworld which is all FF combat. But there are so few enemy types and all but one uses melee and they spawn so often that you end up trying to run away. There is only one Diablo level (a main quest dungeon) but its another button masher that you can complete in 5 minutes or less.\nThe music and scenery have vary few variations. Added to the boring gameplay, this helps to further decrease any desire to continue playing.  The plot is just "Hey im a Cloud clone and you're an Aerith clone. Oh noes, its an evil being named Zephyros. Oh noes, he killt you! I am mad and you die now, Kay? The end". No effort was put into making the game interesting or good, just to look pretty.\n\nWith that said, would I recommend this game to anyone? Only if you are some sort of Youtuber or if you use it as some sort of oddly specific social game in where you play bad games with and objective such as "Who can play the longest with out quiting from boredom" Or "Who can spot the most references"  as a drinking game. Kind of like some Youtubers who have played Mario Kart 8 and the objective was to place first. If you didn't, you would drink some sort of alcoholic beverage. That's the only time I would recommend this game. It was a great idea, just executed poorly and without any enthusiasm.","February 14, 2015","false","6.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Hack and slash mechanics are fun, as are the turn based battles (makes me want to play some Final Fantasy games). I've gone through one dungeon and fought a boss. Wasn't difficult, more just figuring out the mechanics of the fight and doing the right thing at the right time. So far, enjoying the game and want to play more!\n\n2 hours in: I've finished the story up to the last boss. Let's be honest here, not an amazing story. The time travelling section was more tedious than creative or tricky. I plan to collect all of the hidden items in the game, but I think that may wait as I just don't really feel like playing more at the moment. But I do want to 100% the game.\n\n6 hours in (I admit some of that time was spent afk with the game open): Just got 100% completion on the game. Was definitely tricky to find some of the hidden stars/cards, but once you figure out where you need to go, you can usually find the ones you missed the first time around (hint: wall hugging is a good idea). Some of the end game areas were rather tricky with the time travelling mechanic, so that was nice. The final boss was actually quite perfect. Took me a few tries to understand how it worked, but once I did, I was able to down him quite easily.\n\nOverall, I would say it's an enjoyable game. After the first hour, you've pretty much unlocked all of the visual and/or mechanic upgrades that you are going to get. That being said, I did enjoy playing through different game styles; it was definitely fun and brought back some great memories of other games. I don't think there is much replay-ability with this one.\n\nI would say the game is worth at least half price.

Still it's not a bad game in itself, but the flaws are very distracting.\n\nAn overview. This is a loveletter (I dig that phrase now) to a nostalgic RPG time. There's heavy Zelda and Final Fantasy (interestingly 7 almost exclusively, with the exception of the card game from 8)  and other generic JRPG. There's even a bit of ARPG in the Diablo vein, but mostly above all is Zelda. I saw a mention of pokemon, didn't see that at all.\n\nAnyway, the game starts out as a 2d zelda (think zelda 1 and snes zelda) and hits a high point at around the time when you can move between a `modern' game and a `classic' game to solve a few puzzles.\n\nAside from that though, there isn't much content. There's a handful of enemy types, three weapons, and a lot of the worst part of jrpgs. Your character seems to walk around painfully slow, and random encounters are mind boggingly frequent, which makes them even more annoying because\n\n1) There are no interesting rpg mechanics at all.\n2) There any challenge that merits gaining money/experience from completing the battles.\n\nThere are a number of average points. The controls are passable. The music is above par, though repetitive, and the story is completely stock going with the tongue-in-cheek style of satire.\n\nThe high point may be the graphics, specifically in the 2d scape. This game is one of the weird ones in that it doesn't seem to recognize that I have video cards, and so renders through my cpu, which is just fantastic at making the frame rate suffer enormously in 3d mode, particularly the final boss fight, which not only is graphically blocky, low-rez, no-texture anyway, but is rendered at an eye bleeding 1 fps. Seriously, this stuff is N64 quality, and I can emulate that fine on a decade old laptop, so I have no idea what the deal is here. A trillion little polygons hidden where you're not looking.\n\nI got this in a bundle, and did put the time in to finish it, but I can't recommend this as anything more than throwing away a quarter or two when you're particularly patient.","May 9, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is only 3 hours long, but even in that short time it somehow finds a way to turn into something that is not very enjoyable.  By the time I finished the game, and I realized it was only 3 hours, I was surprised (in a bad way).\n\nI do not recommend this game at the price it is being sold at.

Evoland made me realize that you don't need an extremely powerful computer to have fun with games.  It had my nostalgia levels through the roof.  I felt it was a different turn in gaming, if that makes any sense.\n\nFor a 3 - 6 hour game, I found it did an exceptional job of letting you look into the history of hack-and-slash games.  From LoZ to Diablo, it lets you experience those fond childhood memories again.\n\nI am not denying its flaws however.  It was not by any means an enthralling story, but I think people expect too much from a 4 hour game.  For what you are picking it up for, I think it is money well spent.\n\nThis game is creative, there is nothing like it on the market.  I've never seen a game poke and prod at other games in such a cheeky manner, while still making it enjoyable.  Playing through the game twice (yes I have no life), I rode the nostalgia rollercoaster through to the end with a grin on my face throughout.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for it, but if it ever goes on sale I would highly recommend to everyone, young and old, to give it a try.\n\n78/100","September 4, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I started having to grind my stats up to survive the random battle encounters.  I also had to grind loot to get a few of the achievements.  I wasn't seeing the constant changes any more.

The game stops innovating passed the first hour and starts to be redondant and to be constitute of random fights every 5 seconds;\nand that's the whole problem surrounding this game.

I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE!\n- You can basically buy two usable items ( potions and phoenix down ), a couple of swords and armors, two cards and... that's all. So much content.\n- Your crew will be composed of you ( a fighter ), and a mage who's only magic is heal and crystal.. *FirstShotOfWhiskey*\n- The music is horrible. The composer tried to copy/use FF as an influence but it's poorly done and you'll end up muting the game while listening to some Migos/Future, because these trash rappers will be candies for your ears compared to this sh*t.\n- The hitboxes and 3D gameplay are poorly coded, I'm pretty sure my character should've died from blunt trauma considering the number of times he took a tree right in the face.. *SecondShotOfWhiskey*\n- Lack of innovation after the first hour. Lack of an envy to live too.\n- The random encounters. Every 5 seconds. A fight. Against the same 7 ennemies. Doing the same 2 actions. Earning the same amount of XP. The same amount of Glis ( Yes, they named the currency "Glis"... ). I swear to god, those random encounters are more frequents than homeless people in big cities.\n- THEY NAMED THE F***IN' MONEY GLIS MAN. GLIS.

Now that said $2.5 is incredibly cheap for a game so perhaps I did get my money's worth after 5 hours of play.\n\nThe area that really upset me was the Diablo-like area in the middle of the game. (I don't know actually how near to the end this is.) I ended up stopping play after a couple hours of trying to fight against the lag and beat the boss. The battle of which would be hard even without lag. The lag was tied to specific areas in the game but unfortunately needing to be mobile meant crossing those areas eventually and it was a good likelihood you'd get slapped for 60-80% of your health before you could escape. This leads to a very lethal ending.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat funny in its send up of various "Roleplaying" and Adventure gaming styles. I say that in quotes because my idea of RPGs doesn't include getting wrist strain from pounding on the keyboard. (By the way the game is played entirely on the keyboard with 0 mouse input, though it seems to have capability to interface with a gamepad.)\n\nThe best parts were the transitions obtained from opening chests and the worst parts were the attempts to create a mini game that plays like a platformer with inadequate controls. I was initally attracted to the game after looking at its store page because of the image of various transitions in particular what looked like a full diabloesque inventory screen turns out to be a joke. Unfortunately the joke is on the player because it is entirely useless in the game.\n\nI don't mind jokes in games (in fact humor makes a game so much better in my opinion.) However this game takes the joke a little too far by making it at your expense. Oh the items you pick up in the Diabloesque area do nothing whatsoever and may get you killed a few times trying to get them before you realize this? OK. Ha...ha? Also a part of me thought it was a really cool idea to go from a 2d Nintendo game to a fullblown modern game with full RPG elements but alas that was merely a false impression.\n\nThe last thing that makes me say "Don't buy this" is the fact that the devs seem entirely absent from the Steam forums now.

This is besides the fact that the progression is painfully general, at some points changing almost nothing and at others skipping whole years of the industry's steps - I'm sorry, but the change from 2d to 3d did not happen overnight, as this game seems to depict.\n\nI fancy myself as being able to appreciate games that go to lengths to make a statement, but beyond establishing it, this game does not really go any further. The game lacks a substantial or original plot, has a fairly limited interface, is laughably short, gets repetitive quickly, and has absolutely no replay value.","April 7, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now that said $2.5 is incredibly cheap for a game so perhaps I did get my money's worth after 5 hours of play.\n\nThe area that really upset me was the Diablo-like area in the middle of the game. (I don't know actually how near to the end this is.) I ended up stopping play after a couple hours of trying to fight against the lag and beat the boss. The battle of which would be hard even without lag. The lag was tied to specific areas in the game but unfortunately needing to be mobile meant crossing those areas eventually and it was a good likelihood you'd get slapped for 60-80% of your health before you could escape. This leads to a very lethal ending.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat funny in its send up of various "Roleplaying" and Adventure gaming styles. I say that in quotes because my idea of RPGs doesn't include getting wrist strain from pounding on the keyboard. (By the way the game is played entirely on the keyboard with 0 mouse input, though it seems to have capability to interface with a gamepad.)\n\nThe best parts were the transitions obtained from opening chests and the worst parts were the attempts to create a mini game that plays like a platformer with inadequate controls. I was initally attracted to the game after looking at its store page because of the image of various transitions in particular what looked like a full diabloesque inventory screen turns out to be a joke. Unfortunately the joke is on the player because it is entirely useless in the game.\n\nI don't mind jokes in games (in fact humor makes a game so much better in my opinion.) However this game takes the joke a little too far by making it at your expense. Oh the items you pick up in the Diabloesque area do nothing whatsoever and may get you killed a few times trying to get them before you realize this? OK. Ha...ha? Also a part of me thought it was a really cool idea to go from a 2d Nintendo game to a fullblown modern game with full RPG elements but alas that was merely a false impression.\n\nThe last thing that makes me say "Don't buy this" is the fact that the devs seem entirely absent from the Steam forums now.

Kind of remoinds me of DLC quest in a way.\n-The first half of the game is actually pretty fun\n\nCons\n-The story is pretty boring.\n-Because the game switches between three styles (Top-Down Action like Legend of Zelda, Turn Based RPG like Final Fantasy, and Hack and Slash like Diablo) the devs didn't refine the battle systems all that well. The Action and Hack and Slash are very similar, but don't play as well as there counterparts. The RPG system is so unfinished. Levels do not matter and there is no MP so you can just spam special attacks.\n-Every two steps there is a random encounter in the overworld\n-some of the puzzles in-game require you to walk back and forth, this wouldn't be a problem except that your character walks pretty slow and by the end of the game you just want to kill yourself\n-The game has the audacity to just rip stuff from other games and call it a "Parody" or "Reference". The game steals enemies from Zelda and Mario and just change one letter like "Zoomba". Another offender is one of the character is named Kaeris, is a healer, and is killed by the main villian. Just like a character in Final Fantasy VII named Aeris, is a healer, and is killed by the main villian. A texture from Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core is just straight up ripped from the game; the infamous Buster Sword that belongs to Cloud makes an appearance as "Clod's Sword". You get the sword in the Mines of Noria, not to be confused with the Mines of Moria from the Lord of the Rings.\n-The bosses are easier than normal enemies.\n-The Triple Triad card game From Final Fantasy VIII is also "parodied" in this game\n-Prepare to listen to 8 second generic songs on repeat as you travel through the overworlds and dungeons. This combined with the walking speed also made me want to kill myself.\n\nTo sum it up, The game is generic and lacks originality.","October 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

When you get an achievement, it tells steam you're playing it, gives the achievement, and then disappears from telling steam you're playing it again.  There was no steam overlay either, and I do have it enabled, so idk there.  Also, right off the bat it told me to install google chrome for pepperflash, but that didn't work, so I had to do some messing around with their config file and dropping a pepperflash version from someone's on the forums in order to play.\n\nSo, other than dumb issues, the game is basically a poor implementation of Zelda with the overworld and some areas being turn-based combat.  The turn-based combat has a level up system for some reason, but it does literally nothing, and the combat is nothing other than using the guy to attack and the girl to heal anyway, there's no "skill" to it at all.  There is one area that takes the poor implementation of Zelda, and adds an hp-bar rather than hearts, and then throws a bunch of mobs at you in a sort of Diablo-ish sorta way, but the the combat sucked with the Zelda-ish stuff anyway so if anything it just made how bad it was more apparent.","September 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is such an amazing concept that I can't believe this is the first weve seen of it (to my knowledge). Which is why it pains me that this game just doesn't 'evolve'... hehe.... into what it could be.\n\nThe first 45 minutes-hour have a lot of promise as you unlock new technologies and cycle through game modes... but after that it trickles out new unlocks and doesn't really go anywhere. It turns into a 'Bah-bies first Zelda clone'. I have got to be frank.... I don't like Zelda (Early titles). The gameplay just didn't do anything for me. I much prefer the strategy of turn based combat. Speaking of....\n\nThere is 0 depth to this game. From the combat to the story. During turn based sections you have yourself and a girl character. The girl is the mage who only starts with heal and you a basic attack. Then, by about half way through the game she finally gets 1 magic attack that does the same damage as your sword attack and you get nothing. Thats it. Even on the Zelda side of things nothing evolves past the early Zelda titles. You get a sword, bombs, and arrows.\n\nThe story is throw away.\n\nThe humour seems to just consist of 'Epic Movie' type refrences. You are a lucky lucky person if you dont know what that means....\n\nNothing is really done with the concept of evolving through the generations. I would love to see a larger scaled game maybe by some tested devs who could take this concept and just go nuts. I freaking love this idea and I hope to see it around again. Kudos to the devs for thinking of it but I really wish you would hahve developed it more.\n\nOh, also the game is only 3 hours long. I just kind of gave up half way in because I can't play old school style Zelda without a controller and I just couldn't get controller support to work. : /\n\nUpdate: I noticed a You-tuber I like had a full playthrough of this so I decided to watch the rest of it to see what I missed. I have to say Im happy I gave up when I did.\n\nThe game turns into a diablo like (using that phrase lightly) game after I quit. Again like with the rest of the game there is no depth to it. You pick up loot that doesnt even effect anything and you are still using the combat mechanics from zelda. You get gold drops but gold is useless and cant actually be used for anything.\n\nThe story is laughable. Its so crap. I can't imagine what the devs thought when they cobbled that mess together. Maybe it was the day before release and all the writers has hangovers so they got the janitor who played an rpg once like 20 years ago to finish the story for them.\n\nYou get a map finally during this section but nothing else happens. The boss fight here is just as lame and uninspiered as the rest.\n\nThen you fight the final boss and finally get a second attack for the main hero which is on a 4 minute cooldown and is only used once. The boss is in 2 sections. You get beat for the first fight and your compainion dies *spoilers but who cares*. You get an airship to get to where the boss moved to because reasons, and fight in a zelda type boss fight. Then credits roll. Thats it.\n\nI can't understand how they were able to think of such an awesome concept for the game but didnt have a single good idea other than that. I pray I see this idea take shape from devs who are actually talented.","September 30, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the idea of evolving a games gameplay, graphics, etc when you pick up specific items set on a linear path is exciting, it only lasts a short time and some of the evolutions only happen once. The gameplay is super easy and the game itself is rather short. It's a fantastic experience but is short-lived.

You get an airship to get to where the boss moved to because reasons, and fight in a zelda type boss fight. Then credits roll.

You'll see plenty of nods to old games, some more blatent than others, but the ability to progress through the evolution of game mechanics and graphics really is an experiance not to be missed. Progression is fast, but there is enough to keep the explorer in you on your toes for secrets! This really should not be missed by anyone who owned a console prior to the 'Next-Gen' era. I highly recommend it!\n\n[Update] This is, however, an indie title and it shows. There is little more story to this game than pure immitation, calling mostly from Final Fantasy 7, with somewhat janky real-time temple roaming. Keep on your toes for game-breaking bugs though, especially with the Airship, which you can land in places you cannot reach again, requiring you to restart the game from the beginning.\n\nThat said: the game is fun, the references are enjoyable, and the gameplay is varied.

At the start of the game your a one shot kill for a while. (Does get better when you get to the 3D part as you have more health.\n2.The save points are quite far from each other which can get annoying.\n3.You dont want to play it that much (sadily i promised my self i would finish it which may take a while as i will have too take breaks a lot).\n4.You go into it hyped for an amazing action adventure game however that is not what you get.\n\nHere are some quotes from people with the game and from myslef.\n\n"It looks amazing but after 15-30 minutes it gets annoying to play for most people."\n\n"To my dismay, Evoland bluntly tells you, you're in this era of RPGs. I guess its meant for comedy, but I just didn't care for it.      You'll unlock different eras of games and different technologies, such as sound effects, music, 16 bit graphics, high definition textures, 3D battle systems and so on. Its all part of the joke."\n\n"Evoland just makes you remember how fun Zelda and Final Fantasy are, and you'll wish you were playing those instead."\n\n"If you wish to finsh it you have to play 0-30minutes aday (sometimes 1hour) to have fun any longer you will most likely rage."\n\n"Evoland presents a very neat idea but completely fails to really make it enjoyable. It starts out in a very promising fashion but very very quickly turns into a generic RPG with tedious gameplay."\n\n"Don't be turned off by the method used to introduce you to the game, it's called Evoland for a reason. I found the approach refreshing and the game makes not so subtle cheeky jabs and nods to other popular franchises."\n\n"The method to introduce to games is good for about 10 minutes"\n\n"Bottom line: A great set of ideas looking for a better game."\n\n"The game has a very charming visual style which really captures everything from the Gameboy to the playstation one in style, but not only does the art style stand out for me the music is not only reminiscent of old gaming music but it really brings a good vibe with it."\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy final rating for this game is 4/10 as it has more flaws then good features and did you read the comments i found only 2 or 3 say it is a good game. However it does have a good soundtrack and a great concept. Shoiro Games my message to you is that you have a great conpect and good music. Its just doesnt feel like a final project. However do keep making games as from the advice from everyone you can make a good game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 5, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Accumulating game features as you go via chests or other means is enjoyable for a while, but after it slows down and stops you're not left with much. In some areas there is a tedious and rudimentary Final Fantasy battle system which will always threaten you with random death if you're not careful. In others there's a decent Zelda style adventure full of tedious dungeons but with inventive puzzles (especially the later one's). It's not an overly long game, but I feel like I would have gotten the point of the game with about 30% less overworld travel and maybe getting bombs earlier. Completionists be warned, you'll want to keep very close track of where you need to come back to later, as there are things you need to come back to in the endgame to get in seemingly every area. Also, the Final Fantasy card game makes an appearance, and I'm even less inclined to play it here than I was in FF8.\n\nOverall it's hard not to recommend Evoland. I had fun playing it, but replay value isn't high. My completion percentage at the end of the game was 92.9% and I didn't feel compelled to go out and get the last 2 or 3 things I missed in random chests.","January 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I thought to myself when first seeing the games title that it was going to be possibly a very GOOD Adventure/ RPGish type of game. But i then found out when Playing that it wasn't all it was cut out to making itself. Literally the way the entire game goes is you start off an a Gameboy world and collect chests that can either enchance the graphics or add other features such as taller grass housing developments and more retro type music. The game controls for the keyboard and mouse IMO are a little bit off imo. Other than that though the game its self is just... Kinda boring nothing really blows your mind, No really amazing special effects and they only go to about the amount of FFVII's graphic style. Which also your companion for the game sucks I mean really sucks shes only good for healing dont EVER USE HER TO ATTACK you'll regret it. Literally if you like only 2 Hit Damage On a Monster go ahead keep doing it. The company even resorts to having an exact replica of a statue of BOWSER from Mario in the game. Um how did they sneak that in and Nintendo didnt notice it? Seriously Nintendo needs to know about this PRONTO! I honestly had more higher hopes for this game as it was suppose to take like a Zelda and FinalFantasy game instead though the very end of the game is gonna leave you thinking "Wow I spent 3 almost 4 hours on a game and beat it with no problem". And thats it its very short, no special endings, and just pretty bland. If you buy this game get it when its on sale at like $5 or lower. Otherwise if you see this for higher than $9 dont get it. It will leave a little bad taste in your mouth. 5/10","June 23, 2013","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Plenty of decent references but then there's all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "look @ me i'm a 90s kid guys do you remember the 90s please guys remember the 90s with me" moments with parts of the in-game text. Gameplay is based around what era of RPG you are in. There's an achievement every five steps, but they're either incredible miniscule or they actually affect the gameplay in certain areas. It's not pretentious, but there are some EHPIK MEEMAYS here n' there. One of the few Greenlight games with a not-terrible concept.","April 8, 2013","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But now, I cannot stress enough how wrong I was.\n\nThe game is fantastic. Sure it's gimmicky, but it felt like I really was playing every RPG from my past. And it didn't feel cheap, or lazy, the game mechanics were actually VERY impressive. Even knowing what the game was trying to do, I was still shocked at how well it analyzed and represented all the old games I played on various systems.. from NES to PS2. The only thing I disliked about the game is the $#@%ing card game you can play; so frustraiting. Other than that, maybe some better music? There's not much to dislike.\n\nDo not take it lightly when I say this game may actually steal the spot of my #1 indie PC game from Bastion. And for $10, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MACROPOWER/recommended/233470/","MACROPOWER","+MacroPower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MACROPOWER/","1064 products in account","This is a really interesting game that tells a story about the clichés of gaming. It's like an RPG, but instead of upgrading your character, you upgrade the game itself. For instance, you might unlock "256 bit color" as opposed to 16 bit or "free roaming" as opposed to moving along a grid. Some areas even allow you to cycle from modern graphics and mechanics to older ones, allowing you to bypass some limitations introduced in more modern games. This makes for a very interesting and enjoyable way to solve puzzles.\n\nYou progressively move from a sidescroller to a game like Torchlight or Diablo, without lingering on one particular thing; except for random-encounters. Random-encounters appear literally every few seconds in specific portions (mainly fast-travel) of the game-- and it's terribly boring. The whole point of the game is to continure moving from one thing to another, except for some odd reason they decided to keep those through the entire game. Now, sometimes they're fun, but the main character only has one attack for the better part of the game. This really discourages exploration-- and it takes a lot of time, mainly because you are granted a mini-map very late in the game. (It's sometimes hard to find where you need to go with random-encounters interrupting you every few seconds.)\n\nThat aside, it's honestly a refreshing experience to see all the generations of gaming packed into one 3.5 hour game. The gameplay mimics the gameplay of the generation you are currently dwelling in, and it does it very well. It seems like a lot of time was put into Evoland, everything was polished well to fit with the various themes.\n\nI think this game is worth it at full price for some people, but also would not be enjoyed by others. I certainly enjoyed it, and if anything I've said sounds interesting, I recommend that you give it a try.","April 26, 2013","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I bought it for $3 during the steam sale. Having played it, it was worth every penny. To review in one sentence: Evoland is short and sweet.\n\nIt's basically a trip down 90's RPG memory lane. In the game you get upgrades. Each upgrade improves the game. For instance, there's the '256 color' upgrade, the '3d' upgrade, and even an "HD Texture pack" upgrade. I won't spoil any more, but there are some clever ways the game gives you to make itself more fun.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's changing so often that once you get the reference and appreciate it's implementation, it's on to the next innovation. This is not a bad thing.\n\nLastly, there is a minor technical issue. In order to play the game with a gamepad (highly recommended) you have to set the executable and one other file to run in compatibility mode with windows 7 and run as administrator. This will hose your hours played in steam.\n\nIf you're at least 25 years old, there be good gaming here.\n","December 4, 2013","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No, probably not worth it.","November 29, 2013","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game starts out with a 4-bit Gameboy feel and slowly evolves as you play through unlocking different aspects of the genre. The sentence "You got XYZ" will become very familiar very quickly, and I say "very quickly" both because the game is short and evolves as a quick pace, which is one of my gripes. While the trip down nostalgia lane is very welcome, some of the game feel is progressed very rapidly (from one screen to another I had changed to 8-bit colour, then bumped almost immediately up to 16-bit).\n\nThe other issue with the game is that later on, once you have unlocked the turn based battle, XP, and a second character, the pace gets very tiresome. XP is awarded, but levelling up is pointless toward the end of the game since the final boss battle gives you a limited 12 HP hit counter anyway, GP awarded is useful to buy only a handful of items such as Potions which I never used because my secondary character has infinite MP and heal. At that point, random encounters become a time filler with no real reward, and just become a tedious chore to get out of the way.\n\nIf taken as a stroll through RPG history, as more of a story or interactive showcase than a game, it works, and I found it enjoyable on the whole.","April 22, 2013","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first 5 minutes of the game are quite interesting - you literally can only move one direction - then you open up the ability to move multiple directions - then you gain attack, then you unlock a colorized world map, etc.  It's a pretty neat idea.\n\nThen, after these 5 minutes, you realize the game should've only been a 5 minute tech demo.  Once the novelty of the "I'm unlocking EVERYTHING - gameplay, game mechanics, flash, etc." thing wears off, you're left with an incredibly poorly-made mashup of bad-collision Zelda, atrociously balanced lite-as-hell RPG, and the worst attempt at Diablo in recorded history.\n\nThis game is really, really bland.  There is the occasional decent puzzle, but most of them take the form of the brute-force puzzles.  "Keep doing this simple thing until you get it - and we'll throw it in later in the same exact form you've already seen it - but there's a bat on screen now."

You start out with only black and white, 2 dimensional game play. You unlock colors, graphics, 3 dimensional gameplay, sound and sound quality, gameplay features and basically everything to do with a game by finding the different and many chest found throughout the game.\n\nIt also features (true to the Final Fantasy spirit), a mini card game within the game. You can find or buy cards to play it. A fun plot (once you unlock the storyline as you do everything else including basic movement), it keeps you entertained for hours. You also unlock the ability of save points found scattered throughout the land, health (which when in Zelda mode shows as hearts in the upper right hand side of the screen). When in Final Fantasy open world exploration mode with radom encounters, battles play out as made famous by the Final Fantasy series up to Final Fantasy IX.\n\nMore unlocks and fun than you can imagine, the gameplay is highly addictive and keeps you smiling. Dungeons also unfold where you must move blocks onto pressure pads to open gates or put you in trap rooms where you must defeat all the monsters within to escape, and mazes unfold as well. I could not for the price range recommend many games as highly as this one for absolutely any gamers collection. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being horrible and 10 being the most awesome game of all time, this one would rank as a solid 9.

I doubt anyone would regret paying $5 or less for this, though there may be a small number of gamers who would feel the story was too short to justify spending more. It's likely to wake the little kid in you, and will probably make you want to play through your library of "classics", but I doubt you'll want to play through the game a second time just to find all the "Hidden Stars".

The controller didn't want to work. I found a "fix" online that worked for me until I restarted my computer. From that point forward the fix would no longer work for me and I had to play the second half of the game with the keyboard instead. The controls with the controller were wonky and craptastic, when I played with the keyboard they actually turned out to be a lot better. I think that kind of sucks as this feels like the kind of game you want to play with a controller.\n\nCombat. The only time combat seemed to work well was in the turn based sequences. Every other form of combat in the game was so clunky that I got hit a lot when I really should not have. This caused a lot of annoyance.\n\nI ran into a few bugs, one of which caused me to have to return to the menu and restart from the last save point due to my having gotten myself somewhere that the developer didn't intend by thinking I was completing part of one of their puzzles. I really feel like the QC process on this game must have been terrible.\n\nBasically, I enjoyed the idea of the game. I thought the actual gimmick of the game - unlocking various new technological advances in video games over time - was pretty cool. There is a section where you alternate between two different techs so as to complete a puzzle - I thought that section was great but it is also the place where I managed to break the game as mentioned above.\n\nSince steam goes with a rating of recommend or not recommend, I am choosing not to recommend this game due to the fact that the developers didn't bother to work out the kinks and left me with a frustrating experience.\n\nFor the record, I played the entire game all the way through. I liked it enough to finish, but I just don't feel comfortable "recommending" it.

I would sooner give them an old playstation underground cd than point them this way.\n\nWhy? because for the most part, this game is just a demo, scattered caves and small concept dungeons that sell and only tease nostalgia. Even in older demos and games I was more willing and enjoyed grinding exponentially more than in this game.\n\nIt is a great concept, and pulls from a great resource of games. Running back and forth through times and generations is something that would attract anyone who wanted more from a new generation and was willing to go back to get a good story, I mean, that's what is usually the grounds for tossing graphics out of the window. But this game misses it on so many levels. It looks good, and goes through the graphical changes in game and even musical changes. But the gameplay plateaus extremely too early. Even before you've gotten 3d you can call it over.\n\nThe biggest flaw in this game is that, it's not necessarily bad, but if you even begin to explain what this game tries to be or what it should be, it sets everyone up to be disappointed, and the only place it should belong in is a class where they skim over concepts that have so much more to them to the point where even robot chicken gives you more character depth. I really don't like games that will literally make you want to stop playing it to go back and enjoy the referenced games rather than choose this one. And it does very well to keep you from enjoying it.\n\nAlso, a really bad part is that this game exists at all, so someone who could have done it better is probably going to have to try a completely different approach to addressing older games and experiences or avoid it altogether. Where in fact the approach itself is spot on, the exchange between lands is also solid, the references are blatant enough to see, but there isn't enough game to bother with it and not just sit through a youtube walk through and tell yourself what a good reminder it is of how far things have come. but only those who know already will understand how far it has come in a gameplay sense.\n\nPass this game. You can do a whole lot more for less. Maybe they will make a sequel that is better and displays more of the depth in those games to the point where it is actually a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drisana/recommended/233470/","drisana","Drisana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drisana/","618 products in account","A wonderfully inventive game, Evoland features a mixture of game play between the Legend of Zelda series and the Final Fantasy series. You start out with only black and white, 2 dimensional game play. You unlock colors, graphics, 3 dimensional gameplay, sound and sound quality, gameplay features and basically everything to do with a game by finding the different and many chest found throughout the game.\n\nIt also features (true to the Final Fantasy spirit), a mini card game within the game. You can find or buy cards to play it. A fun plot (once you unlock the storyline as you do everything else including basic movement), it keeps you entertained for hours. You also unlock the ability of save points found scattered throughout the land, health (which when in Zelda mode shows as hearts in the upper right hand side of the screen). When in Final Fantasy open world exploration mode with radom encounters, battles play out as made famous by the Final Fantasy series up to Final Fantasy IX.\n\nMore unlocks and fun than you can imagine, the gameplay is highly addictive and keeps you smiling. Dungeons also unfold where you must move blocks onto pressure pads to open gates or put you in trap rooms where you must defeat all the monsters within to escape, and mazes unfold as well. I could not for the price range recommend many games as highly as this one for absolutely any gamers collection. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being horrible and 10 being the most awesome game of all time, this one would rank as a solid 9. Well worth the investment.","December 28, 2013","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The first 5 minutes of the game are quite interesting - you literally can only move one direction - then you open up the ability to move multiple directions - then you gain attack, then you unlock a colorized world map, etc.  It's a pretty neat idea.\n\nThen, after these 5 minutes, you realize the game should've only been a 5 minute tech demo.  Once the novelty of the "I'm unlocking EVERYTHING - gameplay, game mechanics, flash, etc." thing wears off, you're left with an incredibly poorly-made mashup of bad-collision Zelda, atrociously balanced lite-as-hell RPG, and the worst attempt at Diablo in recorded history.\n\nThis game is really, really bland.

Since the difficulty level overall is very low, this can be recommended for two types of people: those with nostalgia and those new to the genre or games in general - seasoned players won't find it challenging and will spend the most of their time trying to find all the chests in the game. For me, the great thing about this game is, that developers put in many tropes of the genre, also acknowledging the different eras of video game development - sometimes an advancement comes at a price and sometimes an advancement is, in retrospect, not that advancing but a necessary step forward.\n\nAltough there are two main influences (namely The Legend of Zelda series and the FInal Fantasy series), there are nods to others as well.\n\nOne could nitpick that some steps and/or features have been left out, but that's beyond the point - the game does, what it does, well.","April 4, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't find it.\n\nThe beginning is fun and it felt accomplishing earning new dimensions and mecanics, until you get the 3D graphics, after this point the gameplay grows more teadious for every new stage and the controls are imprecise. This was for me very frustrating. I continued playing only because I waited for it to be as fun as in the beginning  (the first 20 min) again.\n\nI found the the Final Fantasy battles charming and fun at first, but also this got old quickly because of the low variation of attacks, enemies and characters, and when you finally gain new attacks the character choise immideatly shrinks, and guess what more? You no longer have any relevant battles in this style of gaming to use them in. Not. Worth. It.\n\nThe boss battles are unimaginative and boring, ESCPECIALLY the last one which I completed first after a hiatous of a few weeks because it was so teadious and the controls so bad that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. When I finally did, it was only because I wanted to give a fair review.\n\nExcept for the first, Zelda-esque part of the game, the absolutly only part I enjoyed was the in game card game, which I also spent about 20 min with. If that was released as a android game I probably would buy it. Would I now buy Evoland at full price? No. As a homage or satire, it's perfectly fine, but maybe at the price of a few euro.","November 15, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/profallister/recommended/233470/","profallister","Prof Allister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/profallister/","1508 products in account","After spending hours trying to find the upgrade that made the gameplay fun and interesting, and combing through a walkthrough, I was dismayed to learn no such upgrade exists.\n\nI gave this game way too many opportunities to redeem itself, and it never did. I saw it in the store, and it looked nice. A friend got it and played it. Told me it wasn't worth my money. So that wouls have been the end of it, but I think I ended up with a copy froma  Humble Bundle or something. It sat in my library for about a year, until, bored one day, I fired it up.\n\nIt starts out in the standard manner for this sort of game - you start with one direction of movement, then unlock the others. Cheesy, but the earliest games were reestricted to lateral movement and the like, so I was game. Up until you pick up the transition from grayscale to 16 colors. The grayscale setup was a bit of a stretch, since graphics never really worked that way for early games (not counting  handhelds), but I was being lenient. 16 color made it clear that the designers had never really looked at the graphics for anyhting earlier than Playstation era. Even if the system could handle so many colors on a single sprite, it means the main character permanently occupies half the available pallette of the world. (Fun fact: Mega Man had to be composed of two sprites to support his whopping total of 5 colors).\n\nClearly, the developers were aware of how much they messed up 16 colors, because they jumped to 256 colors almost immediately. As noted above, though, they never did the same for the gameplay. In fact, they actively made the gameplay worse than the old games they claim to emulate - as part of a cheap gimmick, you get an upgrade that unbinds you from the grid. While that should be a good thing, it means you're out of alignment with enemies more often than not. And 95% of the game still uses a grid, so you're not getting much benefit from it. Up to and including gaps between trees like the cute barrier they put in place for you to bypass - nearly indistinguishable from the normal grid barriers, and exceedingly rare.\n\nProblems like this pop up so often that it becomes clear that the immediate jump from 16 colors to 256 wasn't any sort of self-awareness; they want the game to be "pretty" as fast as possible. They take way too long to add a health bar to progress beyong 1 hit = death. They add a "Loading" screen that costs 5000 GP to get rid of - from random fights that drop 100-200 GP each (not that there's much worthwhile to spend your money on, but it's still a stupid aproach).\n\nThings start to get some hope when they drop you into a Diablo-style section, but that's msotly padding and an excuse for cheap jokes - back to the status quo after that. With one exception - you get a combo chain ability (because we all know that Diablo invented the combo chain).\n\nAll in all, it starts off with some promise, but the hope for it to get better gradually fades. On top of that, 2/3 of the way through the game, you've unlocked pretty much eveything, and from that point on, it may as well be called "Spinal Clam SE: Heaven". Except that still gives too much credit to the story writing.","February 15","false","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(starts in 2D and goes higher in graphics)\n\nInterface/Settings/Menu\nYou can turn the Music and sound volume higher or OFF.  There is no slider but numbers.\nThere are 3 languages, German, French or English.\nYou can play this game with a xbox controller. But has no Rumble option.\nYou can change the controls on the Xbox controller.\nThe graphics are amazing! They changes and updates! From time to time.\nMusic is very good too! With alot of Variety! (Bosses has boss music, villages has villages music etc)\n\nAbout the game.\nYou have to see this as a game that starts off with a gameboy-pocket and will be updates until the PC versions with better graphics.\nThere are chests in the game which are improving your gameplay! EACH TIME AGAIN.\nThe game is super interesting.\nThere is a decently good story line!\nThere are save stations and Inns to save the game!\nThis is an action rpg game which evolves with upgrades and updates over-time.\nYou start off 2D with not sound, But as you progress and collect you will find sound,music and graphical updates.\nSadly there are collectables in the game! Stars and Cards!\n\nFighting method and ways will be changing over time aswell. Like Press a button to attack or an actually an RPG style (which is turned based).\nYou are able to change names on playable characters!\nPlayable characters talk, EVEN THE MAIN CHARACTER.\nThere are bosses, "Quests" and a level up system.\n\n\nOther Things.\nThere are references from other games. Like Zelda or Mario.\nThere are some items hidden in objects, Like potion in a barrel.\nSome Meme's.\nIf you are going for all achievements, I do wish you good luck. As some is difficult and require alot of time.\nSometimes you have to farm up, to buy good items. Which could slow you down.\nI have never seen a game like this before and i do recommend this. TOTALLY!\n\n\nI give this game a 10/10!","December 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely worth your time, but don't expect to fill your weekend with just this game.\n\nGood:The action turn-based combat system was very solid.\nThere was plenty of collectables that were hidden decently well.\nThe story did not drag on as some older adventure/RPG games tend to do.\nThe later half of the game looks absolutely amazing.\nThere was a fun little card based minigame that directly tied into the collectables.\nThe Diablo inspired section was very fun.\nSeeing the game portrayed in all the different art styles was very fun.\nBad:The Zelda inspired combat sections have wildly fluxuating difficulty.\nThe adventure segments lacked any real puzzles.\nThe party size was very limited compared to most RPGs.\nThe game felt a little short, especially for an adventure/RPG game. I beat it in approximately five hours and while I didn't obtain all collectables, I still managed to beat the game with 90% completion.\nThe card minigame's harder difficulties relied a little too heavily on RNG rather than strategy. Despite this, I still managed to beat all dificulties without collecting all the cards.\nThe end of the game didn't really have a solid payoff, relying more on presumed emotional ties rather than a solid conclusion.","May 11","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Through out the game you will be taken on a journey through the evolution of games over the years.\n"Evoland = Evolution Land".\n\nThe game starts out in a retro gameplay style similar to the original "Legend Of Zelda", and your hero is a young boy named Clink which is rather close to Link our favorite Hyrule hero.\n\nThrough the game you will see two main combat styles including: an over world random encounter much like "Final Fantasy" and dungeon crawling similar to "Legend of Zelda, Diablo"\n\nLike most games it is dangerous to go alone so early on in the story you will have a heroine join your party. You also receive new items through the game that help you to solve some basic puzzles. Also if saving the world starts being a little too much to handle, take it easy and play yourself a game of double down! Evolands very own TCG game.\n\n\nIt is up to you, save the world of Evoland from the forth coming shadow set to destroy your home. Weather you wish to complete the main story clocking in at around 3-5 hours or 100% completion including (Collecting Stars & Double Down Cards) this game has a lot to offer and will leave a positive impression on you.

Starting with simple black and white 8-bit graphics that resemble the earliest GameBoys, it slowly evolves into Nintendo 64 era features. Each time the player opens one of many treasure chests scattered across the worlds, new graphical, musical, or sound effects are "unlocked." In this way, the game slowly progresses through the history of action/adventure video games.\n\nObviously inspired by classics like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo, this game appeals to fans of those games, like myself. Highlights of the game include the unique evolution style, decent music (though sometimes overly repetitive), and a great homage to classic games. On the negative side, the game was a bit too long for me, but only because I searched for every secret room and hidden items. So, without the side-questing, I am sure the game would have been less of a drag. There was included as well in the game a side mini-game, called Double Twin. This was a basic card game twist of tic-tac-toe. Again, an interesting idea, but only good for a few plays, not for prolonged play-time.\n\nThis also marks the first time that I have gained all the achievements for a game on Steam... No reward for that except a little self-pride...\n\nReview originally published on https://brockpattison.blogspot.com/","May 21","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing against C64, i still have one, but i wont see that in 2013.\n\nThen i saw a little review accidently where i saw 3D grahics in it. My interest was awakened.\n\nEvoland is a time-travel between the grapic engines from C64 style to today. But the biggest reference of it is Final Fantasy VII.\n\nAs mentioned you start with 8bit graphic and have to learn how to walk left and right, some minutes later you will unlock sounds and shortly thereafter COLOR!!! Well, the time from C64 to your first 3D effect is not very long, your first 3D HD graphics will come after 1 hour already.\n\nThe whole game took me only ~4 hours. It was good invested 4 hours for me, for the price we could fight. 10€ (Sep2013) is ok but 5€ would be more fair for that playlength.\n\nThe story is kinda funny, not only cause of that much references. 7/10","September 9, 2013","true","4.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","2"

And I don't want to spoil anything too heavily, but FF7 fans will notice alot of shout-outs, and one scene especially should hit pretty close to home.\n\n\nOnly get it on sale though, IMO. And at $2.50 or less. Even at 50% off ($5), it wouldn't be worth it. I completed this game in 6 hours, and that's with all achievements cleared.

Get a little further still and you'll unlock a color display! Wow color!\n\nThe unlockable everything aspect sort of reminded me of Half Minute Hero, though thankfully Evoland doesn't have that title's frantic "time is running out constantly hurry hurry hurry!" methodology killing its fun factor.\n\nIt's neat to look back on the progression and see how things evolve as you play, and it's a fairly good reminder really to the way games of old have matured over the decades.\n\nI'd say the two plain-as-day obvious biggest influences on Evoland are the early Zelda titles, and in particular, Final Fantasy 7. However there are a number of other small references here and there to others as well: Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 4 and 6, Final Fantasy 8 just to name a few that I was easily able to recognize.\n\nThe story, well there hardly is one, and again, see Zelda/FF7 for the majority of parallels, sometimes downright ripoffs honestly. Still the concept remains interesting throughout the relatively short campaign (it took me about 8 hours for 100% completion).\n\nThe fact that you don't have to sink 100+ hours into it is actually welcome. It gets the point across and manages to be enjoyable without requiring a month's worth of your spare time.\n\nIf you are a fan of older RPGs and indie titles you'll definitely find something to like here. Just having multiple battle systems and graphical presentations in a single game and having it work well together is reason enough to give it a try.

Once you clear the first town, however, the flaws of the game become suffocating, and even though the game is only about three hours long, it felt like it should have only lasted for half of that.\n\nFor one thing, the randomized battles add a horrible amount of teeth-grinding fluff to the game – they appear early, and never fade away. The game’s Steam page promises fully real-time battles by the time you’ve upgraded Evoland enough, but in reality the active combat zones are few and far between. Enemy variety is very limited, and I would always try to busy myself with something else as I hammered on the “A” button during battles. There’s almost no fear of death, as your character is capable of healing and there is NO mana bar to limit the ability to do so. Enemy scaling is frustrating as well, as your character is capable of dealing damage that always seems to be about one point short of the mob’s maximum life bar, requiring multiple hits on multiple mobs for arbitrary EXP that really doesn’t seem to boost your stats in any measurable way. It’s dull and pointless.\n\nFurthermore, the game begins to rely far too much on RPG tropes. Sure, that’s the main hook of the game, but I started to become annoyed when the main character, “Clink,” used a buster sword to fight the main villain, “Zephyros” (and guess what happened to the female protagonist, “Caris”). When I thought the story was going to deliver something at least somewhat original, or put a twist on a trope, I instead found myself wandering a field to hunt a “choboko.”\n\nSpeaking of the tropes, they don’t fully evolve the game, as I was expecting. If you get near the end of the game, after you’ve unlocked full 3D models and HD backgrounds, and you travel back to the starting village, the game automatically reverts back to SNES-era sprites. Backtracking actually becomes somewhat of an inconvenience.\n\nIn all, Evoland feels like an overpriced student game that managed to do a good job up front, when it really has no real legs to stand on. Not recommended – just watch the GiantBomb Quick Look and call it good.","December 8, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game begins in very simplistic 2D, but soon begins to play very similarly to the original top-down Legend of Zelda games (think Link's Awakening). After more time, the game progresses into full-blown 3D, more akin to PS1/PS2 Final Fantasy games, and even further onward to open exploration, like Diablo. There's all sorts of collectibles and monster encounters as you'd come to expect, and the package is hilarious and represents its source material very well.\n\nHowever, the game isn't without its faults. The transition to 2D to 3D is somewhat rough, and the game starts to lose a bit of polish there. Also, at all points in the game, hit detection can act oddly, leading to your character taking hits due to some wonky hitboxes, or in some cases, pushing your character through walls in a dungeon, leading you unable to continue without restarting. These problems are obviously very annoying, and make the experience worse overall.\n\nWould I recommend the game, given the balance of positives (nostalgic value, good design) and negatives (bad hit detection, suspect 3D game mode execution)? Yeah, but not at full price. The game is great for what it is, but it's short (the game takes 2-3 hours, maybe 4 if you are trying to collect everything), and the bugs can be very frustrating. Therefore, if you're interested in things like Zelda and Final Fantasy, be sure to give Evoland a look - if you can catch it for a large discount in a sale.","December 21, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/recommended/233470/","lerabbitt","trolltasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/","116 products in account","As other reviewers noted, this game isn't so much a journey of action/adventure games so much as it is a journey of RPGs--notably the Final Fantasy and the Legend of Zelda series. Which, admittedly, still promised a lot of fun and engagement, but didn't really deliver the way I'd hoped it would.\n\nIt incorporates both old-school turn-based RPG combat and your older "hack-and-slack" style combat reminiscent of early Zelda games. However, these forms of combat alternate, so that most world-map combat is turn-based, and the majority of the dungeons and forests are subjected to the hack-and-slash that can be a little jarring in transition. The turn-based follows a familiar timer system, where you cannot attack, heal, run, etc., until it's your "time" to do so.\n\nWhile it admittedly did bring me a good bit of nostalgia, the game doesn't have much to stand on beyond that. As much as I found myself enjoying the ability to "unlock" the advancements to the game such as 16-bit color or 3-D rendering, it quickly grew tedious and monotonous. There's not a lot of story or plot to keep you interested in long term play, let alone to replay the game, and it doesn't have that something special to set it apart from other games, as it seems to rely to heavily on the nostalgia to carry the game. I did like some of the puzzles that had you switching between the 16-bit era and the more modern 3-D game structure to move through them, but it wasn't enough to make the game stand out.\n\nFurthermore, if you're looking to play this game purely through the keyboard and mouse, you'll be a bit disappointed. The space bar acts as the action key, and movement can only be achieved by your direction keys. It makes the older style combats (particularly your hack-and-slash) a bit more difficult to pull off with finesse.\n\nIn the end, I can't really say I'd recommend the game--unless you have the time and money to kill, and don't mind enduring some frustration during gameplay to do so.","May 15, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some sort of bug where it only counts time on the start screen for some reason.  I'd say I've loged about 3 or 4 hours.\n\nCombining Legend of Zelda with Final Fantasy and even some Diablo - this retro-ish RPG / Action RPG is really like several games in one.  Or at least, several tastes of games in one - as the entire game itself is not very long.\n\nStarting from a Game Boy - esqe 4-color pixel graphic style game and moving up to Playstation 1 era 3D graphics, the game evolves (hence the name) and morphs in front of you, changing not just the look and feel of the game, but the game mechanics as well.\n\nThere are a lot of references in this game.  If you enjoy games like Saturday Morning RPG, Dragon Fantasy, or Retro City Rampage - then you will enoy this game.  If you want to be reminded of some of the best RPGs in the last 30 years - then you should give this a shot....  Just don't expect to replicate the entire experience, just get a brief taste - just enough to remind you of those games of old.\n\nDespite its short length (I haven't finished it yet, but I've read that it can be finished is just a few hours) there is quite a bit of grinding.  Not really grinding to level up, mind you.  Just grinding because the random encounter rate on the overworld screen is so high that it actually discourages any time of exploration.  And the rewards from leveling up are so few, that grinding is completely pointless.\n\nI mentioned it is like playing several different games at once.  One of the main complaints that I have is that these various game-styles are largely unrelated in practice.  If you level up and get more life / hit points in the Final Fantasy style turn-based fighting - it does not affect the number of hearts you have in the Zelda-like areas.\n\nI've heard a number of people talk about wasted potential and missed opportunities in this game, and I believe there is some truth in that -- but the game is well worth playing, and I for one seriously hope that those missed opportunities will be fulfilled in some future Evoland 2.  And, if that game comes out - I will certainly be playing.\n\n6.5 out of 10.  Better than average, good - but not great.","February 5, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a ton of fun as long as you see it as an exposition of game style and not as a game itself. It's like playing through a documentary about the game industrys evolution. The game itself is somewhat simplistic, but you do get a chuckle out of it every few minutes and the bosses are tricky enough to keep your attention, but I had two major problems with it.\n\n1. OMG random encounters. Every frickin' second. I understand that you probably want to level the character faster, but after a while I'm just hitting the a button repeatedly while I watch a movie on my other screen and not even paying attention anymore because it just becomes so boring. Once you get the ship it's kind of fixed, but the ship can't go everywhere - like to the starting map etc. If you want me to level faster give me more xp per kill - don't throw more fights at me. If you want me to focus on levelling before the boss, then tell me this and I will go do it - don't force it down my throat. Besides, my levels don't even count when I get to the final boss (I don't think so anyway).\n\n2. The final boss fight. I just unlocked a new type of health bar, why am I back to hearts? No bueno. I understand you want to make this fight difficult, themost difficult in the game even, but do it by being clever, not by making me think you suck at storyboarding.\n\n3. I know I said two problems but this is less a problem more a request. Make it longer! :) I love this game - I want to keep playing! There are so many more engines I could be unlocking! Quake, Source, or Unreal - I would love to play this as a true 3d rpg! Keep going please! :)\n\nThose are my two (three) cents.

This is a game that would have really benefited from having more people working on it, and more time devoted to it.  "Upgrades" are given rapid-fire, with little effort involved.  Only near the end is it ever really used as a gameplay mechanic, and not just some way to pay homage to other games.  The concept deserved a longer, slower approach, where the upgrades are prizes to be earned - and where they impacted the entire world, and not just a part of it.  When you get the 3D upgrades, older dungeons are still stuck in their 2D incarnations.  There are several places where design is frustrating - floors that break away, but don't reveal them quickly enough to avoid unless you move slowly.  The final boss, while having some interesting mechanics, will do unavoidable damage due to not telegraphing properly, or having a random duration.  Even the card game included, an homage to Final Fantasy 8;s Tetra Master (also see in Final Fantasy XI as a side game), chooses cards you own at random for your "deck", making the later levels based more on luck than skill.\n\nThere's a lot of good concepts to be had here.  But this game needed a lot more polish to really let them shine.  As it is, it's just a quick little knock-off title.  And there's nothing wrong with that, if you go into the game knowing that's what it is (which I did), you WILL find entertainment there.  But I cannot recommend the game in this state.  Hopefully, if they do a second, they can put more care into the various parts of it.","January 13, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It quickly jumps through the early eras of gaming, which was the only reason I bought the game, and then devolves into an insipid mishmash of poorly executed gameplay.\n\nTo break it down, the game begins with a Zelda-stlye top down action game, which, while competently executed, lacks the aesthetic beauty, creativity, or excellent design which define excellent games like Link to the Past or Minish Cap. The visuals are uninspired, and the enemy design is limited to very few, extremely repetitive octorock clones and bats. There are one or two interesting boss fights, but it remains dull and uninteresting.\n\nAfter this you are hurled into a truly horrifically designed Final Fantasy clone. Lacking a mana system, it is utterly dull and a chore to grind through. Outdated principals like random encounters and a totally pointless item system makes this truly digusting. To make it worse, this takes up the majority of the games 5 or 6 hour lifespan, and the endgame is almost nothing but it.\n\nThere are a few bright spots. Sort of clever Easter Eggs are hidden in a few spots, and the Diablo style level is both challenging and a scathing mockery of the goofy loot system in such games. Overall, however, the game is disappointing, uninspired, slapdash, and dull. There is no way in hell this thing is worth 10 dollars or your time.

Anyways it looked fun and for ten dollars, to me it looked like it was worth. So I gave it a shot, and to cut the review short to me the game is a four out of five. The different forms of combat are nice, but none of them are to extensive, which makes sense but a couple of other options would have been nice. The 3d to 2d gave an interesting puzzle or two I feel like the developers could have worked this a little more, maybe give the game more flavor. Obviously the game isn't there for a story, which is sad because. . .well I like story, the tale told in this one is generic and bland, and so are the characters. However the game is all around great, mainly because of all the awesome references, I mean how many games do you get to fly star-foxes ♥♥♥♥ and carry around clouds buster blade? None except this and maybe minecraft. It also had a decent boss fight at the end, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the battle, it wasn't super hard or anything but it was fun. The game is by no means hard, but defiantly has it's annoy parts, and despite it only being like a 2-4 hour game I've put more than double that into it, don't ask why, I don't know myself lol. Anyways good purchase I'd say it's worth the price if they lowered it by like three bucks. I think if a little bit more development would have been put into the combat, puzzles and story and not let references sell this game it may have been a 5 out of 5.","October 9, 2014","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SNES? Playstation 1? Then you will most likely enjoy Evoland. It's a charming adventure that will make you chuckle, smile and fondly remember the eras of past gaming - although if you never experienced them or weren't alive when these eras happened I imagine you won't be having much besides a blank stare throughout the entire thing. Thats the biggest point I can make - unless you have experienced these video game eras first hand, the humor and charm will seem nonexistant. If you buy it and expect to be taught a RPG history lesson you will be disappointed.\n\nYou play as the standard everyhero named Clink - an obvious amalgamation of Link and Cloud - the everyheroes of FF7 and Pre-OoT Zelda games. The main thing you'll be doing is finding technology upgrades that will advance the tech from black and white to color, from 8bit to 16bit, adding save points, health meters and much more.\n\nHalfway through the game the tech advances appear less and less and it becomes more of a simple action AND turn-based RPG. But even in these later sections there are some interesting uses of switching between 8bit and 3D render modes to complete puzzles. It's nothing too difficult but overall a clever way of making challenges. My personal favorite area was the "Diablo-clone, action RPG" stage complete with ridiculous loot drops. It's also the only area you can play as Kaeris(I wonder who shes based off of? /endsarcasm)\n\nThe story portion of the game only takes a few hours but there are some collectibles you can search for to extend your play time like Stars or Cards that you can use for the bonus card mini-game(more or less identical to FF8's Triple Triad). The game also has some pretty nice artwork and music - I've found myself humming tunes from the game long after completing it. Heck, I even payed for the soundtrack.\n\nI personally enjoyed this game and I got exactly what I thought I'd get by reading the tagline - a short story about the evolution of RPGs. That said considering the short length and the simplicity of the second half, $10 is a bit steep. Buy it on sale if you can.","November 4, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
