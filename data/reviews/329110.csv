Really I did.  I mean, it's basically Puzzle Quest, and I LOVE puzzle quest.  For a free game, there is a lot of content to it, from quests, to items, challenges, troops for your party, and so on.  I should love this game.\n\nThen I ran out of coins, and could no longer play the game.\n\nTo elaborate, at the start of the game, you're given a few hundred coins.  These aren't used to buy better equipment or level up your soldiers, (as far as I am aware, I may just not have gotten that far yet) they're the currency that lets you play the game at all.\nYes, your kingdom generates a certain number of coins per hour I believe (up to 500 per day max to start) and quests earn you a meager amount, (most I've gotten so far was 9) but every single challenge and quest takes about 50 coins to play.\n\nThe cash shop I don't mind.  It's a free game, and they need to make money to stay in business.  I understand that part.\nBut I will never understand game mechanics that actually prevent you from playing the game.  Any desire I might have for potentially spending money on the shinies is killed by the fact that I just plain can't play the game until a set period of time passes.","November 20, 2014","false","2.3"," 187 of 234 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","187","234","0","6"

The dev has added a lot of new mechanics and content and I feel it's certainly improved the game overall. It's truly free to play now (you don't need to manufacture gold while battling to enter more battles after you run out of your kingdom bonuses and daily gold like it used to be, which is only an issue at the start) and it's also available on android, ios and the consoles so if you end up liking it you got a lot of different ways to play it.\n\nIt's a total grindfest and you need to get into a good guild if you want to make any kind of progress but overall if you like the gameplay and the acquiring of stuff and leveling it up... game delivers.\n\nOriginal flip floppy mess of reviewlike substance\n\nIf you really liked puzzle quest than this game can be enjoyable provided you don't feel lured into going crazy with the PTW dynamics of the game that make a difference with how fast you progress and how strong you get relative to other players.\n\nIf you just PvE at your own pace though and non compulsively it's alright. Stay away if you can't since it's designed to drain your wallet if you let it so with that in mind I can't really recommend it.\n\nEDIT1: It takes a while before you can really afford it but the arena mode is where it's at for free to play players. I got so much stuff out of that mode that it really helped me out with all the rest (as in improving my deck to be more competitive with the more difficult challenges and the 'fake' PvP).\n\nI definitely recommend this to puzzle quest fans that are patient enough to get this to work without spending much if any money.\n\nEDIT2: I played and enjoyed this game for over 100 hours (I do idle but still). I can't in my right mind not recommend the game. The game is perfectly playable for free or you can spend some money during sales to speed up your progress and get a good armor.\n\nBasically if you play smart, you'll be fine as FTP and get a very enjoyable experience if this is your kind of game (ergo puzzle/rpg/strategy hybrid). Just check Tacet's guide for a lot of good pointers and you'll be a gem master... someday.\n\nEDIT3: Back to negative. This game is just too much of a mind screw for those that are susceptible to that to recommend, only try it if you can handle playing and enjoying the game at your own pace and are comfortable now having to HAVE everything that there's to get in the game. I've only spent 2 bucks on the game myself and that's all it's ever going to get from me.\n\nEDIT4: Blah... its basically a lot of fun if you like match 3 and trying out different combinations of troops and the like even with the paywall stuff but if you are sufficiently advanced to belong to a good guild... you can get everything eventually. All depends on the type of gamer you are. No need to go overboard on the spending for the game to be sure with a little discipline.","July 6, 2015","true","382.0"," 103 of 131 people (79%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","79","103","131","27","22"

The game does not revolve around the player trying to make good matches. It revolves around the player trying to avoid creating matches for the AI. But resistance is futile, if you don't create matches for the enemy, the board will make sure to create it for you from outside of the table. You think you made a good skull match? Hah! Think again, because you just created two other for the opponent. It really downplays any kind of strategy.\n\nThen there is the "progression system".\n\nYour currencies are gold, souls, and gems.\n\nGold being your primary resource, is used to "purchase" Towns, towns which will generate you additional money. However gold is also used and is constantly being drained from you through Invasions (PvP of sorts, although still AI controlled) and Quests. A quest has multiple objectives, each objective eats up 50 gold, which ramps up as you advance.) The return of gold on the other hand is very small, always less than the amount you invested. It cripples progression and obviously tries to force microtransactions.\n\nYour abilities from Puzzle Quest are replaced here with Cards, these are unlocked by accidentally stumbling onto a key every 10 years. 1 card/character provides 1 ability. You level up these individually for Souls. Which is yet another gripe with the game. The amount of Souls required to level cards are substantially more every time, while your Soul income from quests is significantly less. And then you are supposed to level more than one cards, but you can barely (if at all) can keep up with one. Not to mention that each levelup feels underwhelming, resulting in 1 statpoint increasing.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe game does not feel rewarding. At all.\nIt weighs towards the frustrating side.\n\nOh, and the writing is brilliant. *sarcasm*\nExamples of your character's lines:\n\n"Okay."\n"Great."\n"Good!"\n"What?"\n\nYep.\n\nThere are other means of getting cards, and other "currencies", but I don't think I'd have to patience to even get there.\n\nNot worth it.","December 14, 2014","false","13.8"," 83 of 108 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","83","108","6","1"

I'd win some I'd lose some, no big deal. Once I hit 50. I can't win to save my life. What happened by leveling to 50?\n\nAlso, I know one person, out of all the people I personally know that play this. I know one person with one Legendary. One. He got really lucky and it was in the very first iron key he opened. Now that being said. All I ever face is four Legendaries. Not even a player. Just four of them.\n\nI know one person with one. M'kay, I know not everyone and there dog has four. I myself have opened a plethora of iron keys and magical keys and have not even seen a single Legendary. Which is why you guys don't get any more money from me.\n\nI've played plenty of CCG's and real life card pack games. Legendary cards while are rare, are not as rare as you've guys have deemed them to be.\n\nI'm just going to call you out on it. All those four legendary accounts above 50, are not legitimate players, they are computer opponents which you've placed in the game. Your PVP at that point is a joke, because really it's just PVE. You are frustrating your own player base. HUGE MISTAKE. Stop it!\n\nChanges you've made that I could slap you for....\n\nI enjoyed playing Gems of War in window mode. I could play, do work when I needed to do something and then pick it up where ever I was. Why oh why must the game reload now. Change it back. That was beyond "dumb". You're creating an annoyance on top of something that's already becoming annoying in the first place.\n\nI didn't mind listening to the in game music while playing gems, it was never great, but I didn't mind it. You're variation of holiday music. :cfacepalm: Are you kidding. Did you listen to this? Or did you just go to some composer and say hey, make us some holiday variant. He gave you what you asked for, and you just put it in the game. Again. You're creating something annoying when there wasn't an annoyance before.\n\nWhen the game first released, in the first couple of weeks or so. I could PVP all day, literally all day, and I'd find 8 to 10 iron keys while playing. That was enjoyable. I've not seen an iron key in a couple of weeks. PVP being the only thing I do when I play gems. I want to say since Dec. 4th. I've seen only one iron key.\n\nIt's like you're making decisions to just "suck the fun" out of your own game... Why would you do that? The first couple of weeks, that this game was available it was very fun. I highly enjoyed it. I promoted you on Twitch and Twitter. Now, I'm just becoming disgusted. Literally I play this and I feel like I'm preforming some kind of Chinese torture upon myself. I repeatedly ask myself, "why am I still playing this?"\n\nMyself and all of my personal friends that play this. At the moment we are no longer playing it for ourselves but just playing it because we want to help our friends out. We've finally made an uninstall pact. When the first person within our group finally gets to the point of disgust that they can no longer handle it anymore they are going to uninstall it. We've all agreed, it doesn't matter who the first person is to uninstall it, but once one of us uninstalls it we're all going to uninstall it. Literally the only reason we are logging in and playing anymore is for each other. Personal enjoyment is completely gone.\n\nI hope you can stop and reflect for a moment, and really absorb what I am saying to you. You've managed to derail your own game. It's time to stop what you're doing and take a meeting. You are going in the wrong direction. If deep down inside you made this game, and the goal was to get as much money as you could in six weeks, and then you're going to just abandon it for another project. That's fine. You've achieved what you were going for.\n\nI really enjoyed Marvel Puzzle Quest in the beginning, and then they made some changes that ruined the game for not only myself but for others. We uninstalled and stopped playing it. You guys helped advise Marvel Puzzle Quest on some of the aspects of their game. Myself and others are beginning to believe that the changes that were made in Marvel Puzzle Quest that we didn't agree with was your suggestions, because of what we are witnessing unfold in Gems of War currently.\n\nI'm not angry, I'm not bitter, I don't want you to think of this as a rant. I'm a game journalist, and I'm giving you a straight up honest, detailed, and informed opinion. I've put 150+ hours in Gems of War. Obviously you were doing something at one point I liked to put that many hours into it. I invested in the game personally, emotionally, and finanacially. I'm beginning to not only have my doubts, but am starting to be filled with regret of even installing.\n\nI originally gave you guys a positive Steam review. I'm going to delete that review now and provide, I don't want to view it as a negative review so much as a warning to anyone that is not currently playing the game.\n\nI hope you guys can find a way to at least salvage this before it is too late, but I'm fearing that we're approaching the point of no return not only for myself, but for many others as well.\n\nTake this for what you will, but I hope you can turn something positive from this.\n\nOne of your gamers,\n\nSaint Killjoy","December 27, 2014","false","149.3"," 80 of 112 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","80","112","0","3"

This games has hours of game play between quests, PVP, Challanges, Own  diffrent kingdooms and oh there is the arena . One Kingdom also has teasure hunt  where you can earn a lot of good prizes, you do have to have a map but it you contribute to your guild you can get all kinds of maps, also sometimes while playing the game will give things like maps , keys and gems . So this game definitley keeps you busy, I am guessing the reason it gotten bad reviews is due to it has a store in it. One I have never bought any gems that require to buy things in the store, I have earn them through the guild I am in.  I have gotten nice store items without paying anything.

Collect troops like pokemon, build them up and find the best combinations to secure victory.  It eased me into PVP without my even knowing it, and there the game truly shined.  Your level didn't matter so much as your strategy and your team building; a low level character could beat a much higher level one if he kept his head.  Best of all, everything that could be purchased could also be found in game with persistance.\n\nSo why the negative review?  Well, each update to the game has taken a little something away.  The gameplay is still casual, but the team building has gotten very complex.  Players with a lot of in game resources (read that "either play obssesively or payed out for them") now have a massive advantage over those that don't.  Also, as these overpowered opponents have so many hit points, even if you can secure a victory, it feels more like a grind than a game.\n\nI'm not going to stop playing, but if you're looking for something fun to start, look somewhere else.","December 17, 2015","false","027.4"," 84 of 129 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","84","129","7","5"

I like the gameplay and the idea of matching the different colored gems to attack your opponent and gaining mana to use special effects. The graphics are nice and the game is pleasant to look at. It’s easy to lose track of time while playing all the quests – if you have the coins to do them.\n\nIt’s got many nice features, but I do have some suggestions for it. Most of these are small changes or additions I’d like to see, but there are a couple of issues I’ll be addressing as well. I feel bad about giving this game a negative review (because it is a good game), but there is an issue that needs to be fixed before I can recommend this game.\n\nThere isn’t too much variety on how your character appears – 6 different races and your gender. So there are really only 12 different appearances your character can have, not including the two types of free armor and (the other ones you have to pay real money for). I’d like to see more variety in customizing your character.\n\nThe gem "hints" can be useful, but not always. Many times it's suggested that I make moves that would not help me and it would help the computer by setting up a combination for its next turn. You can turn these hints off, but I prefer to keep them on for when they actually are helpful.\n\nThere’s a place where you can type to your guild under the announcements button, but none of the users in my guild ever use it and its unclear whether that is supposed to be a guild chat or not. It would be great to have a specific place to chat with your guild that is different from the announcements so they don’t get lost in the chat. It would also be nice if we could have more than 10 members in a guild.\n\nThe coins you earn are used to unlock new content and every time you want to battle, you have to pay coins. You do earn coins every day you log on and your cities do generate coins, so it isn't impossible to play without paying (at least where I am currently in the game). So it hasn’t bothered me that much yet, but it does limit what you can do.\n\nIf there were some changes made to this game (specifically the problems I’ve mentioned), it could be very great. I understand that because it’s a free game they need to try to make money somewhere, but there are so many places, it would be better to just eliminate them and charge for the game.\n\n\nThe main problem I have about this game is how the computer plays against you. I've been in battles where there's not much I can do, and then the AI will get a bunch of combinations. Some of the times I don't see them, which was my fault. But many other times, the way the gems fall into place after you've made a move will cause the computer to make more combos. I've seen them get multiple in a row - like six or more - just because of the way they fall into place. This also happens with the skulls, which are used to attack. If there's an open spot between two of them, more often than not I've noticed that a skull will fill in. The way it's set up is for the AI to win.\n\nThe AI will make the best possible moves available (often that were a result of how the gems fell in after my turn).  So it allows the computer to gain more mana and attack more often. The AI also has better troops, because they want you to buy them. I’ve gotten some by playing the game, but the best troops are available by buying a magic key (to unlock the chest) to increase the rarity of the cards won, which are random. You can level up your troops by spending souls, which are won by each opponent you defeat. However, if you keep being beat, your soul count goes up very slowly or doesn’t change.\n\nThe game is set for the AI to win. It’s as simple as that. If that problem was fixed and the game wasn’t relying quite as heavily on paying, I would give this a positive review.\n","December 23, 2014","false","23.7"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","44","62","0","1"

I've seen many reviews depicting that game as a mixture of Puzzle Quest and Hearthstone. Well, haven't played either of them, so I'll describe Gems of War a bit more in detail.\n\nAs you can see from screenshots, you got table with jewels, which needed to be moved together, and you have some cards on the sides, 4 for you and 4 for your opponent. There are two ways to win the round: first, you collecting skulls - that's a direct attack, second, you collecting some colour jewels to fill "mana" pool of your units, to perform some specials, unique for every card. And since there are more than 120 different cards, you can gather thousands of combinations of them. Some will be better in particular single-player quests, some - for multiplayer battles.\n\nAbout multiplayer - being a single-play focused type of gamer, I really enjoying that part. But if you are want to actually battle with somebody on "who's better match 3-rows", that's not your game. For you don't actually making PvP there. You accessing cards of other players, and fight with AI, which using another player's stats and card combination.\n\nNice thing for that type of "multiplayer" casual game is that you don't have any time counter. It is good for mobile games which you are playing while taking some quick-brake. So you can easily stop playing this game, and return to your main tasks (and vise versa), without any delays. Which is good when you driving in heavy traffic, with big jams on your way, for example...\n\nSo. You start your game with some basic cards, quite easily gaining more cards, the most of achievements (except of 3, where you need to play alot for making more exp for levels)... If you're wandering how much is that a "pay-to-win", well, like I said, the focus of that game is on the single-play. All of the selling content can be collected without any payments. So you need to pay only if you want to get on some top roaster from the start, and bend everything on your way from the 1st level. But! Even there it is better if you can actually play the game, and not using super-powers. Without paying any money, on my 30th level I win the most of my battles (more than 80%), just being good with matching jewels. And yeah, I've played versus 80th levelled players (more precisely, their decks and stats with AI) and usually I'm winning. I've seen some reviews from pro-players, who spended hundreds of hours there, that "pay-to-win" becoming a problem lately, much more, than it was before. Dunno. Haven't noticed so far (about 75 hours of playtime and 40 levels gained).\n\nThe only real problem is that Gems of War is a server-based game, and every your step should be loaded via internet, to move forward. You can't proceed with anything there without net connection, and if the game loosing that connection, it is freezing until you get back on line.\n\nConclusion. For a free-play game, this one is very solid. The concept is not original, but so far, it is quite properly balanced. If you can play "match 3" games over and over, I easily recommend you that one, for being variable enough, challenging enough, and fair enough. I can conveniently play it as replacement of my precious Windows Minesweeper and Solitaire games. Well, maybe not as replacement, but good addition to that list.\n\nMy mark 7/10. I plan to get the 100th level, but it will be after about 150-200 hours of play, so it is not a good game for quick gold on achievements (even with cash invested).","January 17","true","247.3"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

The basic gameplay is fine (essentially playing Bejeweled against an opponent on the same board), although the luck factor is extremely high--frustratingly so from my perspective.\n\nThe combat system adds the extra element of a player's party.  In theory, it adds a nice feature to the game; it rewards tactical and strategic thinking, and gives the player incentive to build a party.  But that just makes the high luck factor all that much more frustrating, from my perspective--I hate having the right team, and making the right play, but losing because the skyfall set my opponent up for an insanely good string.\n\nAlso, the monster skills could use a balance pass or two, but that's a fairly minor complaint.  Nothing feels broken--it's just odd that the minions of a boss are sometimes more powerful than the boss itself, or that a monster might have a skill that's just flat-out better than a similar skill held by a monster of similar rarity and gem color.\n\nThe artwork is fine, in a cartoony sort of way.  The plots (each kingdom you purchase has its own) are funny and absurdist, which I appreciated.  The music isn't great, but isn't bad.\n\nThe UI and new player tutorials are pretty bad--hopefuly they get fixed.   For example:  you can save different party compositions, but you can't alter those party compositions without starting a battle.  Those party compositions are heavily dependent on which weapon your player is using--but you have to change weapons from the main map screen.  The game is full of menus, challenges, side quests, and features, none of which are properly explained.  Again, fixable, but frustrating.\n\nIn any case, if they fix the tutorial and UI, and give the game a balance patch, I would probably change my review to "recomend"--if you are really into match-games with a bit of strategic thinking.  But even then, there are better games out there than this one.","January 8, 2015","false","14.5"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","38","53","0","1"

Also, the PvP is not an actual, live matchmaking system but a matchmaking with someone's roster where the cheating, unmistakable A.I gets luck rolls with OP cards (like that worms that burrows itself, damages the last unit in your roster for 6 points, then creates a ♥♥♥♥-load of brown gems and gets extra turns and the ability to do that on the next turn as well.)\n\nAll in all, an unbalanced, pitiful excuse from people that developed REAL gems like Puzzle Quest 1 and 2. They stooped so low you may as well refer to them as "Cash-grab + Infinity" instead of Infinity + 2...","November 24, 2014","false","19.3"," 68 of 108 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","68","108","0","1"

To get those in "large" amount like with the ranking system you need either to already be strong or use your credit card.\n\nIn other word, harder time for new ones that will be disgusted, easier for old ones and money wasters that will also be disgusted of the lack of challenge after a few weeks.\nWhat is hard to understand in "A challenging game is not a game that brings more power to already powerfull player"???\n\nGame totally broken, try an other one.\n\nOne more game to fall (after Robocraft recently).

When a developer has to post a sticky (over 200 posts) about it's own game not cheating, you know it's bad. Usually posts about cheating from developers revolve around player misconduct, but not this game. There's zero player vs player. Their idea of making it difficult is giving itself advantages moves that occur off the board or there is literally no moves left except for a move that would be bad for you. Even if the computer has one or two colors to gain mana and you cleared the board of it, 9 times out of 10 it will get it from cascades. It will make moves that don't help itself and suddenly turns into a chain or extra turn.\n\nIf that doesn't drive you to either quit or pay money, they raised the cost to level your cards and they increase their level cap. The only people to truely benefit from that is the developers because now that means they can prolong the time it would take to max everything out. It didn't help the players certainly not the new players who now have a harder time to catch up to everyone. This brings me to their pseudo pvp. The only thing that your opponent controls is the setup, but you're essentially still playing PVE. They also make the match ups completely lopsided, so new players will have to deal with veteran players who have the advantage of already having a max team. Their latest attempt in adding content is a draft game, which has been out for over a month and a half now, Is just the worst part of this game. In addition to the computer being rediculous, the cards you picked from the draft may disappear and be replaced with cards that you didn't choose. This is a known issue since it's introduction that the developers have made no compensation or actions to fix their programming. They also rarely stay up to date with their steam players, so expect your posts to be forgotten and have to repost it like spam.\n\nIf you want to play this game, then don't spend money. Let the developers bleed out more till they understand that when profits become more important than the players the game will not live long, and the community should not condone it with fundings. Just like Transformers, it is our duty as the consumer to not support their choices. Great games do not drive into a corner to earn your money. Great games get support from players because we want the game to have longevity.","March 29, 2015","false","014.1"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","37","55","3","0"

The next opponent will be just as, if not moreso difficult as it becomes sheer tedium to lose over and over until you happen to land a particularly lucky sequence. Relying on luck rather than skill/strategy is a pointless and unrewarding venture.\n\nLike others have said before me, to play this game without paying for it, you must spend inordinate amounts of time "not-playing" it, instead logging in daily to collect your gold bonuses and saving up to buy things that may or may not make you competitive.

It does cost 50-60 gold to battle but you can earn  a basic return of 25+ gold back each fight, over 100 gold if its PVP plus 4-5 gold everytime you get 4 or 5 in a row. I can easily break even or make a profit in the majority of fights.\n\nThe game matches PVP players which I have found to be very reasonable and well balanced.\n\nSecondly, if you complete all of a cities quests you win that cities hero card so it is possible to build a team of 4 good monsters/heroes. I think it took me about 5 days to gain the first city hero card without paying anything. I have no doubt as you progress the top players will pay to play but you can still have a really good experience without doing so if you really want.\n\nAfter about 6 days of playing i bought some keys and the return was very good compared to other games I have played. I did get several high quality cards.\n\nNo doubt the guild system requires a lot more work but again you can play without a guild quite easily.\n\nSo give it a go its a really good game and it is free to play  :)\n","December 1, 2014","true","142.4"," 43 of 73 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","43","73","0","1"

If you've enjoyed the Puzzle Quest games, then this one is up your alley. It's free to play and even with the Gold "energy system", it's still a blast to play without having to spend a dime.\n\nYour team consists of 4 members which is usually your hero and 3 other Troop cards.\nTroops can be earned from Iron Keys (random chance, 1000 gold, guild tasks) or Magic Keys (real money).\nTroops level up by enchanting them with Souls. Max level as of now is level 10.\nSouls are gained by killing enemy Troops, completing Kingdom challenges, disenchanting duplicate Troop cards, PVP rewards, and guild tasks.\n\nFor every Kingdom quest line that you complete, you are awarded with the Epic card for that kingdom so no need to spend money on Magic Keys unless you really want a chance at those Legendaries.\n\nThings will start out a bit slow since you only have 1 Kingdom and a basic team but hang in there. Once you unlock more kingdoms and join a guild, Iron Keys will become frequent and gold won't seem like a huge deal.\n\nRead on for more tips on Gold and maximizing it. WARNING wall-o-text inc.\n\nIn Gems, Gold is used to initiate battles and unlock new kingdoms. Each unlocked kingdom will produce Gold for you if you complete up to a certain point in their quest lines, however, you can set one kingdom as your home kingdom to give you bonus gold and mana. Your home kingdom will produce for you 500 gold per 24 hours, or 525 gold if you completed the quest line for it.\n\nIf you log in once a day, you will receive a daily log in bonus. The bonus begins at 50 gold and then maxes out at 300 gold. The day resets at 7pm EST/6pm CST.\n\nGems also runs PVP events that will rotate every 2 weeks. So far, the events give you an additional 200 gold per day.\n\nMy recommendation is to join a guild. The guild will give you an initial daily gold bonus of 5% and of course, the percentage bonus will be higher the higher ranked the guild is.\n\nThis is what it looks like so far on a Day 7+ log in with one completed kingdom:\n\nHome Kingdom: 525 gold\nDay 7+ Daily Bonus: 300 gold\nPVP Event: 200 gold\nGuild Bonus (5% to daily): 25 gold\nTotal: 1050 gold / 24 hours for just logging in\n\nOther ways to maximize Gold is to play smart. Matching 4 or 5-in-a-row will give you 4 gold and 5 gold respectively. If you are decent at match-3 games and setting up moves for those 4 & 5-matches, you will seldom, if not never, run out of Gold. Out of my playtime on Gems, I have yet run out of Gold once.\n\nThere are also several Troop cards that give you Gold as their ability such as the Alchemist:\n\nAlchemist\nTransform a selected Mana color to Yellow. Gain [3+Magic] Gold.\n\nAt Level 10, he will give you 8 Gold and then you can choose a color to change to yellow and net yourself easy 4 or 5-in-a-row matches.\n\nTip: The maximum gold you can earn per battle from Troop skills and 4 & 5-matches is 105 gold.\n\nWith Troops like the Alchemist, you can come out of a battle hitting the 105 gold cap easily. And when battles cost 50 gold - 80 gold, you've made profit every battle.\n\nThe biggest gold costs are unlocking kingdoms. It costs 250 gold to unlock your first kingdom and then every kingdom after that costs 250 gold extra (e.g. 500, 750, 1000, etc). There's really no way to lessen the blow so just save up :)","December 16, 2014","true","368.8"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","29","47","0","1"

You will need about 40 of these little doohickeys to actually do ONE upgrade for one unit, and each unit has multiple upgrades to it..  Yay for progress?\n\nUnfortunately I have to recommend that people stay away, there are better match 3 games out there that are less driven to push microtransactions.  While I liked the game overall and I love the puzzle quest games, the continuining path of pushing microtransactions harder and harder with each patch made me stop playing.

Not the worst ofthem, but there are many others I enjoyed more.\n\nBasically the issues are;\nWhile the cascade chains tend to be rarer, the falls are heavily in favor of the AI, it will almost always get something to make your life miserable.\n\nIt is built backwards from what a game like this should be.  It is a grind for the beginning player.  A terrible terrible grind.\nEverything you want to do uses gold, But every win you get returns a lower quantity of gold than you spent to perform the action, and every lose is pretty much a 100% loss - The only exception is the quasi-pvp matches, where you can get slightly better than double the returns on your investment... until you reach a mid-rank pvp area when the game starts heavily cheating and you are losing as often as you win, so this is where the grind comes in... trying to make enough gold together to expand into a reasonable roster, while trying to overcome the constant hemorrhaging of gold.\nThe backwardsnes of the game is that the systems in place make it so that the longer you play and and take advantage of the world mechanics in place, and get your team to a more competetive level, the easier, and more money money you make, but since there are no real high-level gold expenditures, there reaches a point where money is unimportant and you don't care about it anymore.\n\nIf the game found more a middle ground where the early game didn't feel like death, I'd probably recommend trying it out if Match-3 is your thing.  As it stands, I find it an exercise in masochism that I am not interested in.","January 11, 2015","false","258.5"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelfore/recommended/329110/","zelfore","Zelfore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelfore/","993 products in account","Gems of War is a CCG Match-3 Puzzle RPG. Every one of these elements has a pivotal stake in the gameplay, so if any of these elements are considered undesirable to you, the game could begin to feel like a slog at certain points.\n\nCross-Platform between PC/Mobile, while the Xbox/Playstation versions are purely independent and are unable to connect across platforms. Keep this in mind when choosing which platform to play on. (Certain features are exclusive to Xbox and Playstation, while other features might be missing.)\n\nGems of War has come a long way from when I first started. This is a bit of a running theme with how active patches are in the game, completely reworking some mechanics every couple or few months. Adaptability is very important to have in this case. If you don't like change, whether in your team setup, new features, or reworked mechanics, I highly recommend you against playing this game.\n\nBut even among all the differences between when I first started and now, a few things have always remained the same. The core gameplay, the weekly excitement, and the amazing developers.\n\nCore GameplayAs mentioned in the beginning of this review, GoW has 3 very consistent points to stand on.\n\nCollectible Card Game  - If you've ever played a CCG online game, you'll no right off the bat that trading is a no go. There's no clear plans of this changing anytime soon either. So if you're desperate to get that one troop card you really want, you'll have to leave your fate in the hands of the RNG.\n\nMatch-3 Puzzle - Power up your troop's spells by collecting on board colored gems. You can match skulls instead to inflict attack damage. These are both very important to your success in winning a match. Troops spells often offer board control to manipulate the playing field to your advantage, or possibly screw yourself over. 4+ matches also offer an extra turn, meaning another free match before the opponent gets to play, so thinking out your moves and observing the board carefully are important.\n\nRole-playing Game - Leveling, Ascension, and Traits are all key aspects in powering-up your troops to better handle opponents. Obviously some troops will outshine others, some times you'll need to use another team to handle the situation better than your primary one. There's many ways to learn how to build your teams, but the best one is the Arena, an important minigame that'll teach you team synergy and introduce you to all sorts of spells.\n\nWeekly ExcitementWeekly events are what they're known as, and are a fun way to keep you interested in playing. Whether it's a new troop or Hero weapon, not a week's gone by since I began playing that there wasn't something to look forward to.\n\nSome months a new kingdom is introduced, and other months we've got a whole new patch to explore! The amount of content provided so frequently is mind-boggling sometimes, and keeps my interest firmly gripped for whatever may come next.\n\nThe DevelopersYou honestly won't see them much around the Steam community or in the AppStore, but if you give their online forums[community.gemsofwar.com] a chance, you'll quickly realize how much attention they pay to player feedback. They keep active and enjoy chatting with the community, even when things get rather heated.\n\nSupport will also quickly look into and resolve issues as soon as possible, they've even offered apology gifts to compensate the delay on occasion.\n\nNegative Points?Some people have expressed concern or a hatred for certain aspects of the game, so I'll be addressing these issues here so you can know to avoid the game if they aren't to your liking.\n\nF2P or P2W? - The game is most assuredly Free 2 Play. The most that money will reward you is Pay 2 Progress faster. I, myself, have not spent even a dime on the game. This isn't out of disrespect for the devs or because of a lack of thanks for an (imo) amazing game, but to help prove a point that everything in this game can be achieved without spending any money whatsoever.\n\nCheating AI? - The game has 50-100% random board drops. This is both a good and bad thing, as you can get massive cascades and possibly never lose a turn to the opponent (with decent board control), but the flipside to this is that the opponent has the same possible luck, meaning some matches can feel lost without any skill involved. This is rare, being normally a 1/10 chance you'll lose this way, but the better you improve your builds and plan out your matches, the less likely this is to occur. Just know that randomness is a factor.\n\nToo Many Resources? - I won't sugar coat it. There's a lot to take in as the games progressed over this time. Gold, Souls, Gems, Keys, Glory, Maps, Traitstones. All of it's important, but the positive to this is how much there is to do! And you can never get stuck, there's always someway to recoup your losses or an alternate route of progression, but practice and learning are factors that never fade.\nVerdictSo is this game for you? If the idea of a Match-3 RPG with countless hours of play (700+ hours now and not even halfway done) sounds interesting to you, definitely give it a shot.","April 1","true","885.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

As others have mentioned the game makes sure AI gets an advantage with numerous extra turns. Enemy power level also scales up so fast you're almost required to spend money to buy upgrades. If you own Puzzle Quest, play that instead.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that some elements of the game's art, such as the victory screen and card design seem somewhat familiar. And the way you open a chest with cards in it is by dragging a key to it, flipping the cards over by clicking on them, and the game announcing rare cards. All this bears a striking resemblance to a certain card game about stones of the hearth.","February 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Ever noticed how those obstacles seem to be more accurate or faster depending on the contestant? Well say 'hello' to the video game equivalent! You're never really playing a 'game' when you're playing Gems of War. You are simply participating in the most blatant 'skinner-box'-ing I've ever seen.\n\nAt first glance the game is rather appealing. 'Match-three'-style gameplay with collectable card-based units that have differing levels of health and armor, along with various special abilities. Abilities which are charged by clearing colors corresponding to that unit. A lot of fun and hints at a strategic depth that could really keep you searching for that perfect member for your team!\n\nUnfortunately there is a hidden player in every game: The skinner-box.\n\nSee, you're supposed to win some games and lose others. That keeps you motivated, interested and encourages you to monetize by buying items for real money. The game is pretty set on this so you'll see a lot of strange things start to happen. Maybe the computer seems to be smarter during this round. Maybe the computer quite blatantly holds back on the final blow. Maybe the computer (or you) is particularly lucky in what pieces drop from the top. It isn't very obvious at first, but the longer you play the more blatant it becomes. At my current level of skill it's like a fork in the eye. My opponent almost never lands a blow unless it's with pieces that dropped down after my turn. I've seen the computer go on streaks of up to 6 moves (you get more moves if you combine 4 or more pieces at once), while I myself have never gotten higher than three. I've seen four attack blocks come down from the top, clearing themselves and allowing my AI opponent to go again. I've seen the game basically go as far as it possibly can to stop me from winning. Strangely, I've seen it do the same to let me win. I've been a turn away from defeat, only to 'luckily' receive the blocks I needed and enough of them to get another turn, followed by 'luckily' getting attack blocks in just the right place to be able to defeat my enemy.\n\n\nAnd there we come to the crux of the issue. This is a failed game. It doesn't reward skill. It doesn't punish failure. It simply is. You could sit your four-year-old in front of it, and he'd do decently with the skinner-box looking over him, or you could put the grand-champion matcher and... he'd do decently.\n\n\nSo stay away from this game. There are plenty others that do what it does, only better.","November 30, 2014","false","30.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Don't belive what the devs tell you until you can experiance it first hand. I have even streamed this game and people agree this game is heavily pay to win with poison everybody + straight to HP damage troops. With patch 1.0.3 coming soon ( http://gemsofwar.com/patch-preview-1-0-3/ ) I have instantly lost what little faith I had in "PvP" (AI controlled players' troops) balancing, and the game becomes more of a money grab than anything. The puzzle aspect is way more luck than actual puzzle.\n\nWhat is really dumb about the PvP is that it really isn't PvP; It's pseudo PvP with players' troops that the AI controls. You would think the makers of Puzzle Quest wouldn't regress like this, but it seems like they did with this mobile port.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, and gave it more than a fair shot to show me any redeeming factor after putting a lot of hours into it. They should feel ashamed for hunting for microtransaction "whales" in this "PvP" game. Really sad that they wanted to butcher what worked pretty well in Puzzle Quest 1, but all they kept was the broken AI.","December 2, 2014","false","51.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Spending cash does give you an advantage but this is a connect 3 game so if you suck at the basic premise of connecting gems in a row then all the cash advantages in the world won't save you.\nI kind of like it, actually as its been a long time since I played a "fremium" game that actually had gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately this game is just a reskin of Puzzle Quest and rightly so since its the same dev team. Why make it online then? To play against other people of course! Except you can't, you can only play against the AI controlling their team.\n\nThis...Is why I can't recommend it. You can take any of the Puzzle Quest games or any Bejewelled game and get the same experience so why play this? The only thing that would set it apart from its peers, online real-time matches, is absent so I end up asking myself why should I play this over my Nintendo DS copy? Or the bazillion other match 3 games that exist out there.\n\nPresentation is also bland, this game seeks to appeal to a broad audience so expect no riviting story-telling or anything to grab you into the world of...Whatever world this even is.\n\nMusic, SFX, graphics, everything seems ever so slightly off. I am not sure how much is recycled and how much is new but take the music for example, it really tries to be an orchastrial piece but it has no theme to it, its like lord of the rings music playing while you are riding an elevator, its nice on its own but it doesn't fit in and seems to not even be made for the game itself.\nVoice acting falls into this category as well; "Is it as painful as it is flashy?" she exclaims while I swing a hammer. Isn't that a line that should be spoken when I cast a spell? All read in monotone as well, of course.\n\nGems of War is a fun game because match 3 games are fun. Its like Arkanoid or Medal of Honor, the clones are fun but only because they copied the base game and repainted it, not because of anything they bring by themselves.\n\nIf you like Bejewelled or Connect 4, then you will feel right at home playing this but it also brings nothing those types of games don't already offer either so the choice is yours.\n\nOn the note of matchmaking however despite the AI controlling your foe, every player has an avatar and every level that avatar gets stronger. Matchmaking ignores this completely so you end up fighting players who you can never hope to beat and it costs you gold.\n\nInfact lets talk about gold!\nThis is a free to play game so you know the drill by now hopefully but just to quickly recap, Gold = Worthless money and Diamonds = Premium money that unlocks the good stuff (in these free to play type games).\n\nNormally you also have a stamina system as well so you can only play or do so much in a day before you spend cash or go elsewhere. In this game there is no stamina system! Yay! Instead you use your "worthless" gold, as stamina. You use it a lot!\n\nYou need it for everything, playing a stage, unlocking a stage, unlocking a new world, PvP, PvE, buying new cards, you get the idea.\nSo gold runs out, FAST. It is also deducted first so if you find yourself accidently clicking or in a quest that is way too hard for you, then, well, sorry.\nIt was an interesting choice but you need gold to enter PvE so if you run out, you are not getting anymore, you are out of luck! Strange design decision but as with all games of this type you can spend money to get more or you can wait.\nWaiting is always an option.\n\nSo yeah, sorry my review is so bland for this game but the game itself is mediocre. It has a few failings here and there but unless this is your first connect the colors game then chances are you will probably already be playing this or other games like this one and if you are not into puzzle games then you really are not going to be won over by this one either. If you hate fremium games then by all means pick up any of the dozen Puzzle Quest games, not sure why this one doesn't have Puzzle Quest in its name but its by the same people so you get the same experience.\n\nOriginally posted by GoW Team:GoW Team  [developer]\nHi x2Madda,\n\nThank you very much for your feedback. Due to popular demand, it no longer costs gold to play Quests and PvP. We understand if your concerns about synchronous PvP are not enough to tip the scale but we wanted to reach out in case the gold costs were the main sticking point for you. If so, we would really appreciate it if you gave the game a second chance and reconsidered your review.

In fact, the same items being offered for real money are often actually available to everyone, (though the droprate might be kind of low).

Always connected means that if your internet drops, or their servers lag, or a mouse farts in china.... you drop connection.  Now you might be saying "But Rhev, I have a good connection!"  Yeah, you know what?  So do I, normally.  But in about an hour and a half I lost connection three different times.

It will take the obvious four block break, or the skulls that do damage most of the time. Occationally though, the AI will ignore these to go for some basic three block break, which then causes a series of awesome combos to fall from off screen.\n\nI'm not saying that the game is cheating when this happens, but it sure feels that way.\n\nWhichever.

It feels far to much like one of those free facebook games like Candy Crush Saga. However, there is the elements of card collecting and a little turn-based RPG thrown in. It's not a bad game, don't get me wrong. But little annoyances here and there can really get to you. Like figuring out that you have to pay with in game currency in order to do a quest but suddenly can't afford it because you've spent it all doing quests in the first place! You don't even make back in rewards what you spent to do the quest either.\nAlso, while the AI doesn't cheat there is really something funky going on with it. This is quite obvious and I'm not the only one to notice this. While I'm not up for the challenge I do get very p-ed off when I am able to get a couple mana surges in a row and then on my opponent's turn he is able to drop down 'randomly' five mana surges and a couple attacks while he's at it. This has happened on more than one occasion and if I have to I will record it.\nOn the other hand, the AI will rarely be as dumb as a board. When this happens it's quite fun to watch. As such, I recommend playing with game hints off as this really does you little good and you'll have a better chance of winning without it. Once your eyes adjust to the game board and the patterning you'll be more on level ground. That, and A LOT of luck! And I DO mean that.\nAs said, it's not a bad game and I will continue to play it. But little things here and there irk me enough to make me not recommend it to people. I also really wish the PvP battles really were PvP and not against the AI. I think this would have made a fun and unique element to throw in.","January 9, 2015","false","56.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","1"

You can be CLEARLY winning a match, just to have one move by the CPU wipe out your entire side, all due to luck. This could be viewed as a fun gameplay mechanic, but it just comes across as overwhelmingly frustrating. It takes away from the fun of the game, and should be changed.\n\n* It's good this game is free-to-play, because spending money on it would be horribly stupid. Nothing that can be bought with real money is worth it, and the whole game can be experienced without paying. Again, don't waste any of your money on this game.\n\n* Here it is 25Jan2015, and the game still has it's Xmas theme. Music, loading screens, etc. It's no longer Xmas guys, wake up. How much longer are we going to have to listen to Xmas carols this year?\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a simple puzzle game to kill 10-15 mins, this will kinda work.

Victory is meaningless without them. Outmaneuvering a game like this can be immensely satisfying and well worth your efforts.  On the other end of the spectrum,  constantly losing a game - any game - that overwhelms you with unecessarily difficult or next-to-impossible challenges quickly becomes frustrating, if not infuriating, and that's what's going on in Gems of War. ft doesn't take long for you to realize that the developers are in total control of every outcome of every match you play here, that random number generators, luck and skill have nothing whatsoever to do with the experience.  No matter what you do, how many guilds you join, how often you allow them to post to your Facebook page, or how many dollars you throw at this game to embellish your troops or your main character, once you reach the advanced level of the game, you will not win.  Gems of War doesn't want to challenge you.  It wants to make you angry, and at that it truly succeeds.\n\nPlay this game long enough and you'll see for yourself:  at a certain point, the AI literally takes control of the match and gives itself 6 turns in a row to your every 1.  Super powered monsters come out of their respective lairs and blow your characters to smithereens leaving you sitting there slack jawed and stunned, with nothing to show for your efforts.  Blatantly rigging a game in this manner is audacious and mean spirited, not to mention just plain stupid.

If there was a far better gameplay system I might reconsider my opinion, but as it is, it becomes too restricting with no way to block the obvious overpowered computer players in later quests and seemingly imp[ossible combinations of gems appearing only when the computer needs it.  there is no challenge in this game as it does not require any skill, and even though it has a satisfying control system and item card system, upgrading cards is a pointles exercise leading to the inevitable "buy upgrades with real world money" cycle of purposefully blocking progress unless you invest.

There is something elegent about mashing together a match 3 and deck building game. Being a match 3, there is always an element of luck to winning. There is also a lot of skill that goes into building a good deck. The two are as balanced as it gets.\n\nDespite being an always online game with guild and chat features, it is a single player game. Even the PVP feature puts you against a player created team controlled by AI. This is the biggest thing I can fault the game for. I would love if the game were to have true PVP, or at least an offline mode.\n\nBeing a F2P game, I must also mention the payment model. The game currently follows a pay to grind less model. While everything except the newest piece of armor is obtainable for free, it will take a long time to get normally in game. Currently, the amount of available troops is expanding faster than I can generate resources to upgrade them.

This game is predicated on two extremely broken concepts:\n\n1.  The person who moves first in this game (which is you) has an overwhelming advantage in a short game.\n2.  The AI is overwhelmingly stronger than most players in a long game.\n\nSo you start your game and you're easily able to leverage your first move advantage and beating the AI down easily, and you think this is a fair game for a F2P or that you're just so awesome at this game.  Then, eventually the game gets longer as AI comes with more complete teams + higher level teams with HP values your team can't touch.  Since the AI pretty much never evaluates a match 4/5 or a skull situation wrong, eventually you're going to make a bad move and watch the AI merciless pound your guys to oblivion.  Now this is where most reviews will claim the game is P2W or the AI is cheating.  But it's not that.  Even if you spent hundreds of dollars on the game your slightly stronger team will still get pounded horribly whenever you make a mistake, but if you got enough money on your guys you might be able to withstand the barrage.  Of course, for those who aren't big spenders you'll simply lose and run out of your gold.  You can try again or grind some more but overall it doesn't change the fact that as games drag on, you'll simply be beaten by AI's flawless evaluation of the key scenarios, and evaluating those scenarios correctly determines the winner about 90% of the time.\n\nOf course, the lack of information on your cards from an in game source makes any attempt to put together a team a wild guess at best.  There are skills that reads like "does 2 + damage based on number of reds".  How much damage?  You don't know unless you check a forum for a guy who has worked out the math.  So you face a significant deficit and you don't even necessarily know how your skills will work.  Can you expect this guy to be able to tank or that guy to be able to do damage at level 10?  Better check a guide elsewhere, because this information isn't available in the game short of leveling the character up yourself, and there's no way you can afford to do that just as an experiment.\n\nI suspect if you spent enough time/money on the game you'll eventually reach some kind of equilibrium where you have enough high level characters with enough cheap skills to reduce the average game to a length short enough to be even, but I don't know why anyone should be expected to put up with the abuse on the way getting there.  The game by design is meant to hurt and I guess you win when you can overcome the beating.  Or you can just not play the game.","December 2, 2014","false","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Nah, just L2P!\n\nLong version:\nIs this Free to Play or Pay to Win? No, it's just Learn to Play! If you do, you will not need to pay anything in the store.

This is not really a match-3, it is a match-4! A match-4 gives an extra turn. The AI is not cheating as so many lazy guys have been complaining about, it follows certain rules of its own, always! So find them out and use it against it. It always does match-4 first even if there are spells or skull moves that could make it win the game, then it does skulls, them spells. It almost never does anything clever, like a move that will create a cascade of matches. This gives you the chance to outwit it. I regularly can win an opponent 3 times stronger than me. At level 200 I could beat the level 1000 opponents. But if I am not careful or if I play a new combination of troops I may easily lose by an opponent half my level. Use the quests and the challenges to learn the best conbinations for you. Study the opponent to find which troops are the really dangerous ones. In other words Learn to Play! Then join a guild and play PvP. It no longer costs gold to play so you can play as much as you like, and you get traitstones, gold and souls to help you upgrade.\n\nThe original Puzzle Quest was one of my best games.

As it currently stands though, it is very much a pay to win (or at the very least pay to not tear your hair out). Making better use of gold as a resource vs an energy source would make this a much better gaming experience. It is playable and even fun here and there, but I wouldn't put too much time into it.\n\nLooked into PvP to make some gold as suggested by another poster. I was put up against higher levels EVERY time and usually they were 15-20 levels higher. There are zero checks and balances that would make this a fun game for the casual gamer.","February 21, 2015","false","82.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I dont know why specifically. If I were to describe the game to someone who had never played I would probably say something along the lines of it being like Bejeweled and Hearthstone had a baby. Though I know this is actually pretty far from accurate, its the first feeling I had when I started playing the game.\n\nI personally feel that Gems of War being a mobile game has little effect on me enjoying it. Yes there is a cash shop, and there is a type of currency you need to keep playing, but I have seldom run in to any situations where I need more and cant get any, or have to pay.  I have to say overall I enjoyed what I played of Gems of War, and while I will admit its not a game for everybody. I feel that it could very much have a playerbase large enough to sustain it.","December 15, 2014","true","6.3"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

At least that's what I feel a match-3 game should be. Except I found in Puzzle Quest that there was so much reliance on RNG (random number generator) as far as gems falling from the sky, that the game was: A.) swingy (you could dominate, only for your opponent to pull a victory from out of nowhere and vice versa.), and B.) time-consuming. What should have been five minutes or less was suddenly 15-20 minutes, and the scope of the game simply just does not justify the time investment.\n\nTo use a tabletop game parallel (if you like tabletop games), it'd be if like Zombie Dice was an hour long. After 10 minutes, it'd be obnoxiously boring  to the point that it wears out its welcome. Puzzle Quest is no different.\n\nSo when I stumbled into Gems of War and how it was designed by people who worked on Puzzle Quest, I was hopeful. Thematically, it appeared to be in the vein of Puzzle Quest with a brighter art style, and more appealing to me than let's say a Candy Crush. Honestly, I was thinking it'd be an evolution of the Match-3 game, where games were quick and fun, where the RNG was reduced in its impact, making the game less swingy. At least that's what I was hoping for. Instead, what I got was essentially the same game as Puzzle Quest, except the RNG is just as bad, making the game swingy as all hell both in terms of difficulty and time. Even worse, so much of the design is now blatantly micro-transaction driven. You can buy gems (which are hard to come by in-game, naturally.), which in turn can be used to by keys (to unlock troops), gold (it costs money to engage in battles), costumes (playing dress-up that affords buffs), and souls (XP to level up your troops; typically earned by playing battles.)\n\nUltimately, I wish I could put a 'maybe' in recommending this game. Despite my occasional anger at this game, I actually would recommend this game with the caveats I stated above: luck-driven, and unpredictably swingy and time-consuming. If you care about these things, you may want to look elsewhere for a good bite-sized puzzle game. Gems of War may be worth checking out, even playing occasionally, but nothing more. Certainly, you shouldn't pay any money for this game. Just buy Puzzle Quest / Puzzle Quest 2 (one-time transactions) and enjoy what is essentially the same experience.","February 24, 2015","false","34.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

When I get around to playing this game again I will update this review. At this current moment in time I recommend you give this game a try and form your own opinion of it.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game. It's a little different to the puzzle quest games I've played before, but enjoyable none the less. However my enjoyment was cut short. Turns out for each game you play you spent in-game gold to play. This is usually 50 gold, but for pvp games it's significantly higher. You can get gold by completeing guest, which requires you spend some,  during the course of a game and daily. Now two of those require you have enough gold to play a game to gain the gold to play another game. Not useful when you haven't got enough to play a game. The other option means waiting, so I now can not play this game until some 24 hours after this post.\n\nSo in short, if you fancy something you can do stuff on every now and then, the I recommend this game to you. If you're looking for something to last a bit longer, then I suggest you look for something else, which is what I'm now doing.\n\nI think I'll come back to this tomorrow, but I don't know how many tomorrows I'll be willing to put up with before I just play something else instead.","October 12, 2015","false","22.6"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","27","49","2","2"

All of the others are out of date, or they havent spent enough time with the game to appreciate it.\n\nWhat you should note: This game has an incredibly steep learning curve, you will have to play for awhile to get the hang of it, and IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY- AND I MEAN ANNNYYYY Money to get into, and its fun to play when you dont have a lot to do, you CANNOT play online with another player- you ALWAYS have to fight CPU.\n\nThe story to this game sucks. I'm going to be frank, its terrible. But thats not why you should play it. This game is about the stratigy and a bit of luck is involved. If you arent into these puzzle-type games, this will be one that may change your mind, like it did mine.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to proceed through the kingdoms and beat all of the, i guess, campeigns. Even after you do this, you still have MANY hours of play with PVP and Challenges. (Once again, PVP is you vs a CPU with another players team)\n\nThis game isnt really OUTSTANDING FUN, but more so, "Hey, im going on bubbles for a little while, i dont have much else to do" -Dont write that off as im saying its only for when you are bored, its something to do anytime. You will get addicted to the simplicity of the matching gems, and love how in depth team creation can get, and you will actually see how much potential play time for you there actually is.\n\nIf you are into major stratigy and team building, you will probably like this.\n\nThere are also guilds. These are the best way to get paid currency. Join a guild, and i reccomend donating at least 1000 Gold a day to a certain task, or more depending on how much you make. After a task is completed, when the donation limit is exceeded, gift(s) will be givin out to all memebers. Weather its, Keys to open cases to get new cards, to Diamonds to purchase...100 souls?? idk.. whatever you wanna spend it on, or tokens or maps, whatever, you get it, there is a lot to get. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO you SHOULD join a guild as soon as you can.\n\nMaps are a way to collect currency, you will only get a lot if you understand game mechanics. You must learn those on your own, i cant help you phsycologicly, sorry.

Sadly, I find myself unable to resist them way too often. Thus I tried Gems of War. The wisest course of action would be to abandon this abomination and prevent further headaches. But then my Steam account would forever be besmirched by my horrible achievement completion rate in this game (30% at the moment).\n\nI fear my pride won't let me take the easy way out.\n\nThis game has many of the usual annoying Free to Play aspects we all love. The daily login bonus, popups to inform you about the newest ways to spend your money and sure enough not only the shop button but another button which leads to the aforementioned deals. Because the popup isn't sufficient.\nThere are worse offenders out there. I know that because I played some of them. That doesn't absolve the developers of Gems of War. They knew what they created when they did it. So shame on them!\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a long tedious grind. Basically you assemble your army by collecting cards which represent the individual troops. Each one has different abilities, some of which are actually interesting and allow fun combinations and synergies.\nBut then you have to level these cards up. And that takes effort. The currency needed can be bought (of course, lol) or acquired in the match-3 gamemode this all is about. The latter method takes a lot of effort. Especially if you want to swap out your cards from time to time, to experiment or because you found a better combination of troops you want to use.\n\nThe artwork is mediocre and the dialogue is downright horrible. The protagonist mostly speaks in one-word-sentences. "Why?", "Okay." and "Hmm..." make up a big portion of his contributions. Great! I always wanted to play a halfwit who is barely able to talk.\n\nThe way you get screwed over constantly by the cheating AI is another bottomless source of joy.\n\n\nUpdate: After playing this for quite some time now, my opinion has changed slightly to the better. Once I had a decent pool of troops and the souls to level them up to a usable level the gameplay became significantly less frustrating. But therein lies a huge designflaw. If you have to grind a game for 20+ hours before it gets fun I can't recommend it.","June 10, 2015","false","48.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

First things first - this game is in no f..king possible universe is a strategy. If anyone'll try to say to you that it is - you can laugh his face off. Strategy games rely on thinking more than on a pure luckfest. This is a 3-in-a-row game with fighting elements. People who gave it "strategy" tag are doomed to hell either, by the way.\nSo, considering that, how this thing stands? It's a "3-in-a-row" with fighting mechanic and CCG collecting - your fighters are cards. And it has positives about it. The collecting feeling is there, there is a lot of customizing for your team - every card has type (dwarf, elf, etc) level, rarity, kingdom (theme\campaign based thing), traits and color for their ability. You can take up to four cards for a team - including your hero - and based on the sum of these (except for rarity) features you'll gain team benefits. There are also banners that give +1\+2 to certain color matches to tune this up. And, of course, you've your own representation in the game - your hero. Hero gains expierence from every fight, increasing attributes (armor, health, attack and magic), color affinity (gives a chance for double energy from color matches) and can equip weapons that give him actual attacking abilities. Recently classes were presented giving even more to your protagonist - traits like those that creatures have, special class-based weapons and abilities (like mimicking one of creature types for team bonuses). So building your squad of legend is quite interesting too.\nQuests here are just series of battles that have pretty uninteresting - in majority at least - dialogues and that's it. Finishing quest-lines give you more tax from kingdoms, opens challenges for gaining souls and some of them have class missions that give you certain classes for your hero. And that's it.\nPvP isn't that forced and you don't actually fight players: you invade their defence party that was chosen before by the player and it'll be controlled by AI. It's just that these can be more of a challenge because of roster - some are pretty devastating if not prevented in time.\nBut the game can't be all pluses, you understand. First, and most obvious, it's f2p. So, a paywall is awaited. Thank Gods it's not so forcing on you, but you'll nonetheless meet people who paid and yes, they have access to ways of upping their squads to "you gotta be kidding me" levels. That's a problem of f2p in general, not just this one. This particular game problems are difficulty spikes during said quests - some fights are done easily, some are nearly rage-stomping you because of 1-2 creatures that are strong on their own. Second problem is luck: your team uses three out six colors but you can't make a single useful match while enemy spoils or takes those that you create? Welcome. Plus 4 and more gem matches give you an extra turn - so yeah "first turn and half of your team got squashed" situation is possible. Not so often but possible. And infuriatingly real. Trust me, THAT makes you rage-quit pretty easily.\nSo all in all, I'd recommend it. The game isn't bad, doesn't throw you into "no-pay" trash-can, has pretty good artwork, music in some areas and what it's good at doing good thing in it.

I was happy when they announced it, but a lot of things are missing here.\nOne of the worst things is: You can't see how many people are in the chat at the moment.\nYeah, it would be to much because you're automatically joining a room but sometime it would be good if\nyou could see it.\n\nSome parts in the "Guild System"\n\nFirst: If you want to know whats up in a guild you need to join it. You don't get any informations about it before.\nSecond: The invite System. I hate it. My friend and I started a guild and it is hard to find members. There are only 2 ways\nto find some. 1. The Forum 2. Chats.\nIt would be nicer if you had a list of all players where you can invite people (Like Shakes & Fidget as an example).\nThird: Not really important but you can't see how much EXP you need to level up and how much you get from tasks.\n\nNo "Profile and Friends"\n\nIt would be nice if you could have some friends in this game. I met some people which I enjoyed to write with and I would've liked to write with them later too. But this is nearly impossible because of the 999 Chat rooms.\nA "watch" System would be nice too. Why? In my beginnings it was hard to play. I had no strats and no idea what I was doing the entire game. I wished to watch people with some knowledge (Don't say go on youtube, I did, most of the videos were to old)\nSomething i would like to see is a profile system where you could the how many games a person played or maybe whats his favourite team is etc.\n\n\nBut now we go to the nice part of this game.\nFirst i played it while I waited for a game to load, yeah the PvP is not really PvP, but this is the good part.\nYou dont need to hurry to finish your round.\n\nNow i'm playing it when ever I like to, not just one game every hour or something like this.\nIt's not just a game where you play a round and then win something and thats it. You can collect things, "farm" and start thinging what the hell you're doing next.\n\nAnd instead of ignoring you or just giving you a standard message the Game Devs really care about their community and help where they can.\n\nI know the part whats good about this game is short. But don't worry. Give it a try and you may fall in a deep addiction like me. (I don't mean this negative).\n\n\n","May 15","true","435.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is hard to work a decent story into a match-3 game, but they managed it pretty well.\nThere is PvP in the game, but at this point, it is totally optional.  You can and will get attacked by other players, but they are limited to taking a certain percentage of the gold you accrued while offline, not emptying your bank account.\nThe PvP ranking system is a little sketchy, but can work in your favor as often as against it.  You can be level 100 and get ranked against a level 295 but then 'try another match' and get a level 45.  I have no idea what stat it matches you up by, but be patient and you can do well.\nThere are guilds in the game.  There is no guild chat as you may know it in other games, but instead there is a message board.  The advantage to that is the messages STAY, so you can talk or give messages to players who aren't on at the same time you are.\nGuild quests are simple.  Give a little extra gold when you can.  You pay to fill the quest bar.  You don't need to be uber skilled to help your guild.\nThe skills and abilities of your troops was greatly expanded about the time I quit playing, so I can not add a lot to that, but it creates a lot of depth and customization for fighting style and powers, that you really would not expect in a game that seems so simple on the surface.\nPay to Win.  Nope.  Simple as that.  Pay to speed things up?  Yeah, of course.  Dev's don't live and work for free.  But there is no gameplay advantages to buying other than to get stuff done faster.  You can patiently grind away to get those runestones and still get those talents on your troops you want without paying.  It will just take a bit longer.  I really like that.  It kept the game from feeling like it was descending into a stale cash grab.\nThe game is still vibrant and alive with active devs and a lot of players.  I hope it continues to thrive.","May 15","true","37.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised to find it otherwise. The RPG elements actually intergrate surprisingly well with the puzzle match-3 elements. Now, there are rather a lot of options for microtransactions, and, when I first started playing, it seemed like levelling troops would be extremely painful. However, this was before I discovered the minigames.  Both the arena and the Zhul'Kari Treasure hunt give potentially high yields of gold and souls, with the Zhul'Kari treasure hunt providing free to play players a means of slowly acquiring gems, and thus high rarity units. Once you start playing those two minigames, the power progression proceeds at a quite reasonable rate.\n\nThe most obvious complaint I have about the game is that the quests are written, well, kinda terribly. The characters you quest with are rather centred around a very basic archetype with no development beyond that, and the player character has no personality whatsoever. While I haven't seen anywhere near all the quests, the four I've started on (three of which I've completed) have all been a fairly formulaic near-solitary lawful good hero campaigning against large chaotic evil force. Maybe I'm just refusing to see some elements somehow, but it's almost impossible to get invested in the stories. I do understand the plot isn't the point, and the brief dialogs are not really enough to convey any depth, and the attempt at plot is appreciated. Nonetheless, how flat this falls is my one true complaint about the game.\n\ntl;dr Gameplay's great; story, though the attempt is appreciated, kinda sucks.","May 12","true","75.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Gameplay wise, its fine. There is nothing really overly that you have to do in terms of thinking. Its straight forward. Monster abilities are weak, or a joke. The AI of the game that picks the gems for you, is heavily geared towards your opponent. Sure you match 3, then they match one and get 4 turns, skulls to decimate your troops. And u watch it all happen while shaking your head.\n\nGold is a bit absurd, two days without playing to get enough to get another kingdom open to do some quests. And THEN it costs gold to battle the quests? Lots of things need fixed. A patch over for balance might be useful, actually it is really needed. I beleive other users have said it as well.\n\nThis game is fun, when for lack of a better term its not cheating. Getting troops to a manageable level is funny to say the least. You dont really get enough souls to upgrade with, your frustrated to the point of just closing the game down. And so matches you play against, you are just getting destroyed.\n\nSo, i think a good balance patch is in order, look at the gold spending for quests (i mean seriously?) Buying a kingdom seems to scale with your level. Which is stupid. Make the kingdoms a set amount of gold and be done with it. if it happens and they fix alot of issues i might change the review to reccommend.","February 5, 2015","false","185.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The developers have made the game so you can buy with crystals if you are patient everything. Also I have obtained 2 legendaries from silver keys and a joining a guild after level 25 is worth your time as the people donate more gold and you usually get at least 18 silver keys and 30 crystals each week.\nThe game is progression based and you can earn higher level cards by farming souls such as using the valkyre and brian the lucky cards together (60 souls cap per battle).\nI do prefer this free to play style game where waiting will get you everything slowly vs other companies using a clear abuse of paying to win tactic you can never obtain paid content/rewards - these games I refuse to play. I will always donate some money for the developers as they are fairer than other companies.\nI play divination fields challenge 1 over and over to progress now i have finished all the stories.

(Although many people do choose to get the extras, which help pay for the servers and ongoing development.) The development team is responsive to bug reports and is continually adding and improving features. The game was fun a year ago, and it's only continued to improve from there.\n\nYou play match-3 vs an AI-operated enemy. Great if you get frustrated by slow players or people who rage-quit mid-game in PVP. Unsatisfying if you really crave the challenge of matching wits against another human. (I love it!)\n\nYou operate a character that gains experience with each game, and gains access to new special abilities as you raise gem mastery levels. You can collect allies with various stats and abilities. Special abilities are fuelled by different-coloured gems. As your collection of allies grows, you can mix and match them into teams (the deck-building element), and you can even replace your main character while continuing to earn experience. You can use resources to level up allies and give them additional special abilities.\n\nThere are guilds available, which allows you to gain resources more quickly (just for logging in!), chat (or not), and contribute toward group rewards. Winning PVP matches while you're in a guild will raise that guild's level and improve the rewards available.\n\nThere are a range of different ways to play:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n* Storyline quests where you play versus pre-designed "teams" of enemies. Completing storylines can increase resources available.\n\n* Challenge matches where you battle key questline teams at higher and higher difficulty (a real challenge early in the game, often not any more difficult than the main quest once you get to higher levels). Completing matches gives you additional resources for levelling-up allies.\n\n* PVP matches where you fight against teams designed by other players. (Opposing teams are still played by AI.) This can be a good way to earn in-game resources more quickly.\n\n* Arena matches where you you create a team on-the-fly from limited options presented, including allies you may not have available in your current troop listing, to play against other teams generated by players in the arena. (This is especially fun if you get frustrated facing over-optimized teams, because the randomization and limited scope evens the field for deck-building strategy.) It costs in-game gold to play, so it might be harder to access for new players, but this is a resource that continually regenerates and the cost for arena matches quickly becomes negligible.\n\n* Treasure hunts which are a different style of match-3 game. It is single player (so there is no opposing team that manipulates the board) and matched gems join to one upgraded gem, so the strategy can be quite different. This costs maps to play, which can be obtained with long combos in the other games or purchased with in-game glory. As with arenas, these resources quickly become easy to access.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBasically, if you like match-3 games with a little extra, there's probably something here for you! Games are quick, so you can just pop in and back out without losing a large portion of your day.","February 25","true","454.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With hundreds, if not thousands of different characters with different abilities and majoring in different gem colours, there are so many combinations to create to make your team all-powerful.\n\nGuilds are also an increasing important role (ahem, mines is "WARMACHIN3"). Guild participation allows for additional keys for treasure chests (these give characters, as well as other cool stuff), gold (this helps progress to other areas), souls (help with levelling characters), diamonds (good for buying new armour)and maps (allow you to gain extra loot)\n\nIn order to go into every detail of the game I would be writing for a long time, there is plenty to do and hold your interest. The only downside I've seen is that it kind of throws you in, and you need to discover a lot yourself, but that's not major as it's pretty easy to get the hang of it. I've been playing aound 50 hours and I'm nowhere near close to halfway through.

You collect troop cards to build on and level up throughout the game, and it's the strength of your team that helps you win each match.  You can join a guild and earn numerous rewards.  There's a LOT of hours of game play in this game!\n\nYou have to earn gold to take part in things throughout the game, and I see numerous negative reviews complaining about how they have no gold to do things throughout the game.  I don't understand...even as a casual player, I've earned more than enough gold to do just about anything that I want in the kingdom, and still have a cushion.\n\nThe game can be highly addictive, if you like match 3 games.  It's not just a mindless match 3 game, either.  You have to plan out your moves, otherwise you could end up in some serious trouble.\n\nOf course, you have the option to purchase diamonds to buy special chests and other things in-game, but you can also purchase chests with gold and glory that you earn; although they're not as "high class" as the diamond chests, they're pretty good nonetheless.  Anything you need...except for the diamonds, of course...can be earned in numerous different ways throughout the course of the game.\n\nThe game play itself is a lot of fun. Depending on what sort of troop you're playing against, the game can go quickly, or it can be an intensive grind match that lasts and lasts.  It's the grind matches that give you a serious sense of accomplishment in the game when you win one, which is something that you really don't find in other match 3 games.\n\nOverall, I think this is an excellent game, and well worth a try for even the most serious match 3 game player!","January 7","true","261.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you are just looking for a matching game with a splash of adventuring, this game would make a decent time waster.\n\nEdit: Oh, I should add that this game cheats...

Believe me, time disappears playing from battle, to challenge, to invasion, to a defence- I played this until 5am having started to play at 23.00 - I could have sworn I was only playing for 20 minutes instead of the 6 hours I enjoyed.\n\nLevel up yourself and troops by earning souls, gems, cash and glory. Use a combination of troops, and move their order in the team to find the perfect combo; some troops are useful to use with others and some troops are specifically complimentory to one another. It's trial and error but good heavens it is fun finding out what works and what doesn't.\n\nThe PC version differs from the PS4 version I play in that one is British and the other American- the troops can differ between the two and the layout is slightly different- plus one take £ the other $ for extra items like gems to spend in game on souls $ gold in order to open chests gain troops and be the best- but who cares what denomination is required!!!!!!!!\n\nGems of War is by far and away the best game in the match 3 or more genre I have played- and I have played these games to death. Pay no mind to my steam game time- I am level 71 going on 72 on the PS4 with over 40 hours game time- I really love this game!\n\nSo bust them gems and bring the enemy down. Oh and HAVE FUN!\n\nAngelDelight81 x","January 6","true","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you're familiar with "free to play, pay to win" games, you'll notice after a few battles that the reward drop-rate will ensure that you'll be in for the long slog if you want to stick with the free option.  (To be fair, I haven't bothered looking at the prices for buying anything, nor do I have any intentions of coughing up any $$$ for this.)  The game mechanics are fairly straight-forward, and if you have any aptitude for gem-matching you should do just fine... just as long as you be patient and actually try to figure out what the consequences could be for some moves.  (Trust me, I've scuppered myself more than once with a "I need that color!" move, only to be immediately chain-ganked by the AI making a match I should have seen right away.)  There's no timer either, so you should have all the time you need to think.  (Not sure if there's a timer in PVP, since I haven't looked at it yet.  And since this is pay-to-win, I'm pretty sure PVP would be as lop-sided as it gets.)  So if you have some time to kill, have a decent amount of puzzle patience,  and like puzzle-matching, I say go for it.... it *is* free, after all. :P","May 12","true","86.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But that’s personal preference biased since that’s how I started and touch screen feels better, and I’m usually multitasking all the time so the tabbing out problem bothers me.\n\nI don't think it's pay to win or that the AI cheats. I've gone pretty far while being a completely free player: lvl 85 with 50 troops, all kingdoms unlocked, rank 1 pvp and 41 free gems (40 from guild, one from cascade of 7 matches). You just have to pay attention to the board and sometimes switch troops around. There is more strategy than just troops (though that’s a big part of it), like denying the enemy mana, which enemies to prioritize, and forcing the enemy into giving you better matches.\n\nLuck, of course, plays a role but I’ve only had to re-do a handful of quest battles that swung against me to beat it with the same team right afterwards. Most of the time when the AI gets huge cascades I’m kicking myself because I missed something or gave them the matches.\n\nThere was a bit of frustration in the beginning but branching out to other kingdoms to lvl and get purple troops helped solve a lot of that and really upped my PVP game. I’d also suggest joining a guild asap as the bonus help as does the task rewards. My main team also utilized every color instead of doubling up but I’ve seen some killer teams that do it differently.\n\nAs far as PVP is concerned, it’s when I have to defend against extreme higher lvls that I get decimated but that’s not a pay2win problem. I have beaten legendary teams and gotten legendary troops from iron keys.\n\nI’ve been searching for a game like this since Puzzle Quest and have finally found it. :)","February 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The two main complaints I see are:\n\n1)The AI cheats.\n2) It's a pay to win game.\n\nFirst, the AI doesn't cheat.  There is an element of luck involved in what new gems drop into the board, but it's absolutely fair.  Making smart plays will almost always mitigate the effect of luck on a game as well.  If you're counting on a lucky gem or skull to fall in place for you, then you're the one who's put you in the bad spot of relying on luck, and there is/was likely a better play available.  When I lose, it is almost always due to poor decisions, not poor luck.\n\nSecond, I've logged over 300 hours, eclipsed level 100, gotten the second most expensive armor set in the game, and done all of it without spending one cent of real world money.  I have never encountered any situation in the game that made me feel like I hit a paywall.  I've earned over 500 gems (the real world currency) just through guild rewards.  Earning gold becomes rediculously easy after the first few hours of gameplay.  It really is free to play and free to win, I promise.\n\nI'm not saying this game is the best thing ever, and certainly it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but as FTP games go, it is absoutely worth trying out.\n\n","June 19, 2015","true","804.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

These chests are similarly to packs in trading card games. It is hightly likely that epic and legendary troops will cost you a lots of cash to obtain. However, obtaining the troops is just a start. In order to play even against A.I. you need to level up troops using souls. In story mode, the A.I. has troops of level 10 and up. In order to level up one single troop to level 10, you need to collect around 800 souls.  Each battle will give you 8 souls without buff, hence in order to f2p you need to win at least 400 games. The fastest way to gain souls is disenchanting extra troops as you can imagine. The problem is that in order to play the game you need to use in-game gold to start a game. For instance if you play in story mode, 80 gold will be paid; if you manage to win, 30 to 40 gold will be rewarded. In generally, you need to wait the daily reward gold in order to f2p. It is true that PVP will give you more reward, but it is likely that you will lose without decent troops.\n\nThe game is indeed fun, but ruined by microtransactions.","November 23, 2014","false","76.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

I have learnt since then that Rare cards can sometimes be better used than epic cards! It all comes down to deck dynamics.\n\nThere are very varied skills which allow one to customize their decks to their own play style which I consider a big plus.\n\nNow for a bit on the down side, after a few hours of playing without a single new card i decided to sponsor them $5, so yes it has already become a pay to proceed game for me. I received very very nice cards in those packs and as mentioned I dont even use the upper tier cards (I am top tier ranking number 1 as I type this) so if you do happen to get a hold of even some other card options you are not limited by encountering uber god cards that will insta kill your entire team on turn 1!\n\nI did notice I only started finding keys after I purchased a $5 bundle, this may just be random luck but 0 keys for the first 4 hours and 4 keys for the following 2 hours post paying $5.\n\nThe normal keys gave me an epic card (Which from what Ive seen is the highest rarity that may be obtained. Thus even free to play has access to this tier.)\nthe game.\nFinal note / tip, using a unit that can add orbs to the board, allows for many multi matches giving you gold each time. Using one of these characters almost guarantees that I actually make a bit of gold per win, so spend 60 per match gain 72 back etc.\n\nAll in all I  am enjoying the game, it seems the $5 was a good investment for me, however if it turns out that one cannot get keys frequently without paying I would be very very disappointed with this game. All round Im enjoying it, I would recommended to the developers to give one or two low level boosters to give players a head start.\n\n(V2) (Only read this if you need more insight and have been playing a bit) After a considerably longer period of play, it seems key drops are very rare, daily one can expect to accumulate a passive 1000 gold  +-500 from your castle and the rest from login/rank bonuses.\nOnly 1 castle purchased and used as your home base will accumulate gold for you per day. However normal quest progression that adds a daily +5 gold per day will accumulate daily on castles that are not set as your home base.\n\nQuesting generally always costs you gold and you dont make a profit on these, however defences and invasions (Invade button) if you win them frequently always more than double the cost of the match at higher levels. Thus running these can fund your normal questing indefinately.\n\nOnce one reaches the top tier ranking you can no longer lose that rank ( As mentioned in game ) This will give you  a considerable amount of free gold and feathers for stuff in the shop every new day.\n\nFor me persoanlly I use a mixture of cards that use all the types of energy, this allows for any match to work out well for me. For instance to have 3 cards that all use brown would mean that random matches of other colours would not go to good use and further if you needed to use your 3rd brown allies skill you would first need to fully charge brown allies number 1 and 2!\n\nI like to use at least 1 ally with some sort of random spread damage, this allows for enemies with just 1 or 2 HP remaining to get sniped and the rest of the spread damage not to go to waste as it is allocated to other enemies.\n\nI do hope this "tiny" review has helped you a bit.

Some of the incredible bad luck streaks have had me threatening to ragequit.  Still enjoying it though.  I find I'm not having any problems with gold--my attention span or my available free are always used up first.\n\nDespite some of the complaints here, you can progress in this game for free.  New allies and fast progression are available for a fee, but if you want a casual, hour-a-day game you can play while you're cooking dinner or watching TV, this is perfect.  As well, I don't think the computer is cheating.  Sure, you'll get nailed by combos that seem unlikely, but you'll land a few of these too and pull victories from almost certain defeats.  Because random.\n\nIt's got the weird writing you remember from the Puzzle Quest games, plus the surprisingly deep and addictive gameplay.  Possibly it will become frustratingly difficult later in order to squeeze some money out of me, but for now it's fun.  Nearing the end of the second campaign and haven't lost a battle.\n\nIMO, GoW does the free to play model well.

You may not like updates on your Facebook page. Guilds are expensive to create and you might have trouble joining one as when I looked they seemed all full. I couldn't figure out how to edit my stack once I created one so I was stuck with an archer unit that was easy fodder for my enemy stack.\n\nConclusion : I played the game for over 4 hours and I have played a lot of Puzzle Quest there is enough here for fans of the series to make it worthwhile giving this game a go.","November 20, 2014","true","250.9"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","17","34","0","0"

There's not a single thing that you can't buy with real cash and it's absolutely necessary to do so unless you're fond of farming the same challenges over and over again in order to get powerful enough to progress further in the game.\n\nI don't recommend the game unless you have patience, you're a masochist or you have a full wallet that needs emptying. If the reason you play the game is the later, the money would be better spent on buying your friends couple of games from their wishlists.","November 29, 2014","false","13.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is little to like at first glance. An overly simple to learn game that seems too hard. The thing that brought me back to change my review is that I just kept playing it, rage quit, come back to it and the deeper I went the deeper the rabbit hole took me.\n\nA complex, thrilling and rewarding game that gets better the more you play it. There are a few things that I notice that will really help new players out.\n\n1. Finding a team is hard. Finding a winning team is really hard, this game doesn't pull punches like Marvel Puzzle Quest. After playing this game I haven't opened MPQ since. There is far deeper mechanics to this than just getting all colours of mana covered.\n\n2. The road is long, especially if you are free to play. I spent $20 (which is easily a fair investment for this calibre game) and it got me over that first hurdle of finding a team that works. Ive easily spent far more than that on big title games that have sat on my shelf. Do yourself a favour, pick up some magic keys and all of a sudden this game starts unfolding before you. Additionally they are constantly updating and releasing whole new content and once you start winning games the rewards are regular.\n\nAll in all an excellent game. Don't listen to all those peeps ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in your ear, it will fill up many an hour with eaze.","January 25, 2015","true","129.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Though 'tact' will only get you so far because as with most of these games that revolve around combat, one luckstreak from the enemy can totally turn the tide of battle. Likewise, it could also be in your favor, but from my experience it usually isn't. I always love a good M3 game especially if there's PvP / Guilds / an online community involved. It's somewhat reminiscent of Marvel Puzzle Quest but I would have to say it's better because of the hearthstone elements, and I just like the fantasy theme much better.\n\nHowever..! ..as much as I would love to praise this game, there are some great concerns with it. It's free-to-play which in the case of this game has a more negative impact than a positive one in my opinion. I was able to play Marvel PQ competitively with only spending a trivial amount of money for comic slots.. I'm sure this game follows a similar progression but it will require lots of patience and time as the game utilizes a 'sort of stamina system' which uses the in-game currency you otherwise need to progress.\n\nFurthermore.. you can buy keys for the in-game currency to unlock chests (which is basically the same as buying boosters in HS) but if you were to spend real money, you can buy "magic" keys which have a much higher chance of netting you a rare or higher card. I got an ultra rare and two rares from 1 magic key, 2 more ultras and a rare from 2 more keys (you get 3 cards per key/chest). This unfortunately leads me to believe it is a Pay2Win game which is a real shame.\n\nThis game would have been great as a normal retail game.. or without the obvious P2W elements. Because aside from that, it's a really fun match three puzzle game. But.. If you have the patience or just don't care about playing it competitively, it's a great way to kill time on a day-to-day basis or once in a while. After all.. it IS free to play.\n\n=== June 2015 Update ===\n\nInstead of rewriting, I'm adding a little bit to this 'review' so one can consider what I've written previously was my first impression. I just want to clear things up a bit as I do think the game is deserving of it with the amount of updates they have been releasing and whatnot.\n\nI take back what I said about this game being Pay2Win. Spending diamonds/real money basically just speeds up 'progress' if you will, but there's no exclusive benefits in comparison to playing normally. Given enough time or with a bit of luck, everything can be obtained without spending a dime. Once you get a good enough team going, you can easily gain much more gold than what you are spending and you can keep this up endlessly if you so desire. Joining a decent guild can also help a lot with pretty much everything.\n\nThe game is actually pretty solid for what it is. Honestly, the only thing that bothers me and what may have influenced my 'sceptical' thoughts previously is that the pacing of the game is very slow for a 'Match 3' game. I'm not referring to the time you may need to get into it.. it's the actual speed of matching gems that is slow and gets really bothersome. Especially when you make a mistake and/or your opponent is on a huge streak (through luck or otherwise) the slowness of it feels very taunting and unnecessary as you're basically forced to just 'sit and watch' all of it. You can argue that this gives you time to see his moves and keep an overview of the board, but in reality it is pointless.\n\nIn the beginning the AI is very easy but eventually hits a 'stable level' where it will always prioritize extra turns and doesn't miss a single one unless it's obtained through a combo. Paired up with a good team or luck, enemy turns will feel endless and demoralizing because of the slowness and the breaks between every single match. Disregarding any thoughts of 'artificial luck' this is what broke the game for me and at times made it feel unfair.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you can get over the slowness and time investment, you shouldn't have much (if any) problems with the game. At it's core, it's a casual game and for that matter it's a pretty good one.","November 20, 2014","true","114.2"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

I've had so many times where there are 2 moves i can do: put their gun in my mouth so they cant miss, or stand still. Either I set my opponent up to easily hit me, or I waste my turn matching 3 gems I don't need. Then the AI goes, and because of your last move, they get an extra turn, then another, and another, and another...and their troops are all ready to kill yours.\n\nThis game does have -some- form of skill involved and feels like you can control whether or not you win, but no. the gems off screen fall in to help the AI more than they will help you.\n\nI would only recommend if you are really into Bejeweled (also theres an odd Hearthstone feel to the game, such as the ranking system).

I appreciate games that make you think before you act and this one makes your brain tickle.\n\nThere is a lot of stink about ''paying for every little thing'' but honestly, it's not a game where you're supposed to sit for 8 hours and do nothing else with your time. For every moment you are logged out the game GIVES you money. Think of it as a "take a break" feature.\n\nYou have to pay gold to start a match, sure, but I really consider it a 'wager' as you get some or more of that money back if you win.\n\nYou CAN get everything in the game without paying a dime. If you spend a single dollar on this game you are weighing your time against money and that's hard for some people.\n\nThe PvP aspect is not a true peer to peer deal, it finds an opponent around your skill level and puts you against their 4 card deck controlled by the computer. If you win, you get a great deal of gold (which increases as you rank up [down?]) and daily 'Glory' to trade for items that you cannot pay real money for.\n\nIf the game seems too hard, consider changing your lineup or, God forbid, THINK before you take your turn. You are not penalized for taking your time.\n\nI really enjoy the artwork, they have very talented artists. The flavor text however on  the cards is sometimes a little dry, even for pop culture.  This was the only downside I could find to the whole thing.\n\nThat said, for what it is, and with many run on sentances, I give this game a 4/5. If you need something to do while your friends go out for dinner/school/karate or if you're just alone and bored, I'd highly reccomend at least giving it a try.","November 30, 2014","true","31.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In particular, I am a fan of puzzle-based combat system and I love that it works cross-platform and that I can play on both iOS and Steam. The combat system in Gems of War is very similar to the Puzzlequest RPG, however, since you quest with a party of four creatures there is a lot more customization involved. In particular, when I get stuck on a hard fight, I love the strategy of trying to figure out what party composition I could pick to win that particular fight.\n\nMany other reviews have touched on the business model. In my opinion, this should not be viewed as a "Free to Play" game. Instead, it should be viewed as an indie-game with a free demo. Personally, I enjoyed playing the first part of the game for free, and because I enjoyed it, I spent $20 for in-game currency (gems). I then purchased the biggest chunk of gold that I could, and spent the little bit that I had left over on a couple of "keys".

Keys drop randomly in-game and so I feel that between quest rewards (for completing a storyline) and random drop keys that I have been able to acquire new allies at an acceptable rate. I am very happy with the entertainment value that I have gotten for my money, and I think this game is easily as good as other $20-independent games on Steam.\n\nOne last tip -- it wasn't obvious to me at first, but "Challenges" are the best missions to run to level-up your allies. Run the same challenge repeatedly and each victory provides more of the level-up resource ("souls") for your party. The story-driven "Quest" missions are a lot of fun, and each plot arc yields a cool new ally, so when you have leveled-up on the "Challenge" missions you can use your powerful team to advance in the "Quest" missions.

If you win you earn approx. double the gold. If you lose you lose your gold.\n\nStarting out your at an EXTREME disadvantage because none of your stuff is leveled up and everyone else seems to have max leveled cards. On top of that, your not playing against other players.....your playing against the AI.\n\nSo please consider this.....a game who marketing is based on the player needing gold to pay for matches, or players in need of leveling up so they can actually compete. Do you really think the AI isnt going to cheat to get you to lose money?\n\nI write this after just having a match where I had all 4 of my cards near max armor/health. The AI had one card left, poisoned and 4 armor and 1 hp. Through some strange twist of fate, the AI managed to "luckly" garner 14 extra turns which was enough to defeat me.\n\nThe devs will tell you this cannot happen and that the code is not set to do this. They are liars.\n\nIt's a fun enough game to play the single player quests I suppose. But for your sake, do not give these people your money.\n\n\n\nEDIT 5/7/2016\n\nSo at the behest of a member of the Dev team I decided to try this game again. It took them\n\nthree days to find my old account and get it working. Some of the features of the game are\n\nimproved. Again, if your new, HUGE disadvantage, nothing different there. More importantly, the\n\nAI is still horrible, and quite possibly worse. It will and does change the gem drops to it's own\n\nadvantage. Matches you should never lose will result in the AI 'CHEATING' and costing you a\n\nwin.\n\nBottom line, there is nothing in this game you cant get with some play time.\n\nDO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!","November 8, 2015","false","182.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","3"

Perfect mix of Match-3 and Collectible Card Game.\n\nI am wondering about some of the comments I read though...\n\nI agree that the new ranking system is no help to most players, but it does not remove any fun from the rest of the game. Apart from that, the new PvP system is otherwise much better than before.\n\nYou must now use 1 diamond to get new opponents instead of 10 gold. Honestly, since you now get 3 choices for each match instead of only 1, I never had to use that. At worst, I select the "Easy" opponent which I know I will beat and just get lower rewards for that fight.\n\nAs in any other game, those who play more will have an advantage. That is what the ranking system gives. And for most players, the only reason to try to reach high ranks is pride, not the prices. What I think is missing would be giving all players who reach Tier 1 a couple(1-2) of the week's Traitstones. That would reward everyone who makes the effort of getting to Tier 1 and would help players progress.\n\nI totally disagree that the system is now "Pay-to-stay" or "Pay-to-win". I would rather call it "Pay to speed things up". Even without paying, this game is still very enjoyable. If fact, even more so with 2.0 for me.\n\nAnyway, I'll keep playing. This much free fun is not to be missed.\n","May 31","true","236.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A no if you're a one-sitting gorger.\n\nAs far as a game goes, I find it a nice and interesting take on the Puzzle Quest concept.  The art is clean, the mechanics are smooth, and things are for the most part labeled as they should.  It's still a question of how much mana of a color you need for a certain card, but considering it's fairly recently come out it's not that big of a gripe though.\n\nIn regards to the reviews of "Getting stuck after 4 hours" because of coins and souls, I have to say this:  There's more to this game than the storyline.\n\nIn regards to coins: Yes, you only get 500/day, and battles do cost 50-60 coins apiece, but this is to try to help you limit your playtime.  You're not supposed to gorge on video games for 12+ hours at a time.  The game does seem to be formatted like a mobile game, and one of the logos on the title splash IS a mobile department.  So the micropayments for additional playtime/content seems normal, yet I haven't spent a dime on the game and am having fun.\n\nIn regards to souls: Don't hoard cards.  Look through what you have, chuck the crap for souls.  Along with this, also do Challenges.  Broken Spire's Stone Wall and Fortress Siege can be done really easy with a lot of cheese tactics, and they give large amounts of souls for completing them.  So it'd be a win-win, no?\n\nThe one gripe I have, and is starting to become a wall for me, is the RNG in the game.  Far far far FAR too often will gems fall perfectly for the AI to combo off of (since 4+ strings give an extra turn), or will drop down skulls at the perfect placement for them to push them into damage.  It's almost too coincidental, and feels more like fluff difficulty than an actual challenge, which without this luck of the draw for the AI, would be a general pushover.","November 23, 2014","true","150.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You have to pay to plays\nIt is correct to a certain extend, especially in the beginning. But after a day of gold generation you will have enough gold to play casualy 1-3 hours per day.\n\n2. It's a P2W game\nYes.. to the certain extend it is. If you dont spend any money you will have a hard time playing in the top pvp ranks after the leaderboard system will go on. I spend a rather hefty amount in card packs to build a tier1 competitive deck and it is stronger than most of the ones of my opponents.\nYou will have to play for a long time to make a deck with more than 1 legendary and only a few of them are acutally very good.\nIf you are not interested in PVP the P2W impact is much lower if even there.\n\n3. The AI Cheats\nNo.\nJust no.\nThe devs explained the mechanic behind the AI in this topic:\nhttp://gemsofwar.com/forums/topic/cascades-and-shuffles/\n\nAnd as a player who spends rather long per turn thinking about the possible different outcome with each match and the cascade resulting from it, there is no bias towards the AI.\n\nIf you are a bad player you will loose often and hard. If you are a good player you will win much more than you loose due to an unlucky break.\n\n\n\n","November 29, 2014","true","49.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

This system is terrible, it buffs already powerful creatures and creates a huge divide between strong and weak creatures.\n\n- Traitstones are used to give your creatures traits. They are aquired randomly and slowly, but you must have many of them of a specific type and quality to actually use them. You will spend more of your time trying to get traitstones than actually playing if you want a strong team.\n\n- P2W...

However, it is also a money-sucking leech. Moreover, you are unable to progress much further lvl 10 (which is just a start), because your troops are underleveled, because you need "souls" to level them, which you can grind for in non-solo modes for days or (yay!) buy for your money. Thus, your progress (your SOLO progress at that!) is effectively crippled until you are anxious enough to spend money or stupid enough to grind the hardcore way.\nMore points out: graphics is clearly targeted to mobile devices and crappy social networks like FB, music is "out of league" (it just doesn't fit cartoony looks),\nHave money to spend and consider yourself a fan?

After only a few hours I am highly dissapointed. The game is f2p only by the name, if you want to play and have fun you are forced to play.\n\nIf you want to start a fight in "Gems of War" you need to pay 50 gold (in game currency). But, for every won fight you get... around 10 gold. After a few fights my character didn't have anymore gold and I had to stop playing. Ofcourse, game provides player with daily gold but it amount is as low as for the won fight. So, basiclly, if you want to play more that 3 games a day you are forced to buy in game gold for real money.\n\nAlso, the pvp matching is horribly unbalanced. My character, below lvl 10, was matched against characters over 30 lvl. Pvp also cost gold fee for entering, which is way bigger that normal fight and if you loose... you loose almost all your gold.\n\nThe game itself IS nice and fun. Graphics are simple but nice, music and sounds are okey, it is fun to lvl up your troops and giving your character masteries points... but you actually can't do it, cause you can't fight... and can't get lvl, troops, masteries.","September 14, 2015","false","441.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quxup/recommended/329110/","quxup","werewolf Gubli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quxup/","291 products in account","Alright, here it goes. I have played Gems of War for roughly 483 hours. I started the game with the expecation to find a experience that is relaxing, which this game is - it's relaxing.\n\nI will focus on what I find good and bad about the game and answer to a few points I've noticed in other reviews.\n\n\nThe good:\nThe game looks awesome (ingame art looks really great, gems look good too)\nIt's free (I've tried out different games of the same genre, this is by far my favorite and it is free)\nHas great replay value (collecting different weapons, armors, creatures adds different layers to gameplay. Different creature combos, home kingdom, weapons etc play out differently.)\nConstantly updated (I've played the game roughly from november of 2014, within that time there have been multiple updates, adding creatures, features, weapons etc)\nGreat customer service by the company who produced the game (they answer fast and solve the problem, if you have one.)\nThe bad:\nThe only problem with this game I have encountered is account information storage. Namely when I bought a new PC and logged on to my steam account and launched the game, my account was gone. I emailed customer support, as it appears the account information is partially stored on your computer (they had a copy of it though). They sent me the needed files, told me where to place them and did that within 24 hours. So all in all, while annoying, the problem was solved quickly and well.\nMisconceptions about this game I have read in other reviews:\n"It's pay to win."\nIf you pay, you get the chance to get ingame items (such as souls which are used to ugprade creatures, armor, creatures, gold) faster.\nSo essentially there are pay to win elements here. However you can get EVERYTHING without spending a cent, you just have to spend more time in the game (like in league of legends or hearthstone).\n"I get too little gold. Developers are forcing me to buy gold."\nI am level 70 and I haven't encountered a single time I've ran out of gold to do matches. How to achieve this? Don't waste all of your gold. Learn the game mechanics, win. At the moment I win most rounds and I can continiue playing nonstop.\n"Enemy has overpowered legendary creatures. I dont. I cant win."\nAll towns are easily unlockable. Many towns unlock strong creatures. Use them. Use gold to buy creatures. You also get ingame keys within battles, you get legendary creatures there as well. While legendary creatures are strong, there are many strong non-legendary creatures.\n\nHow to increase gold gain?\nUnlock more kingdoms. Complete all quests in kingdoms. Read about ingame tactics. Buy a armor. Join a guild. Optionally you can log in daily. Get better at the game. Win more games.\n\nHow to increase soul gain?\nBuy a armor. Join a decent guild. Finish all town challanges.\n\nHow to get ingame armors?\nJoin a decent guild. You get gems for upgrading your guild with gold.\n\nHow to get op creatures?\nJoin a decent guild. You get keys for upgrading your guild with gold. Finish all town quests.","March 18, 2015","true","759.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I've thoroughly enjoyed playing through it and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good puzzle game. While the gameplay can get increasingly frustrating and difficult, it also has a nice playable feel to it that drags you back in like most other puzzle style games. I honestly cannot say I agree with the whole "AI cheats" thing, because the random number generator is just that. Random and unpredictable. I've been on both the receiving and dealing end of some nasty combos, so it's pretty balanced. I've even taken some bad situations and turned them around for impressive wins.\n\nStorylines are interesting, humorous, and creative. They keep you wanting to play and see the ending. Creatures and Bosses are very creative as well, including the heroes. The free roam style also is a plus, as it doesn't force you to do things in a specified order.\n\nThe game can be played without spending money, and doesn't force you into it. Gold regenerates quite nicely, and the addition of getting either more gold, souls, or even glory from other kingdoms you've unlocked sweetens the deal even more. The game even allows you to earn gold/gems/keys while playing. There are several ways of getting what you need without paying actual money.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely amazing and good, with factors spreading in various areas. I would definitely recommend playing it for awhile before deciding if it's good or bad. The frustration is high at times here, but a good challenge is never a bad thing.","May 26, 2015","true","811.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

First, let me assure you that at level 125, I do exist, since many people think 50 is a magical level where things stop. Cogito ergo sum. Let me also state that, in the beginning, I thought things tough. But the more you play, the more you get items you need to improve yourself and, thus, do better against the NPC’s. To date, I’ve defeated every land and every set of challenges.\n\nThe game itself is simple: match gems. The more you match, the better off you are. Your troops gain power based on the color matched, and when fully charged, their power can be used. Defeat the other side’s troops, and you win.\nThe real strategy comes with combining skills. For example, Gorgotha, blows up seven gems at random, so you could potentially get 7x9 or 64 gems that would probably fully charge the other troops.\n\nBut I know what people are saying: But he’s an ultra hard troop to get. Possibly, but there are so many combinations. I’ve fought someone with all basic troops that crushed me.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is guilds. Guilds help boost your power, give you gems, keys and other things that make you more powerful.\n\nRecently, treasure maps were added. These are pure profit and increase your wealth across the board.  There is also an arena, where you randomly pick three cards and go to battle.\n\nWith so many options, it is easy to increase your overall standing in the game. And all without spending a dime.  Instead of quitting when things hit 50, fight through and take a stand.\nYou will definitely enjoy it once you do.\n","June 24, 2015","true","947.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I got to level 50 with under 5 loss. Gold is easy enough to make if you do "pvp" wich isn't real pvp. You match up against other players "deck" so it's pretty relax. Just level up your cards with souls and take time before you play your turn to make sure you don't give easy skulls or "match 4" to your opponent. Overall free to play model is good. a little hard at first but with the daily bonuses and your kingdoms income it gets better fast.

If you also get into RPG's and CCG's then you will love it for sure.  It is very playable on the F2P level, but of course things do not move nearly as fast that way.  Souls (skill raising currency) are not quite but almost finite in F2P.  Armor and such gives you decent buffs to gain bonus Souls, XP's and Gold.  If you're F2P you probably want to join a guild, save up gems and buy armor that gives you a soul boost.  Leveling slow is not a bad thing in F2P.  P2P makes life easier, but the challenge of F2P makes it more fun, IMHO.  I rate it 7.5/10, maybe even a full 8.\n\nBTW- As some other people have mentioned the AI does seem to cheat pretty bad sometimes.  Sometimes the AI will get like 5 or 6 turns in a row with some incredible drops, things that rarely happen for players.  I guess it may just be their way of making up for AI shortcomings, but it pisses you off sometimes.","May 13, 2015","true","649.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What this game lacks (really really lacks) in storyline is a fun battling and upgrade system.\n\nMy personal favorite is the Arena-- available after you complete the first tutuorial kingdom's questline in full. You pay 1000 gold (much easier to come by now since the devs removed gold cost from other battles) and pick 3 troops: Common, Rare, and Ultra-Rare-- from a group of 3 in each of the type. You pick your hero's weapon and battle other players. Granted, the PVP is not real-time PVP, so while you are technically playing another person, they will not make human mistakes! If you win 8 battles in the arena (without losing more than 1 battle), you get a handsome set of rewards in the form of gold, souls (for upgrades), and keys (for draws).\n\nI look forward to the continued development of this game!","February 1","true","120.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I couldn't even complete the first quest completely. My cheap units vs strong ai units (pay to win!). It was fun for a while, but then when you're nearing the end of the first quest all the enemy units seem overpowered compared to your weak units (regardless of team/color setup).\n\nYour troops start off as white cards, then green, blue purple and pink is all I've seen. Yeah the game is really fair, my white and maybe green cards vs all the colors above in various combinations (oh that's right, I forgot it's pay to win, play for free only goes so far...). Even the ai white cards present a serious problem. You know there is something wrong when you're still trying to get enough mana for an ability, however the ai has already wiped out 3 of your 4 units.\n\nI tried the other two (close) kingdoms, the first part of each quest I was able to beat (barely) and that was it. Exps and gold are slow to come by, so you must grind, replaying the same losing battle over and over. After a while this just gets boring.\n\nI got the impression that the hint system is more helpful to the ai's next move. It will suggest moves (when there are multiple moves) that will help the ai's next move much more. And the ai never misses anything. And the funny thing is it will suggest matches for colors you have no use for (but if you look ahead you'll see why it's suggesting that particular move). Also noticed that when there are no more moves and it reshuffles fresh for the ai every time. Never once in my short game time did it reshuffle at the end of the ai's move. So don't tell me the gem drops are random.\n\nSupposedly your supposed to be able to collect taxes from your kingdoms (every hour plus whatever is your daily amount). What a crock of poop. All I ever get is 32 gold next day of play. I've unlocked 2 cities, the next one will cost 1000gp to unlock, to get that I'll either need to log in every day for 32 days or win/lose 40 +/- battles or some combination of the two. Perhaps you could make your game more clear with this? What I see when I click income is gold per day (590) +35. And yet next day of game play I get 32 and that's it, plus the usual 17-25 per battle.\n\nThe only difference between winning and losing a battle is you get a traitstone, otherwise it's 3-5 exps (souls in the game) and 25 gold max. It's 10 exps to get a troop to level 2, 25 to 3, then 75 to 4 (good luck), talk about a very grindy game.\n\nThere's no random encounters, all battles are quest pre-determined. So you must constantly fight the same groups over and over......\n\nYou'll get a couple hours of fun, get bored, and then delete the game (or pay to play and enjoy it).","April 4","false","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

But, if you're a high level, then you've already sat around and waited for gold to replenish, so you've dealth with this issue as well). In a way, this game reminds me of a fantasy-style Bejeweled but with a storyline. Many of the characters are witty and I found myself looking forward to playing for an hour or two everyday. Every now and then, one of the levels seems extremely difficult and it takes a few tries, but that sense of determination always kept me going. After a while, it gets repetitve (hense why I haven't played much lately). But, it's still a fun game and I think it's a good game to have for when you don't have the time to play something more indepth. I will caution, though, it can be a tempting pay-to-win.

It isn't always about having the strongest creatures (common, rare, ultra rare, epic, legendary) in order to win. You can actually earn most of the Epics through the story line, and the arena (opened after the first story area) has been greatly improved to be more useful to those that can win through with the random creatures you choose. I think that the balance is actually quite impressive. The more powerful the creature/weapon? (type not level) The more gems you have to match to use its ability. Conversely, the weaker ones are faster, needing less. Your Hero gains weapons from leveling masteries. You get 1 mastery point per level, and have to choose from the two colors (out of 6 in game) that it gives you.\n\nIt really is a great game, and you can get creatures from playing, and spending gold (in game currency) And, you can actually earn pay money slowly, in or out of a guild. You can accumulate it faster in a guild (good for bonuses) and even cheaply Start your own guild if you so choose. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell if a guild is active until you join...\n\nOverall, a Fun game that while it Can be played quickly, just might suck you in for hours at a time...be careful.","April 24, 2015","true","998.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been on just about every evening, so here's my honest review. Recommended for a casual 5min-10min play. Any longer and you get bored.\n\nPros\n+Simple to play and understand\n+Art is decent to nice\n\nCons\n-Gets boring rather fast\n-Not much to do\n-Based on luck, not skill\n\nMy rating: 6/10\n\nHere's why. So, when you begin you can get swept away by the simple gameplay, sharp colors, and nice looking art. Though it doesn't keep it's apeal for long. After a few hours you start getting the sense there isn't much to do, and there isn't. During my first few kingdoms I did read the story and they were okay. But after you complete your first four, the story just seems rather boring. Each kingdom is their own story so there's no real connection between all of them. There's no arc.\n\nThe gameplay is all LUCK! Sure, some skill is needed to spot the 4, 5, or 6 piece combos, but the rest is purely on luck. I can't explain how many times I get close to beating a match only to have the computer complete a 6-stage combo and kill all but one of my characters. HELL, even the 'suggestions' the game offers backfires on you and supports the computer instead. So you're constantly debating whether or not to make a move because it's easy to give the computer the upper hand. At the same time it feels AMAZING when you pull of that 7-hit combo.\n\nYou don't have to pay for anything. You can get pretty far for free and get decent cards based on whatever luck gives you. You can get the rarest cards through Magic Keys, but there's a rare chance you can get them in the story or tribute. Though you can get the second best cards by completing the stories so it's all good.\n\nYou'll literally run out of things to do really quick. I'm at lvl 40+ and I feel bored doing the same thing over and over again. No wonder hardly anyone gets the 50+ Achievement.

Purshaced towns giving you a total of moderate amount gold per day. And to do quests, matches, you need to use at least 50 golds per match (it gets higher /+10 per town you conquer.\nAbout the gameplay, it's simply Bejeweld. Furthermore, there is a ranked system which you can buy some good stuff with your ranked points.\n\nBut other than that, the game is absolutely involves pay2win factor and the RNG system sadly. You can get to unlock every town with paying real money, so means higher gold you gain per day, this leads opening card packs (which is 1000 gold). Also, there is a real money pack too which gives you a bit stronger cards compared to others. But notice that to unlock a town you also need your account to level up.\n\nOverall, it would be stupid to blame the RNG system since here's nothing can be done about it but wish it was not that much of a limited game for non-paid users.

You can very easily maintain gold. just make sure you get some low level duels in the beginning and win them. Also make sure you upgrade your heroes and do as little quests as possible, only do quests to make sure you get some starting cards.\n\nGood luck and have freakin fun. this game is cool.","July 6, 2015","true","398.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No need to buy extras unless you really want to.  In early play in the game it costs more to play than you "earn" by winning, but play through and soon earning plenty to play and get extras."\n\nNow, I no longer recommend this game to others, and although I still play some, I am very close to quitting.  Here are just a few of my thoughts:\n\nSo far, I do not like anything about this new update.  The previous update was a degradation of the game, but this one has taken the game to a point where I feel like I am "slogging through" an unpleasant experience rather than enjoying an engaging fun game.  When I started playing the game it was relatively easy to understand the play and logic, and it was a nice way to relax after a day of work.  It took some thought and strategizing to improve your game, building teams for different purposes and using them to advantage under differing circumstances.  Leveling up is now too complicated, and even the "buying" rewards with earned glory or gems, etc, has now essentially become so complcated or expensive (seemingly targeted at the pay to play audience), I no longer have incentive to play enough to "earn" enough to buy a reward of armour, additional character or new weapon.\n\nNow everything that was relaxing and casual (and fun) about the game has been taken away or changed.  I have previously recommended this game to others, however, do not believe will do so again.  The last update seemed geared towards smart phone or tablet users, and the appearance of the cards/characters changed significantly.  Most of the character/card appearance updates were not positive.\n\nPlease bring back the original game as it was--roll back to a couple of updates ago and release it as a "version 1" or "classic".  I did like the addition of new kingdoms, rewards, arena, and maps. It would have been better to have rolled out a different version ("gold" or "championship" or even as simple as "gems of war 2") to make these changes, rather than so drastically altering the play of what had been a very fun, enjoyable and relaxing game.","June 7, 2015","true","460.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And got better. It had ideas and dev resources. Seems it lasted only up to 1.05 update.  Fro there devs evaporated mostly, and the game went stale waiting and waiting and waiting 1.06 that got delayed by months.  And when it arrived it had nothing good. And all improvement requests were ignored. So the game ust went on dying of boredom.\n\nThen a few weeks ago out of the blue we got another update, 1.07. With drastic changes around the boad. And devs promising they are on again.\n\nUnfortunately most of the changes are bad and/or unfair. And while the potential surfaced again, the first few weeks of action clearly shows the direction is HOPELESS.  The design is either out of hand or is deliberately steered to a bad destination.\n\nTLDR: I can't recommend the game any more for either new or old players.\n\n- --- old review with recommended status\n\nEDIT: With 1.0.5 update the game got much much better. We got Arena that is kind-of sealed deck format that keeps up fresh challenge and drops cool prizes too (if you win.)\n\nAnd kingdoms now have 1-click collect with tributes that provide many resources if you bothered to play the content.\n\nGuilds got minimal communication and is promised improvements soon. In short the game is alive keeps improving in all directions.\n\n- ---\nRecommended only IF you are okay with actually well playing AI and losing a plenty. :)\n\nThis game finally looks tuned to those who look for actual strategy and challenge, resouces are not abundant so you need careful plan and AI is definitely not forgiving for mistakes -- also you can lose anytime just to RNG snake eyes, but overall can manage using brains in the long run. Especially if you adjust your team and play depending on the opponents.\n\nPVP probably could be better if you had some intel option to have a clue about the opponent and could deploy a better matching team, but well, more the challenge here.\n\nTo be effective you should concentrate your effort: playing a full quest line for a town gives you the hero providing the quests (usually a really stromg card), and completing the last challenge star gives 100 souls to add several levels to your fighters. Levels mean huge improvements obviously.\n\nThe guild stuff lacks communication that makes in not really interesting unless you organize one from people you know already.","December 6, 2014","false","556.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They have a money trap going on, they make you spend more coins then you get to start a battle. Then not to mention when you level up you only get on point, and if you use souls to level up your army the same thing happens. I used 55 souls and I got one defence, I should of at least got one of each, and souls are not easy to come by. Now if you want to do a PVP fight, well you better be in the level twenties. Thats mainly who they will set you up with, then you basically just get the same gold you just spent out. This game was so not worth it to me, least its free though.

It's addicting and challenging, with a bit of RGN luck thrown in. Try it out!\n\n\nA lot of negative reviews mention the AI cheating or not being able to play for long periods of time due to running out of gold - but I think that is a result of just poor skill and bad luck. Mostly poor skill. I would consider myself an advanced puzzle player, and I own no "pay to win" items (the game does sell items that can help you earn money/souls to level your troops more quickly), and I never have an issue with running out of gold, nor do I feel the AI has ever "cheated". I've played enough match-3 games to know it's 75% skill and 25% luck of the drop.\n\n","February 18, 2015","true","84.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The invade tab in the bottom right corner is where you can get quite a bit of gold if you're good by going up against a AI controlled team comprised of another player's troops.\n2. Selecting challenges from the kingdom menu and getting all 5 stars in one will give you quite a bit of souls.\n3. As for the difficulty and supposed luck the computer always has, this is puzzle quest on hardcore mode, the enemy won't miss a beat, it has the mind of an adept tactical puzzle master, and it can and will use everything avaliable to sabotage you.\n4. I don't know this for certain but I believe that the enemy AI and board AI are two separate entities that do not communicate with each other, again the enemy AI can calculate an unbelieveable amount of information instantaneously, which is why it seems to cheat, however if they board and enemy AI were both actually communicating you wouldn't get a single move past your first one as it would move once and then simply cascade 4 skulls infinately till you were completely wiped.\n5. The one thing I will say is that it could be good to have a limit on the multiple turns for 4 matches, something like a maximum of 3 turns off matches of 4, this may lead to less people thinking the AI is cheating and that you need luck over skill.\n6. Remember this is a mobile based game, the fact that it doesn't have an "energy bar" is something that seems unreal, and is one of the best F2P mobile buisness models I've yet seen and is more "it takes money to make money" then "wait for this bar to fill because... reasons"","February 20, 2015","true","48.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

But, here, i'll give my opinion, but seriously, no offense.\n\nFirst, everyone said that if you want to play more, you'll need coins more. It means that when your coin is running low, you can't play it. But if you invade the other players and win, you can get more coins to play. It's true that you can't play it for hours or more because the coin system, but that is the art of this game, patient.\n\nSecond, to level up your troops, you need souls. Everytime you win a match, you'll get 4 souls. The amount of souls you need to level up your cards increases by large amounts as you level up the cards. But you can get souls from challange and disenchant your troops.\n\nThis game it's hard when you play in in first day or week, but you can enjoy it and keep playing if you get max daily bonus coins, join a guild, and invade other players. If you join a guild, you can get keys, souls, even diamonds for every task completed. Try to level up to about level 50 or more, and you can join a good guild to help you. And the most important things is patient and skill. If you got enough diamonds from guild tasks, try to get costume that increases your coins or souls everytime you play games.\n\nI never pay for this game but i have no problems with the coins and souls. Except for the server problems.\n\nEnjoy~","February 24, 2015","true","104.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It was puzzle quest all over again, with tweaked mechanincs, new card/troop systems and a whole lot more content than we saw in the  previous games.\nThe game plays great, carried by it's solid, dependeable, "if it aint broke dont change it" gem matching gameplay. There's far more strategy this time around in the form of collectible cards called "troops" which differ in rarity.\nTrying to wrangle more of these cards just added to the obsessive-addictive depth the developers put into the game.\n\nThe problem is, it's free to play, and we all know what that means. Just like most other people who reviewed this game, I reached a point in my first play session where I simplly could not play any further without paying RL money.\nI mean, that's at the same time a bad thing and a good thing.\n\nI wouldnt mind the option of paying cash to get more troop cards, or to level up your guys, but the fact that I couldnt play at ALL after a certain point was kind of discerning.\n\nMind you, It's not that much. 5 bucks or so bought me another 8 or 9 hours of gaming.\nIt all came down to me asking myself if I wanted to pay some more money to keep playing, or whether I should go to sleep and wake up tommorow when my game would have generated a small amount of currency.\n\nI love this game, I think it's great, and I'm hooked. It's all the fun of Puzzle Quest with more features, more quests and more tactics.\nThe main problem is the way the developers have implemented the free to play system.\n\nI would gladly pay 50 bucks for Gems Of War straight out of the gate it if meant I could play it indeffinately. Considereing the amount of hours' I put into the previous two Puzzle Quest's, I could easily keep playing this game for months.\nFactoring in how much it will cost me to play on a daily basis, I'm not sure how long I will keep coming back.\n\nBottom line:\nThis is a great spiritual successor to Puzzle Quest. If you loved the previous games, you will love this one.\nThe gameplay is as frantic and addictive as ever, and you can easily lose yourself for hours in the rich quest system.\nHow long you will end up playing this game is up to  you; If you've got the cash, Gems of War will entertain you indefinatly. If you don't, this may be a short trip.","March 17, 2015","true","88.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And I waited until I'd put some hours into it so as to make sure I had waited long enough to be "forced to pay" as many reviewers insist. I never was forced to pay - the game rewards you over time with the coins necesary to play, and its really not a long wait period. You can get several hundred a day, and if you are good at the game, and play many days in a row you can easily get many many more.\n\nNext, it is NOT P2W!!!! I haven't spent a single cent on the game and have put 10+ hours into it already with much enjoyment. Sure, you CAN pay, and you'll a much easier time of it, but whats the fun in that?! Playing the game without paying just requires some patience and a love of a challenge. Like many other games.\n\nAlso, the game CAN be unfair. You'll be going along and BAM the enemy gets a crazy huge streak and wipes up a ton of the board ( and deals a lot of damage to your troops ). Yes its angering, yes it seems unfair, but sometimes ( as another reviewer noted ) these crazy moments of luck happen to YOU, the player, also. And when that happens, boy is it sweet.\n\nAlong the lines of the actual gameplay, its a match 3 game with some light Fantasy card game elements. I don't have a lot of experience with the genre so I can't compare the atual gameplay much, but I find it pretty fun and varied. The 100-odd cards are fun to collect and upgrade and the tactics you can use can be somewhat in depth.\n\nBottom line really is that the reviews aren't particularly good for this game; they are not a fair assessment. I'd say that if you enjoy either fantasy card game styles or match 3 to give it a go - it is free, so find out if my review, and others, are fair on your own if you don't believe me.\n\n","March 16, 2015","true","56.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The key is to invade and beat other players, because instead of 25 gold per victory you can get upwards of 300 or so gold. Plus the more kingdoms you buy the more gold you get per day. Plus if you have a great selection of kingdoms sometimes you'll possibly get offerings of gems, keys, and souls.\n\nThis game equips you of everything you need to continue playing, you just have to budget a little at the beginning. On my iPhone version I have over 30,000 gold and I can drop gold on keys as I please.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geelw/recommended/329110/","geelw","geelw2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geelw/","237 products in account","Yes, Gems of War can be a pain to play if you dive in for hours at a time and expect Puzzle Quest-like addictiveness without paying a cent. The game does deliver the gameplay goods. But it's clearly a child of the modern "F2P" era where that "f" stands for "free", but some players will be thinking of other words that begin with that letter when they try to play in longer stretches and can't unless they dip into their wallets.\n\nGranted, the industry's current "free" model is  broken in the first place because it's taught gamers to devalue the work of people who make these games (some of which can be good and worth paying for without the paywall nonsense). Conversely, many game studios seem to be trapped in the model because they rely on people buying into the idea of timed pay as if they're remaking the arcade experience into a more sinister version. Well, these aren't at all the same as arcade games for a few key reasons I won't get into here.\n\nThat said, when Gems works, it works quite well. The mechanics are solid and the game doesn't "cheat" as some say because you can get some pretty wild Extra Turn and Mana Surge runs yourself. This is particularly true if you're good at reading the board and not making "suggested moves" or matches before considering every gem's place post move.\n\nOf course, sometimes you do just get "lucky". I just completed a game where the AI had a nice streak that ended when the board had no more matches and my turn came as the board shifted with a 5-skull drop and me grinning like a crazed squirrel that just discovered an overturned peanut truck. That led to a run where two of my cards were able to get in nice extra turn runs that wiped out the enemy. "Luck" goes both ways in these games. You just need to roll with the punches and perhaps think of logging out for the day if you're having a bad run. The game will be there tomorrow.\n\nWant to enjoy this game more? Quit playing for long periods of time and game the system a bit so it's paying YOU to play it.\n\nAs I don't always have an active internet connection AND a busy life outside of one game, I'm not able to play this for hours on end like some who dislkie those annoying paywalls. So, I (somewhat accidentally) came up with a way to enjoy this at my own pace:\n\n1. After an incident where I logged in, collected a gold bonus and my connection dropped out (boo!), I had the realization that the game pays you in-game gold that you can hoard as long as you don't use it every day.  So, I try to log in daily to collect the gold and kingdom rewards and don't touch the main game for a week or so unless I have time for a few matches. At some point, without playing much (I'm level 16 as I type this) and just from collecting gold bonuses, I had close to 30K stocked up, which was good for unlocking kingdoms and buying keys to unlock better characters.\n\n2. When I do have time to play, I put in about 15-20 minutes then STOP for the day. Period. I have other stuff to do, so I don't obsess over not getting through events or getting certain rare stuff. My one concession was picking up a rare weapon I had my eye on because of its effects that made getting through a certain boss fight really easy.\n\n3. I'm not a PvP guy, so I avoid it. I've been invaded and have had to defend a few times, but I don't sweat it because it's always been a much stronger enemy I lose to. But I don't sweat it because it's only a small bit of gold and I can get that back by not playing for a day or so.\n\nOther than that, I like much of what Gems does on the game front and not much on the monetization front. That $4.99 one time offer pop-up is super tempting (and probably recommended to total newbies or those who want to pay something), but I prefer to play this completely for free as long as it's fun for me. It's too bad that it's NOT offline at all and the pay model is a bit too eager to attempt to get players to whip out that credit card. At the end of the day, this is a game I think would work better as a standalone retail product or digital download where you pay once and play at your leisure.","March 15, 2015","true","65.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Then about 20hrs in you will find the cards you like and unless a legendary comes along, you will stick with the same party for a long time.\n\nGets grindy and a little dull after a while when you get no new cards and stick with the same team for a long time, The amount of resource used to level up your cards is too damn high so if you want to try out a new team it is hard to judge unless you want to waste this resource\n\nALL the battles are AI controlled. Even the 'Invade' battles where the AI takes control of another players party. I have wone multiple 'PVP' games against teams filled with 'broken' cards. Because of the AI controled battles and the randomness of the gem drops this game is not pay to win.\n\nAll in all the game is fun enough and you will get a kick out of it for the first 20 hrs for free.

I love playing it while I can, but here's a tip for newbies:\nNever follow the hints on the puzzle board unless you are 100% sure that it isnt setting up a combo for the computer because 99 out of 100 times if you click what it hints to you you will get screwed.\nAlso, the amount of gold that it takes to play a match is so rediculously high that youll never play the game more than 2 hours, and most of the time no longer than a half hour if you spent any gold on getting packs or unlocking more storyline that day. Also, the matchmaking in PvP is downright awful. The only reason I PvP is for the glory points. Half the time I wonder if they are even worth it because the rewards are pretty awful except for the most expensive one. Also, a question to the developers who for some reason love to cheat players out of gold: Why would an opponent click a combo of four when they dont gain gold and they arent gaining mana from it or cheating you out of mana (a viable tactic), but the computer always will and itll cheat you every chance it gets even if there is a match where it wouldve gained mana or cheated it from you. I understand that devs need to make money but blatantly cheating people out of ingame currency says a lot about the ethics of the people who made the AI in this game.\nAgain, it's fun to play while you play it but dont expect much playtime unless you want to drop your bank account into it.\n","November 30, 2014","true","29.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

One has two options for the game: Pay to play, or wait to play. But a good game shouldn't ask its players to pay to play when offered as a free game, nor should it require players wait several days between sessions just to accumulate some gold. In regards to gold earning, it's very illogical to earn LESS in a battle than it costs to wage it.

Talk about the gold, if you play everyday upto 7 days you can earn up to 750+ gold more, try to win some PvP game, it does cost 50~80 gold per match but you can earn back 30~50 gold per match (50 gold per match is a badass enemy). My advice? Don't buy keys, you can earn them just by matching those gems.\n\nDefend you kingdom does gain gold, it cost you 50 gold to get around 30~60 gold, easy money. By the way you can get EPIC cards , i repeat EPIC CARDS just by unlock the kingdom and finish all it quest. By finish all the challenge you can earn 100 souls, enough to upgrade the hell out og your troop up to max Level.\nThsoe challenge are nothing, it super easy.\n\nFor those who said this game not good, I feel sad for them. It a good game for great mind. Just don't play it when you have a bad day. You might fall in a losing chain instead of winning chain. It like playing chess, you move one gem wrong , you dead.\n\nAfter 45 hours of playing I now have a great deck without paying any real money. Totaly a free game, only those who want to be OP fast in this game, pay their money :v\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","418.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is NOT true. You can easily get a good unit from the free key drops and if you think about how to put your best line-up out there you can definately beat someone with 3 legendary troops. I spent a lot of time just winning P2P with a common troop (goblin) in my line-up.\n2- You can only play 10 minutes a day because you run out of gold to pay for your battles. Also NOT true. Just win some matches at P2P and gain enough gold to keep playing for as long as you'd llike.\n\nHighly reccommended game, IMHO.","December 22, 2014","true","372.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

"meh" option. Overall I'd say its a good game, especially given that it's free. I play a bit every day and it keeps me occupied, but I have some gripes that I need to air out here.\n\n1) It's pay to win. Bleh.\n\n2) It really really needs better AI. Right now the AI is pretty dumb and easily exploitable. This is the formula:\n\nIf 5 match then take it\nelse if 4 match then take it\nelse if 3 skulls match then take it\nelse if attack skill ready then use it\nelse match 3 of a useable color then take it\nelse match 3 of an unuseable color\n\n3) The AI gets a major handicap in the form of free moves. Because the AI is so dumb, the AI opponent is given numerous extra moves in the form of predetermined matches that fall after the player moves. This results in the computer more often than not getting 3-4 turns for every one of the player. Sometimes these extra moves, rather than being a result of a 4 or 5 match, are simply given to the AI at random. While this certainly boosts the difficulty, I would much rather just have a smarter AI than a cheating one. Many of the matches become ridiculously one-sided after the first move by the player, which rather than being a fun challenge, is just a bore at that point.\n\nI wish the devs would have taken all the time they used to compensate for the AI and put it into improving the AI.\n\nThat's really my main gripe. The gold limit on playtime has yet to actually bother me, given that this isn't the sort of game you sit down and play for hours on end.

So far, it is a good game, mainly based on the fact that IT IS FREE! Now, that being said, there are some good things and some maybe not so good things about this game. Of course, I haven't been able to get into all parts of the game, me being so new to it. But, for the parts that I can and have been able to: I have heard many negative reviews on the fact that AI gets way to many chances and/or attacks because the computer gets all the better combinations. Now, I haven't seen that as much as others...possibly because I haven't played as much as others. But, again, it is free people...what do you expect from a free game?  lol   Ok, I like the match-genre games, and this one is better than most I have played. Also, the fact that the matchings go directly to the gameplay makes this game awesome, as you really need to strategize your moves to win. Yes, there will be some luck and unknowing combinations that will arise(from the top of the gameboard when you make combinations as they fall down into the play area). I love the fact that it is a great storyline, and there are other mini-games involved. BUT, I do now see why most of the reviewers complain about the lack of game money here. Each battle costs roughly 50g in game money. But, IF you win, the game only gives you UP TO 23g game money per battle(in my case of where i am at in my game). So, I do agree after playing the game an hour or so, you will most likely need to stop just on the basis that you run out of money...that sucks. I will never ever pay my own money for a free game, I do like the quality and graphics. I would like to see some patches or changes in the money side of the game. Oh, also, one last irk I have is when you level up, you don't have the option to relegate where your points go. The computer adds them at random(which I don't care for). I enjoy games where I can personally deal with points I get from leveling.\n\nOk, so now for my verdict: Yes, I would recommend this game to others.  Thank you for viewing my review, and happy game-playing Gems of War!!!!!!","May 31, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The gem matching is fun and intuitive, if not especially innovative -- but where this game really shines is the way that many other elements are incorporated into a brilliant game that's bigger than the sum of its parts.\n\nI find the RPG / Strategy elements to be well-done and think they add a lot to the game, in particular.  You have constant control over what you choose to do -- quests, raids, challenges, which troops to level up, which masteries to pursue, which weapon to use, and how to build your banners -- and it's absolutely great in that you can play it for 5-10 minutes on a break... or for hours at a time.\n\nYes, like many free games there are micro-transactions.  But you quite literally needn't EVER do a single one to fully enjoy this game.  I think "kids these days" are impatient and can't -- or don't want to -- deal with a typical RPG "grind", and if you want you can basically buy your way through that.  And, truly, the sky is the limit on the amount of money you COULD spend on this game potentially.  Aside from that basic impatience, I am aware some people probably compulsively buy crap in micro-transactions... so if you're like that it may be best to stay away.\n\nPersonally, after playing this for quite a while now (getting a great deal of enjoyment from it clearly) I have just today spent the first actual cash on this game -- $4.99.  But you can play through the story of this game for HOURS without spending a penny.

When I saw this, I felt they had crossed a line of good judgement in the artwork.  And I understand there's a market for this sort of artwork and it's very similar to DnD style.  I can't in good conscience endorse the sort of "surprise!" experience from a more light-hearted introduction in the cover art and first steps playing, to the darker elements.\n\nIf you're going to go that far into a dark S+M artwork style, at least try to reflect it in the game's cover art that this might not be agreeable to all parents for their children playing.\n\nThis is especially surprising when the other games from Infinite Interactive do look like they are targeting a younger audience.\n\nAlso personally, even though I own the DnD genre of games (Baldur's Gate comes to mind) - I don't appreciate when a game goes that far into the dark style, and I tend to give up on the game upon recognizing it.  It just doesn't appeal to me.  Maybe because there are real people who do experience torture and I don't find any enjoyment or entertainment value whatsoever in finding references to torture in games.\n\nSorry.

No fight bonuses. From the start you will have less gold than you need but after few days it is no problem with gold.\nAlso cry about how it is hard or unfair, that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, i do not reallize that is something unfair or too hard to beat. Yes, if play computer he got more moves cuz the gems falling down are ideal for him, but that is really small compenzation for that he cant really use tactic.\n\nI still have fun even if i had played more than 100 hours.\n\nSo, game is free, no subscription or anything i RECOMENDED to try this game and do not listen loosers who cant beat ranked after lvl 50 etc.\n\n8/10. -2 for absention of real PvP.","January 22, 2015","true","134.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Like all Bejeweled clones, Gems of War is a match-three-gems game at its core, with a bonus if you match four or five. But the goal of the game is the kicker- the shell around the match-three-gems field isn't that of a puzzle game, but instead, that of a turn-based RPG with attacks and spells! It seems extremely polished gameplay wise, and is extremely engaging- and FUN.\n\nAnd then you get into the rather confusing system- er, systems- of currency.\n\nFirst, you have gold. You get gold pretty easily in game, even getting small amounts for small things like matching 4 or 5 gems- but it, as far as I have seen so far, goes absolutely nowhere, and has zero uses. This confused me to no end when I checked out the store to see if I could get a new costume.\n\nThen you have the ACTUAL first in-game currency, souls, which are used for leveling up your allies- and that seems to be it.\n\nSecond, you have the real-money currency, gems. And it's used for buying EVERYTHING in the shop, except for itself- you, of course, need real money to buy gems. And the thing that irks me the most is that although you have no use for gold, you can buy it with gems- and although souls are pretty valuable as they're used to train allies, you can't buy them.\n\nAnd fourth, there's Glory, the event-reward currency, used for buying extremely rare items.\n\nFinally, as far as I could tell, there was no way to let my character try on a suit of armor before I could buy it. If a suit of armor is only for looks, let me see how it looks! (Even if I can't buy anything at all with gold.)\n\nHowever, it IS a rather new game, so the stellar gameplay takes the cake here. Upvote with little hesitation.","December 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

To charge the powers you need to get enough 3 in a row of gems in the same color as your power. There is a storyline to it as well, as you go and unlock new kingdoms with new type of monsters and powers.\n\nAlthough, the AI may suggest you moves, but I learned to not trust it. If you follow its advice, you usually end up with giving away opportunities to the AI instead. Try to find your own solutions instead.\n\nOverall, a fun casual game.","March 9","true","9.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The drawings are cute and the animation is fun to look at.\n2. The heroes you get are pretty awesome. I gots me a vampire priestess, a dragon, a rogue, and some others too.\n3. I enjoy the quests and challenges. Every one of them is a little harder.\nand\n4. I like the whole guild thing. This really has some potential to it as players should be able to help other players too.\n\nCons:\n1. It does have a P2W quality to it. I chipped in 5 bucks and got various stuff's but I can already tell it's going to be one of THOSE games. You know. Pay out more for more goodies.\n2. It's luck based. It feels more like Match 3 poker than it does anything else. This fighting mechanic can become grusome esp. during a boss fight. If it draws 3 skulls, sometimes that is all it needs to win. I have lost a lot of battles due to just not "drawing" what I needed at the time.\nand\n3. Probably my least amount of concern goes to the generic soundtrack. I suggest Spotify or Youtube whilst playing.\n\nOverall, not a bad game. It has decent mechanics and even though it's solely luck based..it's not the worst game in the world. I wish it had a little better graphic system, but the cute sprites are fun to look at netherless. I'm impressed with how the game works, on most ends, and will be playing this some more. :)","March 17, 2015","true","5.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The in-game limitations. You know those techniques games use to artificially prolong their life? What I mean is paying to be able to play. Yes it isn't needed, but you need to pay in-game gold to play every time. And what can you do after that? Well you have two option, either wait for your town to generate enough gold so you can play more, or pay up. Especially annoying is when you want to defend youself, you still have to pay gold and there is no guarantee you will be able to do it succesfuly. More often then not you will fail, cause the matchmaking isn't the greatest and almost always you will be facing someone with better characters then you. When your opponent is better the only thing you can count on is the board and that luckily sometimes does help, by giving you useful combinations.\nIt's not a bad game, you don't "have to" pay to play, but it is definitely one of those games where paying helps, and a lot.","December 18, 2014","true","21.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game is set up to make you lose more then any other game I have ever played, I have played Dwarf Fortress.  The AI cheats and will ♥♥♥♥ you over 9/10 of the time.  The majority of the time when the AI suggests a play for you the play it creates for itself to play against you that is much better, if it is not an attack it will create an extra turn for itself.  I have actually been in battles where the AI plays for 30-90 seconds before I get to have another turn.  Finally, I have had battles that I have been winning, got the AI down to 1-2 players left while I still have all 4, just for the AI to get 5 consectutive attacks, 2 of which were critical hits, and completely destroy me.  I will admit this is a bit of a rage review.\n\nI do recommend this game but I don't, Steam doesn't have a nuetral option on recommend, it is addicting but it is also frustrating.  If you rage quit games easily this game is not for you.  If you rage quit and come back in an hour after you cool off then you will enjoy this game.\n\nIn response to the Dev comment to my review, I do have a couple strong teams that can ussually win most of the time, Mauraders/goblins are a strong group to fall back on when I need to, but I get tired of playing the same team all the time and will often switch between teams for more of a challenge, which often can lead to a rage quit.  On that note it is also frustrating during PVP to run into so many goblin/maurader/Zaejin teams, I often find it a relief when I run into a team strategy that is strong and completely different then what I typically run into.","April 1","false","135.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

You can have allies, different weapons, you also get to pick your class, name, and you even gain levels! So far, I've only reached level 5, but I can see this game is really fun. It only takes 333mb of space. What makes the game harder, is that you have to pay with in-game gold or coins to unlock battles, which can be get by daily rewards and by playing games. You can also buy the gold, but I'd reccomend to keep it the hardcore way, so it doesn't make you quite as addicted to game. The story seems great. There are many many weapons and many classes, many allies, and TONS of islands and quests. You upgrade through playing game. For example, you can become more than level 5 in just 30 or less minutes! Also, this game is GREAT for NEWBIES, and even VETERANS. Newbies can go to settings and add "hints" mode to game, which is also already primary setting at start of game. If you want the game to get a little HARDCORE, you can disable the hints, and go for the hardcore. But the game goes harder and harder. Many complain about this game being like, P2W, but it' is actually F2W and P2W. You can be patient and wait for daily rewards, instead of rushing and buying gold for game. This game is no Wizard101, but it is still a great game.","November 24, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Match 3 with Spells and RPG elements.\n\nThis is standard freemium fare, but if you treat it like a standard pay-to-play game it works perfectly without traps.\n\nGold is the "timer" but unless you fall into any traps (buying additional kingdoms, buying the common pack-key) you'll never run out of gold.  "PVP" (asynchronous, so not really pvp) is also a gold mine, costing relatively little to earn 3 times.\n\nEpic cards(2nd best rarity) are earned at end of kingdom quest lines, so there isn't much need to drop cash in hopes of a legendary drop.\n\nTry it, if your a fan of Puzzle Quest, I recommend dropping the $10-$20 that I did for the last few iterations of puzzle quest.

Its fun, new and very creative... Its also hard and you really have to earn your gold in order to play it but... there is a limit to everything too. I was playing just recently and had about 800 gold so i said to myself "well ive cleared 3 lands so time to unlock the 4th" and thats what i did... except the game decided to crash and it deducted the 750 gold it costed to unlock the zone without unlocking it for me. I really hope a developer see this and either gimme back 750 gold or some diamonds i dont care which but if its diamond it should be a fair sum.\n\nsecondly about this game is just the fact its soooooo hard... It feels like it grabs you by the scrotum and jerk your genitals off but release just enough that you want to play more... and once its been tugging for awhile on your crotch that you wanna say "to hell with the game" it gives you a small bonus either in gems or keys.\n\nlast thing i wanna say though is this. FIX THE BUGS i cannot say how many times ive been getting bugs from the game. i do sincerely love the game and will be playing it until ive gotten all lands but please... do consider to try and make the drops from the top a bit more fair cause it feels i have to rely more on the powerup rather than trying to get the skulls to kill my enemy.\n\nsincerely\n\nchris","January 24, 2015","true","79.5"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

And, you know, FREE.\n\n(-) some of the voice-overs are annoying ('Mana Serge!' Is that some magical Sommelier?); Atlanta's cleavage is just improbable; also clearly racist against goblins (I kid, goblins rule!).\n\nThis is a real successor to the original puzzle quest games, with the same humour and over-the-top high fantasy sensibility. I was a fan of the Warlords games from the very start (I am that old) and I had kind of given up hope of ever seeing Etheria or the Warlords universe agin, but this will just about do. I kind of hope Steve Fawkner is involved in this behind the scenes, but if not - this is true to his previous work.\n\nEdit: Looking at negative reviews, a lot of the criticisms are aimed at how to gain troops and the gold mechanic; with a bit of patience, neither is a problem. Some of the best troops are recruited by completing all the quests in a kingdom;  Quests = troops and XP (pro tip, get Divinion Fields and unlock Atlanta; forget what I said about cleavage). Completing quests opens challenges; Challenges = Souls to level up troops. Once you have some half-decent troops, invade your neighbours; losing still earns you enough to absorb the cost of attack, winning gains you around extra 100 gold each time.

Easy to pick up and wonderfully addictive, with the added bonus of having lots of shiny armour, troop and weapon cards to collect. The best part about it is that, whether you're playing through the quests or pvp-ing, it's all about strategy and wits, not player level; the right combination of troop cards can be devastating to an opponent even if they're tens of levels higher than you.\n\nI've seen lots of reviews here that claim the game is 'Pay2Win,' i.e. you have to buy things in-game with real-world cash in order to earn enough gold to even PLAY the game, never mind buy the shinies that give you an advantage. THIS IS NONSENSE. I'm now level 117 and play for an hour or so pretty much every evening, and I can honestly say, hand on heart, I have not spent a penny of real-world money to do that. All the shinies I've bought (like Epic troops and weapons, and armour that gives stat bonuses) I have bought purely with in-game currency which is EARNED BY PLAYING THE GAME. There is a very simple way to make enough gold to play as long as you want AND earn the shinies, and that's to join a guild (which is easy as pie) and help them earn trophies. Do that and the whole 'Pay2Win' thing isn't an issue.\n\nPVP is well-handled, particularly if you're a bit timid about that aspect of the game. While the players you 'invade' or 'revenge' against ARE real players, you don't actually play them in real time; the game selects them randomly and then uses the troops they've selected in advance to play against you using the in-game AI. This removes the uncertainty of hanging around waiting for your opponent to make their move (the computer AI handles it instantly) and also stops you feeling guilty about taking a long time to make your own moves (since the computer AI doesn't care.) However, don't assume that this makes winning a pushover, just because you're 'only' playing a machine. As I previously mentioned, picking the right combination of troops can make or break a match, and with the gem-matching element being the main source of 'charging up' your troops the luck of how the gems fall plays a big part in determining both your and the computer's chances. PVP-ing is how you win trophies (and gold) for your guild, which brings its own bonuses that get better the more trophies your guild earns.\n\nHowever, there's more to the game than just pvp. You can also play through the quests for each of the (currently) 18 kingdoms (you start with one and then 'unlock' the rest with the gold earned from playing.) Completing a quest either earns you more daily income from that kingdom or unlocks a Challenge, which you play through the five levels of to earn Souls (which you can use to level up your troops.) There's also an Arena option in the Broken Spire kingdom, where you're given the chance to pick three random cards to join your character and play against other players (handled the same way as for pvp, except the game AI has also chosen their random cards for them) in a series of up to 8 battles, to win trophies, gold, glory, souls and keys. And the Zul'Khari kingdom has a Treasure Hunt option, which you can use to earn more of the same providing you have a treasure map (which can be earned either through completing guild tasks, getting a super-cascade of seven gem-matches in a row or buying them with Glory points.)\n\nIn short, this game has the addictive thingy-matching of Candy Crush without the teeth-grindingly frustrating complicated extra bits (like bringing down the fruits and nuts, breaking the cages and exploding the bombs before the countdown runs out - admit it, you hate those things!) combined with the Top-Trumps-esque card battles with collectible troops and weapons. Fun on so many levels!","November 11, 2015","true","606.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is fun, they add a ton of new content regularly (new kingdoms / troops / weapons / game modes...). They also hold sales regularly to incite people to spend money, which is understandable.\nBUT there is a major problem: they just don't fix bugs. Some have been going on since the Steam release and have NEVER been patched. Which makes the game infuriating, and sometimes downright unplayable (such as the AI getting free extra turns for no reason whatsoever, the worst offender bug of them all in my opinion, or having wins counted as losses, particularly damaging when playing the arena). Also, actual PvP is non-existent at the moment, which I believe is a shame.\nSo yeah, it's cool to add new content and ask people to give them money, but honestly, as long as they don't work on fixing what's broken before releasing new stuff, the game is just not worth it. Wait for them to fix the bugs before trying it out.","April 28, 2015","true","010.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","I enjoy matching puzzle games that focuses a bit on story mode with troops to train and evolve. There's a lot of "free-to-pay" alternatives. Despite there being a lot of annoyances in this one, I still enjoy it. I can live with the AI cheating most of the time, because I still win a lot of the games. I feel you can still be a good player against the cheating AI, unlike "Marvel Puzzle Quest" where cascades leads to you loosing the game. I don't do PVP. As a casual player doing quests and arena, it works for me.\n\nPositives\nYou choose what troops you want on your team. You train them to become stronger and it's relatively easy to collect currency without paying in the game.\nArema is fun. You are allowed 1 out of 3 choices and make a group to compete againt the computer. I was able to win my two first arenas 8/8 and the rewards helped boost my gameplay.\nI reached level 22 without much hassle or needing to pay anything. I think that is a solid level experience before you decide whether you wish to put some money into a game to help progress faster or not.\nNeutral\nInstead of energy currency like many free games, where you charge up energy to play again over time, your ingame money currency is your "life". So if you are broke, you have to wait for your kingdoms to generate enough money for you to play again. Personally, given that I am quite busy at the time, I usually play a 2-3 before lunch and then in the evening. I find I rarely run out of money enough to play.\nQuests are not displayed in difficulty. So you may accept a mission that is way too difficult for you. And it costs money to attempt the quest. A weird design.\nWhen you complete a quest, it lists getting less gold than you spent on starting the quest. But sometimes I find I have earned keys and other items which were never announced. So it's hard to tell exactly what you earn on a reward.\nIf there's only one enemy left, you still need to select them during your monsters attacks if they have a "Choose enemy" option. A minor annoyance really.\nNegatives\nSometimes the server is very busy and you can't play the game. Sometimes I have to wait 5 minutes for the game to register I completed a quest. It's very annoying when it happens. Mostly in the evening.\nThe computer, like most of these kinds of games, cheats. A lot. With colors and skulls (that deals damage to you) landing in from the top, no matter how smart you are and clear the other nodes to prevent them from getting those. It is not as bad as when the computer cheats in "Marvel Puzzle Quest", but it's still aggrevating when your strongest unit gets killed because the computer is handed the win.\nMost of the stronger enemies have instant-kill skills. Couple this with them handed victory and it gets tedious fast.\nThe "help" system that points out which nodes to move next usually urges you to make a move that helps the computer win. Like giving them free turns (matching more than four) or making skulls drop so that they can match them on their next turn. I've learned to wait and see what happens before I make a move, to see if there's a better option nearby.\nThe PVP matchup is horrendous. The game forces you into a PVP match during the tutorial and you are matched up against opponents you can never defeat. I am talking about people being 20+ levels higher than you.","September 25, 2015","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took a break for almost a year and recently got back to it. There have been some good updates and improvements made in that time including more bonuses, more to spend gold on and more troops. One of the best improvements is adjustable difficulty. Base difficulty removes the cheating AI where they seem to magically have gems  they need drop down into crazy combos which is much needed to eliminate frustrations. Increasing it brings back that little bit of cheating and can increase enemy stats, giving you greater rewards. Win for new players and veterans alike. As you progress through the game you gain new units fairly steadily. Completing all adventures in a kingdom unlocks that kingdom's epic troop and keys\gems are gained from time to time that allow you more troops.\nThe game is fun and strategic, I love making new armies to find various combinations of troops and even order in the army is important. Great game with always more to gain. Sometimes I've got a half hour and get a couple games in, sometimes I sit for hours at a time and grind out souls, gold or other achievments.

I finished Puzzle Quest 1 & 2, and Puzzle Quest Galactrix on the DS back in the day (yes, match-3 games are my guilty pleasure), and so far this game is at least as fair in AI as those games were.  Unless something changes, I don't think anyone needs to worry about the AI stacking on you just to make you buy things.  That said, the game does get progressively harder.  Each area starts out relatively easy, then as you progress you eventually start losing.  At that point, just move to the next area, earn some more goodies, get more powerful, and then come back later and kick butt.\n\nRating this game within its genre, I would give it a 5/5 today.  That said, it's lacking in a big way in that it doesn't have guild chat you can use during games.  Really, the match-3 aspect only goes so far so they could really make this much more social than we've seen in this genre in the past.","October 29, 2015","true","51.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you spend your gold on the wrong things (i.e. keys), you'll probably feel like there is a paywall pretty soon. Instead, when you can, play the Arena to earn nice sums of gold, keys and other stuff. Just read up about what monsters work well there and you should be able to consistently win and at least break even every time.\n\nThere's a lot of different monsters to play with and other interesting mechanics, so it stays interesting for quite a while.

You can level all of your cards/characters up as you see fit, though. There is a quest/storyline, but you get to choose which kingdoms to unlock. Completing all challenges and other requirements will level up a kingdom as well, though I haven't seen how that plays a part in things yet.\n\nFair warning, this game does have the option to buy things with real money.

Because in order to fight you have to spend 50+ gold to fight, and when you win, you get like 5-40 gold back, depends on how well you did in the fight. So your cash reserves will slowly deplete.

You can figure that out, I'll assume you're not an idiot.\n\nThe games fun expansive whatever it's bejeweled with more things to do etc. The reason i'm writing this "review" is because of the simpletons who have said "OH MY GOD IT'S PAY TO WIN!" and thumbed down the game.\n\nlook, it's not amazing. It's free and it's a bejeweled game. It's also single player (The "online pvp" is just an AI using the other players team) so the P2W doesn't matter.\nSo this whole "YOU PAY TO GET GOLD TO GET MONSTERS TO BEAT LEVELS IT'S BAD!" b.s is annoying. It's a single player game, the only progress you make is the progress YOU make. Not some other people. it isn't like there is some group in the game that's going to come to your home and beat your ♥♥♥ because you payed to be better at a bejeweled clone than them, ok? There is no 'winning' just you, giving away your money, because you're bad at games. Ok?\n\nSecondly is the "oh my god I have to wait for more gold?". Oh shocker, a free game trys to get you instentive to play the game who knew.\nAfter the first day of playing this game, yeah this was annoying. Then I rememberd the ten thousand other bejeweled clones, that if I really, REALLY want to, I can go play because I need more of bejeweled than anything else in my life.\n\nBut, after this short contemplation on whether or not I should just go outside when I can't play bejeweled anylonger. I came back to find MORE gold, MORE gold everyone!\nI got so much god damn gold after just ONE day of not playing, that I; like some sick meth addicted freak. Layed in my bed for 10 hours. 10 hours straight. I took a single ♥♥♥♥ that day! I played the game for 10 hours and STILL had gold leftover.\n\nSo any of the "reviews" that complain about that crap, are morons.\n\nAlso, if you just capture the city bellow the first one, you get treasure hunting (which gets you a lot of gold whenever you get scrolls); and you get the elf maker of gold. Which at that point it is easy to play a match for 50 gold, and win and get back 100.

Basically, it costs you gold to play missions, whether you win or loose. That would be bad enough, except you usually don't even get a net positive in gold when you win a mission. That's right, it costs you more to play and win than it would to not play. There is this tax system kinda thing with the kingdoms that lets you get more eventually, but when taken into account that you're suppose to be buying new units and unlocking new kingdoms with this same currency, it's difficult to even get enough to play, and keep in mind, this is the basic currency, not the premium currency. I really can't think of why they would do this either, as nobody in the world is going to buy the currency for IRL cash, since you need it so often and in such bulk, and that there's really no way to make a net positive. Which keep in mind, breaking even is simply being able to keep playing the game.\n\nSecondly, The AI cheats. No, i'm not just bad at the game, to give you some backround, the game plays like a combat trun-based bejeweled, 4 in a ro or an alligning row of 3 gives you a free turn, and lining up attack tile or collecting enough of one color ball will fill up an energy bar you can use for abilities. If you get 4 or 5 in a row, or two connected rows of 3, you get a free turn before your opponent can do anything. The AI will regularly get 4+ tiles in a row 4+ times in a row. This leaves you just frustrated watching it get stupidly lucky while you're helpless to do anything but watch, just hoping it will be done at some point. This is especially frustrating when considering the jumbled mess of a currency system, and that when you loose, you loose the money you put in just to fight.\n\nFinally, and this one is only really an issue in light of the other problems, it wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for the energy system, but there's no way to really grind missions. Every time you beat a level, from what i can tell, there's no way to do taht level again. This means you're going to be going up against a lot of things you might not be ready for, and with the energy system, it's pretty much a hole you can't dig yourself out of.\n\nIf at some point these issues get resolved, the game will be great! Apart from those issues it's quite fun and if they'd just fix these glaring problems, i'd reccomend it to anyone in a heartbeat.\n\nEdit: march 10 2016\n\nAll these issues have been fixed! Which is great. There is the problem now that it's impossible to get above green cards with gold now, whereas before you could get legendary cards, but overall it's an improvement, and i think the game is worth reccomending now. Still, it would be better if they could include at least a small chance of getting at least blue rarity cards, or have some way of getting rarer cards with regular income.","December 12, 2014","true","173.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The Match 3 aspect is very rudimentary, and doing it well or doing it poorly isn't really rewarded or punished all that much except at the highest level of PvP play, which makes it kind of a vestigial add-on to the overall gameplay.\n\nThat said, the game is full of sweet art, neat monster ideas, and a pretty rewarding progression ladder that never really makes you feel like you're stuck anywhere waiting for the next big drop to happen. The larger meta game of card collection/organization and building the perfect army seems well done, but just wasn't compelling enough for me to get really invested in when the underlying match 3 mechanic seems a bit lacking. It'd almost save effort if you just clicked a button to roll a die or pull a lever.\n\nIf you like games with lots of stuff then this could be a game for you, since you are constantly collecting ephermera and mcguffins to cash in to improve your character, your army, or just cosmetics. In the end though that wasn't really enough for me. I will mark it as a recco though simply through the remarkable effort that went into its making, especially for a F2P title.","March 17","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devs actually acted on a few things, which surprised the hell out of me. They removed gold as a barrier from attacking, questing, and generally playing the game. That's a great start. It means you can now play the game as often as you wish, which was my major gripe pre-patch.\n\nthey also added a crafting section which is nice, added lots more things to purchase with gold, glory and gems (i've got mixed issues with that, but i'll get to it below), and streamlined the interface somewhat.\n\nI've switched my review to positive, since the barrier to actually playing is gone, so for a casual game, it's both free and playable at your own pace. Don't get me wrong - there are still flaws, and some of them are major. But not enough to keep me from playing for months at this point.\n\nRight. Flaws. The random nature of drops mean you may literally never get cards you are missing. And since crafting is dependant (for part of it anyhow) on getting multiple cards, or specific ingredients to upgrade cards, well, it can be a pain in the posterior to get stronger.\n\nThe matchmaking system is possibly the weakest part of the entire game. I have no idea why, but you wind up with at least half your matches against opponents that vastly outlevel you. Or outpower you. Having said that, it's obvious in more cases than one that some of these opponents are paying their way to power, which is, again, a real flaw in the game for me.\n\nThey also introduced maps and arena options, but maps are boring beyond belief for, well, terrible rewards. Perhaps if they allowed you to craft multiple maps into a single more powerful map, people would start using them. As it stands, i've got several hundred of the things gathering dust. Arena is equally unsatisfying, essentially because you get better rewards (read:gold) from pvp fights.\n\nThere's lots more to say, but by now you have either installed it and are trying it, or have moved on, and so be it.\n\nKudos to the dev's for listening to the community and making more positive changes than negative.\n\nUpdated March 4, 2016.","January 13, 2015","true","728.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The beginning is very rough as all matches cost gold, but it smooths out after the first initial days. I end up making more gold per game than the cost. For beginners without the troops, it might be more efficient to do the arena minigame where you get 3 random troops.  For people wanting a bigger challenge, the difficulty can be ramped up.\nI have fun coming up with new troop combinations. Common troops can be as usefull as the legendary ones.\n\nIt's also possible to get the money gems in game. Overall, a very fair F2P game.","December 15, 2015","true","526.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callomac/recommended/329110/","Callomac","Callomac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Callomac/","1924 products in account","I initially enjoyed this game quite a bit. It a match 3 combat game, like Puzzle Quest. The game plays smoothly, though the AI is not very good. The game has some RPG elements in which you acquire troops, level them up, and build your attack force before each match. It's fairly addictive, and I had fun with the game for a while. The troop management interface needs to be improved - browsing your troop's abilities is frustrating (an Xbox or Playstation constrained interface?) and there's no easy way to compare troops or compare your current army with alternatives. But the ability to build your army and attack other player's armies (the PvP part of the game) is fun and so I enjoyed this game for a while.\n\nHowever, the real annoyance of the game comes after you have played a bit and start encountering armies that have troop lineups far better than you will ever obtain. I started encountering troops tougher than any I've ever obtained (able to wipe me out quickly). The problem is that you have to obtain keys to unlock chests that contain three random troops, with most troops obtained this way "common" and not very strong - very collecticle card game-like. The good troops are rare, so you can only get them by getting a lot of keys. Yet keys are also uncommon unless you spend a lot of real money.  You can't even grind for keys because every match costs you in-game gold and gold is earned on a fairly slow timer (you earn some as rewards for winning, but you earn less than it costs to play matches). Once I started encountering enemy armies full of epic troops I was toast because I'm not finding epic troops for my army. The real-money costs to buy gold or keys are stupidly high - if you want to play more than a small bit per day you'll need pay more for this game than for a premium game. Some nights I'd be playing well for an hour and then,oh well, I'm out of in-game gold.\n\nSo, as much as I like the idea of the game, and enjoy the bits I could play it, the pay-2-win design, and the decisions to intentionally frustrate players to convince you to pay, really limit how much fun you can have with this game. It's still fun, so I give it a slight positive review, but not as enthusiastic as I could be if the game wasn't pay-2-win.","July 4, 2015","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is fun, they add a ton of new content regularly (new kingdoms / troops / weapons / game modes...). They also hold sales regularly to incite people to spend money, which is understandable.\nBUT there is a major problem: they just don't fix bugs. Some have been going on since the Steam release and have NEVER been patched. Which makes the game infuriating, and sometimes downright unplayable (such as the AI getting free extra turns for no reason whatsoever, the worst offender bug of them all in my opinion, or having wins counted as losses, particularly damaging when playing the arena). Also, actual PvP is non-existent at the moment, which I believe is a shame.\nSo yeah, it's cool to add new content and ask people to give them money, but honestly, as long as they don't work on fixing what's broken before releasing new stuff, the game is just not worth it. Wait for them to fix the bugs before trying it out.","April 28, 2015","true","010.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But once you get the flow of the game and understand the economy you can progress very fast. An active guild is very recommended and can get you all the gems you need to buy costumes which grant you benefits (look into the forums to find a great guild!).\n\nIt's not a pay-2-win game. I have the top two costumes and still 700 excess gems. Also have most troops, only lacking some legendarys and event troops I missed, but they will return eventually. And enough souls to level up any troops I want to try out to max.\n\nThe AI also doesn't cheat. My win rate at the moment is more than 95%. I would rather say the game can get too easy once you have a good synergetic composition of max lvl troops.\n\nWhat I really like about the game are the events and the ammount of stuff you can do. You can sink a lot of time into it but it's also fine to play it for only half an hour each day. In my opinion one of the top games of it's kind and hugely underrated by people who couldn't get into the game.","July 6, 2015","true","226.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is pretty much the best time killer ever, especially if you loved the Puzzle Quest games. I think I might have spent 4.99 for a deal I was offered, which is probably a one time offer to give you a taste of what their shop can offer.... BUT I dont see me spending more unless its another 4.99 deal. I pretty much give all my gold to my guild tasks and it pays off and a little pvp each week gives you plenty of that curreny to buy the special items in the rewards shop.\n\nIf I can offer a couple pieces of essential advice.\n\n1. Get in an active guild ASAP. Monitor the activity and leave if its dead.\n\n2. Finish all the quests in the first town ASAP to unlock the arena, everytime you get 1k gold do an arena which is alot like the Hearthstone arena. You dont use your cards and you get to pick from a 3 card draw, three times. You can lose twice and win 8 times. You make your money back if you win twice but winning 8 times gives you 1500g, 2 keys, 400 souls and 10 trophies.\n\nIf you have not played Puzzle quest and liked even one match 3 try this out. Also dont forget to link your android device if you want to play it from that.","July 27, 2015","true","231.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Countering a lot of the negative reviews here for 2.0.  I didn't play the previous build, so I don't have an axe to grind.  I'm not really invested in the game, so I don't care if it's different than it was before.  There are lots of reviews here from players who feel wronged by the game's changes.  Since those changes didn't impact me, I'm just going to talk about the game as it is and the experience of playing 2.0.\n\nI played Puzzle Quest 1 and 2 a lot.  And several of the other Puzzle-type games from this and other publishers.  And while I really enjoyed the earlier titles, after awhile they just got boring.  They were slow and it was more fun to go play Diablo or something else with a little excitement to it.\n\nSo I'm very happy to report that this game is fast.  The animations are fast, the tile moves are fast, the tutorial is fast, the interface is fast.   But at the same time, you're totally in control of the speed.  If you like to spend time stratgezing before making a match, you can.  If you just like to play oh-what-thehell and make matches as fast as possible, you can.\n\nThere was a certain amount of grinding in the other games and a storyline to follow.  There is here, too, but much more rewarding and no where near as tedious.   Every match gives you something.\n\nWhen the game opens, after a 3-step tutorial, you'll end up with a few important things.  Your first town, your first troop cards, your first rewards, which consist of some chest keys, some soul stones and some gold.  You can spend the gold leveling your town, which will give you more daily gold or you can spend the gold in other ways to improve your game.  The keys you use to open chests that give you more souls, cards and trait stones.   I got an epic troop card from my second chest.\n\nI took that epic card and upgraded it with my soul stones.  I then put it on my team (not sure why they call your troops a team, but whatever).   I equipped my hero with a new weapon, added a few common troop cards I received in my other chests and started on my first town's quest.\n\nPretty soon I had enough gold to buy another town, which contained another quest string.  I now have four towns, each with their own separate quest string.   I received an epic troop card for completion of the first town's quest line, upgraded that and started playing PvP.\n\nI really wish they had not named it PvP, even though it is, it isn't.  One reason I wish they had not is because a lot of players have negative views of PvP, since it often engenders a toxic community, loss is often ridiculed and the pressure to compete leads players to make ill-informed or just plain poor decisions regarding their real life money.   Another reason I wish they had not named it PvP is that you actually don't play another person.  You play against the AI, which is using the other person's team (of cards, like yours).\n\nSo, I gave it a whirl and it turned out to be no different than playing the quest line or the PvE challenges.  The game is exactly the same.  You simply get some different rewards and rank up, which gives you more rewards, gold and soul stones, to improve your game.   There's nothing horrible about it.  No one makes funny noises or calls you names.  Because there isn't anyone there.  The AI loses gracefully or wins gracefully and you move on.\n\nPros:\n\nFun graphics\nPlenty of PvE\nFast gameplay\nSense of advancement\nEnjoyable PvP\nClasses as you level up\nTroop card animations\nTroop card improvements (leveling, new traits, ascend in rank)\n\nCons:\nNo cursor tooltips\nNo explanation of the icons of which there are a great many on cards, on character sheet, on the UI, etc., etc.\n\nThe Cash Shop:\nWill give you an advantage on how fast you level, acquire gold and other in-game currency.  Whether you can parlay this into a top spot on the leaderboards depends on whether you have a good, basic strategy to begin with.\n\nRating:  8/10\n\nQuite enjoyable and fast-paced.  Great way to spend a few hours.","June 3","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
