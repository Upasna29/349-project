Well, Steam and I are going to have to disagree on that. I own the physical collector's edition for the Xbox. I've beaten the game twice. I've bought multiple copies for friends. Alan Wake was the reason I purchased an Xbox 360 in the first place, and when it hit on PC, I bought the Digital Collector's Edition on Day one. I've sunk a lot of time into the game, and thought about it for a great deal more.\n\nI love this game.\n\nIf you try to play it like the average person plays a shooter, you might not have a lot of fun. Alan Wake's not meant to be played 'normally,' it's meant to be played WELL. Shooters are games about controlling space; quite a few people have the mistaken impression that a shooter is about pointing at a thing on screen and clicking until it dies. With Alan Wake, it takes longer to click until something dies, so people get upset and think that Alan Wake is, in fact, a bad game. But that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nAt its core, Alan Wake is a strategic action game. The point is to use the beam of light to manage the distance between enemies and yourself while taking them down. Light keeps them at a distance while burning off their armor. In the most desperate fights in the game, you've got to run a healthy balance between focusing on one guy to destroy his armor and keeping the light shined on everyone else to keep them at bay so you can take down one guy at a time. This strategic play ultimately slows down the pace of the game while ratcheting up the tension. It's super clever.\n\nThe story's great, by the way. You might think it's schlocky, but that's kinda the point: the game's aping the quirky, occasionally bad writing of psychological horror stories, and it does a superb job at it. Instead of trying to be great literature, Alan Wake tries to fit within its genre, and it does a fantastic job! You've got to be willing to be part of the game's peculiar quiddity, but if you do, it'll reward you.\n\nVisually and aurally, it's a stunning experience. Even if the gameplay weren't top-notch, I'd still go back to Alan Wake time and time again. Simply being there, in its world, is fascinating. Remedy crafts its moments so well that some of them are ingrained in my head. Listening to Pat Maine on the radio, shooting monsters on a stage while The Old Guards of Asgod blast away on the speakers, getting your first flares... it's great.\n\nAlan Wake is great.\n\nSeriously, buy it. Play it. Have fun!","December 12, 2013","true","13.9"," 419 of 463 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","419","463","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/108710/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:\nAlan Wake is a survival horror third person shooter developed by Remedy Entertainment on the Xbox 360 in 2010 which slowly made its way to the PC 2 years later. It only took 48 hours for the game to surpass the development cost after their PC release.\n\nYou play as (duh) Alan Wake, a writer who channels Stephen King, who, while on vacation with his wife in a sleepy mountain town, soon find themselves in the center of a supernatural phenomenon that threatens to engulf the town in darkness.\n\nPROS:\n+ Combat: - The combat in itself is not original since it plays like your regular Resident Evil third person shooter, however, it does spice things up by making all the enemies invulnerable until you strip away the 'darkness' that protects them using any source of light (flashlight, torch, flares etc.)\n\n+ Atmosphere: - The town and the surrounding mountains and forest are dark, mysterious, foreboding and generally hostile. Not a great place for a vacation but a great place for a survival horror action game. Great lighting is what really made the atmosphere stand out.\n\n+ Story: - (Also a CON, see below) The game boast a good story line that keeps players wondering what's going to happen next with its unique story telling mechanic. The mystery is deep and the characters within it are well written.\n\n+ Sound: - This would normally go to Atmosphere but I think it deserve its own bullet point. Voice Acting is great, sound effects are well implemented and the musical score are suited to the general theme.\n\nCONS:\n- Horrendous Facial Animations: - The character models are good, textures are nice, but the lip syncing and general facial animations are awkward and painful to look at.\n\n- Story: - (Also a PRO, see above) If the player has ever read a Stephen King book or seen a movie with a Stephen King book as its basis, then you can easily see where this game HEAVILY takes its inspiration. So heavy in fact that it can be seen as unoriginal.\n\n- Too Much Forest: - This is kind of a personal gripe I have with the game. It has way too much forest sequences that makes me kinda hate nature. The forest sequences are nicely done, but if repeated way to many times, it looses its charm.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGREAT GAME. If you're looking for a third person Survival Horror experience and you're one of the disappointed Resident Evil fans, then Alan Wake is a good alternative. It delivers a clever new mechanic to the third person shooting aspect that does not involve chest high walls or massive explosions. Though the re-playability might not be great, Alan Wake still brings a lengthy adventure that makes your money's worth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/108710/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Game name: Alan Wake\nGame score: 10/10\nReviewed by: Wolf\n\nIn Summary...Alan Wake is a psychological horror survival game produced by Remedy Games in 2010. The game follows writer Alan Wake, who becomes trapped in his dreams pursued by the antagonist "The Darkness" who turns people basically into pawns of an evil force. Your main goal is to find and save your wife, Alice Wake, who is presumed taken by The Darkness.  The DLC, The Signal and The Writer, respectively, continue the story of Alan being trapped in his dreams, and further expands the story on how he defeats The Darkness.\n\nIn The Signal DLC, you travel through memories of the past game (main story) uncovering clues to how to wake up from your dream. With Barry to accompany you, he guides you through the area with both motivation and moral support (such a good guy Barry is).\n\nIn The Writer DLC, you finally uncover the truth about Barry, as well as uncover the reason your dreaming. Zane is there to guide you as like the main story, and helps you defeat The Darkness and wake up from your dream.\n\nAlan Wake is an episodic story, meaning it's told in episodes rather than all at once, kind of like how TellTale styles their games.\n\n\nControls:Mouse 1 - Shoot\nMouse - Look\nWASD - Move\nQ - Reload flashlight\nE - Pick up objects/use\nR - Reload gun\nF - Focus\nTab - Toggle view (which side displayed in 3rd person)\n1,2,3,4,5 - Cycle weapons\n\nSounds:Being a horror game, Alan Wake is filled with jump scare sounds (at least for me) such as when a Taken jumps out and attacks it's pretty sudden at times and can scare some people. Some of the cutscenes also have jumpworthy sounds when transitioning, not going to spoil where it's at because that would ruin basically the whole story.\n\nAnother thing to note is the music. Each episode ending features music which in my opinion is perfect for the game. It's not disrupting in any way, and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game. It's mostly Indie Rock, but very fitting with the game and mood, so it fits in well with everything.\n\nGraphics:So most people may not know this going into this game, but doing research will point out this game took over 5 years to develop. Being that this game was released in 2010, the graphics are still unbelieveable to this day, prividing both very scenic background areas, and also amazing cutscenes. Now, they may not be "Unreal Engine: real life vs video game" standards, but literally, I loved them, and got quite a few worthy of posting screenshots out of them.\n\nGame Balance:Honestly, the game was very easy. At points I did struggle (died a lot because I honestly wasn't thinking, just attacking, especially at points where I just needed to run to a Safe Haven and Taken were infinitely spawning because of it), but in the end I realized how easy the enemies were and how easy it was to progress through the levels.\n\nAlbeit, I did play on normal difficulty the whole time (Nightmare I still have to do for the rest of the achievements) but I've read it's the same as normal, just less ammo, which is perfectly fine, there's way too much ammo in the game as it is. Think of Nightmare mode as hard difficulty, since they removed hard mode and there is a gap between normal and nightmare.\n\nOtherRemedy, ♥♥♥♥ Microsoft and find a new producer/publisher. They aren't biting and your fans NEED Alan Wake 2.\n\nFinal Rating:10/10\n\nIn Conclusion:Alan Wake is by far to date the best experience I've had in a game. It's inspired a lot of creativity out of me, one of which are a few ideas for short stories and also has provided me with a perfect story in game form. I loved literally every second of this game, and I very very very highly recommend it to all of my friends and anyone who reads this.\n\n-It's not a lake, it's an ocean.\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

He hasn't managed to get a word on paper for almost 2 years. The idea however wasn't for Alan to actually write there, he needed some time off.\nWhen his wife Alice tell him she has a suprise for him, he gets excited. The suprise however did not turn out to be a good one, Alice showed him a typewriter, Alan gets furious, and goes outside to cool down. When he looks up, he sees the lights switch off in the study where he and Alice where just moments ago, followed by a terrifying scream. A second goes by, and all of the sudden he sees something drag Alice from the balcony into the water. He doesn't think, and jumps in the water.\nHe wakes up in his car, for after what seems just to be a moment later. The citizens of Bright Falls that have gone missing over the years try to kill him, but they're not just regular citizens. Something dark and evil has taken possesion of them, making them almost unable to be killed. The dark smoke that surrounds them protects them from everything vulnerable to them, except for one crucial thing. Light. Lucky for Alan, he owns a flashlight, and he isn't afraid to use it. He finds a revolver, and manages to find a way to kill these dark inhabitans of Bright Falls. In his journeys he comes across so called 'manuscriptpages', pages from a book he apparently wrote...\n\nThis is just the beginning of the great game called; Alan Wake. It's storyline is so good and at the same time so terrifying, you might actually fall off your chair when playing this game. The many characters you come across in your travels through Bright Falls shows that the creators really did their best when the made this game. I find this story suitable for an actual book, my favorite writer Stephen King would approve this. The money you pay for this game might even be not enough, this game will suck you up just like a good book does. You get so involved with the characters and environment that you need to pinch your arm ones or twice before you go back to the real world. This game is defenitly a must-play.","August 15, 2014","true","14.7"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","53","60","0","0"

The story's quality is that of a blockbuster movie narrated by Alan Wake himself, divided into several chapters. Gameplay-wise this game plays with light like few other horror games do. Revolvers and shotguns sure are handy, but your best friend and best weapon in this game is any lightsource you can find. The Taken are surrounded by a shield of darkness that deflects bullets, and only a concentrated beam of light can break their defenses. Focus your flashlight's lightcone on your enemies and finish them off with a couple of shots to see them explode and burst into little sparks. It may not offer tons of replayability, apart from collecting all the collectables and achievements, but it's a thrilling ride any lover of great storytelling should go through at least once.","February 1, 2014","true","8.4"," 65 of 79 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","65","79","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/108710/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","The story in Alan Wake is quite exceptional comparing to other video games in the genre. Too bad the rest of the game can't match up to the well-written storytelling.\n\nThe game kicks off interestingly where we meet our protagonist, who is struggling with writing crisis and a "little bit" of insanity. Soon we find ourselves fighting with shadowy creatures named 'The Taken' controlled by a mysterious force.\n\nThe fighting mechanics based on the power of light are unique. While this newish fighting scheme is fun at first it lacks deepness, so it becomes repetitive. Unfortunately nothing good can be said about the controls, which is one of the most discouraging features of the game: awkward movements, slow reaction times, super sensitive mouse controls\n\nOne of the high points of the game is the voice acting. It phenomenally supports the great story, which pushes the player for resolution...that may or may not exists in the end. The end of the story will leave many with questions and bad taste, but the open nature of the conclusion is not necessarily a bad thing at all. However, the special chapters (The Signal and The Writer) will help put a proper end to this tale.\n\nAfter 6 chapters it is hard to think of any reasons why anyone, who is not a fan of Alan would start this game all over again. The replay value of the game is very low thanks to its linear nature. Other than some collectibles there's no point to return. Alan Wake is one of those games that would've been enjoyable on a big screen rather than with a controller in a hand.\n\nRating: 65/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 14-16 hours (incl. the specials); Played on: normal.","July 17, 2013","true","17.1"," 81 of 106 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","81","106","0","0"

Alan Wake definitely won a place in my top 10 games of all time.\n\nAnd also, if you like watching Twin Peaks then you will love this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/108710/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","Let's get one thing out of the way: If you're a creative type, especially a writer of any persuasion, Alan Wake is worth a playthrough just for the subject matter, namely the nature of dreams, the unconscious, and the creative process, and how they are all tied up in each other. Any professional fiction writer will tell you that they often don't know where their "ideas" come from -- they might as well just come straight out of the proverbial ether, and to anyone else it sounds like superstitious mumbo-jumbo. But the truth is, it often really does come out of left field, left field being that ocean of subconscious impulses and images that is constantly roiling in everyone's heads. A writer's job is paying attention to those images when they do show up, when most people can comfortably ignore them, and that makes it a tricky business. That's the gist of what Alan Wake deals with, and if anything, it's worth it to see what the game devs have to say about it.\n\nIs it a GOOD story? Well. That is entirely up to your interpretation of the events in the game. And I'll mostly leave it at that. I'll give some of my impressions in no particular order: If you like the show LOST, you'll like this. If you like David Lynch's stuff, you will like this, particularly for some of the music and very obvious homages to things like Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and perhaps Lost Highway. That is to say, if you want things to make sense in a linear way, forget it. It's actually a little bittersweet to play through this if you are a big fan of Lynch, because while Alan Wake is very very obviously a love letter to the "weird stuff happening in a little town" genre, and it really does nail some of the spooky imagery that Lynch is known for, the characters and the dialogue fall disappointingly flat. It's a very rough imitation of the unforgettable dialogue of Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, etc. I can't fault them that much for that, because at least they tried. Enough of that.\n\nGameplay is pretty technically tight with satisfying, challenging gunplay mixed up with light-source mechanics -- you weaken things with your flashlight, and then blast them. It's fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. But, and this just may be my low tolerance for the same damn thing over and over, there are many times later in the game where you wish you could just get it over with. The pacing is a little annoying and predictable at times; when you would appreciate a chance to just wander around in the more story-oriented areas, suddenly you're back in the gauntlet of enemies running through the nighttime forest. And there is a LOT of nighttime forest. You've never seen so many trees! But they certainly look pretty. One of my biggest gripes would have to be the fact that the game occasionally does not follow its own rules, which inevitably leads to some frustrating reloads. The enemies will sometimes cheap-shot you, for example falling on you while you're in the middle of opening a chest; most of the time you cannot break out of certain "cinematic" moments fast enough and it will screw you fairly mercilessly. Thankfully reload times are fast and the checkpoints for the most part are plentiful and logical. Just minor annoyances when it comes down to it.\n\nIt's a fun ride for the most part. I wish I could say that "this is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee," but for several reasons it's just a pretty good cup of joe.

Originally planned to release on PC before it became an XBOX 360 exclusive, I simply just forgot about it until it surprisingly came to PC three years later. Billed as a return to the survival horror genre of gaming that dominated in the early 2000's with the likes of Resident Evil (not the new ones though) and Silent Hill - Alan Wake ensures that the genre is still alive and kicking even though its been almost abandoned by its former chaperones.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345664296\nAlan Wakes tale begins with a trip to a secluded cabin in the town of Brighfall to try an unlock a bout of writer's block the author has been experiencing of late. Shortly after arriving Alans wife goes missing and the player is left to unravel the mystery as events from a novel Alan can not remember writing beging to manifest into reality. The game is divided into episodes or chapters, like that of a novel or the fictional TV series depiced in game that helps unfold the story at pivitol points and most of them end on cliffhangers urging the player to continue forward.\n\nWhilst it certainly has its "boo" moments, most of those moments come from some of the very tense situations you will find yourself in. In my books when a game has one or two "What the ♥♥♥♥ just happened there" moments it elevates the game out of the ordinary making it something a little more special when most games these days are simply paint by the numbers of former successes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345663883\nAlan Wake has so many of them I've lost count. From the first moment I saw the birds by the thousand just flying ominously around the cabin I was approaching or to the incident on the cable car or where objects like an entire train cart been flung towards me when I least expected it. The fine hairs on my skin have literally fizzled with tension during these sequences and they truly must be seen to be believed. Never before have I feared the squawk of birds as much since seeing Alfred Hitchcock "The Birds" as a child and I am sure Stephen King, horror meister, would get a kick of delight out of playing this title as this is the first interactive experience to channel King so ardently. It helps that Remedy have always maintained that the game is a homage to the brilliance of King.\n\nThat doesn't mean the game is perfect however and much like most of Stephen Kings novels it gets weighed down by its own narrative with the developers trying to cram in too many things. It literally becomes a case of throw it at the wall to see if it sticks. This approach does have a detrimental effect though as it increases the game by a good 1/3 making it one long and hard slog when you are pursued for the 1000th time by the spirit invaders after some outlandish plot twist that most of the time makes very little sense. There is a lot going on here with enough twists and turns to make Twin Peaks look almost normal in comparison. Dialing it down a bit and chopping off some of the unnecessary fat would have made this game a classic for its generation.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345663576\nI definitely urge any action or survival horror fan to give the game a go. The beginning may be a bit cumbersome and slow going but once the plot kicks into high gear you will want to see it through to the end even when it starts to become a rather tireless affair. Remedy also throws its PC gamers a bone by dishing up Alan Wake with an assortment of graphical options, a high resolution detail pack and a mouse and keyboard combo that works perfectly if you plan on playing without a controller. This should please even the most hardened, jaded, cynical gamers out there who associates console ports with the trash bin.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","January 18, 2014","true","31.8"," 87 of 118 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","87","118","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/108710/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Alan Wake is an episodic psychological-thriller action game that follows the titular author on his 'vacation' to the fictional Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls. Alan has fallen on hard times, after writing his very successful Alex Casey crime-drama series, he hasn't been able to write another book for the last two years, and has become far more well-known for his violent out-lashes at the press. He and his wife, Alice, are hoping to get away from it all, away from the bustling city of New York that they're accustomed too to the small and peaceful Washington town ... However, this goes terribly wrong after a series of odd occurrences at their resting cabin ends up with Alan waking up a week later with no memory of what happened in the last week, his wife missing, and strange shadow people coming after him in the darkness of the woods.\n\nAlan Wake at its best is an immersive trip both into the rather colorful and well-realized town of Bright Falls, and the more sinister and campy lurkings that pull from everything from Stephen King to Lovecraft to David Lynch. At its worst its a repetitive combat game where you'll often get lost in the woods.\n\nMaybe more appropriately stated is that Alan Wake is a huge love it/hate it game. There are elements of Alan Wake that it pulls off beautifully, while other elements wear rather thin over its course. Honestly how much you enjoy the game deals completely in how grand you enjoy what it does right, and how much you can deal with what it does wrong.\n\nAlan Wake is a rather gorgeous game. It has fantastic art direction, a well-done lighting system, matched with fantastic optimization for PC and probably some of the best realized forest settings and night lighting realized in games. Its visual flair suffers a bit from some weird facial animations from the characters, but during sections of the game where you stand on mountains overlooking a valley below full of details, it can be kind of breath-taking. Bright Falls feels like a real-place, and the way they connect everything and how it all fits together as an overall map is impressive. It does feel like a vibrant, lived-in place often during the daytime sections of gameplay where you get to explore and take everything in.\n\nIt also has a very elegant soundtrack to it. The compositions really switch between three tones; beautiful symphonic pieces for the more relaxing and emotional scenes of the game, low-keyed and sometimes a bit sinister down-time music to match exploration and dreary environments, and rather thunderous 'struggle' music of when the action gets going. From this, the beautiful symphonic pieces definitely stand-out, but none of it is really bad. On-top of this, a variety of licensed songs have been chosen for the game, which play on radios and during episode endings. And sound-design is rather top-notch, with atmospheric forestry sounds, creaks in rustic homes, and little sounds that really help make the atmosphere and world. The sounds of shining light on enemies, shooting your gun, and your flashlight turning on, are all also suitably satisfying.\n\nThe gameplay of Alan Wake is really split into two modes; Exploration mode, where you're in a location without enemies with a variety of small tasks you can do, both for progression and for fun, and Night Time, when often you're isolated and alone (or with someone who you question how long they're going to last) as monsters come out at you from the woods. The night time takes up probably about 80% of the game, while exploration mode happens about 20% of the time.\n\nThe combat system is fairly simple, though with a few tricks to it. Enemies are covered in shadows which make them invincible to bullets, so the first goal is to disperse the shadows with your light. You can focus-down a strong beam of light that will chip more at the shadows of an enemy, but rapidly consumes battery power, or do a normal light, which does a lot less damage to Taken but slowly recharges the battery. If you use up a battery, it will go out and be off for about 10 seconds, unless you put in a new battery, but of which come in limited supplies. You can also use light to also stun enemies by flashing them with a strong beam quickly, which is useful if you decide to flee rather than fight. The guns feel rather samey, but you also get flashbang grenades, which will kill in one-hit weaker enemies and damage stronger ones, and flares, which you can light to ward-off enemies or deplete at their shadows.\n\nAlan's final form of dealing with Taken is to flee from encounters, but this can be a bit tricky at first. Alan has very limited sprinting (he'll tire out after about 15 seconds and lower his pace to a light jog), and the enemies can catch-up to you without some intervention. The real art of fleeing in Alan Wake isn't just running, but to manage your stamina meter (it's better to stop before you tire-out to recharge it than letting it run out), and managing the enemies with your light by briefly flashing a strong light on them to stun them for a few moments.\n\nAll-in-all, it can be satisfying, but as the game goes on it can also be fairly repetitive. There's only about seven types of enemies through the course of the game, and three of them are rather similar. The limited selection and the amount of times you face the enemies can be a bit tiring.\n\nAlso a good portion of the game is set in forests., especially early on. The game throws you into a lot of forests where if you're not good at keeping direction in mind or marking landmarks, it can get very easy to get lost.\n\nBut there is some good mix-up here. A variety of set-pieces and moments lay littered through the adventure to help break the tedium of combat, ranging from atmospheric and moody caverns, stage show showdowns, a variety of exploration and daytime sections, police chases, car driving segments, and more. In some parts of the game you won't be fighting alone, and notably during Episodes 4 and 5 especially, they tread you away from the forests to much more interesting locations.\n\nAlan Wake may test on some gamers patience, but there is also a lot to love here. The characters are colorful, and through the game's course are very easy to like. Optional side-stuff, including interesting radio broadcasts and black-and-white Twilight Zone parodies you can watch on televisions through the world are enjoyable.\n\nThere are a total of 8 episodes in Alan Wake, and to beat them all should take you somewhere between 12-24 hours. The breaking point for many comes during Episode 3, which is notably the longest episode in the whole game, and with less story developments than most of the other episodes as well.\n\nOn a personal level, I really enjoyed Alan Wake. It has flaws, the biggest one being repetition, but the overall package I found to be immersive, to have enjoyable TV-show like gameplay segments (fun characters, cliffhangers, location design), and I got rather wrapped up in the story and world of the game. There's stand-out moments in gameplay, and I can honestly say there is no other game quite like Alan Wake. While it pulls from a lot of sources, it manages to be unlike any other game, and quite unique.\n\nBut there is drudgery here, and if you're less a fan of camp, world-building, and more dragged down by repetition of combat, you may very well not enjoy your trip to Bright Falls. To some, the game comes off as a mediocre game with flashes of brilliance that it unfortunately does not ever quite live up too.\n\nAlan Wake will either strike with you or will not, a rather polarizing game. However, if you're a fan of horror authors, television programs like Twin Peaks or Happy Town, or want a believable Pacific Northwest setting, this may do you in.","May 18, 2014","true","44.7"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","44","54","0","0"

I would highly recommend if you don't own the game you should stop reading and immediately go pick it up..  Need a little more convincing where here goes..\n\nYou find yourself playing the mysterious and successful author Alan Wake.  Finding himself with a major case of writers block, Alan and his wife Alice decide to take a trip to Bright Falls, hoping the distraction of a 2 week vacation in a beautiful setting will help shake out of the cobwebs.  What could go wrong, a beautiful woman, a beautiful scenic cabin and  2 weeks of silence..\n\nThe game was originally supposed to be an open world game, and what a game it would have been.  Unfortunately while the open world portion of the game was cut, the parts that remain are fairly large although kind of straight forward.  Yet exploration by the player is rewarded with additional supplies or collectibles..\n\nThe combat....  it's unique and interesting, although can be a bit repetitive as only a few different enemy types exist in the game..  The major way this game excels where other 3rd person horror games have failed is with dodging... and trust me you'll be doing alot of dodging..  Outside of that it's fairly straight forward, point your flashlight at enemy, break the darkness shield and then fire away with one of your weapons (Handgun, Shotgun, Flare gun,) it's easier than it sounds although at higher difficulty levels the limited supplies will more than likely see you running to the next check point..\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, mystery movies,  3rd person games or just games in general you will probably like Alan Wake, the only real downside of this game would have to be the lack of enemy diversity.  Although the story more than makes up for the short comings of the enemy diversity.","October 7, 2015","true","3.9"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","29","38","2","0"

The characters and story along with the storytelling are awesome. The graphics, photography, and camera work are stunning. The one major blemish is the gameplay which isn't all that bad, it just isn't all that good either. However using a flashlight to fight off the darkness is a pretty cool concept and the execution comes off pretty nicely. Although I have to admit the game didn't draw me in to play non-stop from start to finish--ultimately starting the game in September and not actually finishing it until November.\n\nSo what is it about Alan Wake that makes it so standoffish? Well for starters, the gameplay starts to get repetitiously dull. Some of the forest paths are really long laying ground for more hordes of Taken than one person can deal with before it just becomes mundane. It is kind of broken up with some areas to explore in between, but it wasn't enough. The other aspect which may sound weird is that I never really felt like I took the role as Alan Wake. Instead it felt more like I was just moving the story forward and watching Alan unfold as opposed to being a part of critical decisions. Fortunately the chapters are broken up very nicely into roughly two hour segments with good musical intermissions allowing players whatever amount of time they need before jumping into the next chapter.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game and a must play in my book.","November 13, 2013","true","13.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","0"

However, Alan has much more to think about other than his novel when his wife mysteriously vanishes, and pages of a manuscript that he doesn't remember writing suddenly begin to appear; ominously outlining events that are about to occur. Alan Wake is brought to us by the developer of Max Payne 1 and 2, Remedy Entertainment, and was initially released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 before finally making its way to PC in 2012.\n\nThings start off normal enough, you're on a ferry with your wife Alice, headed to a remote destination in the forest for your vacation. Your writer's block has been killing your career, you need the escape. You're met by friendly locals who are excited that a big-shot such as yourself will be vacationing near their little town. You stop by a gas station on your way to the cabin that you and Alice have rented, but once you come out of the bathroom things begin to go haywire. However, it's when Alice goes missing at the cabin that things really heat up. She's scared of the dark, so badly that she becomes paralyzed with fear, and now everything is dark; save for what becomes illuminated by your flashlight, and your wife is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe storytelling in the game is absolutely fantastic, as Alan's inner monologue is spoken as though it is in book format. The game itself is set-up in a TV show format, where once you reach the next chapter you'll be greeted with a "Last Time on Alan Wake" sequence. The entire experience is like playing through a deranged horror show while listening to a coupling audio book. These unique factors only adds to the eeriness of the game, and they also add a different spin on the horror genre as a whole. For the time of release, the environments are lavishly detailed and come with a thick amount of ambiance such as fog, rain, and lightning. Most of your time will be spent in the dark, with only a flashlight to help guide you from one creepy destination to the next. While most of the baddies look the same, their potential of showing up always keeps you looking over your shoulder to make sure that you're not being chased by their near silent presence.\n\nEquipped initially with only a flashlight and a pistol, you will later find yourself with more diverse guns to battle the onslaught of evil that awaits. Even though Alan Wake is fast-paced, the fact that you never know from which direction, and when, the devious shadow-people will make an appearance keeps tight tension in the air. Combat is simple, you must shine a concentrated flashlight beam on the shadow-people to dissolve their darkness barrier, and then fill them full of bullets. Paranormal entities are abound, and even inanimate objects become possessed and deadly. When you get overwhelmed, flares and flashbangs are your best friend when it comes to keeping these monstrosities at bay. Whatever you do, your ultimate goal is to stay in the light; that's the only place that you're safe in, but well-lit areas are few and far between.\n\nTo say that Alan Wake was, and still is, one of the best horror games of the last generation is an understatement. The game was initially a diamond in the rough when it was released on the Xbox 360, though it appears to have garnered the attention it deserves after being released on PC. Graphically, it doesn't even look that dated, it was very far advanced for its time when looking at other games of the same genre and time period, such as F.E.A.R. and Condemned: Criminal Origins. Alan Wake has a flair to it that no other horror title has yet to emulate, duplicate, or even attempt to replicate, it's one of the few games that have been left alone to be uniquely itself. Even six years later, this game stands as one of the horror games that must be played, but not for the price of $32.99 CAD; wait for a summer or holiday sale first.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 2","true","23.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

It has all the charm and meticulous world-building that made the Max Payne series great with the game universe having its own pop culture you're privvy to and yet managing to keep your nerves on edge.\n\nIt's not a terrifying game in the sense that Amnesia or Silent Hill are (though Silent Hill is the series I'd liken it to the most) but it does its job as a suspenseful and tense survival horror nonetheless. Using light as a weapon and having to conserve your resources makes every fight an exciting one and the pacing is very well executed, giving you the occasional downtime while the story advances.\n\nThe story is an interesting breed and pays homage to multiple works from HP Lovecraft and Stephen King to Twin Peaks and the Twilight Zone and does its job well to keep you playing. There are some over-arching themes that I found interesting, but that I won't spoil here. Suffice to say that as far as Survival Horror stories go, Alan Wake is at least moderately ambitious, thematically. The structure is an episodic one splitting the story in several manageable 2-3 hour long chapters giving you a clear cut between story arcs so that you can take a break for the day.\n\nThe graphics make for some beautiful, if perhaps a bit dated, sceneries even if most of the game takes place at night. There is attention to detail to spare in Alan Wake and it seems to be a labor of love. The sound and voice acting are subject to little criticism and I guarantee that at least one or two tracks from the score and soundtrack will wind up in your playlist.\n\nIt comes highly recommended.","January 17, 2015","true","19.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/108710/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Alan Wake is a combination of survival horror and psychological thriller. It looks, plays, and feels a lot like an episode of Twilight Zone, from which the game overtly draws a lot of inspiration. Alan Wake is *not* an action game, but there are combat sequences which feel forced, repetitive, and unnecessary.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Interesting and compelling story, although it is cliche at times. I get the light/dark motif and its importance to the theme - but it is as old as sin and you don't need to cram it down my throat!\n\n* The game runs great on PC; it is hard to tell this is a console port. I originally played the game on console and I think I now prefer it on PC.\n\n* Fantastic graphics and atmosphere. The town of Bright Falls feels like a real town in its own fictional universe with its own radio stations, TV programs, and billboard advertisements.\n\n* The game is frequently only $3-$5 (up to 90% off!) during Steam sales, which is one of the best deals I have seen for a AAA title on Steam.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* The player is asked to press F5 quite often to read manuscript pages. However, once done reading the manuscript, the player is given the option to (a) cancel, or (b) return. These two options are fairly ambiguous, and I more than once chose the "cancel" option, which required me to navigate through several menus to actually get back to the game.\n\n* Uninteresting "collectibles" mechanic - why am I supposed to collect these coffee thermoses if I have no idea what they do or how to keep track of them? Why is someone hiding them in horrible places, such as behind this large sign that happens to have an invisible wall next to it?\n\n* The combat is unique but completely uncomepelling: you must first shine a flashlight on an an enemy for perhaps 3-4 seconds before your bullets will do any damage. In practice, this mechanic is the least-interesting portion of the game. I ended up dreading combat sequences as they distracted from the game's only strong-suit: the plot.\n\n* Inconsistent ammo/resource management feature. At times I was constantly at maximum capacity, and at other times I was avoiding entire mobs of enemies to conserve ammo. If I was ever low on ammo, I could always spend 5-10 minutes backtracking to pick up ammo that I left earlier due to being at maximum capacity the first time around. This is entirely flawed game design: either give the player a larger capacity for ammo, or don't give them the ability to go back and pick up ammo they missed. Making the player go backwards at a snail's pace is NOT a feature.\n\n* Awkward controls limit Alan's mobility. Why can I jump over some knee-high ledges, but not small logs that are about ankle-high?\n\n* The "extra episodes" are horrible. My first death occurred because I walked into some floating text a few times....\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* Horrible check point system. There are no save games, just checkpoints. If you barely survive an enemy encounter with only 1 bullet left and happen to end up at a check point, that's it, there's no retrying that fight to see if you can land a better outcome. That one bullet is all you have now, and you now have to either start the entire game over or try running through the rest of the chapter without fighting any enemies (which is virtually impossible if there are more than 2-3 enemies at once.)\n\n* Outside of the fantastic plot, the game, at its core concept, is a hallway with uninteresting obstacles in the way. By the end of chapter 2, you will begin to ask yourself how many more repetitive trails in the middle of the woods you will have to travel to reach the end of the story (spoiler: a lot more).\n\n* Even though I have touched on the plot being fantastic so much, there are some huge plotholes. If the monsters are afraid of light, why didn't Alan buy a much bigger flashlight before he went venturing around at midnight? If a non-monster person wanted to meet Alan, why did he set the rendevous time to be at night when the monsters are out and he knows it is unsafe? There are also MANY more plotholes that would be spoilers if I typed them here. Also, as in the Bioshock games, if you don't collect all the manuscript pages (which are often somewhat hidden), you are liable to miss entire sections of the plot.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nAlan Wake might be worth it to check out the story for three or four dollars. Personally, I felt the replay value and broken mechanics were so bad that I could not bring myself to play it through a second time while writing this review. Pick this up only if you are looking for a good story with depth and don't mind repetitive action sequences.","January 1, 2014","false","3.1"," 107 of 190 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","107","190","0","2"

After a few years, Alan is unable to write anything. His wife, hoping to help him with his thoughts, brings him to Bright Falls.\nOnce you drive to your cabin, Alan gets into an argument with his wife and storms out. Darkness consumes the cabin and Alan's wife disappear. He runs outside and sees his wife in the lake and jumps in. Afterward, he finds himself in his car with a head injury, with no memory of what happened after he dove in the lake.\nThe core story spans six episodes, each crafted like part of a TV miniseries. After the first episode's exposition each that follows ends with a cliffhanger, fades to a title screen and then transitions into a plot recap as the next begins.\nTo finish the game it takes a bit over 10 hours, the story may seem a bit short, but collectible items like hidden coffee thermoses and collectible manuscripts, which tell more and more about Alan Wake's story, offer some incentives to return to Bright Falls.\nAlan Wake has stellar lighting effects and environmental design that creates an atmosphere to make the scares and thrills more affecting. The game is full of shadows and effects that put the mood of the game into good use.\nThe in-game music is atmospheric and totally in-tuned with the story.

From an early stage you're taught to be afraid of the dark. It's intriguing and obscure as you journey through a nightmare, running from light to light, armed with a flashlight and occasional flare as you're persued by dark creatures. Between the scary night stages are relaxing daytime stages that come as a genuine relief and also serve to progress the story.\n\nI'm pleased to say thart the game unnerved me. It nails the queasy feeling of a nightmare perfectly as small things gradually grow into impossibly large obstacles without you realising until it's too late. There's a strange black goo that begins consuming the world and things start to shake before being hurled at you from across the level. It repeatedly lures you into a false sense of security by giving you other people to hang around with, before cruelly forcing you apart from them again and again. Towards the end of the game I had had enough but it was worth playing up to that stage.\n\nThere's a recurring theme with my games collection- it's the games that I wouldn't consider to be my taste that end up being the most memorable and enjoyable. Alan Wake falls under that category. It's a one-off experience, but one that is most definitely worth the effort.","December 7, 2013","true","11.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But there can be no explanation, and there shouldn’t be one. The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest, and it’s what we’ll remember in the end. My name is Alan Wake. I’m a writer."\n\nThis qoute exactly shows what this game is. This game is a tribute to great horror writers like: Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft. Excellent combination of thriller and a bit of horror athmosphery. Fantastic story where's always a mystery: Alan Wake is writer who for vacations goes to a little town called Bright Falls, which resemble Twin Peaks, with his wife Alice. After moving to theirs house, they start an argue and Alan walks out of it. After some time he hear screams. He run into the house to check what happened, then he finds his wife in the lake, he jumps after her and he... wake up in the car. Yeah, the rest is mystery and it's revealing itself during story playthrough. What makes the mystery more mysterious is that we're finding manuscript pages in which a little glipse into the future is written. Graphics is beautiful with fantastic landscapes. Fighting with enemies is interesting and unique too, we can't just shoot them, no, the light is our strongest ally. First is needed to light the enemies until theirs "darkness shield" is off, then we can shoot. It's not a shooter game so there isn't too much of a weapon choice, couple of rifles, revolver, flash granades and flares. Too bad that there's no puzzles at all, most of them look like: go from A point to B point, but still game is fantastic. The last what I want to write about is game soundtrack.

Oh man I’m freaking out right now. These damn shadows seem to move and all I have is this small flashlight. To make things even worse I have some guy screaming "You take two pills in the morning.... and then you'll be nice and calm all day" in some demonic voice. Ya my nerves aren’t racked.\n\nAlan Wake is a psychological survival horror that will scare you and amaze you at the same time. You play as Alan Wake an author who is on vacation with his wife to get some relaxation in or so he thinks. Once you arrive in the nice little town of Bright Falls things start getting a little weird when some old lady in black gives you keys to a cabin on Cauldron Lake. You arrive at the cabin and are trying to get settled in when your wife screams. You find the porch railing broken and an image of her drowning in the water, so you dive in after her only to wake up in your wrecked car with no clue how you got there. This is the beginning of your insanely scary story to find your wife Alice and the secrets behind Cauldron Lake.\n\nThe story through the game is fantastically written and is actually your book come to life. Voice acting is superb and fits each character well. The support characters are likable and funny and help bring more depth to the story. Barry, your manager, is probably one of the best sidekicks I’ve seen in a game with his humorous, pushy personality. Your fight is against the darkness which takes over people in town and makes them way scarier. The best though is the lines they spew at you when running around in the dark. Things like "Omega 3 fatty acids are good for your heart" and "There are 65 billion cows and pigs in the world!" will have you laughing and also wondering what the hell are they talking about.\n\nThere’s a total of 6 chapters that the game is broken up into and in-between each one is some great music to listen to. It may help you relax a bit before beginning another chapter of horror. In the beginning of each chapter they also give you a recap of the previous one in case you took a break and forgot some things. I found this really cool and thought it should be an option in many games. How many times have you not been able to get back to a game and then forgot what, when, and where.\n\nWake’s gameplay is some of the best mechanics of light and dark. You use a flashlight to find your way around in the dark and is also used to help fight the Taken. The Taken cannot be killed until blasted with light for a little bit, then you can shoot them with your gun to take them out. Inanimate objects can also be taken over but those only need to be blasted by light for some time. When shining your light on your enemies you will see a small halo that will shrink and then disappear when they are vulnerable to regular weapons. Other items to help you fight the darkness are your typical guns like a handgun, shotgun, or rifle. Then there are the light items like flares, flash grenades and a flare gun. The flash grenades and flare gun will actually destroy the Taken most of the time without need of your guns.\n\nMany collectibles are scattered around the chapters for you to find. TV’s you switch on to watch a small episode of Night Springs similar to the great classic Twilight Zone and radios you can listen to and hear what may be going on in town. 100 coffee thermoses scattered all over the place to find and even manuscripts which are the actual story of the game. Some of the manuscripts can also only be found on the hardest difficulty nightmare which adds more replay value to the game. Then there are the secret stashes you can discover by finding glowing marks with the flashlight.\n\nAlan Wake is a well put together game and feel it’s overlooked by many. It’s well written story, great voice acting, and challenging gameplay make this a must play game. I’d really love to see an actual sequel come out for this but those may be some high hopes. If are looking for something to pull you in then don’t hesitate to play Alan Wake.\n\nBear Rating: 10/10","March 1, 2014","true","14.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

This is really the best part of the game, as the labyrinth of creation and created and how to balance what is desired with what is needed leads Alan down an increasingly dark path (pun intended). As he discovers, he is not alone in his knowledge of the lake's mysterious power, nor the first to suffer from it. The supporting cast are varied and colorful characters, several of whom have their own history with Cauldron Lake.\n\nThe atmosphere is suitably dark and fog-swept at times. Most of the game happens at night, so turn down your room lights and crank the audio to catch the ambiance (the sound design is superb). The setting is a unique one: the woods and small town atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest. The ambiance is captured nicely, and the woods have thick foliage and dark shadows. Old logging and mining gear abounds, providing just the right touch of historical nostalgia and rusty menace. The buildings and architecture are a mix of rustic, country-style structures (built sturdy to withstand the harsh winters) other more attractive, modern structures designed to impress tourists (Cauldron Lake Lodge). The superb music score is the icing on the atmospheric cake: moody but melodic, it catches the feeling of solitude at night-time haunted by the supernatural.\n\nA supernatural that is made perhaps more terrifying by the clunky combat. Shine a light at enemies to burn away the darkness, then shoot them with whatever weapon you have to hand. It works well enough, but feels loose and sloppy. The weapons are few, but do feel different: revolver, shotgun (regular and pump-action), flare gun, hunting rifle, flares, and flash-bangs. That's it. They're not all available at the same time, and at the beginning of each episode, Alan only has a flashlight and a revolver. So, no matter how good you were with saving up your gear, thinking there might be a big battle coming up, once the episode ends, you'll lose it all anyway. The enemies offer little variety. You've got the standard hatchet-throwing “taken”, the big “taken”, the fast “taken”, and random flocks of crows that fly out of the sky and attack Alan. Sometimes random objects (like cars, tires, dumpsters) will become possessed and attack Alan. With so many creatures that dwell in the woods of the Pacific Northwest, I expected there might be a boss fight with a bear or a pack of coyotes, but no.\n\nNone of these drawbacks would matter if the total experience offered by Alan Wake were more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately, it isn't. I enjoy it because when I first played it years ago I had no idea that video games could handle narrative in this fashion. I'll always have a nostalgic appreciation for it and it just kills me to provide a mixed recommendation. But if you want more than story and atmosphere, look elsewhere, because you'll be sorely disappointed by everything else. If story and atmosphere suffice, though, get Alan Wake right away.","May 29","true","59.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I've split my gameplay into 2 period. The 1st to the 3rd chapter are played a few months before the rest are finished. I love all game's genre but I am more of a survival horror fans and Resident Evil is my favourite game.\n\n\nThe following are some noticable tech pros and consPros\n+ Graphic is amazing. It is very atmospheric and the graphic fits the game.\n+ Game mechanics are very creative.\n+ AI is very interactable with. They do react to the light.\n+ The bugs and glitches aren't easily spotted as it doesn't affect the overall gameplay experience.\n+ Well ported from Xbox 360\n\nCons\n- I push the volume to max but the sound produced are imbalance. It could be my laptop's problem but it happens to this game only.\n\n\nThe following are just some in-game elements I like/dislike based purely on my opinionLikes\n* Combat mechanics is very interesting. I like the sound of bullet impact. It really feels like hitting the enemies hard.\n* Environment. The levels are very creatively designed especially the last few chapters. The whole game is very atmospheric.\n* Characters. Charming, Humorous, Evil and such. It is very interesting to watch as the characters developed.\n* The light and darkness concept. It strongly inspire me with it's metaphor. Light in the game always give you a sense of secure and relief and darkness gives you a sense of death and fear.\n* Special Features Chapters. Ironically, best part in the game for me.\n\nDislikes\n# Story. It has an interesting concept but it is dully presented. The structure is quite boring to me.\n# Item management. You can't keep your items for the following section/chapter of the game. Whenever a chapter/section starts, you start with barehand, torchlight or a gun.\n# Manuscript. It is an optional collectibles throughout the game. Some are fun to read, some are good to sleep.\n# Soundtrack. Not as atmosperic, romantic and engaging when it comes to the specific scenes.\n\n\nAt first, I hated this game because it wasn't what I expect it to be like. It changes my view as I progress afterthat.","August 14, 2015","true","14.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Controls are your standard WASD to move, mouse one to shoot, and mouse two to shine flashlight. Enemies can be overwhelming and are a bit faster then the character which makes outrunning them to get to the nearest light source pretty difficult and basically requires you to fight which is alright. You aren't going to find a shortage of supplies before fighting either but don't let that discourage you from looking around to find things as this game doesn't really have a crosshair and if you have no idea where to shoot or have incredibly poor aim you'll find yourself missing shots, so yeah.

A great deal of effort is put into engrossing the player in its world, setting up th e game as an episodic miniseries, complete with intros, recaps, and outros, as well as plenty of collectibles and side tihngs to find that expand on what's happening. The game plays well, but unfortunately combat can fall short and become repetitive, since the tools at your disposal are few and mostly upgrade in pure numbers. It's tense enough to keep you on your toes, but playing on normal/hard, i never felt truly stretched for resources except once during the game. There are only a few enemy types so combat becomes fairly formulaic after a time.\n\nThat said, the presentation of the game, and the story it tells make up for the difference in spades, and it's a shame the game only got two small DLC episodes instead of the true "second season" it deserved.\n\nWould definitely recommend to fans of the thriller/mystery genre, as long as you're OK with never really finding out what happens after the end.","November 25, 2014","true","15.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","6"

Remedy (creators of the original two Max Payne games) deliver a lovingly crafted narrative married to engaging survival horror gameplay, and fans of either will find a lot to appreciate. Alan Wake borrows liberally and eagerly from a variety of influences - homages can be found from sources as diverse as norse mythology, Stephen King, Twin Peaks and the previously mentioned Max Payne.\n\nVISUALS AND ATMOSPHERE: Graphically, the game has chops. The small town of Bright Falls (and the forests of the Pacific Northwest that surround it) are well done. Small details strewn throughout the sets reward observant players by alluding to a narrative beyond the main story. The game often finds clever ways of interacting with the props of the environment, which lends itself towards the feeling of a very dramatic (and dynamic) atmosphere. The effects of the darkness - on the environment and everything in it - is easily one of the most impressive mechanics in the game.\n\nHowever, stilted animations often betray the models, resulting in awkward puppet-like mouth movements when characters speak. This is most noticable when characters are in distress, and regrettably (given the theme), characters often have a good reason to be.\n\nSound is well done. Ambient music is tense but often subtle (though it can border on repetitive), and the game prefers to use it's carefully chosen collection of licensed music to solicit emotions beyond circumstancial flare ups. Voice acting was solid.\n\n4/5\n\nNARRATIVE: Alan Wake is both author and audience of the story, an unreliable narrator thrust into progressively stranger circumstances as he investigates the disappearance of his wife. As a protagonist he is far removed from the chisled and grizzled stereotype, often openly frustrated, petulant or terrified. There is a clear sacrifice made where the depth given to him as a character supercedes our ability to really step into his shoes, and I found it to be a trade worth making. The story is divided up into clear chapters emulating a television episode, featuring a brief recap ("Previously on Alan Wake") and a clear intermission at their end. It is an often confusing story, but unapologetically so, and the presentation is exceptionally well done.\n\n4/5\n\nGAMEPLAY: Presented in third person with a focus on light and darkness, expanding on the themes strongly featured in the story. The bulk of gameplay involves either exploration or combat, which is often difficult. Enemies will often spawn without end in dark areas of the woods, adding urgency in your race to the next light source. I felt challenged (and at times frustrated), but never cheated.\n\nThere are limitations to the engine. The excitement you'll feel after stepping behind the wheel of one of the game's many vehicles will fade quickly when you actually have to drive them. Even with care, driving often felt like a DUI simulator, and vehicles frequently arrived at their destinations like they'd gone through a demolition derby. Additionally, the game often pretends to be a platformer and fails, miserably (as you invariably will during these portions). Jump mechanics are imprecise and I often found difficulty in clearing gaps with any degree of certainty.\n\n3/5\n\nOVERALL: 4/5, easy. Well worth the asking price.","December 22, 2014","true","74.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

However shortly after arriving in the mysterious town his wife goes missing under unusual circumstances as a seemingly supernatural presence haunts his every move.\n\nThe story unfolds over 6  (+2 DLC) episodes each opening with their own 'previously on' segment and credits sequence accompanied by some pretty good episode appropriate music. The pacing of each episode does a great job of slowly building intrigue about the mystery of what is going on in this Twin Peaks-esque town and propelling you forward into what's to come. There are mellow, slower moments in which you interact with the town's quirky characters and history as well as tense, fear inducing moments in which you battle against people possessed by the darkness which hunts you down.\n\nThe majority of the game has you battling the dark presence with just a flashlight and a small array of guns, flares and flashbang grenades. You use the flashlight and flares to deteroiate the shield of darkness covering the enemies, followed by using your guns to finish the job. This sequence is repeated ad nauseam. At first, this makes every combat encounter meaningful and frantically tense and goes a long way towards making the Dark Presence feel like something you have no hope of fighting against in the grand scheme of things.\nAlthough this feeling doesn't last long as the lack of enemy variety and weapon selection causes things to drag towards the latter half of the game and the game does little to add variety to the combat encounters other than throwing more enemies at you. As I became more invested in seeing how the artfully told story unfolds, I became less interested in foraging for supplies and engaging in the combat and simply attempted to run past all of the enemies as it became more and more frustrating to deal with the barrage of seemingly never ending enemies.\n\nThe game is also littered with collectibles; There are coffee thermoses, another homage to Bright Falls inspiration Twin Peaks; An in game FMV TV show entitled 'Night Springs', which is very heavily inspired by episodes of The Twilight Zone; Radio's which provide insight into the town and it's inhabitants through nocturnal radio host Pat Maine and Prophetic manuscript pages written by Alan Wake which foreshadow events that transpire throughout the game, each one fully narrated by the protagonist.\nThe abundance of collectibles combined with the games fairly large environments make you want to explore every nook and cranny to uncover as much of the narrative content there is to see but in doing so you'll find yourself engaging in more and more of the quickly tiring combat as the longer you find yourself in the darkness, the more opponents you'll find yourself fighting against which seems completely antithetical to itself. I often found myself battling the compulsive urge to find everything with the desire to engage in as little of the combat as possible.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I found the intrigue and mystique of the story was more than enough to hook me and keep me playing and interested. Each episode ends in a way that propels you forward and the authorial nature of the protaganist, who frequently shares his often hammy thoughts through voiceover narration, will get you invested in the characters and in discovering what's going on and leave you wanting for more when it reaches the final credits.","August 25, 2015","true","13.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Videogames have too rarely explored the themes of the unknowable inspiring creativity but Alan Wake wants to make the effort. It is a game about an artist changing reality with his gift and facing the darkness, both inside and outside the mind.\n\nAlan Wake, the titular novelist, has attained success precious few novelists can even imagine including a downright luxurious apartment in New York City and high visibility in the talk show circuit. He is also a dark, brooding man with only his wife Alice and agent-and-best-friend Barry being his only windows to the humanity in general. A vacation to the mountains and forests of Washington state becomes a nightmare for our hero when his wife is taken by the darkness sending Alan on his quest. The story is central to the game but it is unfortunately impossible to discuss it in detail without posting spoilers. Suffice to say that it is a mixed success. Alan comes off more petulant than tortured and his disdain for people in general renders him unpleasant, especially considering his winning hand in life. What makes this worse is that the writers are on Alan's side and the people he hates turn out to be hateable. The cast has an another Achilles' heel as well in Barry. He is one of those hustling agent types familiar from many, many movies about Hollywood. It makes no sense that someone like that could be on the top of the literary food chain and his career-boosting ideas are inept indeed. His attempts at comedic relief are also a mismatch for the sombre tone of the game in general. Since Alan and Barry get most of the screen time a thickness of skin is recommended.\n\nThe first and most important rule in depicting genius artists in fiction is always the same: do not show their work for genius cannot be replicated. Alan Wake the game apparently does not approve of this rule for Alan Wake the novelist has pages of his fiction scattered throughout the game as collectibles. The prose is so incompetent that I would have preferred Alan reciting from The Lusty Argonian Maid instead. Sadly these are not the only collectibles for the intense nightmare also has room for beer can pyramids, coffee thermoses and more. You cannot start a generator without passing a QTE test either. The ladders are also something of a mystery: why do I have to first press the action key to mount and then the movement key to climb the damn thing -- with a prompt appearing to tell me what to do? Why can't I be allowed to disappear into the game instead? Alan also has a highly irritating tendency to narrate the events, in effect repeating the things the player is already experiencing or making utterly baffling remarks such as: "I had fallen off so many cliffs it was ridiculous."\n\nThere is still reason to shut out all this (and a few other things) and focus on the strenghts, the ones that make Alan Wake a game worth experiencing. The forests at night are otherworldly and threatening and I have not seen ones like them elsewhere in gaming. I was most relieved to be allowed to switch off the HUD to complete the atmosphere. The town of Bright Falls also has proud Twin Peaks influences which were highly pleasing to see. Graphics may have some Xbox 360 ruggedness but the nighttime sights are still powerful. The main gameplay element besides experiencing the story is the combat. Alan needs to peel away the darkness protecting the Taken before using his guns to end them. The arsenal consists of a revolver, two varieties of shotguns and hunting rifle which fits the setting perfectly. You also have to reload them one bullet at a time which adds to the intensity of the encounters. The other group of equipment are the light sources you carry, from flashlights and flashbangs to the flare gun which is here the BFG 9000 superweapon it rarely gets to be. Alan isn't particularly nimble either so the process of avoiding enemy attacks, firing and reloading weapons and knowing when to use light requires a steady hand. I found this all pleasurable to do and felt skilled but not invincible after defeating a particularly dangerous group.\n\nAlan Wake would certainly have benefited from tough but fair editing. Had the designers been free from the pressures of fitting into the general design of console gameplay of the time and had the writers focused more on presenting questions and invoking mystery than churning out language something unique could have been achieved. But while Alan Wake is a mixed triumph it is still a triumph. The feel of wandering in someone elses dream is palpable in the best sequences as is the intensity in many battle scenes, and the contrast between light and dark is used in many creative and thematically appropriate ways. Those looking for pleasure in nightmare should find some in Alan Wake and I can recommend the game for anyone in the mood for exploring the unknown.","April 28, 2014","true","17.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Particularly Stephen King, although other literary references are dropped here and there.\n\nThe main plot is that you are a deeply troubled writer on vacation with your wife in a quaint mountain town. Pretty quickly you realize that things are going on in this town that are quite strange, the supernatural is afoot, and pretty quickly your wife disappears and you are on the run for your life from the dark, spectral inhabitants of the town. 2SPOOPY4ME!\n\nBut seriously though, although some of the plot points are a bit cheesy, the core of the story is very good. You spend the whole game fighting dark creatures while traveling through the town, and the whole time, you question whether or not what you're experiencing is "real" or Alan Wake descending into insanity. It's a theme the game comes back to quite a bit, which is also indicative of the Stephen King influence.\n\nAnd in the end *SPOILER*after all this questing to retrieve your stolen wife, you end up having to sacrifice yourself to do so, by trapping yourself in the dark world in which she was being held. It ends the game on a really good note in my opinion, because it shows the dedication of Alan Wake's character, and allows him more character building in the American Nightmare storyline and the extra chapters. *END SPOILER*\n\nThe game is sort of hard, the shooting mechanics are kinda clunky, and enemies can spawn infinitely in sort of areas, meaning if you get trapped in a bad spot, running low on ammo can mean getting stuck in that spot of the game since there are no melee options or non-firearm based attacks.\n\nUsing light as a resource is a good mechanic, but it's also sort of poorly implemented. Overall, the game has a lot of good ideas but the developers were'nt really sure whether they wanted this to be a shooter or a horror game.\n\nThe storyline is really good though, and it is a unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.","August 31, 2015","true","22.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Remedy studios has made an other masterpiece. It is a Psychological thriller that will keep you unhinged. You start off as a famous bookwriter taking a vacation with your wife in the pacific north west. Shortly after you arrive at your cabin your wife goes missing and all hell breaks loose. Alan Wake breaks away from basic third person shooters making the combat very unique. Your strongest wepon is the light. Your main wepon is a flashlight to weaken the dark ones, guns and limited ammo to finish them off. Right off the bat the whole game and story is told like a Stephen King novel with perfect storytelling. Also breaks down each chapter like a tv series recapping what happened making you even more excited to play. Masterfully crafted music, sounds, and voice acting are nothing below perfect the whole game.\nArea's are dark and very explorable looking for extras like flares or thier own crazy in game tv show night springs. Game is not to long but not to short either. Characters and the story are so interesting you will have no idea what to expect. Combat while unique can be a bit underwhelming if you are use to guns ablazing. In the end this is a game that you should not slip by it honestly might change your life.

The game is really unique in a few aspects. In the game you play as Alan Wake who is writer from New York. He's not a soldier, he has no combat training, he is clumsy, slow, and last guy you'd pick as video game hero in every possible way. The plot alternates between a manuscript, a dream, flashbacks, and Alan being awake. This can be a little confusing, and I admit after beating the game I'm still not sure what happened. I think this is actually a plus, because it gives you a reason to replay the game, and find the rest of the manuscript. It's almost as if you put Stephan King, & the Twilight Zone in a blender.  The cutscenes, and voice acting are very well done. The story is presented in a series of six episodes, and with each episode you get the “Previously on Alan Wake” cutscenes to lead you in to the next. It's like your controlling a TV episode of the X-files. The game play is survival horror. You always be scrounging for supplies like batteries, flares, bullets, and it typically seems you have just enough to get by. The combat centers around using light from flashlights, flares, generators, or flash grenades to essentially weaken your enemies. The “Taken” are possessed with the darkness, and can only be killed when the light has removed their shield. The scenery is beautiful, the game looks great even on low settings. The lighting and effects, are all on point. The music is a perfect fit, some instrumentals, some alternative indie bands. I can't find anything negative to say about Alan Wake, I enjoyed every minute of the experience, and I'm glad I got a chance to play it. Wait, why are you still reading this?

So, all of this considered, why do I not recommend this game? While enjoying the atmosphere, trying to focus on the beautiful visuals, and contemplating the artfully crafted thriller-narrative being unravelled as I play, the last thing I want to do is be subjected to relentlessly spawning mobs of 3-5 of the same uninspired enemy every 10 seconds. Especially when each individual enemy in these  mobs takes 5+ seconds of shining a boosted flashlight on him and a minimum of 3 shots from a six shot revolver to be defeated, all while the other guys batter you with axes.\n\nI am not wanting to take away from the fact that the combat was well inspired and tried to do something new, because it definitely did. You don't just blast away at whatever appears out of thin air until it falls lifeless: there is a method to the mayhem... but this doesn't change the fact that the combat is repetitive, time-consuming, clunky, and more a of a distraction than a benefit to an otherwise great game. Another viable alternative would have been the Mirror's Edge route: making it possible to avoid combat entirely. With some refinements to the dodge system and making it so you no longer run like a midget with one normal sized leg, you could actually run from that which terrifies you and this game would really feel a lot more like a thriller/horror game.\n\nSadly, the combat was actually bad enough that I had to stop playing one episode from the end... even in light of all the great things it had going for it. Though I will definitely be finding a playthrough online to give me some closure on the story.","November 3, 2015","false","8.7"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","34","61","2","0"

The game is divided into six Episodes and is heavily inspired by mystery TV shows, with Twin Peaks considered a major influence. The game follows our protagonist, Alan Wake, as he tries to uncover and solve the events behind his wife's enigmatic disappearance whilst on vacation to the, seemingly picturesque and calm, town of Bright Falls.\n\nGameplay is fairly simple. The protagonist is armed with a mandatory flashlight and, depending upon availability, an assortment of weapons ranging from a revolver, shotgun, rifle, flare gun, flares and flash grenades. Most of the game takes place in the dark so the flashlight aids in navigating the environment as well as battling the Taken, who are your foes in the darkness. So the flashlight and a weapon of your choice are enough to ward off enemies, which range from blade and chainsaw-wielding foes to poltergeists that throw stuff at you. There are instances when you can drive a car to move around but those segments are completely optional and thus, can be skipped.\n\nAmmo is not plentiful so it's up to the player to judge when to take enemies head-on or settle for evasive action. Light is your best friend in the dark. In addition to the usual ammo boxes, fluorescent paint directional cues also lead you to essential supply caches. Exploration rewards you with supplies and also enhances story progression but there's a certain risk involved as foes can jump at you from the dark at any instance. Manuscripts scattered across the environment complement the story and are considered essential towards understanding the intricacies of the plot.\n\nRemedy outdid themselves by designing Bright Falls. It's a stunning, albeit grim, town and the attention to detail is amazing. So it comes as a bit of a let-down that the game isn't open-world because Bright Falls is one place that deserves to be explored thoroughly. The story character voice-overs are brilliant and it almost feels like one is watching a mini-TV show. The writing is spectacular; not unexpected for a Sam Lake game.\n\nAlan Wake happens to be the most atmospheric game I've played in a long time. The game really pulls you in after the first few episodes. Although missions tend to get tedious because you're forever warding off enemies and/or finding alternate routes to the objective. There are also a few glaring plot holes and characters whose fate was left dangling mid-air. But thankfully, the story is gripping and the presentation and production values are top notch.","June 27, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Lucky me. I knew Remedy for their masterpiece, Max Payne, so when I realized Alan Wake was their latest game I took it without further inquiries. And I really believe I was right.\n\nAlan Wake is a third action (and I dare to call it) survival shooter (considered the measured amount of ammos and the weak constitution of the protagonist). You are Alan Wake, a world best seller Writer... Kind of a Stephen King level of Fame. Due to the amount of stress after the writing of the last book Alan is retiring with his beloved Wife Alice in a small mountain town called Bright Falls. When they get to their cabin Alice is abducted by a dark entity and pulled to the depth of Cauldron Lake. Alan will then realize that there's something really odd and dark happening in Bright Falls and their citizens.\nThe game is structured as a classic third person shooter, but you won't have any mass destruction weapon, nor you won't have any huge amount of ammos. The most interesting concept in the gameplay is the contrast between light and darkness, so when the Takens (citizens possessed by darkness) approach you, you must light them with your torch first in order to get rid of their "protective dark aura" and be able to shoot them and eliminate them. Also there are few street lamps here and there that will give you protection against them (and serve as checkpoint as well). Besides, this game is definitely full of collectibles that will lead to various achievements.\nAnyways this game It's not about the gameplay (which actually includes funny sections where you can drive a car which can be used to quickly enlight the takens and drive over them B-) ), nor about the graphics, which is nice and always shows beautiful landscapes and ambiences. It's about the story, which is not original but involving. Besides the unexpected end, the story is quite linear and explicative but its strong side is how it gets you involved with the main protagonist and other characters. And this is one of the few times it happened to me, because the game isn't what I'd call revolutionary or innovative yet I'm still playing it, or better, re-playing to attempt a 100% completion which is something I rarely attempt on this kind of games.\nThe story and the settings are quite dark, almost horror. Almost because you'll never jumpscare nor be afraid or stressed as in other games like, I don't know... Amnesia, maybe? But it's still a great setting anyways. The story doesn't end on its own as there are a couple of DLCs included: "The Signal" and "The Writer" Which follow after the end of the original game (no spoiler about it, as they're strictly bound to the end).\n\n+++PROs+++ ALAN WAKE. This game is a story about the protagonist, his insecurities, his struggle to help Alice even though all the odds are against him. I liked the character and how he relates to the other caracters in the game, I like how he's narrating the facts and his thoughts as if he was reading pages of a book, not to mention te ending of the game.\nGAMEPLAY. It's not a huge innovation but the way you need to face your enemies -(light them first, then shoot) is a very creative and fitting idea. Not to mention the huge amount of collectibles that might contribute in increasing the playability of the game. And don't forget the driving sections, taking downs enemies by night and breathing fresh air by day in those mountain streets...\nLANDSCAPES And AMBIENCES. I definitely loved all the views this game offers you, mountains, lakes, rivers, valleys, not to mention the various locations.\nMUSIC. There are tracks that really are great (just don't touch anything in the main menu and let go the trailer), not to mention the credit rolls at the end of each episode, while ingame there are some interesting tunes that will follow your action giving the right ominous or appropriate mood for the situation. Really a great job.---CONs--- STAMINA. I understand that considering the survival side of the game you can't be a professional runner but seriously, I can run way more than Alan does, and I'm spending my entire days sitting at work...","March 13","true","32.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not a moment gone by without suspense and constant mystery.\n\nPros:\n-Incredibly rich and detailed world, this is an older title but its eye for detail is out the wazoo\n-Episodic narrative that really immerses you with fantastic (and slightly tragic) writing\n-Very challenging gameplay\n-Creative use of weaponry\n\nCons:\n-Lethargic mobility, and wonky vehicle physics\n-The game holds you back quite a few times which could get annoying on a 2nd or 3rd playthrough\n-Lip synching could've been better\n-The light can be a bit too bright, making it hard to see\n\nA masterfully written and bearing game wrapped within so much mystery that will make you question more well after you've finished it, definitely worth another playthrough (do it on Nightmare, it's not that tough) just to get a full understanding of it all. I really suggest grabbing all of the manuscripts (I mean all of them) so you can really get a sense of how the story developed.\n\nThe thrill and combat is near constant, with only a few short beautiful vistas to give you a breather, and you'll definitely be grinding teeth now and then until you fully master it all. My tip, conserve your ammunition! Now I understand that Alan isn't exactly an athlete or action hero, but he sometimes moves in a way that is way too slow, taking his time to do his stuff when you're really pressed for time, it shouldn't be that hard to actually SPRINT instead of running just a bit faster for a bit longer, or hurry up with climbing up ladders or getting in and out of vehicles, which takes me to the next point - they're pretty garbage. They're like jello on ice, so be careful when maneuvering the finnicky cars. You'd best leave them alone altogether if they weren't useful for traversing long and sometimes dangerous lengths, so be warned! The game also tends to interrupt your flow by slowing down time to show incoming enemies or pan the camera to locations that are kind of obvious to get to, it's fine on your first playthrough, but gets quite frustrating on your next ones.\n\nAll in all, besides those gripes, I'd have to say this is one of the best horror games I've played yet, and it shows that a game doesn't have to rely on gore or excessive action to tell a great story and really strike a sense of fear and anxiety in you.\n\nNow wake up!","March 14","true","58.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

During that final episode moment, there will also be played a nice song, which suits the mood very well!)\nThe game is, overall, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, the effort put into this game is clearly huge, as I will explain later.\nAs for gameplay, it's unique in most aspects: you fight the "taken" during the whole campaign (don't worry, it's varied enough, there are maybe like 5 or 6 types of taken, excluding the possessed objects, which are thrown in your direction and cause massive damage!) and they are protected with some sort of "shadow armor" that you will need to break with your flashlight and finally shoot them with your gun. To break the shadow shield just simply point your flashlight at them (the flashlight is also your crosshair, sounds weird but surprisingly works quite well!), to destroy the armor faster, you can "focus" the flashlight, but it will drain your battery much faster! This mechanic is genius, since it adds tension to the table! You will constantly have to check if you have enough batteries so that you can more freely spam focus the flashlight or be more careful about the use of the batteries (And I strongly recommend you don't spam the flashlight at all! This game on Normal or above is harder than 90% of modern games! You will often run out of ammo or batteries, and if that happens, you do what most people do in horror movies: F'cking run like the wind!!) and the same goes to saving bullets, which are surprisingly scarce and the enemies take a few shots to die, mainly the big ones! The axe guys take a full 6 round clip from the revolver or a full (2 shells) double-barrel shotgun blast!\nGameplay also features a dodge mechanic which allows you to avoid incoming attacks, whether the attack are ranged or melee, occasionally the dodge mechanic, if successful, will result in a cinematic slow-motion dodge, which looks very nice and quite badass!\nMoving to the graphics, this is an XBOX360 game from 2010 ported to the PC in 2012 (this game doesn't exist for PS3, most likely because the PS3 can't handle it >:D) and the game is heavy as ♥♥♥♥! I'm not joking! It's very heavy and this mainly applies (I think) to it's fantastic lighting effects which blow anything I've ever seen in term of lighting effects out of the water! Shadow quality is top-notch as well, and the attention to detail is amazingly high! The game runs well on my AMD, no lag or FPS drops, so you should expect the same smooth gameplay, if you have a decent PC. Continuing to the graphics department, the game has also very nice and smooth animations!\nMoving on to voice-acting: amazing! The game can sometimes be creepy with the shadow voices or funny when you talk to some people, usually Barry, Alan's manager.\nFinally getting to the story: the story itself is original and epic in almost every aspect, from the amazing voice acting/ lip-syncing, to the storyline itself, which takes huge twists and turns and concludes to an amazing ending (and this isn't a clear ending, like Bioshock or Spec Ops, you will need to think about the story as a whole and think a bit about the end part of the campaign) but when it all becomes clear, it's a joy of an ending!\nAlan is a successful writer that goes on vaction with his wife to clear his head and get away from the fame, but he has nightmares with weird shadows (the taken) that go after him and then they move on to real life and ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan from then on, after his wife is kidnapped...\n\nAlan Wake deserves a 9.5/10; It doesn't deserve a full score because it has only a campaign that lasts 10 hours! And for 27,99€ it isn't really worth it, although the campaign is great! Usually you will find it 90% off, that is 3 euros the whole freakin' collection (DLC and a second game [it's a spin-off, not a sequel]) and is completely worth it!","July 21, 2013","true","12.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I like this game a lot. The episodic format makes it easy to take breaks between play sessions (each "episode" even starts with a "...previously, on Alan Wake").\n\nThe graphics are verry pretty and looks like the team really put time and effort in porting the game. Same can be said for the sound effects and the music.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a TPS with an interesting mechanic - the enemies are defeted by first shining a light on them (Alan is using a battery powered flashlight), destroying the "darkness" surrounding the enemies and only after that you are able to shoot and destroy them.\n\nThe part I enjoyed the most was the story - it feels like an actual TV show, but with a great plot and plot twists. It can take a bit of time to chew through all the info you are presented with at times but it all makes sense and leaves you longing for more.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game and I highly recommend it.\n","October 18, 2015","true","32.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It’s not that scary, which is fine as it is more aptly defined as a psychological thriller than a straight horror game. The controls are solid, albeit sometimes a little clunky— but that’s intrinsic to the scary/survival genre. Visuals and sounds are mostly top-notch. The voice acting is very convincing. I didn't experience any technical difficulties when I played. The timing of the story and length of the game are fitting and keep you enticed without growing boring.  It is a well put together game.\n\nAlan Wake is very engaging. Definitely the kind of game you want to play with headphones on, lights off, and no interruptions. The world looks good and you can feel the atmosphere of the creepy little village. There are also lots of collectibles that provide further lore/backstory. Be warned however: the collectibles system is somewhat flawed as it can really break the immersion of the game if you choose to go for them.\n\nMy personal favorite aspect of this game was the characters and their development. Video games sometimes have great stories; but to me, because it’s a game, I always have a harder time connecting to the characters than I do with other mediums of storytelling, like TV or movies. The way this game was produced, though, I was able to really feel the connection with the characters, which was one of the best parts of the experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","37.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Despite not being released in an episodic format, the game is laid out in a series of "episodes" complete with credits and an ending theme which I feel needs to be noted because each one is excellently chosen - I wish all the licensed music could have been on the soundtrack.\n\nCombat controls aren't bad, but aren't great - they act to make the game a little more stilted than it otherwise would be, and definitely lends the combat to feel more like padding between cutscenes instead of something interesting into the gameplay itself.\n\nThe story is more "unsettling" than outright creepy/horror, but if you're easily scared it might be best to skip it.\n\nGraphics hold up excellently, and the two DLC chapters which follow the original game are.....weird. Good, but weird.\n\nAll in all, the game is VERY solid, and the atmosphere of the game is incredible. Highly recommended, and I'd also give a nod toward getting the collector's edition so you get the soundtrack, as well. The soundtrack is dissimilar to many game soundtracks in that there are vocal tracks as well, and it's very, very good.\n\nHeck, just buy the franchise pack - American Nightmare is even better than the original game (if a tad short), and the combat controls were tightened up to the point where the combat is quite fun.","March 22, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story of Alan Wake is a masterpiece. Little bit of Hitchcock, little bit Twilight Zone, lot of Twin Peaks and Stephen King. Everything is extremely well written and flows together perfectly.\n\nPresentation - Again 10/10. The game play and story flows together seemlessly. It plays out not so much like a tv show or movie, but like a miniseries. It's very distinctive. That's an impressive feat. The camera angles, the story arch, the presentation in general, it's almost tv worthy. The setting is amazing. It pulls you right into Washington state, with all of it's beauty and isolation.\n\nGameplay - 6.5/10. (That's not a bad score. I'm a tough critic. I know I gave the story and presentation 10/10, but I believe It's brilliant. Best of any game I've played.) The game plays well. A few quirks here and there. The combination of flashlight and gun works well, keeping you at a cautious pace. If you were able to blaze through it with guns popping, it would take away a lot of the suspense. They also give you just enough exploration and collectibles to keep you from complaining about it. I would like to point out that I did not feel like I had to "endure" the gameplay to get to the end.\n\nMusic - 10/10. Not just the song choice, but the use and placement of the music is just superb.

The story itself is intriguing and the narration is well written. The soundtrack is great, especially when listening to the radio broadcasts. I found that simply enjoying the scenery whilst listening to the radio really built up different emotional atmospheres throughout the game.\n\nThe characters are easy to like and connect with, and you really care about what happens to them.\n\nThe combat style took a little bit to get used to, but the use of the flashlight while in combat was a nice touch. There were however, a few moments of frustration, when running away and dropping flares was just the easiest way to deal with the situation.\n\nThe collectibles give the game some replay value, especially if you want to come back and play Nightmare mode to collect the rest of the manuscript pages, or work on achievement progress.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 10/10. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an intriguing mystery with a serious creep factor.\n","February 15","true","42.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Awful acting? Check. Laughable plot? Check. Low production values? At times (though the final quarter of the game is pretty impressive.) In spite of all this, or perhaps because of it, the game is a surprisingly charming gem for the genre.\n\nMy only real complaint with the game is how the designers chose to constantly revoke your stockpile of weapons at every turn, instead of taking the time to balance progression properly. At each act, and sometimes more often that that, you're stripped of all the weapons, ammo, and upgrades you've acquired and have to start fresh. Not a deal breaker, but lazy from a design standpoint, and annoying after 6 episodes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireMouseGuy/recommended/108710/","FireMouseGuy","TheFireMouseGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireMouseGuy/","3 products in account","I never saw anything about this game when it was released. Mostly because of it being released when I was only 9, and at that point in my life I spent my time playing games more aimed at my age range at the time. I saw my brother playing it and thought it would be a really good game to get into the whole Psychological Horror genre. What did I think of it? Well to make sure you don't get confused, I will be breaking this review down into several parts:\nThe Story.\nThe Gameplay.\nThe Dialogue\nThe Soundtrack.\nIf it's still good to this day.\nIf it's worth to buy for it's normal price tag.\n\nThe Story:\nAlthough finding it a little unrealistic with it being set in the real world and the overuse of the words 'Darkness' and 'Light' it still grabbed my attention and made me want to keep playing, especially during moments where it was intense. The only real problem I had with the story is a collectible called Manuscript Pages where it basically tells you what is going to happen next or a little later on through the game. This made those moments where it did happen less of a shocker and really ruined that part of the story for me. So much so that I completely stopped reading them when I did pick one up. Overall though the story still got my attention and this was a key element that got me playing till the very end!\n\nThe Gameplay:\nWhen I first got introduced to the combat in the game I was really impressed with how unique yet challenging it was. As a means of combat you have to use your torch to make the enemy vulnerable and then finish them with your main weapon. You need bateries to keep your torch charged yet you also need ammo for your gun. Without batteries you can't make the enemy vulnerable to your main weapon, yet without ammo you can't really do anything apart from slow them down. It's a constant battle to keep those two priorities in check. And that I really liked!\nHowever I found that playing on Easy gave me too much ammo due to how easily it was to kill the enemies that I sometimes found myself not really bothering going out looking for ammo drops and hidden secrets that gave me powerful equipment that the game offered. It took almost little to no effort clearing a group of enemies on Easy mode. The only time when I did find myself challenged was when I replayed it on Normal mode.\nThough I must admit that having this free time did give me a good chance to find the hidden coffee thermos' and manuscript pages. And boy were they hidden! I took my time in searching and I still haven't found all of them! Along with the achievements, it's gave me a reason to replay and search for the rest.\n\nThe Dialogue:\nThe dialogue was really well done and the voice actors really captured the current situation perfectly! If Alan was mad, the tone of his voice really showed it. If Alan was joking on with another character then the sarcasm and humorus tone really showed as well.\n\nThe Soundtrack:\nI loved the soundtrack! I can't stress this enough! The songs when you finish an episode were awesome and I loved every second of each and every one of them!\n\nIs it still good to this day?\nAlthough the controls are a little clunky, in short, yes. The gameplay and story more than make up for this draw back and the views during the opening cuscenes were almost breathtaking considering this was an Xbox 360 game to begin with.\n\nIs it worth to buy for it's normal price tag?\nAs much as this is a good game and all of the really positive points said, if i'm honest? Not really, no. The game is good but if you're a gamer like me that likes to get their money's worth out of games by wasting days on it, this isn't a game you should be considering for a UK price of £22.99 without DLC. ($35.58 for you US players) In my opinion it's a really heavy price tag for a game that could be finished within a day or even a day and a half. This is a game for either the ultimate achievement hunter or if you have nothing to do for the weekend. I'm not saying it's a bad game, it's a really great game and you have my word on it if you're in to these kind of games. I'm saying that I'd rather wait for a really good sale on both the main game and DLC or a heavy price drop.\nBut if it is on sale? I'd say get it! It's a really unique and awesome game that deserves the love and attention it's getting!\n\nOverall it's an 6.5/10 from me!","August 26, 2015","true","13.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I will start off by saying that although this game is good, it is certainly overrated by a long milestone. The game really looks like it's going to build up to something. It doesn't. That is the major flaw. The storyline doesn't make sense and the ending is disappointing and confusing. Yes, there is another game in the franchise, "Alan Wake's American Nightmare" that takes place a couple of years after the events of this game. But even that game doesn't explain what actually happened.\n\nThe game is fun. The shooting is awesome and the mechanics feel really nice. Using a torch as a weapon felt awesome to me. The hidden traps and puddles of darkness were a nice touch. The enemies were never too difficult, but always a little bit challenging. At one point there is a shootout on a stage and Barry activates a bunch of fireworks and there's music playing and it's just fantastic. The characters in the game are pretty good, the voice acting, too. The driving in this game is appauling. This game and Just Cause 2 are the worst games for driving vehicles in my opinion.\n\nIt's just that I don't know what Alan Wake tried to be. Did it try to be a horror game or an atmospheric game or a shooter game or an interactive movie? I mean, I just think Remedy decided "Let's make a horror game. But I want to make an action game too. And maybe an adventure game as well. Hey! Let's just jumble them all up together!"\n\nThe game is good. Yes, I do recommend it. I would try to get it for a cheaper price. Maybe get it during Steam sales or purchase it elsewhere.","October 26, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I wanted it so bad, but after seeing it was only for the XBOX, I forgot about it after a while. When I first joined Steam in 2010*, I wanted to buy a game to get full Steam features. After about a year, Sam & Max Seasons 1-3 were on sale, so I bought them. But in the process I saw Alan Wake, which at the moment hadn't sparked any memory of it. For around a year I waited to buy it, and when I saw it was on sale along with Alan Wake's American Nightmare, I had to buy it. Since then it has become and stayed my favorite game of all time, and that's saying something since I've played somewhere around 300-400 games, probably more. I'm going to keep this as un-biased as possible though. There may be spoilers.\n\nAlan Wake\nGameplay and Story\nAs the story goes, Alan is a famous published author, writer of the Alex Casey novels, who has a severe case of writers block. Alan's wife, Alice Wake, takes Alan on a vacation to Bright Falls, a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Alan and his wife arrive at their lakeside cabin after Alan meets some locals at the Oh-Deer Diner, a cozy small town diner. Alan turns the power on for his wife, who is achluophobic, or has a fear of the dark. Alice calls Alan up to their room, and tells him to check the surprise she left in the study. When Alan opens the door, he finds his typewriter, and that his wife intended for him to come on this trip to get rid of his writers block. Alan get's very angry, and storms out of the cabin. This is where the game's story really starts. The power in the cabin turned off, and Alice screams. Alan yells her name hoping for a reply, and as he walks through the cabin, he finds the door to the dock open, and Alice drowning in the water of Mirror Lake.\n\nThe game is played in a third-person view behind Alan. Alan narrates the game, also. There is a small selection of weapons, which consist of a  Colt Python ,  Orion Flare Gun ,  A Over & Under Shotgun ,  Winchester Model 1300 Defender* ,  Remington Model Seven CDL*  , and a  Model 7290 Flashbang Grenade* . The flashbang is sort of like an incinerating bomb to the enemies, called The Taken, which are composed of darkness. Usually you have to shine a flashlight on them to tear away the darkness, then shoot them. But with the flashbang, and the Flare Gun, you can insta-kill them. There are other items such as batteries, flashlights, and flares, which hold the Taken back a certain distance.\n\nSadly, this game has no other features besides it's linear story mode and achievements. There is another Alan Wake game, Alan Wake's American Nightmare, but it has almost nothing to do with the story and is more of a shooter than a thriller. Remedy Entertainment stated that they have plans for an Alan Wake sequel, but Alan Wake wasn't financally succesful enough to start now, and they are going to finish their upcoming game, Quantum Break, first.\n\nI give this game a  9.5 out of 10  because of the ending, which was fine to an extent. I would recommend this to fiction writers and avid book readers alike.\n\nThanks for reading this review,\n\nDef\n\n* I lost my other account when I forgot the password and had to make this one, hence the difference between dates on my account of when I made my account. In game the weapons are called Revolver instead of Python, Flare Gun instead of Orion Flare Gun, Shotgun instead of Over & Under Shotgun, Pump-Action Shotgun instead of Winchester Model 1300 Defender, Hunting Rifle instead of Remington Model Seven CDL, and Flashbang instead of Model 7290 Flashbang Grenade.\nClick here for weapons source [www.imfdb.org]\nMade for GameBeef ːcsdsmileː","July 10, 2015","true","86.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No, not really, actually the story told by this game is a lot better than much of the recent releases by King, but he does get a reference or two in the game. All in all the setting is spot on, the fighting style can get a bit repetitive (shine light to remove immunity, shoot weapon), but they give you enough options to keep it interesting. Not to mention this game doesn't work well with bad accuracy. Your character is extremely squishy and can often get put into a stun lock when there are multiple enemies around, so some strategy is required for the pacing of which enemies you kill/stun and when. Range is your best friend in the game - second only to light, and while the game doesn't have any "cover" mechanics, if you are clever you can make your own. Ammo conservation is a major aspect of the game, but minimalists can still finish out an act with a stockpile of ammo.\n\nAll in all, I'd say 9/10. Wake is a fantastic character, thrown into chaos; he goes with the flow with a sense of natural disbelief. If he weren't so driven to save his wife, he would go batshit crazy extremely early in the story. Even the semi-comic relief character Barry has a nice balance of annoyance and "this guy could really possibly be my best friend", all the while surprisingly making you hope he doesn't get killed the whole way through. With nods to various classic psycho-horror icons like "The Twilight Zone" in the games very own "Night Springs" show, Alan Wake also makes the world very believable, which helps to really set the mood.

This thriller is a step up from Quantic Dreams and their games like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls in the sense of making an enjoyable story whilst keeping the video game experience intact.\n\nThe Goods:  The story is incredible with many twists and character development.  The gaming UI is minimalistic yet helpful, and you can turn it off and still enjoy the game (see my guide to know how.)  The variety of enemies keeps the game challenging.  The graphics look good for the time it was made, however the setting of most of the maps has a lot of taxing fog on your machine.  A dodge mechanic is very satisfying to get out of the way of a flying axe.\n\nThe Not-So-Goods:  The combat can be a bit repetitiive and overwhelming at times, with many taken ganging up on you.  The game has manuscript pages are taxing to collect and kill the narritive.  While the game has some Story DLC, it seems a bit like an extended universe to compensate for the short yet slow main story experience.\n\nI give this game a 7/10.  The story is incredible, the graphics are good yet taxing, and the AI are a bit lacking in terms of the swarm mechanic they seem to develop, yet the gameplay mechanics cancel it out.","July 20, 2013","true","29.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In my case I couldn't stop playing just because I had to know how Alan Wake's personal hell was going to end.\n\nFrom gameplay perspective it also has creative innovations combining many different mechanics that we usually don't see in mainstream games. A metric crap-ton of designwork has been put into this game and that can be seen in the credibly done and detailed environment with no invisible walls and such. Graphics are also beautiful and sounds are just fine with excellent lines and voice acting deserving extra praise. It is also a long game, but that's allright because it's all quality. You'd be surprised to know how little boring filling there actually was between the most interesting parts (something we typically see a lot in shooters)\n\nTo make a long story short: I wouldn't change any bit of this game. None - And my standards are usually high as Mount Everest.\n\nI wish games like Alan Wake were published more, because this is exactly the way story-driven games should be done. It is solid proof of the fact that game can have amazing story, gameplay, visuals, length and all else in one. It totally deserves all the praise it can be given.","November 26, 2013","true","10.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's interesting, intense, has an amazing sense of humor, and some of the best side characters of all time. The atmosphere when you begin to find pages is wonderful, as you read about Alan being attacked by an axe murderer just before you're jumped- a classic, but fabulous thriller trick.\n\nHowever, at the same time, it was one of my least favorites. Though exploration and early level gameplay is entertaining, the level design starts repeating, until you hit the final chapter which is the worst level design I've ever played. There are some gems in the gameplay, such as the Anderson Farm and the Heart of Darkness- but the gameplay of the game suffers enormously from controls that just seem off.\n\nHowever, as I said before, this story is one that needs to be told. My personal recommendation is to either watch a youtube game movie of it, or to pick up the game if it's on a major sale. You need to hear this story, but you don't need to play the game.\n\nOverall, even with these enormous game flaws, I left the game feeling satisfied- I'd give the game a 6/10, and I'd give the story a 9/10. I wish the developers were given the chance to give this game the sequel it so obviously needs and deserves.","October 11, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/108710/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","I feel like this game was marketed a bit wrong.\n\nAt the time, this may have been a scary game, but certain mechanics and its writing were not original or top notch. Some reviewers noted how unique the light mechanic used in game was: you have to shine your light on enemies for a limited time before they can be taken down. However a similar mechanic was used nearly a decade earlier in Luigi's mansion (and there were probably games before and after that with similar mechanics as well, if we consider this a formula of "weaken with X in order to finish of with Y").\n\nWell aside from mechanics, the writing was highly praised. The writing in this game is functional, but it's nothing to write home about. These days it is much more common for a game's writing to blow people away (Telltale's Walking Dead comes to mind) but, there were games before Alan Wake (2010 on consoles, 2012 on PC) that had terrific writing. Planescape Torment, Fallout 2, Grim Fandango, Xenogear, System Shock 2, I don't think I could go on all day, but my point is clear: great video game writing existed before Alan Wake. More importantly, great synthesis of writing and gameplay existed before Alan Wake, and it is notably missing here. There are the usual suspects apparent: some cut scenes that offer little exposition and only serve to take control away from the player, some (probably most) of the characters are flat and cliche, some of the dialouge is lacking. However none of this is a huge offense, we are all just looking at it the wrong way.\n\nAlan Wake is largely a popcorn "horror" game. So, the writing has to be looked at through a different lens. The Sound and Fury is a terrific novel, as is Catch 22, but they are different kinds of novels trying to do different things in very different ways. So, Alan Wake is neither Faulkner or Heller. For better or worse, Alan Wake is a love letter to Stephen King, mostly. There are some heavy nods to the genius that is Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) as well as Lynch (Twin Peaks). And these nods to the greats show in the lore, setting, and (still pretty cliche) characters. What that means for this game is, it is enjoyable. The writing is not some literary beast, chewing up the conventions of writing and spraying corrosive ideologies all over the human intellect. Alan Wake is simply a great blockbuster horror flick that you can play.\n\nAfter bleeding out all the things that didn't work, lets quickly look at what does. The use of missing pages from a manuscript do evolve into something better later, and it feels organic, which something everyone should appreciate in a good game. Where the main game is filling a general niche in the video game market, the 2 special episodes that serve as the games epilogue serve a much better purpose. I would have probably paid full price (or just 50% off, because this is Steam) for the 2 special episodes alone; these episodes show the mindbending game I was expecting when I thouht of a writer facing his writings in a game.\n\nThere are some thrilling moments, nice camerawork, and overall smooth experience.There are some thrilling moments, nice camerawork, and overall smooth experience. Ambience and enjoyable writing match up nicely to make this solid game. Give it a try when the price is right for you, and I'm sure there is some aspect you will enjoy.","August 1, 2013","true","15.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Not even a "terror" game. There are no scares, unless you are afraid of the dark, and there's no terror unless you hate Stephen King books.\n\nThis is an action game with a supernatural component, an interesting (but simple) kill mechanic (use the flashlight to "light" the enemies, shoot them) and a bloody great told story, which jumps straight into the simple and fun Stephen King style and emerges with a really fun (and light) tale about dark beings, a missing wife and a forgotten writer.\nThis game is made by the same guys who did Max Payne, and it is written in the same, dense, metaphor heavy style. If you liked Max's monologues in the original Max Paynes (1 and 2), you will love Alan Wake's adventure. There are a huge load of references to the original Max Payne, there are references to the nordic mythology (Together with one of the best moments in the game), there are a really good radio broadcast and a really interesting "Night Springs" TV show (both of them continuously referencing what's going on in the game)... all together band up to create a great atmosphere, and to make Bright Springs (The semi incomunicated US village in which the game takes place) a live place, with lot of interesting characters and really well written dialogues, without getting too complex or too boring to hear.\n\nThe bad part is that gameplay wise the game is a bit repetitive: Light (let's calle them) dark zombie with flashlight, shoot, repeat. There are not too much different enemies but at least there are several different weapons to kill them, and, to be honest, the action feels right for the game: Just a good bang bang bang without too many options, but still, enjoyable.\nI can (and will) criticize the lack of variety in the game: Its like a game coming from 2004-2007 with its linear paths, its waves after waves of "dark zombies", a little bit of exploration and some "hold the fort" moments. Really fun, but nothing we haven't seen before. One could think that, with a mechanic as cool as being able to "play" with lights and shadows, the developers could have done something more interesting than just using as a mechanism to "aim" to the "dark zombies" and preventing the player to go all "rock 'n roll" with the big hordes.\n\nStill, the storytelling blends really well with the shooting sections: It does not distract the player when he is playing in the same way that the gameplay does not distract the player when the game is telling him part of the story, and this is something lot of developers should learn.\n\nIn short, Alan Wake is an average-but-fun horror themed shooted with a really nicely told story. It does not do anything new, or innovative, but what it does, it does it quite right.\nSo, yeah, thumbs up.","July 18, 2014","true","18.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

Its greatest strength is definitely its plot. It captures its audience by presenting an interesting premise and questions that need answers, which ends up being the main driving force of the game. It did a fantastic job of keeping me interested throughout the game. The story is complemented by (mostly) well written dialogue and some (not all) well constructed characters. The issue I have with the plot is its ending, which contains no real closure or catharsis, which I imagine is due to a possible sequel. Another strength is the atmosphere. The dark tone of the game is achieved by a meticulous attention to lighting and a carefully picked soundtrack. It all blends together to form a dark engrossing mystery.\n\nUnfortunately the gameplay is its greatest weakness. It is thrilling and exciting at first, but quickly turns into a tedious routine that just stops you from exploring the storyline. The formula never changes: shoot the "taken" with light, then shoot them with weapons, rinse and repeat. The game does try to add some variety by adding elements of platforming, puzzles and even the illusion of exploration. Gameplay is in and of itself not bad. The problem with it is that the gameplay sections are too long. They're so long that whatever fun you had killing the taken dissapates very quickly. This is unfortunate, because I believe if those sections were made shorter, the game would feel a lot more immersive and connected.","December 21, 2013","true","16.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

It's just too frustrating, especially coming from Rockstar.","June 6, 2014","false","12.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

But you feel quite empowered with your flashlight and assortment of guns so there's no time for scary moments, just shooting. Those scare jumps? Killed right off the bet. And more enemies at once? Well that sometimes sadly felt more like fighting with controls as opposed to with enemies, so more annoying than scary. Maybe excluding moments when the only recourse was to run to a safe haven, but it was never obvious.\n\nExcept near the end of second special episode, now there's a scary part.\n\nI realized how dependant have I become on minimaps, getting lost in the woods. But in the end indicator where to go is really all you need, except if you want to wander around for hidden bonuses, then it's time to actually pay attention to your surroundings not to get lost.\n\nBut story, story, it's really great.

A story about a writer, who lost his wife, and now trying not just to get her back, but also trying to stop a dark force from being unleashed in the world maybe sound cliche, but the way they make this story really captures you into finishing it.\nThe gameplay is fun and easy to learn, but not too easy, and rewards exploration with collectables (missing pages, radios, TVs, thermals, pyramids of cans to shoot, and also ammo and weapons).\nThe combat can get a bit repetitive (see an enemy, flash him with your lantern, shoot him until he dies and repeat with the next enemy), but for me it didn't ruined the fun of the game.\n\nSo yeah, if you like survival horror with a good story, buy this game.","November 25, 2013","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first few times I gave this game a shot, I insisted on using the mouse and keyboard, but the more you play, the more you realize the combat moments in this game aren't about precision, but more about crowd control. The story itself is highly original, which I don't want to delve too much into for fear of spoiling part of the adventure. What I will say is that, since the game is broken up into episodes with distinct ending points, and each episode taking about 2 hours to complete, it gives you some very easy moments to stop and return to the game later.\n\nThe graphics still hold up incredibly well, the sound design is phenomenal, the voice acting does a great job of making you long to hear more, or occasionally sending chills down your spine as you run through a dark forrest, listening to the constant dark presence approaching behind you, with enemies snarling sinister sounding dialogue and chasing you down with the sole intent to kill you.\n\nWorth a buy, I definitely had a lot of fun with this one.

I was, therefore, unsurprised to learn that the game was originally envisioned as being more of a free-roaming RPG before the limitations of the Xbox turned it into a a more liner 'on-rails' effort. And it shows. The landscape begs to be explored, but as soon as you travel any distance off the predetermined track you come to a cliff face or edge, and you start to feel a bit penned-in.\nThe driving sections offer more of a sense of freedom, but even then you've got to stick to the road if you want to advance the plot.\nThe story itself is interesting, and wears its Twilight Zone/Stephen King inspirations on its sleeve, but it has trouble captivating because from the very start you don't know what's real and what's a dream, which makes the threat feel too ethereal rather than something solid that can hurt you (even though it obviously can). You find yourself constantly wondering, 'is this bit a dream or real?', 'am I alive or dead?', 'do I really care?'.\nThe atmosphere is the game's strongest point, and makes you wonder why more horror/suspense games don't do it better (I'm looking at you, Resident Evil series). The use of the flashlight is original, and the combat well executed, although it does suffer from being a tad repetitive by the game's end.\nIt's a shame so much of the game is set at night (something necessary to the plot), because the graphics are showcased much better in the daylight scenes, and I'd have quite happily spent hours roaming around the hills and valleys of Bright Falls if given the opportunity.","November 25, 2013","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't particularly care for games that try to creep you out with horror elements, rest assured that this isn't your gore-filled schlock that is churned out every year as a remix of the same thing - this is Alan Wake, and what you get is story.

You start off as a book writer, not a commando or spy or anyone related in military in that matter, that got cought in a nightmare. It starts off with Alan driving through a dark road and hitting someone with a car. When Alan checked who did he hit he saw nothing. But after he started to walk on foot the mysterious character from his one of his written books started to chase him. Few minutes later you learn that the everything is covered in shadows and the only way to harm your enemies is to aim your flashlight directly to your foe and remove armor of shadow for him to become vulnarable. It's pretty interesting mechanic but it gets tedious after a while. The story  once reference Stephen King novels and I figured it might have been huge influence making the game since in some ways it feels like playing S.K. novel.\nGameplay is pretty weak in this game. Limited weaponry, driving sections are worst part of the game.

I'll begin with the pros being that the game offers a lot of areas to search while keeping on track with the story. I enjoyed looking for collectibles and hidden Extra items! The enemies of the game can be difficult at times, if you don't know how to eliminate them. I played the game on normal and still had some trouble killing/escaping the enemies. Another thing which I have to mention is all the smooth cutscenes between point a and b while doing the story mode. This game definitely made me jump from some enemy popping up behind a door! This game offers various story episodes and I say this because after each episode you get a nice preview of what happened in the previous episode! In a way this game is very unique because of all the types of enemies you fight and the weapons you use Ex. You don't use snipers or grenades but instead a flashlight and a revolver/shotgun/riffle! Also you can access free extra downloadable content for the game itself. I liked in a certain place in the game there was a Q.R. code and I scanned it and it led to a picture (Scan it yourself to find out ;D).  Another thing I would like to\nmention is that the game fits it's price for what it Offers:\n\n-> Many hours of gameplay\n-> Different difficulty's\n-> An intriguing story\n-> Various enemies starting from a "taken" to flying items (The main enemies are called "the Taken")\nNow every game has some cons, but for this game I didn't notice all that many... There were some and I'm going to list them below\n\n-> Areas where you would get stuck between a rock or a log\n-> A.I. getting stuck in place\n-> During cutscenes glitchy item picking\n\nThese are the only ones I could think of because as I mentioned above the game is very amazing!\nI rate this game a 9/10, I don't rate it a 10 because of the few cons listed above. I recommend this game to anyone who wishes to get involved in a story mode/ thriller game!","January 6, 2014","true","46.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is by far one of the greatest storylines of any PC game that I have played; the detail, concept, graphics and soundtrack compliment the plot to make it one true masterpiece. Once I had downloaded and installed the game I adjusted my settings and went in game, the twelve hours I have on this game are from me playing this game back-to-back in a single day, the second best purchase of any game in my extensive Steam library; I can't recommend this game highly enough.\n\n\nPros:\nA very well optimised game, I was well below the minimum requirements and still achieved a solid 30-45FPS on low settings.\n\nCaptivating and perplex storyline that made me play the game from start to finish in a single day.\n\nAmazing graphics even on low settings, after seeing it running on ultra at 4K resolution, it looks even more amazing.\n\nAfter purchasing this game I recieved a free 320KBs MP3 copy of the soundtrack and it's absolutely astounding, the composer is to be congratulated.Cons:\nA sequel was made (Alan Wake's American Nightmare), but it felt more of a technical demonstration and failed to captivate me in the same way this game did.","June 24, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The levels are gorgeous during the day and spooky during the night and you'll find your self jumping at shadows and curising the sound of the wind.  The story is presented as if you were in a living book with Alan narrating the events and objectives as you play.  Things start to get really intresting when you begin finding pages to a manuscript that you have no memory writing and that describe things you have no way of know or even things that have yet to occur.  Top that off with amazing sound design and a kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack and i've never been so emersed in a game before.\n\nThe games main short coming is combat.  To kill enemies you have to shine a flashlight on them until they become vunerable before shooting them. and thats it.  And theres only about 4 or 5 enemy types in the whole game so combat becomes samey real fast.  they do try to mix things up every now and then by throwing you into ambushes where you have to fend of multipule waves of enemies at a disadvatge or giving you a driving segmant here and there.  At least the controls are solid so combat doesn't feel frustrating.\n\nThere are also little hidden story elements and item cashes hidden through out the enviroments like radio boradcasts or episodes of a strange show similar to outer limits or twilight zone. this adds a bit of exploration to the leves and gives at least a little replay value.\n\nThis isn't a perfect game but its one that you really should play if you want a solid story and great atomsphere.","June 22, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He's the writer of a single book that was apparently SO appealing to his wife that she...kinda made him take a vacation for the hidden purpose of getting more material out of him. I don't want to say too much, but the thing that stands out to me the MOST in this game is the story and the gameplay.\nThe enemies in the game--from what I've played thus far--are characters from the very story he created, and they're all more that hell bent on killing him. Actually, I'm pretty sure that the entire game is going to be the one in the book he wrote, and this becomes evident really early on in the game, as you find scriptures of pages of words hidden in the environment.\n\nThe combat primarilly revolves around you blincing these enemies with a very powerful flashlight (Seriously, these are ENERGIZER batteries and they last for ♥♥♥♥). You can shine it at them and start to break the blankets of darkness that protect them, or you can go literal energizer mode and shine an intense beam of light at them, holding them in place and doing MAJOR damage to their shields, breaking them faster and allowing you to finish them off with your bullets (you have a gun, too, don't worry. Your flashlight isn't some crazy contraction. Also, it gets rather difficult at times to do this, because you're often outnumbered, and your enemies are very fast; just as fast as you at times.\n\nThey WERE going to make Alan Wake 2, which looked SOOOOOO COOL, but I dunno. Guess Remedy's putting their newer ideas in Quantum Break instead D: It's fine, though :D\n\n10/10, though I don't have many pet peeves about games ^3^","July 16, 2015","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story alone is what kept me playing for 15 hours. The visuals and audio were beautiful, and the presentation of the content in a movie-like fashion was brilliant and fit the game perfectly. The NPCs in the game are VERY well done and helped lighten the mood in a dark game. Not to mention, I don't think I ever heard a repeated phrase by a character and I loved that about this game.\n\nThe actual game play however was very poorly done for my taste. The fights were repetitive, predictable, intrusive, and unnecessary. Every 15 steps the game would interrupt my progression with a slow-motion introduction of a "new" set of enemies, and all I could think was "just let me play the game". It made enemies too familiar which took away any of the horror feel that they were supposed to bring to the game.\n\nThere were a few pieces of actual game play that were fantastic and stood out from the rest in my eyes. The battle on the stage at the farm was the most enjoyable out of all of the combat scenes in the game. The music and the rock-and-roll stage scene made me feel like a boss killing all of the Taken, and having Barry there to cheer me on made it feel like I was fighting with a friend. Although not every combat scene can feel that epic, having more scenarios like this would have made the game play much more enjoyable. Even just changing up the music for other fights would have helped add variety.\n\nWhile I did not enjoy the combat, every other aspect of the game greatly helped it redeem itself. The entire story and ending left me in awe and I very much look forward to seeing it continue in the future. Definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good story and an overall beautiful game.","May 25, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Rumours and small spoils motivated me to play it for myself. On 1 May 2015 I finally set out on this adventure as a well known, cocky, used book writer who went on a retreat to Bright Falls in Washington, USA. It sets off on a slow pace and introduces you to all basic concepts and details.\n\nThe main goal of Alan Wake was to create an immersive movie or story with little effort needed from the viewer, they achieved this with simple controls and an easy difficulty to play on. Do not be fooled and think that the entire story is all fun and games, at the end of each episode everything would get intense, hordes of taken would appear leaving you to fight or flee for your life.\n\nCategorised as a thriller I back the entire game, dwelling in silence with illuminating glare from the moon evolves slowly into a suspenseful walk with atmospheric music setting the tone of every scene. Even the classic jump scares are included, strolling through a home when suddenly a taken busts through the door charging you with al there is. Some were predictable and some were not, but balanced and not worn out.\n\nPhysical gameplay felt unnatural and sloppy but to be fair it was a conversion form Xbox to PC. Minor glitches like getting stuck on something or jumping and getting stuck but no big problems.\n\nGraphics….. This was hard, reviewing in 2015 vs back in 2010 is quite a difference seeing that my GTX 760 made mincemeat of any graphical requirement it threw my way. Certain unpleasantness struck me in cinematics due to visible comers and edges, Alan’s Face his hands ect.\nBUT\nComparing to other titles released in 2010 it seems like the quality of visuals were up to standard, titles like Mass Effect 2, Just Cause 2, Assassin’s creed Brotherhood also had some of these characteristics that feels unpleasant to the eyes.\n\nThis story was amazing and immersive…\n\nAt first they make you compare yourself to Alan, at this stage you would feel all his pain. Then they drop an unravelling bomb on you where you start to hate our Hero, after a while you start agreeing again and feel his drive, anger, hatred and determination to finish his adventure.\n\nAt the very end the unthinkable happens and they leave you on the biggest cliff-hanger ever created by mankind.\nThey later on released special episodes 1 and 2 which continues the story after the story, these were not as good as the main story but also deserves your attention.  It does not really enlighten you about happenings after and if you can shut off your entire brain and only receive entertainment through playing games, I would implore you to do this as the FINAL\ndid not give any closure and generated more hope than was needed.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that Alan Wake 2 will not make an appearance in the future, Quantum break releasing exclusively to Xbox one will receive this title. Producers and directors feel that it is not within the age or time to make a new Title to this extremely awesome piece of art and creative immersion.\n\nMy next game would be Alan Wakes American Nightmare.\n\nHit the review section up to see may say in a months’ time.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: ABSOLUTE YES, Add it to your rich-story category in your library.\n","May 28, 2015","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just can't spoil anything, but I'm positive this is the single best story I ever had the pleasure to experience in a video game - and not just that. It owes a lot to Stephen King stuff, and isn't afraid to show it. Even the gameplay, despite not being "perfect", helps this, with unique mechanics connected to the plot and logic of the world, and even a few surprises towards the end.

After playing for several hours and not completing it, there's one thing I need to point out: the. story. is. killer.\n\nIn all due seriousness, however, Alan Wake is a writer to have found himself in a messy situation when Mr. Wake and his wife just wanted to go relaxing outside of the city. His wife goes missing and he needs to figure stuff out. It all gets way more complicated than that, and it makes you scratch your head at times. Overall, the story makes you feel; that's what makes a good story!\n\nAnd the environment certainly adds to it. Whoever designed the levels need to be glorified. They did a stellar work designing/creating levels that makes you fear the night (literally fear it) and adore the day. During the daytime, you're found in a 1960-style small town that really makes you just want to grab a chair, sit down and relax. It's so calm and beautiful. But then comes the night, and Alan needs to fight for his life and so do you.\n\nSpeaking of fighting for his life, you get extraordinarily limited attempting to do that very task. There's a ridiculous limit on the ammunition you can carry (despite ammunition being found everywhere, it does run out quickly) that makes it incredibly difficult to get out of a hairy situation. For example, if you get stuck and there's no ammo around & you meet a ton of enemies, well, tough luck.. your best bet is to run away from them.. in other words, no combat action. CHEAP AND UNACCEPTABLE ♥♥♥♥ING "SOLUTION". But, usually you do have ammo if you use your equipment very conservatively.. no fun doing that, however.\n\nStory is fantastic, gameplay is great and the environment & the atmosphere are out of this world.. astonishing, really! And the game is so well done that it's essentially bug-free! Awesome! If there's a game that gives you a great bang for the buck, Alan Wake is certainly on that list.

Even on the normal difficulty you will find yourself trying to avoid alot of battles due to the fact of having limited ammo/battery supplies, however the game still balances this out with environmental advantages.\n\nA lot of other reviewers have tried to class this game as a "typical shooter genre", but i find this to not be the case. Though it does have some minor auto healing abilities the combat itself is quite unique and far from a typical shooter. To be honest a majority of the time you'd prefer to use enviromental light or obstacles to defeat enemies as opposed to your weapons.\n\nDefinately in my list of all time favourites, right with another Sam Lake written game "Max Payne".

Alan Wake plays like Stephen King meets Max Payne, meets Twin Peaks and The Twilight Zone, meets a mix of zombie and vampire movies!\n\nRemedy did it again, the game felt quite like Max Payne did, while at the same time managing to set its own distinctive path.\n\nThe atmosphere, story and graphics were awesome, like a good Stephen King horror book/movie should be. The creators made it so the game plays in episodic segments, much like a TV series and the inspirations they got from said movies, tv shows and books are noticeable throughout all its length.\n\nI personally found it to be much more than a horror story though, it also has the classic struggle of a man to save his loved one, but even more than that, it's a metaphor for a man who tries to overcome his fears and problems and in the end manages to "return". I won't spoiler you the rest, play the game till the last dlc to understand!\n\nDespite all that, the comedy element, numerous references and witty lines which defined Max Payne are present here too, Remedy made sure of that. Especially Alan Wake's best buddy, Barry provides great comedy relief feeling and lines!\n\nThe soundtrack was equally awesome, from its haunting pieces to fitting works of various artists, with band Poets of the Fall being in the spotlight with 3 songs. The band had also worked on the second Max Payne game.\n\nMy only complaints here were the gameplay and the checkpoints system.\n\nThe gameplay manages to catch your attention at first with its innovative style, but gets repetitive and annoying pretty fast and unfortunately it doesn't improve much later in the game. Max Payne had a similar issue, however, being a more fast paced game, it didn't stand out that much.\nAs for the checkpoints system, I wished there were more in some spots, as losing in said points and starting all over was quite infuriating.\n\nHopefully they will fix these issues in the game's true sequel, which, due to poor sales performance, seems like will never see the light of the day, but I do believe will eventually manage to come through and shine light in the darkness!\n\nUntil then, if you are a fan of all the above, wake up and play Alan Wake!","October 13, 2015","true","75.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","5"

You might find the plot difficult to follow, but give it a chance. It's smooth and creamy and goes down easy, like dipping your sack in melted butter, but it's not your sack, it's your brain.\n\nThe combat system is pretty clever. While the "Over the shoulder shooting" style game isn't an original idea, the way the enemies are made vulnerable is both relevant to the plot and smart enough that it creates tension without having to have foes burst out of air ducts every 5 seconds, using shock to replace fear. It's challenging and frightening in a story driven way, like a good novel, but it's not a novel, it's a game.\n\nGo on, give it a go. It's no doubt much cheaper these days and it still holds up, even after all these years. The whole thing is very refreshing, like jumping into a cool lake.

Though it does have some shortcomings, ultimately, Alan Wake is a engrossing piece of fiction which does it's best to recapture the cinematic storytelling of Max Payne, and for the most part, it delivers.\n\nThe game is visually impressive, with lighting being both stunning and a key part of the gameplay, and models being fairly well detailed. The shadowy particle effects when the enemies show up is neat, and overall the game exudes atmostphere. The musical score is decent, though utimately forgettable.\n\nGameplay is probably the weakest aspect of Alan Wake, but it's still suprisingly solid. It has your standard set of third person controls, but what it adds is it's light mechanic. Enemies in the game cannot be killed unless they are weakened by light first. This can be from your torch (flashlight), a flare gun, or really any light source lying around. Enemies won't attack you under street lamps for instance, though often, to continue, you have to go out into the darkness and fight the enemies. there are some puzzley section in the game, but they aren't too difficult to figure out, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nWhere Alan Wake really shines is in it's narrative, but moreso how it tells this narrative. While at first narrration by a Stephen King-esque character seems like it wouldn't be quite so interesting, the delivery is great. When things start to go wrong in Bright Falls, the atmosphere compliments the narratation.

The first response would be the following "Oh My God!  What a great game!  What do you think happened at the end?!  Ugh, my mind is melting just thinking about it".  The second response " ... um ... never heard of it".\n\nAlan Wake is probably what most us would call a cult classic.  It has a following and those who follow it, love it.  It's one of those games that flew under the radar but once dug up truly grips you.  I compare the game itself to a music album which after the first listen doesn't blow you away but over time becomes one of your favorites without even realizing it.\n\nAlan Wake has many unique characteristics to it but yet stays familiar with the controls and 3rd person shooter concept.  The story grips you from the beginning and constantly unfolds before you but leaves you still thinking "Um, what just happened?".  The gameplay surrounding the darkness and Alan Wake's companion the light gives you a bleak and desperate feeling through out even when you have the comfort of friends (and very capable ones) to help you through.\n\nWake is stuck in his own nightmare and quickly finds out he has already written it.  He follows the trail that leads him to the darkness.  The question which you must answer is if Alan will defeat the darkness, his fears, his nightmare or will he fall victim just as others have in the past.\n\nA must play!","December 18, 2013","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I never got tired of it either, whenever you get that barely made stumbling dodge you breathe a sigh of relief as you have a few precious moments to regain composure. The darkness will take you if you're not aware at all times, but luckily enough it's also not unfair about it. You'll also learn to love flares, which are just very fun to pop when you're surrounded as the combat can get very cinematic. (without any hitch ups in my experience)\n\nThe entire experience is a wonderful one, between the music, the visuals, the narrative and the plot, it's a great experience. And it never falls into typical horror story sillyness, yes things will jump out at you, but the real danger is because the darkness itself is something that cannot be fought directly. Alan can slow it down all he likes, but it'll take a lot more than a torch and a revolver to end it. And that feeling sticks with you, you can fend off the darkness, but beating it?

But in this game, the character facial movements resemble a bad Hollywood botox treatment repeated 1000 times.  The attempt to match words with lips is definitely an alien concept.

You take the role of Alan Wake, a writer, who goes on a vacation with his wife. Too bad their cottage (or the lake around it) is haunted and the darkness takes his wife hostage. Alan hits his head and is confused, alarmed and out-right horrified to find himself attacked by shadowy but unearthly shapes of townsfolk, friends and enemies alike. To survive he has to use light and gunmanship.\n\nBasically Alan meets a number of horrors along the way and beats most of them with elaborate use of light, guns and fast feet. Story advances smoothly along six chapters, each of which brings new kinds of enemies, tools and of course lore and insight into the destiny of Alan.\n\nAfter enjoying the story once you can play it through on a higher difficulty level, dubbed Nightmare, with stronger enemies and due to that scarcer resources. There are also two bonus chapters that are situated after the main story. The whole game takes anything from 15 to 25 hours to play through, more if you play it through with the higher difficulty level and even more if you go looking for all the extra stuff that gives you achievements. The main attraction however, at least to me, was the story that is enhanced by the immersion provided by believable body language and good voice acting.\n\nGet it for full price and you probably won't regret it anyway, but the game is frequently on a high discount that gets you a nice thrilling story with a price of a large soda.","October 18, 2013","true","45.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Nevertheless game brings to you really great atmosphere and story, most of reviews compare it to Steven King's novels and you really can feel that writers drew their inspiration there. But for me it all reminds "circus" level from Max Payne 2: dark, gloomy, depressive, hallucinogenic and crazy. Some names, situations, etc. insinuate to Max as well, you could even see his face on TV if you got a watchful eye. Drama in Max Payne is stronger, but more obvious and schematic, while Wake's writers create truly holywoodish (in a good way) suspense, narrative full of metaphors and links to pop-culture. It could be a fantastic movie, but it's just a good game worth your time.","September 11, 2014","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Всем советую поиграть!\nСюжет игры повествует о приключениях писателя Алана Уэйка, автора бестселлеров в жанре «триллера», оказавшегося в городе Брайт-Фоллс, штата Вашингтон, где оживают персонажи и события его произведений. Пытаясь разобраться в происходящем и выяснить, что случилось с его женой, Алан узнаёт много неожиданного о маленьком городке — раньше здесь жил писатель Томас Зэйн. Его жена погибла, утонув при странных обстоятельствах в озере, рядом с которым они жили, хотя она и была прекрасной пловчихой. Зэйн, ныряющий на дно озера, в один прекрасный день обнаруживает там некую плывущую чёрную массу, с которой заключает сделку. Сделка состояла в том, что Зэйн пишет рассказ, и высвобождает Тёмную Сущность со дна озера. Она же в свою очередь воскрешает его жену — Барбару Джаггер.\nБарбара ожила, но это была лишь человеческая оболочка, заполненная Тёмной Сущностью. Томас осознаёт свою ошибку и вырезает Барбаре сердце, пытаясь уничтожить освобождённое им зло. Но это не останавливает Тёмную Сущность, Барбара по прежнему жива, и тогда он уходит вместе с ней под воду, но так и не достигает дна. А остров с домом исчезли, оставив жителей с новостью об ожившем вулкане под озером в 70-е. Призванный пером Алана, он приходит к нему на помощь и на краткий миг ослабляет Тёмную Сущность. Воспользовавшись этим, Уэйк в ужасе убегает из домика на острове, разбивается на машине, но выживает. Теперь ему придётся пройти сквозь океан ужаса и безумия, выжигая себе путь фонариком и встречая злобных тварей, от захваченного Тёмной Сущностью охотника и сошедших с ума федералов до завораживающего сердце торнадо.\nКому лень это читать: http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake#.D0.A1.D1.8E.D0.B6.D0.B5.D1.82","January 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Atmospheric surroundings and sound effects, embellished by excellent cut-scenes that help the narrative as the story unfolds.\nThe plot is fantastic yet grounded at the same time, riddled with clever what-ifs and many-layered implications of what it means to write creatively and what it is to truly push the boundaries between imagination and reality in this process.\nThe gameplay itself is pretty damn epic as well. Action remains fast-paced and challenging without being too frustrating, supplies such as ammo or batteries are plentiful enough to stop you ever running the risk of being completely defenceless while remaining sparse enough to keep you considering what to preserve and when, and there is a varying degree of weaponry and enemy strength and speed to keep it interesting.\nOne thing I really like about this game is that the game never gives you too much ammo, so you never really have that safe feeling when you are trudging through the woods. In other games you usually stack up on a lot of guns and ammo and end up being a one man army - not so in Alan Wake. Here, your character really is a frail writer with a flashlight and a tweed jacket, not a super soldier - your most powerful weapon is also the light. Without light, even the most potent gun cannot so much as even scratch the enemy.","November 11, 2015","true","21.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It does a marvellous job in telling a convincing story, and it gives you the felling to be part of a unique setting. This is not done by a large amount of cutscenes or - worse - voice-overs, no: the game manages to give you the feeling to be the protagonist in a good, and scary, movie. Everything in this game is polished to - almost - perfection, but most impressive is the way in which Alan Wake succeeds in drawing you into the story and the setting. After sometime, you feel like being Alan Wake, and like living his story.\n\nVery impressive is the way light is used in a dark setting, both as a weapon against the "dark presence" and as a safeheaven. Sometimes, you are so overwhelmed by enemies, the only valuable option is just to run for the nearest lightpost - which happily double as saving-points.\n\nOk, there are some shortcomings: the difficulty can be a bit frustrating at times, but the story drives you further because you really want to know how things develop. The frightening part is sometimes a bit predictable, but still makes you jump a lot of times. Even during a second playthrough, I found myself being scared quite often, which is a rare thing in these kind of games. Worst: the camera angle is very weird, one has the feeling of walking not in a straight line forward, but after an hour or so, also this gets used to. Still, this could have been done better and is the only indication of the pc-version being a port from the consoles-version. Graphics happily can be tweaked to everyone's liking, so that this game can also run on a less powerful system. Still, it was one of the first games ever being optimalised for quad-core processors, but I only own a dual core, so I can't tell if this gives a noticable performance difference. On my 6-years' old rig (Core 2 Duo 2,66 Mhz & Radeon HD 5850) it runs very smooth indeed on completely maxed out settings.\n\nGraphics are very fine for a game of some years ago, and the sound is simply perfect. One very important thing: play this one in a dark room at night and set the brightness in the options as low as possible, since the light-dark contrast is an esssential part of the game. It will manage to make you jump quite some time!\nAnd o yeah - the two DLC's are masterfull, sometimes even better than the main game. So be sure to get them, they're worth it.\n\nGameplay: 25/30\nGraphics: 16/20\nSound: 10/10 (very, very frightening at times)\nStability/patching: 20/20\nReplayability: 14/20 (singleplayer only, but the immersive story really asks for a second going)\n\nPlayed on: Intel Core 2Duo E8200 @ 2,66Ghz, Radeon HD 5850, 4GB Ram\n\nOverall: 85/100","September 10, 2013","true","47.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It turned out to be a fantastic survival horror type game that really centers on the story. If you’ve played the Max Payne games you’ll have a good idea of how the game story I presented. It’s almost like an interactive movie, making the first playthrough great, but might cut down the replay value (because you already know what happens).\n\nSpoilers ahead\nYou play the title character Alan Wake, a horror writer visiting a small town with his wife to get some rest & relaxation. After you reach your cabin in the woods, strange things start happening. Your wife disappears and the world is cast in darkness. Think Silent Hill, but instead of a “Hell World” it’s like night with swirling shadows all over. You eventually get pursued by law enforcement including a crazy FBI agent who seems to really hate you for some reason. All the while as you move through the world, you find glowing typewritten pages that are kind of like a book that you’re living (the pages are out of order though, so you don’t know what’s going to happen next). It turns out later that you’re living out a novel that you’ve forgotten writing and an evil force is trying to get you to write it in a certain way (so the evil force wins). Throughout the game there is voice over narration (by your character) that does a good job laying things out as well as describing the confusion that will probably be going through your mind.\n\nThe game is played as a third person shooter where you will find various guns to use to defend yourself from the darkness. The enemies are mostly humans that have been “possessed” by the darkness and seem to have swirling shadows around them. These enemies are invincible until you destroy the shadows around them with your primary weapon, a flashlight. After the shadows are gone you can blast them with your regular guns. This is one of the only games I’ve played where the flare gun is the best weapon in the game. The flare gun totally destroys every enemy on screen with its bright flash.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent story – practically an interactive movie.\n+Some scary parts when the enemies come after you in the dark.\n+Easy Steam achievements in this game :)\n+Cheap – the game was in a Humble Bundle for $1\n\nCons:\n-Lower replay value due to it being so cinematic. Wait about a year before playing it again.\n-This is one of those games that can give you a headache when you play, not sure why. Probably because of the swirling shadows that are everywhere.\n-The game heated up my video card despite being on low settings.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys horror, psychological thrillers, or just good stories. There is some very mild puzzle solving in the game but it’s mostly straightforward. If you get lost, just run towards the light! The sequel Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a bit of a letdown afterwards. The same game mechanics apply but there is much less variety and less of a horror aspect. You can probably find the two games for cheap though since they seem to be on sale quite often for less than $5. The Steam edition includes 2 DLCs: The Signal, and The Writer.

This is one of the most gorgeous looking games i've ever played and the landscapes unfold like images from a night mare, anyone susceptible to jump scares will have there hands full with this gem, the games at it's best when your alone in the wood's after dark with a enemy sneaking up behind you. The game play unlike most horror games is superb and sits on a throne above the rest in it's genre, each chapter introduces a new game play mechanic, the pacing makes it so you never get bored. The enemies and there AI are a joy and combat is very fun and is complimented by great control, my only complaint is theres no way to quickly turn 190 degrees without moving the mouse, it can sometimes be the death of you. The story is another selling point, it's like playing a really good steven king book, it's suspenseful and has a very satisfying ending, great characters, one in particular is Alan's best friend and offers great comedic relief that isn't too much to hurt the games serious vibe. All of the characters are fantastic and the dialogue is always engaging, expect twist and turns by the end of each chapter. The game took me about 11 hours to finish minus the included special chapters that are included as free dlc, the free dlc is roughly 2 and a half hours long and is my biggest disappointment with the game, it's unnecessary and doesn't add much. i cant praise this one enough, just give it a try.","October 12, 2015","true","20.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game seems to focus more on the story than gameplay (which can get a bit repetitive), and does well for it.

You play as Alan Wake, a burnt out writer who visits the small town of Bright Falls with his wife, Alice, for inspiration for his upcoming book called 'The Departure'. After the first night in Bright Falls, Alice is gone missing under mysterious circumstances, and Alan suddenly finds himself in the story of his unfinished horror novel. In order to save his wife, Alan needs to finish the story and find out of the dark secret of Bright Falls.\n\nThe game is divided into 6 base episodes and 2 extra episodes, each starting with a short recap of the events of the previous one (except for the first episode of course.)\nDuring the span of the episodes, the story slowly unfolds, and the pieces of puzzle come together to form an outstanding plot.\nSo, is Alan Wake worth playing? Yes, it is. Definitely but only for the story.\n\nGameplay wise sadly it's one of the laziest work I've ever seen, there's zero effort in building tension past episode 2. All you get is cheap jump scares and massive hordes of enemies.\nAnd after a while you realize that the game only brings frustration and makes you angry, yet the plot is so good you will keep going just to get to the end of the story.\n\nPROS:\n- Graphics look pretty neat, especially the lighting and the landscapes.\n- The story! I can't emphasize this enough, the biggest value of the game is the story!\n- The lore and characters. The developers put a lot of details into the world of Alan Wake!\n- Radio shows, manuscripts further extends the knowledge of the plot.\n- Night Springs. An in-game TV show that's inspired by Twilight Zone.\n\n\nCONS:\n- Gameplay is a trainwreck!\n- Massive hordes of enemies ruin the tension and atmosphere. It also causes frustration and anger.\n- Alan Wake's stamina is lower than a 80 year grandpa who's been shot with a tranquilizer. Translation: he can't more than 10-15meters without being completely exhausted. I know the game is supposed to be a survival game, but come on!\n- The gameplay gets extremely repetitive and predictable at a certain point: see a barrel, or a broken down car? 99% they are poltergeist objects and will jump on you. See a generator that you need to restart? You will get swarmed by enemies as soon as you go near it.\n- Despite having collectibles and hidden items, the game does NOT like you wandering off the linear passage and often punishes you with waves of enemies.\n\n\nTLDR: Play Alan Wake for the story!","March 13, 2014","true","37.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It’s a partial success, though not a complete one. They have entirely eschewed the typical RPG tropes of dialogue trees and progression choices in favour of a linear, non-interactive structure. The story is played out in a series of cut-scenes and simple A to B tasks. Basically you just have to battle your way from one place to the next. There’s certainly a place for this type of game, and when it’s done well (á la Half-Life 2) it can be very rewarding. Unlike Half-Life 2, however, ALAN WAKE doesn’t quite pull it off. Firstly, there isn’t enough humour. There’s some but it would have benefited from more. And the story isn’t exactly original. But the main problem for me was the combat. I hated the way control is wrenched away from the player every time enemies approach. I get why they did it (there’s no other way of knowing they’re coming, apart from some audible warnings) but I often found myself disoriented when the camera had finished sweeping around and control had retuned. Several times the sweep lasted so long that by the time I had control again the enemies were right on me and it was impossible to avoid taking a hit. Frustrating to say the least. On the plus side the environments look very good and it’s quite atmospheric (although not as creepy as I would have liked – Silent Hill still sets the bar for that). One other thing worth noting is that I found the special episode, The Writer, to be better than what had gone before. It’s even more atmospheric and far more inventive. Overall this is a good game if not an outstanding one.\n\n3/5","December 1, 2013","true","17.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/108710/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4617 products in account","Alan Wake would of been a marvelous addition to the stealth genre.  Combined with the fabulous landscapes of the mountainous Pacific Northwest and the arresting drama, moving quietly around the mountains and woods of an eerie remote town would seem to meld like needle and thread.  Remedy, listed as the developer and the publisher and of Max Payne fame but not much else, thought otherwise.\n\nAlan Wake is brilliantly atmospheric.  A compelling yet subservient Stephen King  penned horror yarn narrated by our protagonist, enveloping the player into his plight.  A story told by progression and environmentally produced manuscript pages that fill in the backstory.   Alan Wake the game is a missed opportunity.  A famous person once said "He who bemoans the lack of opportunity, forgets that small doors many times open up into large rooms.".  Alan Wake is a well realized world of small rooms that never open up into the game-play that this game so richly deserves.\n\nAs the manuscript plays out before our very eyes, a character utters the words "Like a really bad movie. Who wrote this crap anyway".  The combat in Alan Wake is misplaced, the combat is criminally designed.  Repetitively placed bullet sponge Taken as they're called, evil, are dispatched by our clunky controlled writer turned Rambo, Alan Wake.  Armed and weaponized with only enough ammo to make the game petulantly annoying we blast our way shining light upon the dark and dodging evil as if evil were rapid fans eager to strip us from our dignity.\n\nThis is Alan Wake, the game, the whole game and it never deviates.  Occasionally a few good looking environmental set pieces challenge, but these like the game as a whole can be annoying and not always well executed, presuming that the player knows what is about to happen and should play out the script, except the player's rehearsal is failure, initially not privy to any script and winds up not properly anticipating and failing scenario after scenario such as staying attached to an object for example or not jumping until a grate is dynamically set to 45 degrees ensuring that a jump can be executed in a run sequence.\n\nBesides manuscript pages the game has a number of collectibles.  Many can only be obtained through some deviation of your intended path, some exploration required if you will.  Though found, they are not recorded until you reach the next checkpoint.  The game makes the egregious error of punishing such exploration by removing any collectibles you've discovered upon your failure.  The game will restart at the last checkpoint as if nothing has happened.  Exploration and the collection of an object may have no quantitative effect of reaching the next checkpoint.  Don't demand exploration of already explored areas.  Design that wastes time, removes immersion, ultimately stilts the task at hand and actively discourages the very exploring the game was designed for.\n\nAlan Wake, for only it's story, was saved from early termination and towards the end I thought I was not going to finish the game.  Bored, desensitized from over used enemy and combat mechanics I just about made it over the finish line.  The developers expose a console command to anyone who wants to "customize" the game.  -developermenu will allow you unlimited ammo, flares and grenades.

The horror aspects are all but lost unless you are playing on the hardest difficulty, which takes two or three playthroughs to unlock, and the difference is palpable.\n\nOn anything but nightmare mode, a shadowy man will pop out on occasion and after going shine shine shine, glack glack glack, the threat is gone and you can continue with the story. On nightmare mode the game is completely different. Hordes of shadowy abominations of our reality will pour from the woods while you desperately sprint towards the next pinprick of light only to have it wink out as you near it. Then you pop a flare and continue the full tilt sprint to the next shining becon of hope, only for Wake to get tired and then get an axe in the back of his head.\n\nNightmare mode seems to be the way the game was MEANT to be played, but you can't access it without 2 other plythroughs, which is simply asking too much. Personally I play through a game once and am done with it unless theres some crazy alternate endings that I HAVE to get, wich there aren't here. Which brings me to the story.\n\nAlan Wake's story is a cross between Stephen King and Twin Peaks, with a heavy dose of lovecraft mixed in. I will not spoil anything in this, but the story is truly the best aspect of this game. It keeps the player thinking about what will happen next and where this ♥♥♥♥ storm of nightmares will end up.\n\nIn the end, Alan Wake is not a particularly scary game, unless played on the highest difficulty. The story and immersion are it's strong points, but one playthrough is probably enough, unless you are a completionist, then this game has plenty for you in the forms of thermoses scattered around the playing areas. This game is a definite 8/10, nothing ♥♥♥♥-your-pants amazing, but still enough that everyone should play it one time through.","June 3, 2014","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's visuals are great and there are some really scenic areas in the game, along with well done models and textures for the time. The only things that were not top notch were the combat, and the driving. The combat was slightly clunky, along with the ability to basically dodge out of the way of pretty much any attack, and the driving was just insufferable, since the cars would break down far too often since they get damaged when you run into enemies.\n\nOverall, its a fun game, worth taking a look at if you are ok with 3rd person shooters, not anything super exceptional, since the story is pretty bog standard for a suspense thriller, where it feels like a typical Stephen King novel.","November 27, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatGuysProfile/recommended/108710/","ThatGuysProfile","Sumuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatGuysProfile/","151 products in account","This game is a must-buy for a multitude of reasons. For one, the protagonist, Alan Wake, is a very likeable character; he is written exceptionally well and he, along with his best friend Barry Wheeler, is often believable based on the decisions he makes and his reaction to the world crumbling around him. The story in this game is also very rich and makes you stop in your tracks to think about it quite often... It's just something that we haven't seen a lot of. There are also many allusions to existing novels such as The Lord of the Rings and The Shining, so readers are in for a treat. Finally, the gameplay is completely original and the concept has been executed to near perfection (It's a tad bit repetitive at times, but still tense and exciting).\n\nHopefully, you will make the right decision (BUY THE GAME!) and savour every moment of it. It's a great addition to your library of games and definitely needs to be played from start to finish. Oh, and PC players get the two DLC packs free of charge.","April 21, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is not a pop-up scare game but works more on a persons psyche, which beautifully mirrors Stephen King and his works.\n\nAs for the shooting aspect and over game mechanics: I really can't say much, it isn't meant to be a shooter so I didn't expect the aim mechanics to be 100% accurate (also to be fair he is a writer not a military soldier).\n\nJust for anyone borderline about buying this game, a bit like Amnesia: dark descent, DO NOT buy it to win. This game has a great story, which is its main focus and running through the game at record speed won't let you enjoy the environment or be enthralled by its storyline.\nThough I must digress that some characters could have been drawn out a bit better like Wake's wife. It's hard to sympathise for someone you only meet in the opening cutscene of the game, so no emotional attachment leads to a longer timeframe to actually begin your association with the protagonist","December 7, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has an amazing atmosphere that makes you feel like you have something behind you waiting to kill you, it is extremely intense. The whole game is intense with some lighter areas ( people getting drunk, incidental stage explosions) the ending isn't satisfying but the rest of the story is great. The game Is structured as an tv show with recaps at the beginning of the episodes, it even says "last time on alan wake". This game isn't for the lighthearted but if you can handle it l, the game is worth it and the sound track is amazing. I would recommend the collectors edition to anyone who loves horror games or games with beautiful landscapes and an amazing story.","December 15, 2013","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The real kickers of it are the story and the atmosphere. The story involves a writer named Alan Wake who goes on a search for his missing wife, Alice. But is he really searching for her or is there something bigger, more devastating going on here? The atmosphere envelopes the player in moody darkness as Alan traverses the great outdoors and fights his way past the possessed dark known as the Taken.\n\nThe gameplay can get quite repetitive, but different segments diversify it up (such as surviving an assault with loads of ammo and batteries for your precious flashlight). Light is the key in this game, as the player must make his way to each lampost emitting light which is always another checkpoint. Some may find this repetitive as well, but I was always relieved to get to the next one as many of my resources (my batteries and ammo) were quite exhausted. I played the game on normal and while there were some moments that inflicted great frustrations, all in all it was a great experience.\n\nIt is a survival horror game, and while it is not as scary as Silent Hill or Amnesia, it definitely gives you moments of panic and/or fright. For me, these moments typically came because Alan can not run fast for too long as he gets tired and slows down. This can prove to be frustrating if you are being chased by too many Taken (as I was on many an occasion), but I believe it was purposely done this way, else the game would be too easy if Alan could just run faster than the Taken to each checkpoint and never have to stop, turn around, flash and kill as many Taken as possible, and go back to running.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable experience with this game. I would recommend that everyone who plays it, also play the 2 Special DLC chapters upon completion of the base story. This will provide closure upon finishing the two specials, or at least more closure than the ending of Alan Wake by itself.\n\n8/10","December 13, 2013","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You do feel a sense of dread, when playing Alan Wake.  The graphics are terrific.  The uses of music and songs throughout the game adds to the backdrop for situations and characters.  The voice work is great, except for Barry, who's character is such a cliche and overused sidekick.   Let's cut to the chase though.  The gameplay does become very repetitive.  Also, I found myself not empathyzing with Alan, which made the game slow.  By the time episode 4 started, I really thought about putting it down and not finishing because I just wanted it to end already.  But I did finish it.

No freedom. For a horror game it isn't that scary, but opens it up for people that scare quickly. Losing all your items at moments in the games can be very annoying, sometimes it's logical and other moments it doesn't make sense at all. Especially that at some points you really need more munitions and sometimes you really have way to much.\n\nBut other then that the game is mysterious and the story get's you on and on, as you want to know what is happening around and where Alice is. Handling is a little bit to much console for my taste but you get used to it. The light and shooting is sometimes tricky but fun to execute and makes it a bit more original then just shooting ahead all the time. I also loved the missing pages that is one page of a book, it's well written en narrated very well.\n\n7/10\n","November 25, 2013","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizminkey/recommended/108710/","wizminkey","Wizminkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wizminkey/","390 products in account","One of the best atmospheric thriller games I've played in recent memories. If you're looking for gore and demons and half-naked nurses, move along. If you're looking for something like a Stephen King-esque horror/thriller with supernatural elements and tense combat, pull up a chair. Let me tell you about Alan Wake.\n\nAlan Wake was originally to be a launch Xbox 360 title. But it got delayed. Then it got delayed more, and more, and people started to wonder if it would ever come. Then it came, and it was polarizing. People seemed to either love it or hate it, depending on expectations. But one thing was clear, it was creepy, it had some unique twists and game mechanics, and it looks beautiful now that it's been brought to PC.\n\nAlan Wake is a struggling writer; he just killed off his main character and is looking to start a new series. Alice, his wife, suggests a vacation to get his mind off the pressures of work, and they go to a small town, where they've rented a cabin. The townsfolk seem a bit... strange... and as night falls over the cabin and the lake surrounding it, things take a turn for the worse. Alice's scream pierces the night, and Alan grips his flashlight tightly.\n\nAchievement-hunters may gripe at Alan Wake's collectibles. Some are fun and relatively easy to find with some work; manuscript pages from the novel Alan never remembers writing, televisions that show short "Twilight Zone"-esque episodes of a series Alan wrote for and radio broadcasts that indicate events going on elsewhere in the town. But then there are the can pyramids to shoot over, or the coffee thermoses to gather. Those weren't easy to find, nor did they have a purpose outside of achievements.\n\nLip-synching is also a bit of an issue at times. When you're dealing with rendered models, it's great, but when they mix up live video with foreign actors trying to flap their lips along to English voice work, it can be iffy. Thankfully, these situations are fairly uncommon, only being used on in-game TVs rather than fullscreen cinematic sequences.\n\nOverall, Alan Wake has a well-written story with some interesting twists and supernatural elements. Some of the writing comes off a bit cheesy, but it's intentional; Alan Wake's character writes and speaks that way in the manuscript pages and cinematic sequences or memories he narrates. The scare-factor is more about creepy atmospheres and shadows that turn into enemies and sometimes just sprinting madly to a source of light and safety. The combat can be formulaic if you don't experiment; try different weapons, use your flares and flash grenades in combat instead of misering them away until you absolutely need them for a crazy difficult fight. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely difficult encounters, but the game usually gives you ammo and weapons in the area.\n\nPros:\n- Dark, inky shadows that melt into enemies and more create a great atmosphere\n- Sometimes cheesy, but always dramatic narration and writing that set the mood for this thriller novel come to life\n- The light mechanic is an interesting and fun concept to work with in combat, and the enemy AI can be sneaky. They'll flank you and sneak up behind you and sometimes travel in packs.\n- The DLC and extra content are superb to go through after the game, and I normally don't touch that stuff\n- Some great plot twists. What can I say without spoiling? Pay attention and hopefully it'll all make sense at the end. If not... well, to the internet!\n\nCons:\n- Some horror fans may not like it. There's not much in the way of brutal murders or torture or guts. It's about setting a mood and soaking yourself in it. If you're determined not to be scared, you won't be.\n- Fights can get formulaic. Flashlight, shoot, repeat. Some areas can even be sprinted through, bypassing common enemies on the way to the next plot point. Don't do that if you want to enjoy the game.\n- Driving. Good lord, it's awful. They tried... but it didn't work so well.\n- Non-English-speaking actors dubbed with English voices can break the fourth wall when it's so important to have it intact in this type of game.\n- Very few puzzles, and they're rarely very challenging. It's usually just a question of finding where the button is to push. This may be a pro depending on your expectations, though.\n\nYou'll laugh, you may cry, you'll probably scratch your head in confusion more than once, and you will absolutely want to play this in a dark environment. A second playthrough in Nightmare mode gives you access to some new manuscript pages that often explain an in-game situation in a new light that would have spoiled a first playthrough and gives more explanation if you need it after finishing it once. It also makes the enemies tougher and more cunning, obviously.\n\nAnd don't forget to count the shadows!","December 25, 2013","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am merely making the Silent Hill reference to show you what a great story-driven and carefully crafted game Alan Wake is. It is certainly not a Silent Hill clone and is very unique.\n\nClever story, fun combat, and some very tense moments. The atmosphere and story work together perfectly. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, and some parts of the game will really get your heart pumping. I won't spoil anything. I'll just say some of the scenes get really intense. There are a few puzzles thrown into the mix, but they are pretty basic and easy. The story and fun combat is where this game shines.\n\nI will admit that some parts of the game were really hard for me, even on easy mode, but you can get through them with a little learning (learn to find the hidden item caches, look for alternate paths, run instead of fight, etc). I don't fault the game for this because it made me think of alternate solutions and made it feel really satisfying when I finally beat a part of the game that was giving me problems. Don't worry about it too much though. Checkpoints are encountered often so you won't have to replay much if you die.\n\nPicked it up for $5 during a sale, but would have no problem paying the full price.

The PC port is done well, with all the graphical options you could want, and the DLC from the console game included with the purchase.\n\nThe story for Alan Wake is the real standout. Your character, Alan Wake, is a famous writing who is struggling with writer's block. You go on a vacation to the Pacific Northwest with your wife, where things begin to get supernatural. The game is split into 1-2 hour segments called episodes, like a TV show. At the end of each episode, there is a closing song and title screen. Each following episode begins with a "previously on..." segment. This breaks the game up into nice 1-2 chunks of playtime, and also allows for a natural jump to exploring some back story at the beginning of each segment. I really enjoyed how this aspect played out, and would love to see it in other games. The story kept me engrossed all the way through, and did not overstay its welcome. I was anxiously anticipating the end, not to finally be done with the game, but to find out what actually happens. I couldn't ask for anything more from a game in that regard.\n\nThe gameplay does leave a bit to be desired. There is a very limited selection of weapons, and you will be fighting the same enemies over and over again. The Taken, as the baddies are labeled in this game, are not especially varied. There are the normal kind, the strong kind, and the fast kind. You will see combinations of these throughout your time with Alan Wake. Be prepared to fight plenty of lumberjacks as you run through the forests of the Pacific Northwest. There are several types of collectables to look for along the way. Most have no effect on the story, however the manuscripts tie in to the game and show you what to expect next. It's a shame that the game requires two playthroughs to collect them all.\n\nThe graphics are fairly good when you consider that the game was originally released in 2010 on console. The animation of the main character could have used some work to appear more lifelike. The environment looks great, but you will be seeing a lot of forest. I was growing a little tired of that setting by the end. The FMVs are jarring when they come on, since the graphics take a notable step down from the main gameplay. That may be a result of the graphics getting a small bump when moved to PC.\n\nThe controls are adequate for what you will be doing the most of, running and shooting. I used a 360 controller and had no issues. The only difficulties were in some of the platforming sequences. I found myself missing some jumps or running off the edge of small platforms. I would not have missed those sections if they were not included.\n\nThe music is fantastic, and plays a minor role in the story. At the end of each episode, a song plays over the title screen. It has some connection to what you have just seen. A mix of licensed and original songs are used, with the original songs really fitting in nicely in tone and quality.\n\nOverall I would wholeheartedly recommend Alan Wake for a playthrough. The story is engrossing, and the gameplay, while repetitive at times, moves quickly along to keep you interested. I do not see a lot of replayability in this title, since the story is the main selling point. However, there is enough length to keep you satisfied with your purchase on one playthrough. I recommend playing the special episodes after finishing the main game, since they add a bit more closure to the experience. Those can be found under the episodes option on the main menu.\n\nGrade: B+","June 26, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am merely making the Silent Hill reference to show you what a great story-driven and carefully crafted game Alan Wake is. It is certainly not a Silent Hill clone and is very unique.\n\nClever story, fun combat, and some very tense moments. The atmosphere and story work together perfectly. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, and some parts of the game will really get your heart pumping. I won't spoil anything. I'll just say some of the scenes get really intense. There are a few puzzles thrown into the mix, but they are pretty basic and easy. The story and fun combat is where this game shines.\n\nI will admit that some parts of the game were really hard for me, even on easy mode, but you can get through them with a little learning (learn to find the hidden item caches, look for alternate paths, run instead of fight, etc). I don't fault the game for this because it made me think of alternate solutions and made it feel really satisfying when I finally beat a part of the game that was giving me problems. Don't worry about it too much though. Checkpoints are encountered often so you won't have to replay much if you die.\n\nPicked it up for $5 during a sale, but would have no problem paying the full price. You can easily tell within moments of playing that the creators were passionate about making a great game. It's an awesome game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure/action horror games.","July 10, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He is definitely a character you can easily get to know and feel almost like he's a real person talking to you. The game is very atmospheric, but be ready for a couple scares that will make you jump!

It took the makers years to make (which included many delays), and there is clear evidence throughout the game that it was originally meant to be at least semi-open world rather than sectioned into levels. Once it did come out though, it heralded a new style of narrative with chapters played like episodes of a TV show, replete with visual summaries of the previous episode at the start of each of them. That desire to experiment with narrative in the game is easily the best part, and even though it's very heavily inspired by Stephen King, it's still a very original style for gaming and will keep you playing through even the dullest gameplay portions.\n\nAnd that's the main problem with Alan Wake, the gameplay. Now, that's not to say it's even that bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable and adds a lot of tension that really helps the game's atmosphere. The game even introduces new and interesting enemies for a while that keep you on your toes! But somewhere around the halfway point the game gets bored with introducing new gameplay elements, and of course shortly after that point you will too. The game really does start to drag towards the end, and if you're anything like me it will feel like a real grind to finish it and see what happens to the story. Aaaand then there's no satisfactory conclusion either. The game wants you to play the episodes that were released as DLC, but due to lukewarm reception (the game already got boring, and the DLC adds nothing while rewarding you with even less substantial story), they got cut short at just the 2. I should mention Alan Wake 2 is rumoured to be in the works, so there is that anyway.\n\nBut to cut this short, Alan Wake is absolutely fantastic for half of the game, and then falls short towards the end. Despite this, it's frankly a must play for what it does right, so I recommend it for sure.","January 6, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't much about graphics though, it's about telling you a story.\nOn overall I really liked this game, it was very deep. But playing it for 10 hours straight, I did notice that the combat was pretty flat: it was always the same.. pop off their darkness and shoot them a couple of times and they die.

The gameplay is magnificent and controls are at times a bit extensive but easy to get used to. It's very environmentally interactive and nearly as realistic and logical as a game can get. This game is fun in terms of reading a good mystery novel, only you're in control and replace the need to read text, there are stunning visuals, haunting melodies, and the goal to help you, Alan wake, discover what is reality and what is fiction, if reality still even exists. Writers truly get lost in their work...","September 11, 2013","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a great story, which is its main focus and running through the game at record speed won't let you enjoy the environment or be enthralled by its storyline.\nThough I must digress that some characters could have been drawn out a bit better like Wake's wife.

The story centers around Alan Wake (didn't see that coming, did you? :P) a writer who gets caught up in supernatural events.  The story isn't the most original in the world, but it gives credit where credit is due.  Homages to Stephen King and Twin Peaks, among others, give Alan Wake a surrealistic charm.\n\nThe 'Light vs the Dark' mechanic works extremely well.  Flashlight batteries and ammo are most definitely resources to be used judiciously (run out and you'll be sweating bullets).\n\nPersonally, I loved this game mechanic.  Nowhere in Alan Wake do you ever find random ammo and battery dumps just so you can stock up.  When you do find them, you'll probably faint in relief.  IMO, the game ALWAYS gives you just enough resources to survive the various encounters.  No more, no less.  How you survice, IF you survive, will require a little thinking on your part.\n\nAdditionally, every 'encounter' and discovery serves to drive the story forward; 'filler material' is almost non-existant.  Very few games out there can make that claim.  Be patient as the game is like any well written thriller (film or literature).  There are 'red herrings' and detours but they too serve the overall story.\n\nThe ending will certainly leave some peope confused but never fear!  Simply go the Main Menu, options, episodes, and voila!  The two DLC that come with the game, 'The Signal' and 'The Writer' will be there for you to continue the story.  <'The Signal' is the episode you'll want to start with>\n\nI bought Alan Wake during a Steam sale at 75% off though I would have gladly paid full price for it.  It is that good.\n\n\n","November 27, 2014","true","65.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/108710/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Alan Wake is a 3rd person shooter/action-adventure game originally released for the Xbox 360 and ported over to the PC. The PC port is done well, with all the graphical options you could want, and the DLC from the console game included with the purchase.\n\nThe story for Alan Wake is the real standout. Your character, Alan Wake, is a famous writing who is struggling with writer's block. You go on a vacation to the Pacific Northwest with your wife, where things begin to get supernatural. The game is split into 1-2 hour segments called episodes, like a TV show. At the end of each episode, there is a closing song and title screen. Each following episode begins with a "previously on..." segment. This breaks the game up into nice 1-2 chunks of playtime, and also allows for a natural jump to exploring some back story at the beginning of each segment. I really enjoyed how this aspect played out, and would love to see it in other games. The story kept me engrossed all the way through, and did not overstay its welcome. I was anxiously anticipating the end, not to finally be done with the game, but to find out what actually happens. I couldn't ask for anything more from a game in that regard.\n\nThe gameplay does leave a bit to be desired. There is a very limited selection of weapons, and you will be fighting the same enemies over and over again. The Taken, as the baddies are labeled in this game, are not especially varied. There are the normal kind, the strong kind, and the fast kind. You will see combinations of these throughout your time with Alan Wake. Be prepared to fight plenty of lumberjacks as you run through the forests of the Pacific Northwest. There are several types of collectables to look for along the way. Most have no effect on the story, however the manuscripts tie in to the game and show you what to expect next. It's a shame that the game requires two playthroughs to collect them all.\n\nThe graphics are fairly good when you consider that the game was originally released in 2010 on console. The animation of the main character could have used some work to appear more lifelike. The environment looks great, but you will be seeing a lot of forest. I was growing a little tired of that setting by the end. The FMVs are jarring when they come on, since the graphics take a notable step down from the main gameplay. That may be a result of the graphics getting a small bump when moved to PC.\n\nThe controls are adequate for what you will be doing the most of, running and shooting. I used a 360 controller and had no issues. The only difficulties were in some of the platforming sequences. I found myself missing some jumps or running off the edge of small platforms. I would not have missed those sections if they were not included.\n\nThe music is fantastic, and plays a minor role in the story. At the end of each episode, a song plays over the title screen. It has some connection to what you have just seen. A mix of licensed and original songs are used, with the original songs really fitting in nicely in tone and quality.\n\nOverall I would wholeheartedly recommend Alan Wake for a playthrough. The story is engrossing, and the gameplay, while repetitive at times, moves quickly along to keep you interested. I do not see a lot of replayability in this title, since the story is the main selling point. However, there is enough length to keep you satisfied with your purchase on one playthrough. I recommend playing the special episodes after finishing the main game, since they add a bit more closure to the experience. Those can be found under the episodes option on the main menu.\n\nGrade: B+","June 26, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's axe-wielding sarcastic lumberjacks, axe-wielding sarcastic park rangers, axe-wielding sarcastic police officers, and axe-wielding sarcastic farmers. You also get attacked by an assorment of inanimate objects (puddles, barrels, car tires), but overall there wasn't much variety. I would have preferred a crosshair and no auto-aiming if the control scheme allowed it.\n\nThe controls were a little wonky. The over-the-shoulder angle makes walking on narrow pathways a PITA. Also, for some weird reason, I had to re-bind my jump key (numpad / - I know, weird) every time I played\n\nThe graphics and sound (especially the sound) were done beautifully and fit the mood very well..\n\nThe pacing and difficulty weren't really there at all. The story follows an episodic pattern, which works well, but the game itself didn't pace well. Climaxes would often happen near the beginning of the chapter, followed by boring stretches of nothing for long times. The fights didn't really get more difficult. The most difficult one happened in the middle of chapter 2 or 3 (on the viewing platofmr). Everything else before and after that was too easy. The final fight way so easy I thought i was doing it wrong.\n\nAlso, the product placement was a little over-the-top... You had to regularly pick up Energizer (tm) batteries, and if you got lucky you could find Energizer Lithium (tm) batteries. You see a couple of xboxes in random places, and regular Verizon billboards.\n\nSo yeah, I will say the monotony of "running through the woods killing lumberjacks" was my biggest peeve about it I will give Sarcastic Lumberjack Hunter a rating of 3/5.","April 19, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Being somewhat challenging and fast paced, it can often times be confusing and hard to choke down the story, pretty much being the consequence for being too fast-paced. Also it can becomes repetitive and boring, being that there is no diversity in the types of objectives, which could also lead into some serious confusion if you don't focus on it.

The storyline and plot is very developed, with a strong connection between the characters. The game itself evokes strong character traits, that are almost unforgetable. It is split into episodes, as if it was a TV show. Being somewhat challenging and fast paced, it can often times be confusing and hard to choke down the story, pretty much being the consequence for being too fast-paced. Also it can becomes repetitive and boring, being that there is no diversity in the types of objectives, which could also lead into some serious confusion if you don't focus on it.

While i liked that you could pick up your manuscript pages, it also kind of revealed what would happen later in the game. While the forests sure looks beautiful with lots of details and textures that's good enough, you can't help but think "Not another ♥♥♥♥ing forest" later in the game. Ohterwise, the game gots graphics good enough to deliver. And there's a few key moments that was intense and really interesting i won't mention here for the sake of not spoiling it for anybody.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNow here is what i didn't like about the game:- Linear and repetitive gameplay\n- The same ghostmen over and over again (The variations is: Normal guys, Big guys and Fast guys)\n- It's pretty predictable to spot when you will get ambushed\n\nThe game pretty quickly becomes linear and repetitive since you have to follow a path in the game and kill the same ghostmen the same way over and over. There's a couple of ways to deal with them, but it quickly becomes the same and you quickly learn how to deal with certain types of enemies. also like i mentioned.. you will get tired of forests sooner or later. When you're through the first episode, you will probably already know when to expect company by your best friends, the ghostmen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the middle:- The ending\n- Coffee collectables\n\nThe story itself was good, but the ending makes you think and i am still kind of lost. I still don't really know what the hell happened. (Maybe you'll get it) The coffee collectables... don't really know how i feel about them. They don't do anything and kind of feel out of place.\n\nThe Verdict:All in all, a good game with an interesting and unsettling story, but i don't want to play it again because of the gameplay. The only reason to play it again would be to play Nightmare mode to get all the manuscript pages, yes there is some manuscript pages you can only get by playing on nightmare mode.. which means you have to play the game twice. Now i'm off to play the Alan Wake's American Nightmare game.","June 15, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It pulled me into a deep and engaging story. It scared the heck out of me. It made me care about the characters and what would become of them. Much has been said about its developmental change from open world to an episodic structure, but after playing this game through twice now, I wouldn't have it any other way. Also, despite the linearity, the game greatly benefits from this open world engine; on a current gaming system, players can see to lush forests and rustic towns to the horizon. This 'Twin Peaks/American Gothic' presentation is what's so gripping. The game feels like a TV drama, down to the 'previously on Alan Wake' montages and the 'closing credits' music between episodes. So much about this game is obviously the product of love and pure creative passion. Remedy: I wish you'd made Max Payne 3.\n\nTechnically, the engine is tight, finely tuned and runs beautifully on all detail settings. The lighting and related effects are superb. The motion and control are also responsive and smooth. There was only one bug in which all objects but the lights would be rendered, resulting in an almost entirely black screen. This only occurred twice and restarting the game and the chapter fixed the situation. It must be noted that I have completed the game and its DLC three times; the first time was an all night session into mid morning.

It does a really good job at emmersing the player into the dark and beautifully designed world, this is one of the most detailed and well crafted game worlds I've seen. The atmosphere, story and pacing is really well done and is probably where the game shines the most. Don't expect a horror game, this is an adventure/thriller that takes the player on an nail-biting adventure that won't be forgotten easily.\n\nThe gameplay and mechanics are fun and fluid with some room for improvement for buggy running and jumping controls. Other than that, the gameplay is quite unique and fun making for some intense, interesting and horrifying moments. I've played this with both keyboard/mouse and controller. The game plays easier with keyboard/mouse since it makes aiming and camera controls easier to do. A controller is definitely not required but it does come down to preference.\n\nDefinitely a game that must be played if you like Thriller/Adventure story based games with unique 3rd person gameplay.","January 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A very twisty-turny plot that keeps the player wondering.  Not just about trying to figure out what's going on, but also about all the implications and ramifications once it's revealed what's going on.  I'd really love to go deeper into it, too, because there's a lot of awesome meat on the story bone here, but it really needs to be experienced without spoilers.\n\nI like how the story is broken up into segments as well, with an intro and "previously on Alan Wake" segments, like you're watching a TV show instead of playing a game.  It's a nice little touch, and I think an Alan Wake TV series might do pretty well, in fact!\n\nOverall the game is beautiful (with a single lone caveat mentioned amongst the bad stuff), with great lighting and wonderful textures.\n\nThe Bad\nAs good as the graphics are for the most part, the lip synching is absolutely abysmal.  Alan might be saying something like "You have to believe me!  These . . . these monster just came out of the forest and attacked me!", but if you turned the volume off and tried to read his lips, all you'd get is "Arrarar!  Rah rah rararar arrhar harar!"  It's all flapping jaw and no real facial expressions, like they're all puppets with inexpert handlers.\n\nThe camera - at least on the PC version, I dunno about console - is badly calibrated.  Awful, just awful.  When I played through the game, I was using the mouse and keyboard because I hadn't gotten around to buying a decent gamepad yet, and just the barest touch of the mouse sent the camera swinging around Alan five or six times before coming to a halt, like it was a drunk frat boy doing donuts around the parking lot that was Alan's head.  I had to pull the sensitivity down to almost nothing, and even then it was kind of wild.  I eventually got used to it, but dammit, that's not the sort of thing you should have to get used to.\n\nAs an addendum, once I did manage to get a gamepad, I went back into the game to see if that really did help things any, but it certainly seemed like that was not the case.  I didn't play through the whole game again, tho', so that might be just a first impression.  Overall, the combat can be fun, but only if you can get over the initial hurdles the default settings place in the way.\n\nOn a more minor note, though I did enjoy running through all the different stages, there were perhaps a few too many of them that simply had "dark and spooky woods" as the theme.  A little more variation might have done a lot of good.\n\nOverall\nDespite my difficulties with the controls, I still highly recommend this game.  It's a deep and fascinating look into the blurring of fiction and reality as well as a disturbing thriller with great characters and beautiful settings.","September 27, 2013","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story centers around Alan Wake (didn't see that coming, did you? :P) a writer who gets caught up in supernatural events.  The story isn't the most original in the world, but it gives credit where credit is due.  Homages to Stephen King and Twin Peaks, among others, give Alan Wake a surrealistic charm.\n\nThe 'Light vs the Dark' mechanic works extremely well.  Flashlight batteries and ammo are most definitely resources to be used judiciously (run out and you'll be sweating bullets).\n\nPersonally, I loved this game mechanic.  Nowhere in Alan Wake do you ever find random ammo and battery dumps just so you can stock up.  When you do find them, you'll probably faint in relief.  IMO, the game ALWAYS gives you just enough resources to survive the various encounters.  No more, no less.  How you survice, IF you survive, will require a little thinking on your part.\n\nAdditionally, every 'encounter' and discovery serves to drive the story forward; 'filler material' is almost non-existant.  Very few games out there can make that claim.  Be patient as the game is like any well written thriller (film or literature).  There are 'red herrings' and detours but they too serve the overall story.\n\nThe ending will certainly leave some peope confused but never fear!  Simply go the Main Menu, options, episodes, and voila!  The two DLC that come with the game, 'The Signal' and 'The Writer' will be there for you to continue the story.  <'The Signal' is the episode you'll want to start with>\n\nI bought Alan Wake during a Steam sale at 75% off though I would have gladly paid full price for it.  It is that good.\n\n\n","November 27, 2014","true","65.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Long, with a compelling story, an excellent gameplay, and a great setting. This game reminds me a lot of what Alone in the Dark made me feel about 15 years ago. I never thought a game could make me feel that way again. It has everything a game of the genre needs, and more. It even includes a great soundtrack witin it, ranging from songs from famous artists, iconic songs, and songs made exclusively for the game! And it is based in episodes, just like a TV series, it even has a briefing of the previous episode going like "Previously in Alan Wake...", a GREAT touch for a game like this because it totally has a story that is better when coming in an episodic package. I repeat, once again, one of the best games I've played in my life, and I hope there's more of Alan Wake in the future, because it is a franchise that has a lot to offer.","June 24, 2013","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alan Wake is a third-person survival horror mystery. The main character is a writer, so he is portrayed as not very athletic. This translates into the feeling of slugish and unresponsive movement. Enemies must first be cleansed of darkness by shining a flashlight on them for varying amounts of time (3-10 seconds). I found this mechanic to be a bit frustrating later in the game. The flashlight also acts as the targeting reticule. There are 5 different guns available: revolver, double-barrel shotgun, pump-action shotgun, hunting rifle and the flare gun. The flare gun acts as a rocket launcher since all of the enemies are weak to light. There are also flashbangs and road flares. Ammo is somewhat scare, and there will be times when the player will be out of ammo if care isn't taken. There is no upgrade system in this game.\n\nIf you play games for the storytelling, then you will probably like this title.  The main character and his wife go on vacation to a small pacific northwest town in an attempt to cure his writer's block. I found the characters to be mostly interesting. I also though that the dialog and voice acting were very good.\n\nThe design of the world and the characters is very good in my opinion. The lighting is mostly dark, though. There are a few sections of the story that take place during the day, but most of it is during the night.\n\nI was annoyed by the frailty and sluggishness of the main character, and the fact that most of the game takes place at very low light levels. This obviously gave a sense of urgancy to everything, but this changed to annoyance for me towards the later parts of the story. I also foung the game to be more challenging than I would have expected on the lowest difficulty setting.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with this title. Aside from the annoyances, I found the story to be well worth it.","May 24, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took the makers years to make (which included many delays), and there is clear evidence throughout the game that it was originally meant to be at least semi-open world rather than sectioned into levels. Once it did come out though, it heralded a new style of narrative with chapters played like episodes of a TV show, replete with visual summaries of the previous episode at the start of each of them. That desire to experiment with narrative in the game is easily the best part, and even though it's very heavily inspired by Stephen King, it's still a very original style for gaming and will keep you playing through even the dullest gameplay portions.\n\nAnd that's the main problem with Alan Wake, the gameplay. Now, that's not to say it's even that bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable and adds a lot of tension that really helps the game's atmosphere. The game even introduces new and interesting enemies for a while that keep you on your toes! But somewhere around the halfway point the game gets bored with introducing new gameplay elements, and of course shortly after that point you will too. The game really does start to drag towards the end, and if you're anything like me it will feel like a real grind to finish it and see what happens to the story. Aaaand then there's no satisfactory conclusion either. The game wants you to play the episodes that were released as DLC, but due to lukewarm reception (the game already got boring, and the DLC adds nothing while rewarding you with even less substantial story), they got cut short at just the 2. I should mention Alan Wake 2 is rumoured to be in the works, so there is that anyway.\n\nBut to cut this short, Alan Wake is absolutely fantastic for half of the game, and then falls short towards the end. Despite this, it's frankly a must play for what it does right, so I recommend it for sure.","January 6, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No freedom. For a horror game it isn't that scary, but opens it up for people that scare quickly. Losing all your items at moments in the games can be very annoying, sometimes it's logical and other moments it doesn't make sense at all. Especially that at some points you really need more munitions and sometimes you really have way to much.\n\nBut other then that the game is mysterious and the story get's you on and on, as you want to know what is happening around and where Alice is. Handling is a little bit to much console for my taste but you get used to it. The light and shooting is sometimes tricky but fun to execute and makes it a bit more original then just shooting ahead all the time.

If you like horror based games, you are going to like Alan Wake. You play out a horror novel written by you, that you don't remember writing,  in an attempt to save your wife from an acient evil. The tevevision mini-series delivery of the game makes it all the more enjoyable. If you like this genre, you do not want to miss out on Alan Wake.

I am merely making the Silent Hill reference to show you what a great story-driven and carefully crafted game Alan Wake is. It is certainly not a Silent Hill clone and is very unique.\n\nClever story, fun combat, and some very tense moments. The atmosphere and story work together perfectly. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, and some parts of the game will really get your heart pumping. I won't spoil anything. I'll just say some of the scenes get really intense. There are a few puzzles thrown into the mix, but they are pretty basic and easy. The story and fun combat is where this game shines.\n\nI will admit that some parts of the game were really hard for me, even on easy mode, but you can get through them with a little learning (learn to find the hidden item caches, look for alternate paths, run instead of fight, etc). I don't fault the game for this because it made me think of alternate solutions and made it feel really satisfying when I finally beat a part of the game that was giving me problems. Don't worry about it too much though. Checkpoints are encountered often so you won't have to replay much if you die.\n\nPicked it up for $5 during a sale, but would have no problem paying the full price. You can easily tell within moments of playing that the creators were passionate about making a great game. It's an awesome game worth playing for people who enjoy adventure/action horror games.","July 10, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alan Wake is a third-person survival horror mystery. The main character is a writer, so he is portrayed as not very athletic. This translates into the feeling of slugish and unresponsive movement. Enemies must first be cleansed of darkness by shining a flashlight on them for varying amounts of time (3-10 seconds). I found this mechanic to be a bit frustrating later in the game. The flashlight also acts as the targeting reticule. There are 5 different guns available: revolver, double-barrel shotgun, pump-action shotgun, hunting rifle and the flare gun. The flare gun acts as a rocket launcher since all of the enemies are weak to light. There are also flashbangs and road flares. Ammo is somewhat scare, and there will be times when the player will be out of ammo if care isn't taken. There is no upgrade system in this game.\n\nIf you play games for the storytelling, then you will probably like this title.  The main character and his wife go on vacation to a small pacific northwest town in an attempt to cure his writer's block. I found the characters to be mostly interesting. I also though that the dialog and voice acting were very good.\n\nThe design of the world and the characters is very good in my opinion. The lighting is mostly dark, though. There are a few sections of the story that take place during the day, but most of it is during the night.\n\nI was annoyed by the frailty and sluggishness of the main character, and the fact that most of the game takes place at very low light levels. This obviously gave a sense of urgancy to everything, but this changed to annoyance for me towards the later parts of the story. I also foung the game to be more challenging than I would have expected on the lowest difficulty setting.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with this title. Aside from the annoyances, I found the story to be well worth it.","May 24, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is an absolute narrative masterpiece. Similar to the movie Inception the game does not make it clear which realities are real, and which are not, who is real, and who is not. Dip and and out of dreams until it is impossible to tell when you are awake. I found it hard to understand who I was even playing as in the game the narrative is that well-spun. Fighting in the dark against torrents of 'taken' farmhands and mechanics is certainly my idea of a good time.\n\nThe graphics are amazing in this game, allowing for countless opportunities to take snapshots of the beautiful rural scenery both in light and dark - but even if they weren't, there would still be much to be enjoyed through the narrative that one becomes intrigued and lost in. I cannot overstate enough the narrative genius that is communicated through this game.\n\nThere is only one negative that I would have to say about this game, and that is the driving - which can often feel sluggish and untamable. However, this does not in any way detract from the game's overall ability to impress.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this horror, and if anyone knows of any that are similar, please let me know.\n\n10/10 without a doubt.","January 10, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main character is a writer caught up in a thriller story. The story is quite nice and has a good deal of enjoyable foreshadowing, it jumps between nightmare and normalcy throughout the game. It has not, unfortunately, managed to resist the fad of scattering collectibles around and offering achievements for collecting them to pad the time it takes to complete, but it is not a very big problem. The protagonist also suffers from an awful case of butterfingers, consntatly losing your hard-won stuff like stronger flashlights and guns. A solid effort. The PC version has received a fair amount of love from the developers with somewhat cuztomizable graphics, an option to adjust FOV (!) and an option to remove auto aim and mouse acceleration; this is more than what can be said about most AAA titles on the market today.","January 13, 2013","true","68.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMountain/recommended/108710/","BlueMountain","Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMountain/","141 products in account","The reason i gave this game a thumbs up is because of the interesting story, It outweights the somewhat boring and repetitive gameplay.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nHere is what i liked about the game:- Really interesting story\n- Overall unsettling atmosphere\n- Manuscripts you can pickup in the game (Basicly the story you're playing, but it's interesting to read)\n- Good graphics, not the best but good enough\n- A few intense moments\n\nI really liked the story, one of the better i have heard in a long time in a video game. while it's not a completely scary horror game it's unsettling enough to creep you out from time to time. While i liked that you could pick up your manuscript pages, it also kind of revealed what would happen later in the game. While the forests sure looks beautiful with lots of details and textures that's good enough, you can't help but think "Not another ♥♥♥♥ing forest" later in the game. Ohterwise, the game gots graphics good enough to deliver. And there's a few key moments that was intense and really interesting i won't mention here for the sake of not spoiling it for anybody.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNow here is what i didn't like about the game:- Linear and repetitive gameplay\n- The same ghostmen over and over again (The variations is: Normal guys, Big guys and Fast guys)\n- It's pretty predictable to spot when you will get ambushed\n\nThe game pretty quickly becomes linear and repetitive since you have to follow a path in the game and kill the same ghostmen the same way over and over. There's a couple of ways to deal with them, but it quickly becomes the same and you quickly learn how to deal with certain types of enemies. also like i mentioned.. you will get tired of forests sooner or later. When you're through the first episode, you will probably already know when to expect company by your best friends, the ghostmen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the middle:- The ending\n- Coffee collectables\n\nThe story itself was good, but the ending makes you think and i am still kind of lost. I still don't really know what the hell happened. (Maybe you'll get it) The coffee collectables... don't really know how i feel about them. They don't do anything and kind of feel out of place.\n\nThe Verdict:All in all, a good game with an interesting and unsettling story, but i don't want to play it again because of the gameplay. The only reason to play it again would be to play Nightmare mode to get all the manuscript pages, yes there is some manuscript pages you can only get by playing on nightmare mode.. which means you have to play the game twice. Now i'm off to play the Alan Wake's American Nightmare game.","June 15, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If it's bellow $15 than i'd reccomend grabbing it.\n\nIt's a semi-scary game, sort of like Bioshock where the massive arsenal you carry presumably in your anal cavity gives you a consistent advantage and feeling of security as you go through the scary ♥♥♥ woods, though there are moments within the game (lovers peak, all i'm gonna say) where you're clenching your ♥♥♥ hard enough to pop a vesle within while trying to progress through the enviroment with numerous swarms of enemies and next to no ammo.\n\nThe story overall is fairly well done and is awesome to progress through as you feel immersed with-in it (much like Bioshock), though the ending has a massive enough cliff hanger that you could litterally park seven busses with in, that's how large of a gap they left for a sequel.

I really wanted to love this game but the gameplay holds it back. I really dug the feeling, setting, and storytelling in this game. It was dark and mysterious and I liked the way each chapter ended with credits and had a 'next time on Alan Wake'. They tried to make you feel like you were acting out a novel and it worked for me. Unfortunately, the gameplay while initially interesting wears off and becomes mundane. It's a run from A to B and kill some guys on the way type of game. Over, and over, and over..."Get to the gas station", "get to the lighthouse", "get to the farm". If I hear Alan Wake say "I had to get to the..." one more time!

This game isn't much about graphics though, it's about telling you a story.\nOn overall I really liked this game, it was very deep. But playing it for 10 hours straight, I did notice that the combat was pretty flat: it was always the same.. pop off their darkness and shoot them a couple of times and they die. Then you have flares and flashbangs that add a little extra, but that was it. Fortunately enough in the DLC: American Nightmare there's much more weapons. That DLC was also much enjoyable, even though I finished nightmare mode in just 3 hours! It really completes the whole story..

WEEEIRD...! The music also adds a lot to the game. Play it loud in stereo, dude! You can buy the music on CD from Nintendo if your Nintendo isn't hooked up to a stereo system.

His music is great for listening, just beat an episode and listen to the music without the game sound effects. Speaking of sound effects; you'll notice the quality of the echos in the caves and Alan's ape-noises.\n\nBottom line: Get it now. The graphics are an example of a revolution. Play control is very responsive and monkey-feeling. Alan Stank is TRULY perfect. If you do not get this amazing new generation of dolphin-novelist madness, then you are STUPID.

It pulled me into a deep and engaging story. It scared the heck out of me. It made me care about the characters and what would become of them. Much has been said about its developmental change from open world to an episodic structure, but after playing this game through twice now, I wouldn't have it any other way. Also, despite the linearity, the game greatly benefits from this open world engine; on a current gaming system, players can see to lush forests and rustic towns to the horizon. This 'Twin Peaks/American Gothic' presentation is what's so gripping. The game feels like a TV drama, down to the 'previously on Alan Wake' montages and the 'closing credits' music between episodes. So much about this game is obviously the product of love and pure creative passion. Remedy: I wish you'd made Max Payne 3.\n\nTechnically, the engine is tight, finely tuned and runs beautifully on all detail settings. The lighting and related effects are superb. The motion and control are also responsive and smooth. There was only one bug in which all objects but the lights would be rendered, resulting in an almost entirely black screen. This only occurred twice and restarting the game and the chapter fixed the situation. It must be noted that I have completed the game and its DLC three times; the first time was an all night session into mid morning. The game is worth it.","July 16, 2012","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sideways1234/recommended/108710/","sideways1234","Sideways","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sideways1234/","489 products in account","Note: This game is polarizing and I will give my best ability to not give an unbiased review.\n\nWhat this game does right is captivating the audience into playing more. The game is set in an episodic story arc, weird for a video game, but Alan Wake pulls it off. It is not like The Walking Dead Episodic series, but instead each chapter is broken into the episodic format. At the beginning of each episode (excluding episode one) is a recap of the previous episode. If you are like me and you continue to play through the game, then the recap is not really needed, but it does keep the tone of the game. At times these recaps are helpful when it comes to remembering the plot or just returning back to the game. At the end of each episode, the credits roll and a song is playing. Once you skip or let the credits roll, the game will send you to the next episode.\n\nThe story overall is fantastic and the game’s writers knew what they wanted for the game. These writers are famous for writing the first two Max Payne games, so the majority of the story is told through Alan Wake, the protagonist, as the narrator. The story is about Alan Wake, a successful writer who suffers from writer’s block. He and his wife, Alice, go to Bright Falls, where they vacation to clear Alan’s mind. Then in their stay, Alice is pulled into the darkness and it is up to Alan to save her. Along the way Alan discovers manuscripts of his work in progress, Departure which tells a chilling story of events, and Alan realizes that whatever is on these pages will happen in the real world. This short summary of what is to come in Alan Wake.\n\nThe gameplay is a story of its own. The basic mechanics of Alan Wake are to get from point A to point B with enemies and puzzles to get in the way. Fighting enemies in this game are not in the traditional sense. The theme of Alan Wake is Darkness, and the ironically named Bright Falls is being taken over by the Darkness. The Darkness consumes people and Alan Wake has to shine light from his flashlight on his enemies to clear the Darkness from them before he can shoot and kill them. Not only does Alan Wake fight, but he has a dodging mechanic to where he ducks and weaves from his enemies that either attack or throw tools at him. This feature, like Max Payne’s shoot dodge, is used a lot to avoid enemies.\n\nNow what this game does poorly is its character expression during cut scenes. The character development is awesome and the models are great, but when the characters speak, their lips and face are awkward enough to question the games programming, but it is not so bad that it takes away from the experience of the game. Another complaint is the PC port has a couple of glitches when I played, but Remedy remedied that (lol). Also the gameplay to a certain degree is a bit tedious. The running from point A to point B while doing rendered the same actions over and over is a little bit redundant at times, but there is enough variety in between these segments to make it not boring. Ultimately, the story is what saved Alan Wake from being a generic third person game to being a great experience overall. The story is what keeps you playing; the story is what makes you care for the characters; the story is what drives the gameplay home. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.\n\n\n\nScale:\nStory 10/10\n*Writing, Pacing, and Voice acting\nGameplay: 8/10\n*Fun, but redundant to a point\nGraphics 9/10\n*Fantastic landscapes and models, but glitches in talking and walking.\nReplay value: 8/10\n*Great, like watching a movie, and there are collectables.\nEffort: 9/10\n*The Designers took 5 years to make this, but the glitches is what makes it a 9.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nOverall: 9\n*Rating Scale is based on the average of the 5 main categories and round to the nearest number.\nThank You for reading first effortful review.

Alan Wake is a story driven game. There are many good things about this game but it is the story that will compel you to finish it.\n\nThe horror aspect is mixed into the gameplay and it works at the start as you nervously walk through a forest at night with the feeling you are being chased by axe weilding country folk. As the story progesses you will master the combat style of duelwielding a flash light and a gun to kill the 'darkness'. Once mastered you find yourself collecting heaps of ammo, flares, flashbangs etc, so much so that no matter what object the 'darkness' chooses to posses you will have more than enough to defend yourself and loosing some of that horror in the process.\n\nThe gameplay is different than anything else i have played which straight away makes it fun. Visually, the world you are in is beautiful, dark, dangerous and mysterious. The sound is also very good. The game has a great atmosphere. But...\n\nThe cutscenes and story are so so so much better than the level design and gameplay that you will reach a cutscene, learn more of this increasingly interesting and captivating story, you will be all excited to find out more when Alan somehow manages to fall back into a forest. A dark forest. You finally get to the next cutscene, awesome, more story but then Alan slips and falls into the forest. Cutscene, forest, cutscene, another ****ing forest. That is how i felt playing this game by the end. I was racing through the level to get to the next part in the story. The horror gameplay really takes a back seat maybe half way through the game.\n\nBut the story is that good that you will want to keep playing. One last thing, there is one type of enemy that you come across , little spoiler...\n\nIt is so annoying, runs super fast so you cant shine your flashlight on it until it attacks you. It runs all around so you dont know from which direction will it jump out of the darkness, sounds scary but it isn't. It takes so long to try attack you that you have to stand there for a few minutes waiting. It's frustrating. You will know this enemy as soon as you see him. If he takes too long to attck you just run to the next checkpoint and he will dissapear. Really stupid character.\n\nAll in all, if you want an action game with non repetitve gameplay this game is NOT for you! If you want something different with a great story this game IS FOR YOU!\n\nI liked it accept for that one type of enemy, so stupid, shouldn't be in the game.","February 6","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes I forget I own it, and when I remember, I have to convince myself that I actually played it. When the memories all come back, Alan Wake slams me in the face and forces me to look down at that towering list of games it stands above, not only because it is alphabetically superior, but outwardly superior as well.\n\nThe narrative is so tight, so well-woven that it breathes in and out, heaves spit in your face, and so humid you can taste the ripe Stephen King inspiration on the tip of your lower lip, unless your lower lip decides to fall open for the mind-blowing finale and your mouth becomes vulnerable to the sweet juiciness it leaves on your tongue. Seldom can games be described as such.\n\nHowever, I forget this fact. There it is, standing on a heap of otherwise sub-par games, escaping the "Top 10" lists I like to think up in my head, when it should be modeling at the forefront of story design for future games. The point is that it wasn't a wholly memorable experience. I really hate to admit this, considering how powerful a game it was in scope and atmosphere, but the game itself plays like a Stephen King novel: a single-dose experience that will likely be temporarily surpassed until it can come rushing back to your tongue. It's difficult that way. There's no dishonor in this; if anything, Alan Wake acts like a reality check, like a list of criteria all games must now meet before they can be truly commended for the features they present. Oftentimes I will come back and make sure I don't go overboard about loving a certain game until I pay my tithe to the king of all, if only a spiritual one: Alan Wake.\n\nBuy it on a sale. Don't promise yourself to replay it, because you won't, but it offers an array of emotions that can rarely be captured. You won't ever fully appreciate how great it is, but that's okay, because it's still going to give you an impression you will HATE to see another games attempt to imitate.","May 18, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First I was recommended to try this game, and read many positive reviews so I thought this ought to be a good game. The first hour of playing I was thinking to myself, how on earth everybody loves this game so much. It was super linear, cinematics were not that convincing, voice acting was not superior, blocky geometry etc. The beginning was a bit of a let down for me. But man this game gets going like a virtual twin peaks once you perservere with it. I think my initial expectations were different since I had followed this game somewhat during it's development around 2006-2007 and back then it was supposed to be an open world game. But once this game gets going the linearity is a non issue for me anymore. On the contrary it's almost mandatory to keep the pacing of the game and it's story tight. Story and locations are very Twin Peaks like. This game will not be easy to understand because it was supposed to continue, so you have unanswered questions left. But so was twin peaks also, a lot of weird stuff just remained weird and that contributed to it's bizarre atmosphere that really was it's selling points.\n\nIf you like bizarre suspenceful games, this should do it for you. It is a well made game. Even it does show signs of aging but gracefully so. Oh, and the voice acting that was a bit of a let down in the beginning for me, does improve and reaches a point where the story is told believably and fluently. I kind of wish Remedy would return to this and finish it off open world style one day. Great game even with it's change of direction and style from it's beginnings. And boy does this game have tons of surprises for a Remedy gaming fan..","March 30","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The game is set in an episodic story arc, weird for a video game, but Alan Wake pulls it off. It is not like The Walking Dead Episodic series, but instead each chapter is broken into the episodic format. At the beginning of each episode (excluding episode one) is a recap of the previous episode. If you are like me and you continue to play through the game, then the recap is not really needed, but it does keep the tone of the game. At times these recaps are helpful when it comes to remembering the plot or just returning back to the game. At the end of each episode, the credits roll and a song is playing. Once you skip or let the credits roll, the game will send you to the next episode.\n\nThe story overall is fantastic and the game’s writers knew what they wanted for the game. These writers are famous for writing the first two Max Payne games, so the majority of the story is told through Alan Wake, the protagonist, as the narrator. The story is about Alan Wake, a successful writer who suffers from writer’s block. He and his wife, Alice, go to Bright Falls, where they vacation to clear Alan’s mind. Then in their stay, Alice is pulled into the darkness and it is up to Alan to save her. Along the way Alan discovers manuscripts of his work in progress, Departure which tells a chilling story of events, and Alan realizes that whatever is on these pages will happen in the real world. This short summary of what is to come in Alan Wake.\n\nThe gameplay is a story of its own. The basic mechanics of Alan Wake are to get from point A to point B with enemies and puzzles to get in the way. Fighting enemies in this game are not in the traditional sense. The theme of Alan Wake is Darkness, and the ironically named Bright Falls is being taken over by the Darkness. The Darkness consumes people and Alan Wake has to shine light from his flashlight on his enemies to clear the Darkness from them before he can shoot and kill them. Not only does Alan Wake fight, but he has a dodging mechanic to where he ducks and weaves from his enemies that either attack or throw tools at him. This feature, like Max Payne’s shoot dodge, is used a lot to avoid enemies.\n\nNow what this game does poorly is its character expression during cut scenes. The character development is awesome and the models are great, but when the characters speak, their lips and face are awkward enough to question the games programming, but it is not so bad that it takes away from the experience of the game. Another complaint is the PC port has a couple of glitches when I played, but Remedy remedied that (lol). Also the gameplay to a certain degree is a bit tedious. The running from point A to point B while doing rendered the same actions over and over is a little bit redundant at times, but there is enough variety in between these segments to make it not boring. Ultimately, the story is what saved Alan Wake from being a generic third person game to being a great experience overall. The story is what keeps you playing; the story is what makes you care for the characters; the story is what drives the gameplay home. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.\n\n\n\nScale:\nStory 10/10\n*Writing, Pacing, and Voice acting\nGameplay: 8/10\n*Fun, but redundant to a point\nGraphics 9/10\n*Fantastic landscapes and models, but glitches in talking and walking.\nReplay value: 8/10\n*Great, like watching a movie, and there are collectables.\nEffort: 9/10\n*The Designers took 5 years to make this, but the glitches is what makes it a 9.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nOverall: 9\n*Rating Scale is based on the average of the 5 main categories and round to the nearest number.\nThank You for reading first effortful review.

From the atmosphere, to the sound track that includes well known artists, to the detail of graphics and textures. The importance of the way light and lighting was used in the graphics and story sets this game apart.\n\nIt has well developed characters, stories within stories that aren't boring and epic, well directed cut scenes all set in a picturesque, haunting environment. A mixture of the best bits of Silent Hill, Telltale's Walking Dead, Skyrim and Resident Evil. A brilliant work of art.\n\nI think the only thing that let it down was the marketing and publicity as if it had of been promoted more, I would have got to it sooner.","April 16, 2013","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the story develops, you learn about similar events that happen before and about Alan's troublesome past..\n\nGame is action/adventure survival, in third person view that doesn't have that much adventure puzzles in it, it's more of enjoying the story as it builds up from chapter to chapter with great cut scenes that are directly in the game..\n\nSometimes you really can't tell if Alan is crazy, imagining things or things he is going through are actually real! Game is divided in 6 chapters and 2 special features that furter explains the story behind Bright Falls and bla bla spoilers..\n\nPRO\n- incredible atmosphere, heavily influenced by Twilight Zone, one of the best TV psychological horror show..\n- Graphics and scenery, game is spread over a town Bright Falls, mountain, cabin on the lake, roads, many awesome places, a lodge, old sawmill, farm etc.\n- gameplay is smooth and enticing, story is very well paced and delivered and for once, there are not many logical errors..\n- sounds and music are very good made, music get little wilder when you fight enemies, and all that clasic ♥♥♥♥ hehe\n- weapons and stuff are very well made, there are few clasic weapons like pistol, shotty, flare gun, flares, and as you play, you really don't need much to think about saving ammo, there are plenty (until you play on hard or nightmare mode :)\n\nCONS\n- controls are somewhat "slow" i.e. Alan needs few steps to stop or slow down, which is actually realistic but it can be problem when he doesn't stop when you want him to,\n- field of view, to my liking, is somewhat to close to main character, so you can't really "see" what is behind you.\n\nSHOULD I PLAY IT?\nYeah, especially if you are into psychological horor games and liked to watch twilight zone (NOT SAGA), or any kind of survival game like Silent Hill (all of them :) especially SH2!, in some degree Resident Evil (first 3 parts, rest of them didn't quite fell good on me)..\n\nSomething that really made this game excellent in my mind is as you "approach" the ending of the game, events get really weird/crazy with very good subcontext about whole plot, with many details that gives you small hints about Alan psyche and people around him (his wife, best friend,..)\n\nAnyway, it's 4 years since this game is out, and I played it just now, and it's still a MUST PLAY!","February 14","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's actually quite good. As many have said, it's like Stephen King meets Twin Peaks. I can even overlook the uncanny valley mannequins in the cut scenes with weird sync issues between their speech and how their mouths move.\n\nThe main problem is that the story is trapped inside an unremarkable game. I understand that Alan is a writer not a fighter. (And sadly not much of a runner either; is he really that out of shape?) So why build a game around him where he constantly has to shoot things to stay alive? The flashlight is cool. The gun play is mediocre at best and gets quickly repetitive.\n\nSPOILER: Ninety-percent of Episode Six is a long drive/run through the woods at night with enemies jumping you every few minutes until you reach the story's resolution. They should have made Episode Five twenty minutes longer and wrapped it up as there is no more story between the end of it and finally reaching the lake in Ep Six.\n\nI didn't bother with the DLC, and based on what I've read of the follow-on-not-sequel American Nightmare, I'm going to skip it too.\n\nIf I was re-imagining this game from a different angle I'd have it be a Telltale game with branching narrative and the flashlight would be your primary weapon for killing the Taken. That seems like a far better fit instead of confining a story that could have been even more detailed inside a lame shooter.\n\nRating: 6/10\nRecommended if you are big fan of horror fiction as that's the only thing it has going for it.","February 17","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is not perfect, but it still does most everything right to the smallest detail, in the most original and creative of ways.\n\nFirst off, the atmosphere is absurdly engaging, realistic, absorbing, and scary. The lighting engine especially in this game is better than any game I've seen so far. Which makes sense, considering how essential the lighting mechanics are for this game.\n\nWhat people say is correct - it is literally like playing through/experiencing a Stephen King novel. It is wonderfully cinematographic, during gameplay and in the cutscenes. Plus the voice acting is top notch, perfect attention was given to sound details and animations, and the story is really well paced. The story and the game's atmosphere keeps you on your toes the entire time, with unpredictable plot progression and developments, and a twisting, deep, surprise-filled story.\n\nSpeaking of tension, this is one of the few games that actually makes you address each battle scenario strategically (A few others being Bioshock, Borderlands, etc.). You are so scarce on ammo and flashlight batteries throughout most of the game, that you start to bug out when you are running out of ammo, and the enemies keep spawning anyway, as if they thought you were Rambo or something. You scour every area of the map looking for any bits of ammo you can find. Each enemy takes so much work to kill that it can easily get overwhelming and you can quickly use up your ammo.\n\nThe game implements some pretty crafty platforming and environmental puzzles, particularly in the The Writer DLC. Albeit short, I greatly enjoyed that DLC  because it was just pure creativity, from beginning to end. I did not enjoy the The Signal DLC as much, but it was still good. That one felt too repetitive and eventually got quite frustrating, but it still had creative content and impressive technical feats.\n\nYou get plenty of gametime out of this game - 11-14 hours for the main story alone. And then 1.5 hours for each of the DLC, and also however much time goes into finding all the hidden objects spread throughout the levels, if you are into that kind of thing.\n\nSo in summary, with a fantastic, original, well-paced, complex, non-cliche and creative story, a very impressive game engine that looks absolutely gorgeous a LOT of the time (I took 175 screenshots in my single playthrough. :D), solid shooting mechanics, nice attention to detail, a consistently frightening and tense environment, and excellent level design, this is a game I would HIGHLY recommend, to anyone who feels they can handle a psychological horror game of this degree.","March 22, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alan Wake is a story driven game. There are many good things about this game but it is the story that will compel you to finish it.\n\nThe horror aspect is mixed into the gameplay and it works at the start as you nervously walk through a forest at night with the feeling you are being chased by axe weilding country folk. As the story progesses you will master the combat style of duelwielding a flash light and a gun to kill the 'darkness'. Once mastered you find yourself collecting heaps of ammo, flares, flashbangs etc, so much so that no matter what object the 'darkness' chooses to posses you will have more than enough to defend yourself and loosing some of that horror in the process.\n\nThe gameplay is different than anything else i have played which straight away makes it fun. Visually, the world you are in is beautiful, dark, dangerous and mysterious. The sound is also very good. The game has a great atmosphere. But...\n\nThe cutscenes and story are so so so much better than the level design and gameplay that you will reach a cutscene, learn more of this increasingly interesting and captivating story, you will be all excited to find out more when Alan somehow manages to fall back into a forest. A dark forest. You finally get to the next cutscene, awesome, more story but then Alan slips and falls into the forest. Cutscene, forest, cutscene, another ****ing forest. That is how i felt playing this game by the end. I was racing through the level to get to the next part in the story. The horror gameplay really takes a back seat maybe half way through the game.\n\nBut the story is that good that you will want to keep playing. One last thing, there is one type of enemy that you come across , little spoiler...\n\nIt is so annoying, runs super fast so you cant shine your flashlight on it until it attacks you. It runs all around so you dont know from which direction will it jump out of the darkness, sounds scary but it isn't. It takes so long to try attack you that you have to stand there for a few minutes waiting. It's frustrating. You will know this enemy as soon as you see him. If he takes too long to attck you just run to the next checkpoint and he will dissapear. Really stupid character.\n\nAll in all, if you want an action game with non repetitve gameplay this game is NOT for you! If you want something different with a great story this game IS FOR YOU!\n\nI liked it accept for that one type of enemy, so stupid, shouldn't be in the game.","February 6","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is intentional by Remedy and this narrative complexity is one of the game’s strengths.\n\nRemedy has woven a very complex story into Alan Wake and that’s really half of the reason to play this game. The main story, told in episodes like a TV series, is about Alan piecing together what’s happened in his missing week while the ever-present darkness corrupts the townspeople and relentlessly pursues him. However during that missing week, Alan apparently wrote a pre-cognitive novel about the very events that are happening to him, because as you play you keep finding manuscript pages that he wrote and that describe everything that subsequently happens to him. These are a lot of fun to hunt out and collect because they explain the rather fragmented story and make you feel just as desperate and paranoid as Alan—groping in the dark for answers, desperate that the next chapter page will reveal the truth he needs.\n\nBlood and gore are so downplayed in Alan Wake as to be next to nonexistent. There are no chainsaw wielding psychopaths or bloodthirsty monsters—just the creeping darkness, and the unsettling things it does to the citizens of Bright Falls. People go missing in the woods and nobody sees this as unusual; later, when you’re lost in the woods, these missing people come after you, shrouded in oily shadows and out to gut you with whatever bladed implement they have handy.\n\nAlan is a writer, not a warrior, but he has his trusty flashlight and an assortment of small arms to beat back the Taken, as the infected townspeople are called. First you must aim Alan’s light at an enemy and boost its output to burn away the darkness, and then finish off the Taken with a few shots from your pistol or shotgun. It might sound repetitive but with multiple Taken emerging from the shadows and your flashlight dwindling, it can get pretty hectic as you juggle reloading your tiny snub-nose and popping fresh batteries into your light, all while running away from and dodging attacks. Later on you can get better lights and weapons, including flares to give you breathing room and flash bang grenades to clear an area, but ammo is usually scarce and you must balance exploration with your limited reserves.\n\nEverything in the PC version is essentially the same as the Xbox 360 version. Alan Wake is one of the best converted, least buggy PC ports I have played in a long time. The quirky characters and stark daylight sequences might temporarily pull you out of the terror, but the memories of wandering around in the woods, hounded by eldritch shadows, will haunt your nightmares for months to come.","February 16","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sideways1234/recommended/108710/","sideways1234","Sideways","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sideways1234/","489 products in account","Note: This game is polarizing and I will give my best ability to not give an unbiased review.\n\nWhat this game does right is captivating the audience into playing more. The game is set in an episodic story arc, weird for a video game, but Alan Wake pulls it off. It is not like The Walking Dead Episodic series, but instead each chapter is broken into the episodic format. At the beginning of each episode (excluding episode one) is a recap of the previous episode. If you are like me and you continue to play through the game, then the recap is not really needed, but it does keep the tone of the game. At times these recaps are helpful when it comes to remembering the plot or just returning back to the game. At the end of each episode, the credits roll and a song is playing. Once you skip or let the credits roll, the game will send you to the next episode.\n\nThe story overall is fantastic and the game’s writers knew what they wanted for the game. These writers are famous for writing the first two Max Payne games, so the majority of the story is told through Alan Wake, the protagonist, as the narrator. The story is about Alan Wake, a successful writer who suffers from writer’s block. He and his wife, Alice, go to Bright Falls, where they vacation to clear Alan’s mind. Then in their stay, Alice is pulled into the darkness and it is up to Alan to save her. Along the way Alan discovers manuscripts of his work in progress, Departure which tells a chilling story of events, and Alan realizes that whatever is on these pages will happen in the real world. This short summary of what is to come in Alan Wake.\n\nThe gameplay is a story of its own. The basic mechanics of Alan Wake are to get from point A to point B with enemies and puzzles to get in the way. Fighting enemies in this game are not in the traditional sense. The theme of Alan Wake is Darkness, and the ironically named Bright Falls is being taken over by the Darkness. The Darkness consumes people and Alan Wake has to shine light from his flashlight on his enemies to clear the Darkness from them before he can shoot and kill them. Not only does Alan Wake fight, but he has a dodging mechanic to where he ducks and weaves from his enemies that either attack or throw tools at him. This feature, like Max Payne’s shoot dodge, is used a lot to avoid enemies.\n\nNow what this game does poorly is its character expression during cut scenes. The character development is awesome and the models are great, but when the characters speak, their lips and face are awkward enough to question the games programming, but it is not so bad that it takes away from the experience of the game. Another complaint is the PC port has a couple of glitches when I played, but Remedy remedied that (lol). Also the gameplay to a certain degree is a bit tedious. The running from point A to point B while doing rendered the same actions over and over is a little bit redundant at times, but there is enough variety in between these segments to make it not boring. Ultimately, the story is what saved Alan Wake from being a generic third person game to being a great experience overall. The story is what keeps you playing; the story is what makes you care for the characters; the story is what drives the gameplay home. You cannot go wrong with purchasing this game.\n\n\n\nScale:\nStory 10/10\n*Writing, Pacing, and Voice acting\nGameplay: 8/10\n*Fun, but redundant to a point\nGraphics 9/10\n*Fantastic landscapes and models, but glitches in talking and walking.\nReplay value: 8/10\n*Great, like watching a movie, and there are collectables.\nEffort: 9/10\n*The Designers took 5 years to make this, but the glitches is what makes it a 9.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nOverall: 9\n*Rating Scale is based on the average of the 5 main categories and round to the nearest number.\nThank You for reading first effortful review.

First I was recommended to try this game, and read many positive reviews so I thought this ought to be a good game. The first hour of playing I was thinking to myself, how on earth everybody loves this game so much. It was super linear, cinematics were not that convincing, voice acting was not superior, blocky geometry etc. The beginning was a bit of a let down for me. But man this game gets going like a virtual twin peaks once you perservere with it. I think my initial expectations were different since I had followed this game somewhat during it's development around 2006-2007 and back then it was supposed to be an open world game. But once this game gets going the linearity is a non issue for me anymore. On the contrary it's almost mandatory to keep the pacing of the game and it's story tight. Story and locations are very Twin Peaks like. This game will not be easy to understand because it was supposed to continue, so you have unanswered questions left. But so was twin peaks also, a lot of weird stuff just remained weird and that contributed to it's bizarre atmosphere that really was it's selling points.\n\nIf you like bizarre suspenceful games, this should do it for you. It is a well made game. Even it does show signs of aging but gracefully so. Oh, and the voice acting that was a bit of a let down in the beginning for me, does improve and reaches a point where the story is told believably and fluently. I kind of wish Remedy would return to this and finish it off open world style one day. Great game even with it's change of direction and style from it's beginnings. And boy does this game have tons of surprises for a Remedy gaming fan..","March 30","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Forced to write by a dark presense, he must fight to save his wife who has been abducted by said presence.\nFirst off, let me say the story in this game is convoluted, hard to follow, wierd, odd, senseless at times, off the wall bonkers, and ultimately pretty interesting. The writing is uneven, but mostly pretty good. This game startled me quite a few times.\nYour ever present flashlight is your frontline defense against the dark polluted "Taken", your revolver is the next. Mostly this works pretty well, but honestly, I thought the controls were a little clunky at times. It controls exactly like Max Payne 1, which isn't strange considering its the same studio that made Max Payne. The only thing is Max Payne is 13 years old at this point. Control schemes have evolved.\nGraphically, I actually liked it quite a bit. The lighting is cool.\n\nI am not a great writer, obviously, but maybe this review helps somebody.

Nowadays its really hard to find game with good characters, solid storyline (without big holes in narrating), and unique combat system. Alan Wake got all this qualities. Probably combat system is the main feature of Alan Wake. Using flashlight on enemies and only after that shoot them makes this game real survival horror (specially when you are against few enemies). Variety of light weapon is impressing. Alan got different models of flashlights, flash grenades, flyers and etc. but at the same time only one revolver and and couple hunt rifles (proly i might forgot something  ᘳ º  ͜ʖ º ᘰ ). Thing that you dont have advanced military guns (like M4s or AKs) is also a great plus for survival horror game. The second best part of this game is a storyline. Hands down, Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi made a great job to create tension plot with cool and unique characters and well-written dialogues between them. Also pages that you can find all over the game explain big part of the plot and make dark'n'evil atmosphere. This game really held me till its end and truly recommend to everybody who did not try this game still. Regrettably this game was a victim of weird Microsoft policy. It was Xbox 360 exclusive for 2 years. In 2012 it finally came out on PC and developers were really impressed by the sales. Despite that whole sales numbers were low... That's one of the reasons why now we see Quantum break and not Allan Wake 2. P.S. After Alan Wake i have no doubts that Sam Lake is one my favourite writers in game industry.  P.P.S. Looking forward to Quantum Break. P.P.P.S. If you just like me are Shinji Mikami fan and you love Resident Evil series and Evil Within you must buy Alan Wake! └[◔.◔]┘","March 20","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/recommended/108710/","thecoolstarsabove","Petra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/","210 products in account","What is Alan Wake? Summed up: Luigi's Mansion meets Twin Peaks meets Deadly Premonition and with a small serving of early '90s slasher/action flick on the side.\n\nFor some of the flaws and missteps it takes, Alan Wake is an enjoyable experience, especially for those with a penchant for creative writing. The titular character, Alan, acts as an avatar of sorts for writers and players and for those inclined, both. He takes a vacation in the sleepy town of Bright Falls, located somewhere in the state of Washington. It is here he finds out - rather harshly - that there are dark forces at work, and with it, unveiling a mystery that engulfs the town.\n\nDon't be fooled, however; this is not a traditional horror game. It has more in common with action-adventure games such as Uncharted and Alone in the Dark 2 than it does with more cerebral games like Silent Hill and Sanitarium. The game plays with a behind the shoulder perspective and your crosshair, so to speak, is provided by a flashlight. Even so, the game controls rather well and Alan's movements and responsive and crisp. There are a few parts where the rather solid movement can make jumping from one platform to the next a little cumbersome, but those are a minor gripe. As for the graphics, they do the job. Often times, you can notice artifacts or little quirks, such as questionable facial animations, but if Fallout 4 can get a free pass for that, so can Alan Wake.\n\nThe game's biggest flaw (outside of icy driving controls) is the fact that you cannot explore the town of Bright Falls, as the game is incredibly linear in its direction. You cannot hang out at a local joint like you can in Deadly Premonition or talk to random strangers and get a feel for the town. The reason why I note this is that the characters and dialogue, and by extension writing, are all quite wonderful. All the characters are vibrants with their quirks and personalities. A no-nonsense sheriff, a trigger-happy agent, a disturbingly unfettered doctor, they all stand out vividly. The gameplay itself is nothing to write home about, but it keeps you on your toes and some might find it repetitive at times. But the scenery and massive levels are more than enough to keep you engaged.\n\n[On that note, getting the game with the DLC is highly recommended. You get two full-length episodes (~2 hours of gameplay) that continue the story straight from the ending. They are quite fantastic and switch up the formula nicely.]\n\nOh, and the soundtrack? ♥♥♥♥ing incredible.\n\nConclusion: Get the game when it's on sale, you won't regret it.\n\n8/10.","May 15","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I purchased it for my son and a friend while it was on sale.  Graphics amazing - Gameplay is very user friendly but makes you think a little - Creepy Intense when you really follow the story and immerse yourself in the game.

And, it´s the first Horrorgame i ever played where the Story is more than: kill all the zombies by shooting tons of ammo into them. After a while, the world becomes boring, because the most time you play in a forest. But there are some really cool areas like the hospital for artists, a silver mine and more.\n\nThe Story can be sometimes distracting, because you won´t get within the first two hours if it´s a dream or reality. Or if you are under shock and imagine all this (i´m in act 4 and i still don´t know this).\n\nThe fighting system is innovative and just...perfect. Instead of shooting everything you have in Zombies, you have to get rid of the part of the darkness, which is protecting them and then to shoot them. The Handflares and Flashbangs are a very good tool to get out of conflicts with 4 or more enemys. And they are really needed, they are not something that makes you life easier, it´s essential.\n\nThe enemys are very cool too. There are 4 basic types of them: the normal ones, the big ones, the ones with the special abilitys and the Bossfights (they are so freaking epic, it´s worth to buy the game just for the bossfights).\n\n\nIt´s worth it´s money, and while the summer sale it´s a must-have. Or you can buy it in a keyshop (buying keys there is 100% legal, just selling them not (at least in Germany, i don´t know how it´s in Asia, USA etc.) for just 5€).\n\nAND NOW GO AND BUY THIS GAME!!!","June 19, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There are other games out there that are visually just as realistic, but they require a much more powerful hardware to run the game.\n+ Beautiful rich environment. The creators have put a lot of effort in making the scenery look true to life.\n+ The atmosphere is like out of a Stephen King movie. The environment is gloomy, dreadful, with hints of gothic.\n+ The setting might resemble Silent Hill. As the lake takes on darker and darker dimensions you get suggestions to Lovecraftian cosmic horror.\n+ Enemies are dreadful.\n+ The narrator's approach makes it easy to go into the character.\n+ Memorable and interesting npc's.\n+ Original approach to fighting (flashlight, light overall).\n+ Best map markers I've seen. It's as if there's an invisible dotted line all along your path. You never get lost.\n\nCons:\n\n- Movement, though not bad, could have been even better. Especially jumpting from object to object took unnecsessary effort\nand precision.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's one of the most dreaded games I've played and a remarkable stepping stone in contemporary horror. The enemies seemed very scary in their simplicity and the battles turned out to be a real challenge.

Remedy really nailed it with this one, I mean, four years later, the mountains, trees, grass, clothing, all of it looks outstanding with the texturing. The only objects that are outstandishly low res are books and readable stuff, like newspapers, which is ironic to me considering who the protagonist is, a writer.\n\nAnyway, the game boasts a wild premise, Alan Wake, a bestselling author is on vacation with his wife in the gorgeous Pacific north-west. They rent a cabin on a lake in a mysterious town, Bright Falls, and, essentially, a dark essense exists that wishes to exploit Alan Wake. So when Alan isn't looking, his wife falls into the lake by unusual circumstances. Despite Alan's efforts of jumping to help her, the next thing he remembers is waking up a week later in a car wreck. This is where the game gets interesting.\n\nAlan ends up learning how to fight the darkness, also known as the taken. Using flashlights, revolvers, pump shotguns, and hunting rifles. And the gunplay has Remedy written all over it, very cinematic and stylish with diving and avoiding axe and chainsaw, weilding taken. They're frightening, because some of them happen to be people you'd met earlier and disappeared under strange circumstances.\n\nSam Lake, the head writer at Remedy, deserves all the credit for the direction which is gorgeous, cinematic and well edited. Plus, once you meet more characters, the more interesting the game gets. Without spoiling anything, just prepare for the Eye of Mordor.\n\n10/10","September 26, 2013","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a dark, eerie setting that predominantly takes place in a forest surrounding Cauldron Lake where you come across an evil force known as the Taken. This evil can possess both human beings and inanimate objects in a bid to put Alan to sleep, for good. Thankfully, one of Alan's weapons is a torch light, which literally burns the darkness layer protecting the possessed. Once this layer is burned, then it's weapons free till the assailant fades to nothing.\n\nThe AI is very good. They'll come at you in numbers, throw weapons at you, spread out and try to flank you and even call in the heavies that can take twice [if not more] the damage. You can try dodging their attacks or run away, though you will not get far at all - they will catch you and hurt you plenty. SO! That leaves you with an offensive defense option - FIGHT. Other than your torch, you have an arsenal of weapons such as a revolver, shotgun and hunting rifle as well as tactical equipment such as flares and flash bangs. Not to mention the flare gun. Choose however you want to attack. Ammo is readily available [I played Normal game mode]. There are no med packs and your health bar renegrates slowly. So if you're not careful with your six, you could be in trouble. Finally, you have some safe havens, such as a lit lamp post to catch your breath.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. The setting is beautiful. The lighting is very good, though can hurt the eye so you may need to turn that brightness down or play in a well lit room. Although, I would highly recommend playing in the dark with the headphones on. Huge emphasis on the story and is an interesting story. Definitely has that Japanese horror feel to it. It did feel as though the developers dragged on a bit with the gameplay to prolong the game, but I think the story covered it well.

Nothing else. If you try to make sense of all this, then you are certainly a brave one.\n\nThe story, really well written I must say, is heavily inspired by Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft and such. It does not have the crude horror of Stephen King, but it has the darkness. It does not have the overworldly presence of the Lovecraftian stories, but it has the unexplainable, the evil. Story driven to the core, Alan Wake will make you think twice before going in the dark (even if there isn't a single moment of true horror in my opinion). It's not about the horror really, it's about the darkness.

You are Alan Wake a best selling thriller novelist trapped in a horror story he wrote which has to come to life and has taken his wife. The game is heavily inspired by thriller which draws concepts from the T.V show Twin Peaks and draws inspiration from the works of Stephen King!\n\nAs Alan Wake you must battle through the night to fight the Taken, a darkness that takes over living things and brings life to inanimate objects while trying to find yourself and your wife, which the darkness has taken. Gameplay is in third person and the primary weapon used in the game is light (Flashlight, Flares, flareguns, environmental lighting, flashbangs) as well as guns.  Fighting through lush green national parks and into the town of Bright Falls, Washington the atmosphere psychologically engulfs you, waking up from this nightmare is not an option!\n\nPros:\n-The use of light as a weapon\n-A great story, short but sweet will really leave you with a "Wow, amazing!"\n-The atmosphere although intense is also distrubing and horrifying\n-Narration really makes it easy to understand whats really going on.\n-Truly is a great looking game, feels like you're really in a national park XD\n-Highly replayabe, played through about 4 times\n-Combat mechanics make you feel like your are constantly in danger\n-Stephen king, Stephen king, Stephen king, Stephen king!\n\nCons:\n-Weak ending\n-The game was a little short but there are DLC as well as American Nightmare.\n-Facial animations could've been done better\n-The recaps at the end of each chapter aren't necessary, it does feel like its trying to be a T.V show\n\nBut all in all a solid and rich game full of awesome, 10 foxes out 10 foxes, put de lime in de coconut!","August 31, 2014","true","34.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Star of the video game with the same title. You're about to enter the world of my imagination. You are entering the Dark Place."\n\nThere's no avoiding it: this game wears its influences on its sleeve from the very beginning. If you're aware of the works of Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick, this game *revels* in their tropes, and insights, and atmosphere. Alan is a big-shot author with writers' block, and so of course he ventures off with his wife to the mountain town of Bright Falls to relax and unwind; and, of course, his latest project starts becoming too real.\n\nAlthough the meat of the gameplay is a simple third-person action game, where you travel from puzzle to puzzle while managing crowds of monsters, with a story you can follow from a mile away - the narration by Alan, and the isolation of the mountain-town setting, and the Dark Presence that turns ordinary surroundings into something strange and malevolent, means the gameplay is pushed forward by the narrative. Like EA's Dead Space, if you charge through Alan Wake slaughtering monsters indiscriminately and skipping cutscenes, you're missing the glue that binds the game together.\n\nWhat I really liked - and what not many other games do, come to think of it - was how Alan Wake is separated into six individual 'episodes' (and two bonus features), each with their own sub-plot within an overarching plot. Each begins with a recap of the previous episode's events and ends with a credits song, so again you're encouraged to soak in the game's atmosphere and let events sink in, rather than marathoning through.\n\nI found the 'light' gameplay mechanic interesting, too. Enemies are invulnerable until you banish their darkness with a light source, so in encounters you'll be dodging attacks until you can get a clear shot at them. Alan's healed not with med-kits, but by finding a strong light source - so 'following the light' is both a gameplay pointer and a viable strategy on higher difficulties, or if you're overwhelmed and out of ammo.\n\nAlan Wake embraces its influences without delving into self-parody, and is a perfectly competent action game to boot. I'd definitely recommend if you're a fan of Western existential horror, or feel like something spooky and interesting to play.","June 11, 2014","true","14.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play through a story-come-to-life that Alan himself wrote. The actual gameplay is supposed to be leaning towards the horror genre but you have a gun so all fear is lost. The key mechanic is that the enemies you face are shadow people and in order to kill them you first have to break their "shields" by shining your flashlight at them. From a gameplay perspective, Alan Wake is pretty straight forward but competent. The real meat of the game, however, is the intense narrative driving the campaign forward.\n\nPersonally this is one of those games I put on easy mode and immerse myself in the underlying plot, and from my time so far I really enjoy it.","August 4, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play through a story-come-to-life that Alan himself wrote. The actual gameplay is supposed to be leaning towards the horror genre but you have a gun so all fear is lost. The key mechanic is that the enemies you face are shadow people and in order to kill them you first have to break their "shields" by shining your flashlight at them. From a gameplay perspective, Alan Wake is pretty straight forward but competent. The real meat of the game, however, is the intense narrative driving the campaign forward.\n\nPersonally this is one of those games I put on easy mode and immerse myself in the underlying plot, and from my time so far I really enjoy it.","August 4, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Each episode takes around two hors to complete, and there's six episodes (plus two more via DLC).

Nice story with twists here and there, and keep me wanting to see more till the end. However, I personally think that it shouldn't end where it is, just a little bit further would be nice !\n\n::: Visual and FX :::\nThe game looks nice indeed, you can play as vanilla or enhance it with tool of your choice, sweetfx for example. One thing to look for is that the game use a lot of light FX, i mean, tons of them. (as the game concept is based around the light and the dark) If you have problem with dynamic lighting fx, feeling dizzy from looking at them, you might not enjoy the game much.\n\n::: Gameplay :::\nThe overall gameplay is okay, the unique combat system, light the darkness then blow it away, is fresh enough to be enjoyable. however, I was expecting that it would be more of the adventure, but instead, it is more action-oriented game. I don't mean that it is bad, but the game will throw enemies at you along your journey to the level that it losts its charm as mystery-themed game.\n\nMost encounters give you choices, to fight or to run. You can blast everything in your path with whatever at your disposal (tools, weapons, or even world's interactive objects), or avoid the encounter (if it isn't forced you to fight in the story), you can perform a timed-dodge, or even knock enemies off balance to get away from harms. The game utilized checkpoint system, when you reach it, the pursuers will be disappeared, and believe me, you will strive to get to it than stay and fight (especially in nightmare difficulty on your 2nd playthrough).\n\nEncounters are well-designed, though they lack of visual variations (you will see them again and again). Almost all of them can be staggered, which will give you some breathing room for whatever reason. They will surprise you from time to time (on your first playthrough).\n\nYour first playthrough will be a good experience, but on your 2nd or 3rd one on Nightmare difficulty, which you will be forced to play if you are intended to 100% the game, will become quite a task to finish, if you are the go-loud type. The achievements can be annoying (collect 100 of easily missed bottles), refering to the guide can help, a lot. It is fortunate that the game is in episodes, and can be replayed later.\n\nThe control is responsive and is good enough to allow you to face multiple enemies at once without too much troubles, although sometimes it is too fast XD.\n\n::: Overall :::\nThe game is good. The designs match the concepts, however, they seems to think that more actions are better for this kind of games, but really, they are too much. It play nicely from the beginning to the end. I recommend this for a single playthough, as it lacks of dynamic elements, making the game predictable. 2nd or 3rd playthough will be more like archievement runs.","February 21, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So to find a video game that looks at the perils and pitfalls of writing, albeit ensconced in a horror game, I decided to give it a shot. Ironically enough, I had read a novelization of Alan Wake long before I even got Steam. But how would experiencing the game go?\n\nBright Falls, an isolated town somewhere in Washington State. It seems like the perfect getaway for accomplished writer Alan Wake, who is trying to get away from his increasingly turbulent lifestyle, and have a quiet holiday with his wife Alice at a cabin. But after an argument, Alice disappears, and after trying to save her from a lake, Alan wakes up, to find that a week has passed, a week he has no memory of, and that people are being turned into beings wreathed in darkness, the Taken. What really happened to Alice? What does it have to do with obscure writer Thomas Zane? And is Alan imagining these events, or are they part of a darker plot to turn his writings into reality? With few people to trust, Alan must deal with sceptical authorities and ancient entities in order to save Alice…\n\nOne thing that I definitely enjoyed in Alan Wake more than anything else was the story. Even after reading the novelization, it felt like I came to it fresh and new. In fact, the TV-like ‘episodic’ format actually helps with the atmosphere, given that Twin Peaks was an influence. Of course, one of the biggest influences (and frequently acknowledged) is that of Stephen King. I’m reminded of Bag of Bones in particular. The atmosphere of the game is not unlike a more action-oriented version of Silent Hill, albeit with not as much psychological unease.\n\nGraphics are one of the complaints I do have about the game. Not because they are bad: for the most part, they’re pretty damned good. But on my computer, low frame-rate, especially during some of the more intense combat systems, plagues the game regularly, and I was lucky to be able to defeat some enemies partly because of that frustrating frame rate. This suggests that using standard onboard chips for this game isn’t a good idea, even with the graphics at a low setting. Get a graphics card if you don’t want the frustrating frame-rate. However, the graphics themselves, as I mentioned, are beautiful, my only big complaint being the design and animation of Dr Hartman. For a character who is meant to be a smug and manipulative git, his facial expressions frequently make him look like he’s taken too many happy pills, and whatever threat he has as an antagonist is lessened significantly.\n\nSound-wise, I enjoyed the voice acting fairly well. It does well for what this game is, and the voice processing for the Taken is actually quite eerie and frightening, even if it does sound at times like a Cyberman’s voice from Doctor Who. Music, well, there’s plenty of good pieces, and there’s some interesting selections for the end credits for each episode. But I think the musical sting used whenever a Taken is within attacking range gets old real quick, and that it wouldn’t have hurt to have multiple stings to vary it somewhat.\n\nGameplay-wise, it seems to be the usual bit of action-shooter gameplay that horror games tend to be about nowadays. The combination of using a flashlight to render the Taken vulnerable and then shooting them is a novel one, but does wear a little, though using a flaregun and flashbangs as deadly weapons against the light-fearing creatures is enjoyable. But the camera controls for the mouse are too sensitive, even with the sensitivity turned down. The collectables do make it worthwhile, including reading manuscript pages that add to the backstory of the game, watching short episodes of a Twilight Zone-like TV show, and listening to radio shows that give some background.\n\nOverall, Alan Wake is a pretty damn good game, hampered only by its incompatibility with some machines, and a number of other small flaws. Fans of Stephen King, David Lynch, or Silent Hill should give it a whirl.\n\nRATING: ****","May 19, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottytaylor/recommended/108710/","scottytaylor","ScottyTaylor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottytaylor/","322 products in account","I am not a fan of horror, but this game scratches an itch very few games do. It scratches a certain itch that usually comes with very well done psychological thriller movies, but it's stronger than that because of the nature of how games work. Being directly involved with the story of Alan Wake really creates a tension unlike any other. The way it uses suspense to create this tension is great, and while there are a few jumpscares in this game, that is not where the horror comes from. You'll find your heart rate beating at the times when you are alone, walking through a forest trail as the fog starts to creep in, politely letting you know that you are no longer safe.\n\nThe story is also fantastic and the way it pans out at the end will keep you thinking about it for weeks, maybe even years. I originally played this game when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and ever since then I think about this game regularly and recommend it at any chance I get, like now. And after a good few years without playing it I felt the need to go back an experience this once again to truly see if it holds up well now as it does in my memory. It definitely holds up, that is except the facial animations in the cutscenes. Those haven't aged too well, especially with the pixelated, low resolution that they are on. However, what truly makes this game special, the atmosphere, the story, the sense of a journey, and just the general horror of it all... Those have definitely held up. And other than P.T. on the PS4 Store (which uses atmosphere in a similar way, although P.T. is more jumpscare centred than AW), nothing has even came close to replicating this kind of horror game since, which is a shame because I really like this kind of horror, even though I'm not a fan of the overall genre across all mediums, I really hope Alan Wake gets a true sequel some day or at the very least a very good spiritual successor done in the same vein as this game.","April 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Alan Wake is an outstanding game that mixes elements of psychological horror, thriller and and dark fantasy. Bright Falls are a perfect setting for the story of a dark, somewhat magical, entity going after the protagonist. It also features a lot of meta-elements (like the manuscript pages the protagonist finds scattered throughout the game, which give us insight into the plot and, in some cases, the events that are about to occur or which we do not see on-screen).\n\nAs for the gaming aspect: although some might find the combat monotonous, I personally always get the cold shiver each time Alan steps into a secluded part of the forest that's bound to hide malavolent lurkers. The limited amunnition and the character's poor stamina add an extra spice to the gameplay, but the developers made sure that you are able to get to the next chekpoint even with no bullets left in the barrel (alhough it's much harder). The fights are not quite scary nor horror, as the game even hints that there are enemies inbound, but is definitely adrenaline packed and fun.\n\nThe story is well-crafted, and the narration helps bring it to life. The entire plot is a huge nod to Stephen King and a myriad of other contemporary horror writers. There are a lot of references to "The Shining," "The Twilight Zone" "The Birds," "Poltergeist" and "Lost" scattered throughout the game. The dialogues are neither superficial nor superflous, and I used to spen an extra minute or two to hear out some of the characters (who sometimes provided a crutial hint for the later story development). The division into episodes, the different songs at the end of each stage and the "Previously on Alan Wake" cutscenes help make Alan Wake feel like a TV show you don't want to miss at any cost, so you keep coming back for more.\nTo conclude, I beleive that this game is definitely worth both your time and your money. It's fun and has a lot of replay value, especially when you have the commentary feature that comes with the collectors edition.

So to find a video game that looks at the perils and pitfalls of writing, albeit ensconced in a horror game, I decided to give it a shot. Ironically enough, I had read a novelization of Alan Wake long before I even got Steam. But how would experiencing the game go?\n\nBright Falls, an isolated town somewhere in Washington State. It seems like the perfect getaway for accomplished writer Alan Wake, who is trying to get away from his increasingly turbulent lifestyle, and have a quiet holiday with his wife Alice at a cabin. But after an argument, Alice disappears, and after trying to save her from a lake, Alan wakes up, to find that a week has passed, a week he has no memory of, and that people are being turned into beings wreathed in darkness, the Taken. What really happened to Alice? What does it have to do with obscure writer Thomas Zane? And is Alan imagining these events, or are they part of a darker plot to turn his writings into reality? With few people to trust, Alan must deal with sceptical authorities and ancient entities in order to save Alice…\n\nOne thing that I definitely enjoyed in Alan Wake more than anything else was the story. Even after reading the novelization, it felt like I came to it fresh and new. In fact, the TV-like ‘episodic’ format actually helps with the atmosphere, given that Twin Peaks was an influence. Of course, one of the biggest influences (and frequently acknowledged) is that of Stephen King. I’m reminded of Bag of Bones in particular. The atmosphere of the game is not unlike a more action-oriented version of Silent Hill, albeit with not as much psychological unease.\n\nGraphics are one of the complaints I do have about the game. Not because they are bad: for the most part, they’re pretty damned good. But on my computer, low frame-rate, especially during some of the more intense combat systems, plagues the game regularly, and I was lucky to be able to defeat some enemies partly because of that frustrating frame rate. This suggests that using standard onboard chips for this game isn’t a good idea, even with the graphics at a low setting. Get a graphics card if you don’t want the frustrating frame-rate. However, the graphics themselves, as I mentioned, are beautiful, my only big complaint being the design and animation of Dr Hartman. For a character who is meant to be a smug and manipulative git, his facial expressions frequently make him look like he’s taken too many happy pills, and whatever threat he has as an antagonist is lessened significantly.\n\nSound-wise, I enjoyed the voice acting fairly well. It does well for what this game is, and the voice processing for the Taken is actually quite eerie and frightening, even if it does sound at times like a Cyberman’s voice from Doctor Who. Music, well, there’s plenty of good pieces, and there’s some interesting selections for the end credits for each episode. But I think the musical sting used whenever a Taken is within attacking range gets old real quick, and that it wouldn’t have hurt to have multiple stings to vary it somewhat.\n\nGameplay-wise, it seems to be the usual bit of action-shooter gameplay that horror games tend to be about nowadays. The combination of using a flashlight to render the Taken vulnerable and then shooting them is a novel one, but does wear a little, though using a flaregun and flashbangs as deadly weapons against the light-fearing creatures is enjoyable. But the camera controls for the mouse are too sensitive, even with the sensitivity turned down. The collectables do make it worthwhile, including reading manuscript pages that add to the backstory of the game, watching short episodes of a Twilight Zone-like TV show, and listening to radio shows that give some background.\n\nOverall, Alan Wake is a pretty damn good game, hampered only by its incompatibility with some machines, and a number of other small flaws. Fans of Stephen King, David Lynch, or Silent Hill should give it a whirl.\n\nRATING: ****","May 19, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottytaylor/recommended/108710/","scottytaylor","ScottyTaylor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scottytaylor/","322 products in account","I am not a fan of horror, but this game scratches an itch very few games do. It scratches a certain itch that usually comes with very well done psychological thriller movies, but it's stronger than that because of the nature of how games work. Being directly involved with the story of Alan Wake really creates a tension unlike any other. The way it uses suspense to create this tension is great, and while there are a few jumpscares in this game, that is not where the horror comes from. You'll find your heart rate beating at the times when you are alone, walking through a forest trail as the fog starts to creep in, politely letting you know that you are no longer safe.\n\nThe story is also fantastic and the way it pans out at the end will keep you thinking about it for weeks, maybe even years. I originally played this game when it first came out on the Xbox 360, and ever since then I think about this game regularly and recommend it at any chance I get, like now. And after a good few years without playing it I felt the need to go back an experience this once again to truly see if it holds up well now as it does in my memory. It definitely holds up, that is except the facial animations in the cutscenes. Those haven't aged too well, especially with the pixelated, low resolution that they are on. However, what truly makes this game special, the atmosphere, the story, the sense of a journey, and just the general horror of it all... Those have definitely held up. And other than P.T. on the PS4 Store (which uses atmosphere in a similar way, although P.T. is more jumpscare centred than AW), nothing has even came close to replicating this kind of horror game since, which is a shame because I really like this kind of horror, even though I'm not a fan of the overall genre across all mediums, I really hope Alan Wake gets a true sequel some day or at the very least a very good spiritual successor done in the same vein as this game.","April 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Personally I recommend that you play on easy, because if there is one downside to the game, it's that the combat system wears you down after the whole experience. There's also a difficulty spike right at the mine, but it's not too bad. The game isn't scary, but does have a light v. dark sort of theme.\nIt's also kid-friendly, for the most part.\n\nAlan Wake's story reminds me of a Steven King novel (Wake himself makes the comparison). A writer comes to an old small-town cabin to get away from the fame and fortune. He runs into some issues, and his wife (who fears the dark) is captured by some darkness-something-or-another. It's pretty cool and non-complex, but mysterious enough to remain intriguing.\nThe entire game is narrated by Alan Wake, in the form of a novel, while you traverse the dark countryside.\n\nCombat is simple. Fight the nightmare-men by getting rid of their (as I call them) "darkness shields" then shooting them. Their darkness shields are shown by a circle of lense flare when you aim your flashlight at them. Shoot them with either the revolver or shotgun to kill them. Alternatively, flare guns do both simultaneously. Flares and flashbangs clear crowds.\nFight men from your dreams (and people you have met) through a story with cool bits of radio and TV clips.\n\nThe story is good, but unfortunately to prevent the game from being a 5 hour experience, there's a lot of repetitive combat.

It's an impressive game, but this is going to be a very critical review. I find people get more out of a review if it states somethings faults rather than its values, so that is what I will do here.\n\nIn this game you play as Alan Wake, an acclaimed but troubled writer who hasn't written a word in years, who is brought to the remote town of Bright Falls by his wife in the hope that he can find some inspiration for writing. This all goes disastrously wrong and results in Alan trying to save his wife from a dark evil presence. (hoorah)\n\nThe story is clearly the winning point of the game, I mean it's kinda hard to avoid when your main character is a writer. Theres little bumps and bits that spark a lot of questions along the way, but it's always interesting enough to keep your fullest attention and wanting to find out whats next.\n\nThe problem with this game is the lack of balance between the excitement of the story compared with the gameplay. The majority of the game pans out like this-\n1. Oh look its a really cool story, I want to know more\n2. Oh dear...looks like I have to walk around a forest for an hour shooting things until I'm given the next part of the story.\n3. Wash rinse repeat\n\nI would have no problem with this method, a lot of games do it well. But this game just butchers it.\nThe gameplay consists of shining a light at enemies, and shooting them. It's an interesting concept, but becomes boring after a while, and by the time midgame comes you're only shooting things to find out what happens next. It becomes a chore, and just no fun. It's as if a writer who knew nothing about videogames wanted to make a videogame, that's the kind of vibe I get from this.\n\nAnother note I have to make about this game is the difficulty. When you load the game, you're given the options of easy, normal and nightmare. Wanting to play the game as it should be, I play on normal for two playthroughs. I didn't find it difficult, I found it frustrating. Deaths were always unfair, you were punished for exploring, and in the early game ammo was often non existent in certain areas of a level. Combine this with the fact that this is a story driven game, it doesn't pile up to much fun. After my troubles, I looked online to see if others had similar problems as me and I came across something that triggered a facepalm.\nThe difficulty levels on consoles and pc are labeled differently. On the console, the difficulties are labeled normal, hard, and nightmare, where as on the pc they are labeled easy, normal, and nightmare respectively. Keep in mind that they are the same difficulty, simply labeled different. This means that when I was playing what I thought was normal mode, it was actually set to hard. I even got the "complete in hard mode" achievement on steam. Whether this was deliberate or a mistake, either way it should be made more clear to anyone playing the game. Still, for a hard mode it wasn't fun, it was just frustrating. I'd hate to think what nightmare would be like.\n\nLike I said at the top of this review, this is a good game, but I was going to critical, and I have been. It runs amazing, it looks amazing, it has an amazing story, let down by less than amazing gameplay and truly faulty mechanics.\n\nThis game is constantly on sale for 90% off, that's 2.99 euros. When that time comes, buy it if you so wish. If not, leave it.","August 11, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This title had been one of my favorites for qiute some time! Even though the Steam Version's motion blur ruins the entire game, the Xbox 360 Version is way better! But the thing I really love about this game is it's story line. Each of the characters have unique personalities, and they all play an inportant role in Alan Wake.

Alan Wake has it all if you looking for a story game. The soundtrack on the game are a blast because they have all sort of music but it leans more on the rock/blues style and that is very awesome. As i said, great shooting mechanics, smooth gameplay. strong story, stunning graphics ans brutal soundtrack  makes Alan Wake a great experience, it's a very memorable game and there are some scenes that you just can't forget.","April 17, 2013","true","26.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You feel fragile, so it's tense, but the enemies aren't insurmountable either, so it's a very nice balance.\n\n+The atmosphere is amazing. -- As mentioned you actually feel like you are a character within some kind of horror book. I don't know how they did it, but it's spot on.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n-The game is a little too long to not add new elements or progression -- The game is long because the story is long, so that part isn't bad. It would have made the gameplay grow a little less stale towards the end if they had maybe incorporated some minor progression system or a couple extra weapons just to switch things up as you are tying it all together.\n\nAll in all, must check this game out, it's fantastic.","October 3, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've got to a point where, instead of being scared of the monsters, I was being annoyed by them. Combat every single minute. That's definitely the worst part of the game. On the good side, the setting is amazing (countryside) and the support characters are cool (I love you Barry).","October 10, 2015","true","19.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
