They're constantly getting trashed by the likes of IGN, and yet the games continue to get made, and their fanbase continues to grow. I don't know what it is, but there's just something about plowing through entire armies in the flashiest way possible.\n\nWarriors fans demand a few simple things from their games. Larger numbers of guys on screen, more characters to play as, and more creative movesets. And to that end, SW-II delivers perfectly. On top of that, the game introduces a tag in system where you can play as a second character in a completely different part of the battlefield. It's great for not only battlefield control, but for leveling up multiple characters.\n\n...That being said, SW-II, especially our PC port has a few shortcomings. Not necessarily deal breakers, but noteworthy shortcomings I hope get improved in the next game.\n\nWhile it's sort of awesome that we get to create our own characters, the feature is very limited. And with Chronicles mode from SW4 being taken out in SW4-II, I found myself not caring. In the original Samurai Warriors game, you had a campaign mode for your character where you got to pick which side you played, with future battles depending on said choices previously. If they're going to take the create a character route in the next game, I'd like to see something like this return. Otherwise, why bother?\n\nAh, the mighty gods SEIYUU. Mythical beings said to be able to bring fictional characters to life with the power of their holy voices, while making unworthy plebians quake in awe. Real talk: I've never understood their appeal, but forcing the game into SEIYUU mode makes it somewhat difficult to follow what's happening on the battlefield without contantly checking the subtitles-when our eyes should still be on the man-hacking....\n\nOK, so I know that the "Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆÂÑ™„Çå„Åü„Ç≥„É≥„ÇΩ„Éº„É´" is, and always will be KT's most comfortable platform, but christ almighty the frankenporting has got to stop. If the PS4 can handle a fully worked game, there's a good to fair chance some of our master race machines can handle the load. Hopefully KT will port us a proper current gen game. Hopefully.....\n\nFInally, let's talk DLC. Not only is it overpriced - as is the case with most KT games, most of it adds nothing of value to the core game. If KT were to release costumes from previous SW titles, I might have bitten(alot of the character designs in SW3 were far better than SW4). As it stands now, I don't care about any of what's on offer here.\n\n...But, like I said before: They're shortcomings, but not deal breakers. Gameplay wise, Samurai Warriors is probably KT's best title, matched only Warriors Orochi 3. Which is why despite said shortcomings, I'm still going to recommend a purchase.","October 2, 2015","true","33.4"," 56 of 71 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","56","71","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urikobb3/recommended/348470/","urikobb3","Neith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urikobb3/","90 products in account","Samurai Warriors, or Sengoku Musou as it's known in Japan is an established series of 'hack and slash' games by Koei which are based in the Sengoku era of Japan. If you've ever played a Dynasty Warriors game you know what to expect as the two are almost identical with the exception of the cast and the locations (DW is in China, SW is Japan). Both are by Koei Tecmo and seem to use very similar engines.\n\nThe game recreates a turbulent period of history in Japan now known as the Warring States period. Battles raged all over Japan to try and unify the land and Samurai Warriors 4-II lets you take part in many of the decisive battles, using many different factions.  Each mission has a primary objective (usually defeat an enemy commander or reach an escape point) with several other objectives that can happen during the mission. It can be frantic at times, especially when multiple objectives appear within a short space of time and some of them are timed meaning you have to act fast.\n\nThe maps are laid out well but do get a little repetitive (as many of the battles were fought in the same locations). Each character has a variety of different attacks effective against different kinds of enemies, as well as having a 'Rage' system (which makes you do more damage for a short period of time) and a character specific 'Musou' attack, which is effectively a super and should be very familiar to anyone who has played Dynasty Warriors.\n\nThe game is split into a few different modes: Story Mode (clear a few missions with specific characters as their story unfolds), Free Mode (use any character on any unlocked mission), Survival Mode (ascend an endless tower that gets progressively harder) and it also has a Dojo where you can do several things like create custom characters, listen to music tracks or even read the biographies of the real-life Sengoku era warriors. The only criticism I have of Story Mode is that only a handful of characters have a story mode that involves them to any real extent so some people might be disappointed that their favourite character isn't represented much.\n\nThere is also two-player functionality, both local and co-op online. I've tested the online with a friend on the other side of the world with both of us taking turns to host and it's been flawless. No connection issues and no noticable lag whatsoever. Brilliant fun to play with a friend online; I can't comment on the split-screen as I haven't tried it.\n\nUltimately the game has a very simple premise; kill hundreds (or thousands) of generic grunt enemies, bring down every warlord, daimyo or rebellion you come across and try to unify Japan under your banner, whoever's that may be. As mindless as it can be sometimes, it's still a very fun game and some missions do require you to do more than just mow everything down.\n\nI definitely recommend the game itself; the DLC however is ridiculously expensive for what it is. Unless you're desperate to see the female cast in nurse outfits, swimsuits and the like, wait until a sale to pick the DLC up. The game itself is still worth the purchase.","October 3, 2015","true","38.2"," 49 of 64 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","49","64","2","0"

Since I don't own a Wii/PS3/PS4 this is my only option to play the latest installment. It attracted me since we can now change the weapon into something you really want, much easier than it was in Samurai Warriors 2. Which means I can optimised the characters I enjoy using to the fullest.\n\nStoryline: 4/10\nEvery installment of Samurai Warriors, new characters are added and developed on the storyline. Being a 10th anniversary game, I hope that they added story mode for all characters. Didn't really bother me even if the older characters had PS2 graphics for their scenarios as I viewed it as a collector's item being the 1st Samurai Warriors game on PC. But they didn't. Story wise, I've predicted it weak as the characters featured didn't really play a major role in Sengoku era. I could accept that.\n\nCharacters: 5/10\nWhat I couldn't accept is how the new character personality turn out. Head of the Il clan, apologising to every living creature on the planet in every sentence of her dialogue? Descendant of the Uesugi speaking one liners while Kanetsugu does all the talking? An Afro hair girl in netty outfit fighting with a piece of cloth? A be-spectacled guy fighting using a shield emitting laser beams? If you could accept all that, then buy the game or like me avoid using them. KT is clearly running out of personalities to create for Samurais especially with close to 60 in the roster.\nThankfully KT have been kind to still place the older characters in, which are my favourite since Samurai Warriors 2 with superior movesets making the gameplay fun.\n\nDifficulty: 7/10\nThe game has 4 difficulty mode, Easy to Nightmare. Hard is like normal in previous games, while nightmare mode is a huge jump in difficulty. Unless you are using Hisahide with the only infinite combo in the game, I don't see how you can attempt nightmare mode at the start.\n\nCombat: 11/10 (means it exceeded my expectation)\nThe combat is a major improvement, loads of new moves, attacks chain better, hyper attacks to reduce monotony of killing 1000 soldiers. Instead of spamming same attacks there is now a counter/parry system to retaliate by pressing button shown on screen. Some of the new features are overpowered- a single move killing 5 generals at the cost of spirit gauge and 1 musou gauge.\n\nControls: 8/10\nThe horse control went down the drain, as calling it usually ends up with a horse running in zigzag refusing to pick you up unless you stand still or beside corners of a wall.\n\nBGM: 7/10\nFits the theme. However not my liking. The best BGM from Warriors game is in One Piece Pirate Warriors.\n\nOnline play: 6/10\nThe co-op is not stable at the moment this review is written, I could play with someone far from Asia but it crashes when I play with someone in Asia. Weird indeed.\n\nMost of the game hours I have was either from falling asleep due to hectic schedule or testing game mechanics for writting guides. I don't aim to 100% everything for the reason of new abyssmal characters. I do know it will take close to a 100hrs to collect most of the weapons and max every character to optimum. I am 3/4 thru, left the characters I loath using and perhaps time to put an end to the game.\n\nOverall it is a fun experience, a definite improvement in combat/ loot customization. Even though some say it looks like PS2 graphic, I still love it because it looks like a PS3 port to me. The DLC isn't worth collecting, not my type of weapons, the mounts aren't the strongest and the stages are just reskinned, inverted images of the storyline stages with no cutscene or dialogue. They are finally working harder to make their games gain more reception by targetting a different group of gamers.\n\nI would give it 7/10 overall. I don't rate a game by graphics since it is acceptable and low in my priority. Quite sick of nice looking games with boring gameplay like alot of recent HD console games Squeenix is making.","October 18, 2015","true","223.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

However there is one major issue: Most controllers including the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controller are messed up with the key binds. The game locks the camera rotation to the triggers instead of the right joystick and this cannot be changed. This royally gimps not only the camera, but the amount of actions you can have on your controller, further handicapping yourself. This game is a getting a negative review and possible a refund until this issue is fixed.\n\nEDIT: I figured I would update this since this blew up more than I expected.\nPS4 controllers don't have issues. I‚Äôm also assuming ps3 doesn't either (I can't confirm).  Xbox one controllers do have issues (I believe because it uses direct input instead of x input). The issue lies with the triggers being bound to the Z-axis.  I've seen issues on the forum for 360 controllers in my search for a solution. Some people say theirs works, while others say theirs don't. 3rd Party controllers have issues with this game. I'm not sure if all of the 360 controller issues are caused by people using third party or not. I am able to work around the Xbox 1 controller issue somewhat with xpadder. If you're binding your keys to their traditional locations your camera will spin as you call your horse and when you change your map setting.\n\nThis article explains the issues better than I can and also addresses any other concerns you might have.\nhttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Samurai_Warriors_4-II\n\nYou can always refund the game if you‚Äôre having issues, but I don't think they deserve your money for a bad port. The game uses PS3 texture models (instead of ps4), controller issues, and pc icons (they're more like weird symbols) instead of controller icons. Every time these symbols come up I get my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• kicked shortly after because I have no idea what I‚Äôm supposed to press or what the symbol even means.","December 19, 2015","false","48.9"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","43","63","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iriachan/recommended/348470/","iriachan","ChuuuIria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iriachan/","40 products in account","I prefer Samurai Warriors on PS2. Compared with other Warrior's titles today, SW4-II feels really dated. Most of the moves are imported from SW1 and despite some great innovations made for DW8's combat system, they weren't carried over.\n\nSW1 felt really immersive. Especially for me; for the most part it understood it was a period-piece and it was easy for a Japanese history-buff to feel like they were participating in the battles of the Sengoku Jidai. SW4-II feels more like an anime. The character designs are flamboyant, awkward and uninspired. The music, however, is really good and I've enjoyed this game's soundtrack long before it was released outside Japan. That said, even the music feels watered down compared to SW1.\n\nThis port is plagued with quite a few technical issues. I'm sure everyone's experience will vary, but...\n\nI had to run the game in windowed mode otherwise, the game would get jittery. There's tons of framerate issues, that I ironically fixed by setting all settings to high and turning of dynamic shadows (I think that's what it was called). The textures are taken from the PS3's versions and not the PS4's-- lame, but not exactly a deal breaker on its own. When I begin to add all these issues together, I'm shocked to see that this is the first time I'm not enjoying a Warriors game.\n\nI've played thousands of hours between DW1-DW8 and SW1. Sadly, I don't want to add another single hour into SW4-II.\n\nI actually still want to recommend this game. My issues (aside from the technical, which can be worked around) are mainly subjective and based on my tastes. However, because the port does feel sloppy, and I feel Koei didn't put much effort into this title (especially considering this is a remake) I won't.\n\nThis game is still pretty cool, but get it on sale. I paid $35 for it, but still think that's too expensive for this experience. I'd rate this game at $20 max. If you have a PS4, I'd also suggest buying that version over this.","December 1, 2015","false","11.2"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","37","59","0","0"

I love it, and it hate at the same time. I've been a cult follower of Tecmo Koei and W OMEGA FORCE and the Dynasty/Samurai Warriors franchises. Simply put, I love them. The pc ports have gotten better with every installment which is nice, and they do nicely here with the amount of graphics options you can change.\n\nProblem is on better systems when you turn the options all the way up, you get this film grain and lens flare with some saturation problems during cutscenes which really show the edges of the ps3 textures on the ps4 body textures. When using a controller, the keyboard button maps still show up instead of the controllers layout. I use a plug and play Xbox 360 controller. But thats not my main complaint of the game.\n\nThe writing with the Dynasty Warriors games have gotten better with each installment, though nothing will ever be able to beat Dynasty Warriors 5 in terms of narrative quality. As for the Samurai Warriors franchise, I feel like the writing just keeps getting worse. Not to mention this game was supposed to be more about character stories, yet in each game faction story its only about 2-3 characters and everyone else is left out and given the minor character treatment. Battles that were big in the series were narrated through with no chance of playing them, and each faction only had 5 battles to fight.\n\nEach faction story takes what it considers historically canon in one story and butchers it in the other, and most of the time it does it to try to illicite an emotional response from the player. There is no consistency across the game whatsoever and each faction starts at a different point in time which works and doesn't work at the same time. Some characters are introduced you can't even play once and they die, and the only way you can play them is through free mode which is crap. So don't give me this bullcrap about Warriors 4-ii being about character stories, its still very much about the factions. Maybe they should look back and view Dynasty Warriors 5 as an examble for character stories, because every character on that game had a story and it was well written. This felt like a drama more than a game and every chance they had, they wanted to try to make the player feel like crap... Which really isn't the issue, its the story itself. It could of been written a lot better.\n\nI know I should be emailing Koie or Omega Force about this, because they don't view Steam reviews, just thought I would make this aware to yall the buyers that the story is not the best of the series, or even close. I feel like Samurai Warriors 4 and its ii counterpart are the worst writing of the warriors series, with Chronicles being the best.\n\nThat being said, I don't recommend this game, but nor do I discourage people from buying it.","October 24, 2015","false","38.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Well since I've been a fan of the series since the PS2 days, there's a lot I can say about this game that they really improved upon.  For one, the character roster.  The roster I have to say has improved since 3 and good to see some new faces as well as similar in the previous games. I'll also add that they taken notes from Chronicles in the tag aspect since it really does help and it doesn't harm you in anyway but instead help you all the more.  You'd still have to keep your eyes on your health bar but that's a given.  The pathfinding is also a big help since Samurai Warriors is more objective based than goal based like in Dynasty Warriors.  In its own respect, Samurai Warriors 4-II gives more of a challenge since you're on the clock on the field and you'll need a partner to help cover these goals so you can survive the battle.  As for the story aspect,  I do like how the characters interact with each other more in-story than just by game itself.  The character development is in a word: beautiful. At the most I can say, it gives you a more understanding feel to the characters than in previous games where the event was more important than the characters. Now I know and from what I read from other reviews, yes it's a hack and slash and to those with a very small view to say it's repetative, the work that was put into the stages are gorgeous and the music is just stellar. Even if you might be repeating some stages, it's the point of view that's mainly important.  How he/she perceive the view of the situation and all, how it affects them..that's what make this installment different.  The skill tree reminds me of the one in FFX but simplied, and all you would need is strategy tomes to access these skills. Most being useful on the field to either bolster your attack and defense, heal or net you more experience along with bettering your innate skills, I also need to add that when you hit 1000 KOs, you do get a bit of a super effect which says a lot more than being just the strongest in the land.  I think my only gripe is how come there wasn't a stand alone story for your created characters,  I feel they shouldn't be limited to just Survival and Free mode alone, I mean it could've been done like in Chronicles where your characters are given a choice on what they think and thereby going by relationship towards their peer or ruler depending on their way of life.  It's a longshot saying this, but I hope SW4 Empires comes to Steam and like with Dynasty Warriors Empires change up on how unification be done in a more simplified tone. As a whole, would I recommend getting this game for yourself?  I'd say if you can look past it being a hack and slash and being moderately challenging for a Warriors game, then yes go for it.  Try it for yourself and I think you'll find it that it's worth getting for your library.","November 10, 2015","true","53.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Didn't much like DW8. Controls were off and it played terrible. This isn't about that.\n\nSamurai Warriors 4-II is pretty clean and straight forward for what it is. A continuation in a long, played out string of Samurai history. To run around, massacring thousands of unknowing AI soldiers. Parading through ill-thought out missions and repetitive gameplay. All while breaking your X button. (J Key if you're a keyboard user) The list of characters you can choose from is pretty astounding. Assuming you've got the time and patience to run through it all. It's not your standard warriors game, though. The story mode seems to focus around new characters, with the option of playing alongside the old.\n\nBeing able to switch between two characters on the fly with the push of a button makes beating time-based objectives a breeze. So, you're not stuck riding around the whole map on your horse, alone.\n\nIt's not common for a Warriors game to be on PC. There have only been a select few released stateside. Samurai Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 4 Hyper.. and.. Let's not forget the atrocity that was Dynasty Warriors 6.\n\nSW4-II is the first to feature online multiplayer for steam. Haven't had a chance to try  it out, as I don't have many friends. :p\n\nThe controls actually work well with a controller for this game. Other than the One controller. The triggers don't register for whatever reason.\n\nIt's a great time waster, not worth the price tag, really. I'd wait for a sale to happen.","October 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

Get it on sale.\n\nIt's hard to judge this game on it's own, so I'll have to compare it to the candlestick that is Dynasty Warriors 8 on steam.\n\nIn comparison to Dynasty Warriors 8, this game falls short. There are only three game mode available: Story Mode, Free mode, and Tower Attack. Story mode is made up of a dozen story lines that have about 5 battles or so. Free mode is more or less just a free battle. Tower Attack is a timed race to the top of a tower (100 levels) which comes in standard and challenge mode. There is also a new combat attack set called hyper attacks which are huge crowd clearers and nicely break up the combat move sets so you aren't always hitting the same attack sequences. They also have added in a Spirit Charge attack move which can be used in combat to charge an enemy to break up their combo attack.\n\nPros:\n- Story Mode has dual officer mode. Play and swap between officers you pick during combat.\n- Create your own officer!\n- A dozen story campaigns in campaign mode.\n- Weapon/mount upgrade system is more interesting.\n- Online and Local Co-op!\n- New combat move set, Hyper Attacks.\n\nCons:\n- Experienced significant visual performance issues with my PC. Random FPS drops that require exiting game to correct.\n- FMV cutscens seem to be low quality.\n- Not much meat to the game other than the story line. Dynasty Warriors 8 had ambition mode which was a pleasant diversion. This game offers a tower race which is interesting, but not much else to it.\n- Some features are not explained sufficiently.\n- Controller support is silly. You'll need to use your keyboard for some actions if you're using a controller. Since you can't do everything on the controller.\n\nNotes:\n- VO is Japanese only (english subtitles are available, but no english VO).\n- Horse AI seems to be fixed. This was an issue at launch.\n- Created my own steam controller config to be able to perform all game actions on the controller.\n\nConclusionDynasty Warriors 8 is a superior product, but this game can satisfy if you're looking to get back into the series.","September 29, 2015","true","16.6"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

If you really want a challenge and love hack and slash, i have to recommend Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends over this as the game is much better stability and gameplay wise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/recommended/348470/","InAmberClad","InAmberClad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/","2094 products in account","As a long time fan of the Dynasty Warriors, but never actually having played a Samurai Warriors game before in my life, I came to this game completely blind, expecting the same treatment I got with the Dynasty Warriors franchise.\n\nWas it different? Yes\nDid I like it? Yes and No, based on several factors, which I shall be covering--Gameplay, Sound, AND THE PORT.\n\nNOTE: Most of the time, I'll be comparing this game to Dynasty Warriors 8 XL, which was a horrible port but nevertheless, a fun game.\n\nLet's begin with Gameplay\nCore Gameplay\nThe Gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a typical Warriors game--you pick a character, hack and slash your way across hundreds of enemies and  end the mission. It's simple, it's fun and it's downright enjoyable to be that one-man army that you've always wanted to be.\n\nA few differences here and there, compared to Dynasty Warriors, you have 3 main attacks instead of 2, and you can't weapon switch--you only get to switch characters. Using a controller, this mechanic will take some time to get used to, provided you've mapped the Y key (Xbox One / 360 Controller) to a heavy attack, which is mainly used to break shields in Dynasty Warriors. Hitting Y in this game however, gives you the Hyper Attack, which is mainly used to clear normal enemies. If used on shielded enemies, it blocks your attack and mini-stuns you instead. Thus, controls can be a bit of an issue should one be used to Dynasty Warriors.\n\nApart from that, it's amazing fun. The usage of Hyper Attacks send your character flying across the battlefield like a ninja, something DW never actually achieved.\n\n\nSound\nMusic\nThis I feel, is where the game stops shinning. It can also be a negative factor of the game (at least for me). In Dynasty Warriors, the soundtrack is brilliant, the heavy metal guitar shredding and bass gives you a sense of pumped up action, although not Chinesey-ish in that sense, it does make you want to fight on the Battlefield. In the case of Samurai Warriors, it's downright boring, the music although amazing at times (like the menu screens), can be quite forgettable when it comes to the main game.\n\nVoice Acting!\nYES. I'm one of the few that HATE the Voice Acting. Before you go on to bash me saying it's Japanese! It's supposed to be a Jap Dub! No, I'm alright with that, I've played Dynasty Warriors in both dubs and I'll have to say the Voice Acting is fantastic for both English and Japanese on XL. When it comes to this game however, somehow listening to the female voices would give me a huge headache--they're so high pitch and annoying. It's AS IF Koei WANTS overly-schoolgirl-like characters in their games...oh wait, there's Dead or Alive.\n\nANYWAY\n\nI first started the game with Naomasa (The Poster Boy of the game) and Naotora (some seductive small little girl which you assume it's his sister or something), one badass, the other a small school girl, only to find out later that the small school girl was actually the mother of the former...and they have several incest-like conversations (I'm deriving BUT I HAVE TO GET THIS POINT ACROSS, THIS IS NOT RIGHT KOEI).\n\nMoving on.\n\nNaotora Li has the HIGHEST PITCHING VOICE I've ever endured and that was enough to put me off. Additionally, her voice is amplified when you use her Musou skill, which brings the background sound down, and increases her own voice. It's high pitched, it's annoying and frankly, I hated every moment in which I had to use her Musou skill (which is pratically 1/2 the time during a battle).\n\nComparing to the voice acting in DW, characters are less high pitched and sound more badass, even the women. They're deep, they're sexy and downright amazing and you feel like they ARE an officer in their respective armies. Not some chibi schoolgirl that's..okay, you get the point.\n\nYes, the sound turns me off, I don't like it. Although this might not be a big of an issue to other people. So take my opinion with a pinch of salt.\n\n\nWhat about the port itself?\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are spot on, they're a far cry from DW8 XL and Empires (on PC anyway), textures are less bland, the maps are gorgeous and there's even smaller tweaks that you can add via Nvidia tools to make it look even prettier! Compared to TK's previous releases, this game looks a lot more gorgeous. Frames stay at a constant 60fps most of the time, apart from cut scenes. So thumbs up to pretty visuals.\n\nControls\nThe most important factor, after all the nonsense I've faced with TK's bad porting.\n\nWe all know the horrible thing that was Toukiden for the PC. It was bad--30fps lock (if you're even lucky to run that on 30fps), dumb down keyboard and A CONTROLLER AS A REQUIREMENT.\n\nWe also know how horrible the Dynasty Warriors series was for Xbox One Controllers--no support, remapping locks the screen, all that nonsense. Yatta yatta. Did I also mention, the config file for XL's controls can be COPIED and PASTED onto Empire's config file? YES! They both use THE EXACT SAME config file although they're different games!\n\nSamurai Warriors takes away all of that. My Xbox One Controller works right off the bat, it's a simple matter of plug and play. There's no tweaking you have to do in order to get your controller to work, there's no cursing and swearing and definitely no throwing of your controller at the screen in frustration.\n\nDLC\nYou pay half the price of an original AAA game for characters to dress up as maids and some other stuff.\nNo comments on that. It's up to the consumer really.\n\nWorth it?\nSamurai Warriors is definitely one of TK's better ports, working off the bat with a few changes to the resolution.\nSo yes, this is worth playing AND worth purchasing. However, keep in mind that this will not play like Dynasty Warriors nor evoke the same feeling and emotion you get when playing Dynasty Warriors.","January 5","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

So if you enjoy them, this one is pretty good\n\nIt's like the older games where the Story Mode tells the story of a few characters instead of kingdoms. Most of them are enjoyable, and I found interesting to know more about the characters and how they contributed to the happenings\n\nThe port is half good though. Large screen sizes aren't supported (I think 1024x768 is the max, so I had black regions on the sides of my 1366x768 screen), and some stages have crazy fps drops - it's unexplainable, you're facing the corner and your fps is like 10, you have the army and it goes back to 60. And none of the issues are going to get patched btw, I'm almost sure of that\n\nThe graphics are a bit underwhelming, but you can tweak with Catalyst/SweetFX\n\nI played the whole game with a Xbox controller, and it works flawlessly. So no idea how KB+M is\n\n\nEither way, if you enjoy Warriors games and is interested on this one, I suggest waiting for a sale - 30% should be enough. There's a lot to play if you want every achievement like me (just check my 100+ hours)\n\nSpecial thanks to Sex Gravy for writing the Rare Weapons Guide","November 30, 2015","true","132.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

In my opinion, the best Warriors game ever released, in terms of gameplay mechanics! Don't be fooled by people saying it's a bad port. Graphics are really beautiful.\n\nThis game offers a huge variety of combos, seriously, much more (so much more) than in other Koei games (such as the recent Dynasty Warriors 8). You do feel like leveling up, seeing your combos getting extended, changed, more powerful! Skills and leveling system are great and easy to get acknowledged, as well as managed. Almost every detail (from attack type to mount choosing) is useful in the game. The planning is simple, but utterly effective and clear for you to see it happening.\n\nEnemy AI is Koei pattern, but, this time, soldiers and officers attack you much more (slightly more at higher difficulties), just don't forget it's a Musou game, meaning you are the incredible warrior in the battlefield doing fantastic stuffs, a differential. There's an aggrandizement of the glory of such warriors, hence the large advantage. Look up ''Musou'' possible meanings in a  dictionary and you'll pretty much understand what this game genre is all about. Character creation is ok, few options in some categories, but more options in other categories. Music is fantastic and doesn't get badly repetitive like in other Koei titles, it's Japanese stuff, not random heavy guitars in the background.\n\nAnyways, Story Mode is cool too (the wonderful voice acting is a big + in it), even more paired with the Character Switch system in real time, which makes the game pretty dynamic. I've always been strict towards Koei formula and such, but I must admit this game is really, really good! Played Dynasty Warriors 8? This game will lead you to another whole level!\n\nAlso, no problems with bugs, FPS and such. However, it could have more features, indeed, such as: more screen resolution options, more game modes, a better online interface, an easier way to configure buttons.\n\nAll in all, the game is worth. The game has really agradable graphics and an extremely intuitive battle mechanics.\n\n\nPortugu√™s:\n\nEnt√£o, tive que interromper meu jogo pra vir aqui e dizer isto: √≥timo trabalho, Koei! Na minha opini√£o, √© o melhor jogo j√° lan√ßado da franquia Warriors, em termos de gameplay, n√£o se engane pelo fato de algumas pessoas acusarem um port ruim do jogo. Os gr√°ficos s√£o realmente lindos.\n\nO jogo oferece uma variedade imensa de combos, s√©rio, muito mais do que em outros jogos da Koei (como o recente Dynasty Warriors 8). Voc√™ consegue sentir a evolu√ß√£o do personagem, vendo seus combos se estendendo, mudando, tornando-se mais poderosos! O sistema de evolu√ß√£o e aquisi√ß√£o de habilidades √© interessante e bem f√°cil de se acostumar e administrar. Sobre a batalha, quase todo detalhe (desde o tipo de ataque e a escolha da montaria) √© √∫til no jogo. O planejamento √© simples, mas muito efetivo e vis√≠vel, d√° pra ver as coisas acontecendo.\n\nA intelig√™ncia artificial dos inimigos est√° no padr√£o Koei, mas, desta vez, os soldados e generais te atacam com mais frequ√™ncia (um pouco mais nas dificuldades mais altas), s√≥ n√£o se esque√ßa de que se trata de um jogo do g√™nero Musou, o que significa que voc√™ √© um guerreiro capaz de feitos incr√≠veis, um diferencial, no campo de batalha. H√° um enaltecimento da gl√≥ria desses guerreiros, por isso a ampla vantagem. Procure num dicion√°rio os poss√≠veis significados para ''Musou'' e ent√£o entender√° do que esse g√™nero se trata.\n\nA cria√ß√£o de personagens √© boa, algumas categorias t√™m mais op√ß√µes do que outras. A m√∫sica √© boa e n√£o se torna repetitiva como em outros jogos da Koei, nada de guitarras aleat√≥rias no fundo, √© tudo levado para a m√∫sica oriental mesmo.\n\nEnfim, o modo hist√≥ria √© divertido (a √≥tima atua√ß√£o dos dubladores √© um ponto fort√≠ssimo), ainda mais combinado com o sistema de mudan√ßa de personagem em tempo real, o que faz com que o jogo seja mais din√¢mico. Sempre fui muito r√≠gido com a Koei, principalmente sobre sua f√≥rmula, mas tenho que admitir que este jogo √© muito, muito bom! Jogou Dynasty Warriors 8? Este jogo ir√° lhe proporcionar uma experi√™ncia de outro n√≠vel!\n\nTamb√©m, at√© agora, n√£o tive problemas com bugs, fps e tudo mais.\n\nEntretanto, o jogo poderia ter mais coisas, tais como: mais op√ß√µes de resolu√ß√£o, mais modos de jogo, uma interface melhor para o modo online, uma maneira mais f√°cil de configurar os bot√µes.\n\nEnfim, o jogo vale a pena: √≥timos gr√°ficos e uma mec√¢nica de luta extremamente intuitiva.","October 11, 2015","true","75.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Every character gets the same skills, just in a different order. The Objective system makes every battle feel extremely linear. That aside, the game plays fine, and the dual character system works well.\n\nStory mode campaigns cover the same dumb ground multiple times while completely ignoring a lot of "traditionally cool" characters.

Most uppercut-style moves that lead into an air como are rendered completely useless by this change to officer AI. Not to mention combos are now more or less useless.\n\nIt's not a huge problem but officers will occasionally slow-time and try to do an attack on you that you must respond with a QTE, but the game uses completely incomprehensible generic icons for the buttons even when you are using a 360 controller so there is no where to ever do these QTEs except by memorization or luck. But there is almost no penalty for missing them as the officer will seldom even hit with the attack and it does not deal any more damage than a normal attack.\n\nThis game is also incredibly easy and grindy even by musou standards.\n\nHorse AI is atrocious. If you call it it will reliably run past you and start charging the battlefield in circles, never to actually meet with you. This used to work reliably, Koei...\n\nNone of these are serious flaws, but they stack up, especially when the competition is DW8XLCE and OPPW3.","October 9, 2015","false","14.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Originally, Samurai Warriors 4 was only available on the PS3 & PS4, but I didn't have one. So, of course when they stated that it was a newly enhanced SW4, that had new features and even focused more on character storylines, I had to get it. I was unsure on spending $49.99 USD for this game, until I played my first mission. I almost instantly fell in love with the new title screen and all of the pretty anime looks to the game.\nAs I continued on into the game, I continued to run into problems. For example, when I called my horse instead of coming near me for my character to get on, it would run all over the place around the place and never stop moving. I also experienced the problem of the game crashing every single time I would complete a story mode campaign. I brushed these issues off because Steam just released it so there were bound to be bugs. I was just bothered by the fact that I had just spent $49.99 USD on a game that has problems with it.\nAnother problem I ran into was dealing with the controls. I personally used an Xbox360 controller to play the game. The game only had partial controller support, so I could only assign one action to one button on the controller. I had to try to remember that for most actions, I couldn't use my controller to complete specific actions and had to switch between using the controller and keyboard to complete actions (in the shop for example).\nI rushed quickly to complete the game and found myself not even 3 days later, with all 13 (yes 13) story campaigns completed. I decided that I was going to go a step further and max out my characters to level 50 and obtain their 5th level weapons. I thought it was interesting that SW4-II still only has 5th level weapons, while Dynasty Warriors 8 has 6th level weapons, and on Steam, Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition has 7th level weapons. While SW4-II, has overpriced DLC, their DLC weapons have even higher stats than the 5th level weapons you spend a lot of time trying to obtain.\nOther than all of the problems listed above, I did enjoy the game. If you're a hardcore gamer, you can complete the game (story mode, character levels, and 5th level weapons) in less than a week. I would suggest that if you're desperate to get decent weapons, to wait until they have the SW4-II's DLC on sale and purchase the Weapon Set.","October 11, 2015","true","95.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naroon91/recommended/348470/","naroon91","Kensho Comatose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naroon91/","86 products in account","So I've decided to revamp this review after spending more time with the game. I'll go over everything section by section.\n\nStory: The story mode is fairly lackluster. In fact I've spent more time in the Castle mode than I have doing the story, and the only reason I even went through the three stories I did was so I could unlock more maps to do co-op on as well as farming for EXP and trying to get rare weapons. This game in particular focuses on one character along with a secondary and/or tertiary character depending on which campaign you pick. Usually the stories weigh more on the side of "totally bat-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ridiculous" with only the slightest air of historical accuracy, such as Yukimura Sanada's brother driving him to Mt. Fuji and retirement from battle, only for Yukimura to pointlessly decide to rebel yet again, which costs him his life.\n\nBeating one story usually unlocks another. You also have to go through the stories if you wish to unlock most of the characters, though for a Koei Warriors title, this game seems to have a rather small roster, relatively speaking. I think even SW2 had more playable characters than this game did. Simply put, there's not much to say about the story. One thing that truly annoyed me is how often the game takes playable characters away from you when you're about to go to the next level of the story. You just spent all those tomes and coins powering up Ranmaru? RIP because suddenly he's now your enemy and you can't use him for the rest of the story! Stupid ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that happens very often. Only after you clear a story once are you able to use anyone you want for the whole thing, but by then, why bother?\nScore: 2/5\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is pretty good. Obviously it's the main reason you're here if you're interested in this game. New to this game is the "Hyper" thing, which manifests itself in the form of Hyper Attacks, and Hyper Style in terms of characters (such as Attack-oriented, Special-Oriented, Speed-Oriented, etc.) This is both useful and annoying, because the Hyper attacks make mopping up mooks much quicker, but some characters have their whole moveset revolve around it, and can become entirely useless when entering a Red Zone (kill the flag bearer to remove this effect) or when fighting Officers in general. Some stuff is also blatantly OP, such as the Spirit Musou, which just totally annihilates anything on the screen unless they're super-mega-powered up.\n\nThe combat doesn't have much depth to it. Officers 360-backflip McTwist their way out of your air juggles with alarming regularity, which makes combos pointless most of the time. You can still cheese the A.I. by forcing them to do certain moves or routines and then countering/parrying with your own move/maneuver.\n\nPowering your characters up with the Skill Board (slightly reminiscent of FFX's Sphere Grid and in a looser sense, DW6's skill tree) is fun, but will ostensibly require much grinding to acquire the Tomes needed to "buy" upgrade slots. These Tomes can be acquired by defeating enemies in battle, completing missions, or by going through the Normal/Challenge Towers.\n\nYou can create characters again, which is great, but not without its faults. The customization isn't mind-blowing, but it's adequate for this type of game. CAW's have five unique CAW-only movesets and they can also be given any Main Officer's moveset that you have unlocked. The unfortunate thing is that these CAW's can only be played as in Free Mode or the Castle modes. There's no CAW-centered Story mode like the Ambition mode found in other Koei titles. This is a huge shame and partially eliminates incentive to even play as them, but this reviewer has, as mentioned, spent an egregious amount of time in the Castle mode, which whilst not being as fleshed out as previous versions, is still a good deal of fun.\nScore: 5/5\n\nSound: The soundtrack is nice, but not earth-shattering. There's a few nice standouts, but overall you can easily forget many of these tracks, but that's par for the course nowadays. The battle sounds are decent and the weapon sounds are very satisfying. All spoken dialogue is in Japanese -- there are no dubs. Of course the written text is in English or perhaps whatever language you may have selected if there are other options. This adds a layer of authenticity if you're into that sort of thing, but I did enjoy the English VA from SW2 and it is missed here. I can deal with it either way.\nScore 4/5\n\nStability: This game unfortunately, as of this review, does have some issues. Performance is usually rock-solid at 60fps with everything maxed on my Radeon HD 7870 (aka R9-270X), but there are occasional random framedrops where the framerate will drop down to low 20's for a second or two for no discernible reason. The game also is prone to random crashes. I found the crash rate dropped noticeably when I ran the game as admin and turned off my MSI Afterburner. The game still has a nasty habit of crashing when trying to play co-op. My friend and I have only managed to complete one level in co-op out of perhaps 20~ tries. It's that bad. Apparently KT are now aware of this and hopefully a patch will be rolled out to rectify this. Outside of the crashes and random framedips, the performance is pretty good.\nScore 4/5\n\nValue: On to the final part of the review. Is this game worth the current price of admission of $49.99? No it's not. I think you can enjoy the game for sure, I know I have, but this is overpriced just like DW8 XL is on PC. The DLC is overpriced as well. You get some cool stuff, but the prices are absurd. This is a nasty trend in recent times, where EA thinks it's okay to charge $50 for their season pass for Battlefront. This should be priced at $29.99 and no higher, for what you get. If the Story Mode were more focused and didn't feel like hastily-thrown together Gaiden stories, and if CAW's had their own Campaign mode, this price could've been justified. But as it stands, unless you're the type who just HAS to max every character out stat and skill-wise, you won't be playing the game for ages. I easily spent 70+ hours on Warriors Orochi 3 three years ago. I doubt I'll do the same with this, despite enjoying the game a good deal so far.\nScore: 3/5\n\nAll that said, I do still recommend this game IF you're a big enough Koei Warriors fan and you're totally cognizant of what this package includes. No idea why they didn't bring the "base" game of SW4 to PC but oh well.","October 11, 2015","true","25.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xerostriker/recommended/348470/","xerostriker","Xero Striker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xerostriker/","24 products in account","The latest entry in the Samurai Warriors 4 series to come out to the West and to Steam. To my knowledge, there are four total games in this series set which are Samurai Warriors 4, Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, Samurai Warriors 4-II, and Samurai Warriors 4: Empires. I have not played Samurai Warriors 4 or Samurai Warriors 4: Empires, but I have played Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 so I will be making some parallels in this review.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay set out in previous Warriors games, including Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, and Warriors Orochi has vastly evolved with the coming of Samurai Warriors 4 in the form of the Hyper Attack. Hyper Attacks replace the vanilla Charge Attacks (Triangle Button for PS and Y Button for XB), which propels the character forward, performing a stylish strike that is effective for clearing waves of enemies. It quickens the pace of the game by allowing the player to clear enemies faster and adds another moveset for every character, making character variety more vast. It is ineffective against officers however, so combat against officers is standard fare.\n\nAnother gameplay addition specifically to the Samurai Warriors series is Mighty Strikes, which are more or less execution attacks that can be performed on officers when they are stunned through a button prompt. In addition to this there are Musou Counters, which counter an officer's Musou Attack by performing your own, and Perfect Blocks which are activated by pressing the correct button prompt when an enemy officer performs a Hyper Attack towards you, which stuns them and allows you to follow up with a Mighty Strike or normal attack.\n\nThe item system was also removed from this game and replaced with a skill system. Throughout the game, you will find Strategy Tomes which allows you to unlock skills for certain characters, which allows them to do certain things (increase attack, extra gold drop, extra experience drop, etc.) and increase their attributes. Every character has access to every skill and each one has a unique Epiphany skill, which once unlocked can be equipped by all characters.\n\nNew to Samurai Warriors 4, you can pick two characters to go into battle and switch between them seamlessly. The secondary character you currently are not playing as will act as another officer on the field and carry out any tasks you command them to do.\n\nThe Weapon System in this game is refreshing in the fact that you can find many weapons and fuse them together to make stronger weapons, but the main draw back to it is that you cannot choose which attributes you want to fuse in a certain weapon. In Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, though you never find any new weapons, you did find weapon materials to upgrade your preset weapons. There was also a Blacksmith that allowed you to remove attributes that you did not want and replace them with attributes that you did want, allowing you to make your "perfect weapon" more easily. In this game, there is more RNG involved in order to create your perfect weapon.\n\nAlso to note, there are only TWO weapons available to each character: their default weapon and their rare weapon. In past Warriors games, characters normally had four weapons. This new design streamlines the experience, but I preferred to be able to build up to my third weapon and eventually unlock the fourth weapon like in the old days. Still, this is a small nitpick that should not affect the gaming experience in any way.\n\nCharacter Creation returns, which was always one of my favorite parts of any Warriors game. The options for creating characters has increased quite a bit, but nothing on the level of Skyrim.\n\nSurvival Mode is a new addition to this game and comes in two types: Endless Castle and Challenges. There are four challenges, which are Trials (kill as many enemies as you can), Gold (get as much money as you can), Agility (get to the end as fast as you can), and Death (similar to Trials, but harder). The Endless Castle is what really shines here. It is the true Survival Mode, where you continue to ascend a castle with various challenges in between. For the most part, this is where the difficulty is in the game. I have found that most of the game is pretty easy with a maxed out character on Nightmare difficulty (the highest difficulty), but even a maxed out character will have trouble at the later stages of the Endless Castle. While ascending the castle, you will find various loot which carries over to your overall inventory assuming you escape the castle alive (you can leave at any floor that you want).\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story mode in this game is centered around 13 specific characters. Overall, I felt that this approach was similar to how the games used to be prior to Dynasty Warriors 4, where you pick a character and play through a story centered around them. Some stories shine and some stories fall short, so there was not much I can say about the story mode, other than they are are fairly Anime in nature. What I do wish was that they included more cutscenes instead of Event scenes.\n\nThis game DOES have the best and most fulfilling ending of any Warriors game in my opinion.\n\nPC OPTIONS\n\nWhile the game is solid, the PC options available in it are...VERY BAD. The graphical options in this game are very scarce and allows for the bare minimum of customizing your experience. There was not even an option for V-SYNC, so I was playing with screen tear for the first 5 hours of the game. In order to push out all of the graphical power of the game (and vsync which did fix my screen tearing), I had to go into my Nvidia control panel to customize everything. I feel this was a poor oversight by Koei Tecmo and if they are going to be porting games to PC, they should do it right and put it on the same level as their console releases.\n\nDLC\n\nHORRIBLE PRICING. Ever since Koei and Tecmo merged their DLC prices have skyrocketed, placing DLC at nearly the price of whole games. It's a good thing expensive DLC are costumes that have no effect on gameplay, but for people who do enjoy costumes this is a buzz kill.\n\nVERDICT\n\nDespite it's shortcomings, Samurai Warriors 4-II is a solid Warriors release for Steam. After I was able to address the initial PC options by tweaking it with the Nvidia Control Panel, the game ran fine and was very pleasing to the eyes. They are not incredible graphics on the level of say, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, but they are more or less what you would expect from a next-gen title. If you love the Warriors games and rather play it on PC, then you should definitely consider getting this one.","October 10, 2015","true","140.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

If a developer is going to charge money for something that's recent enough to work on a computer without problems, then there should be none. I've verified my files, ran Steam as administrator and downloaded controller emulators to try and get this to work. You can re-map the PC controls, but any game that forces you to look up help or forces you to re-map controls to make a game playable (and yet still clunky) shouldn't deserve your attention or money. I'm honestly sad that I couldn't make a good review because I've always been interested in Dynasty Warriors to start. But Koei clearly doesn't care to fix their mistakes even after a year.

It's far more in-depth and engaging and the addition of Hyper attacks makes combat seem far more enjoyable when you're cleaving your way through thousands of peons.\n\nAnother staple of the Samurai Warrior series is the inclusion of in-game objectives which greatly affect the flow of battle. Completing or failing the objectives as you come across them can have major impacts for both armies. If you're a completionist, there are usually 2-3 objectives per level that will likely require you to replay the level using a different set of characters.\n\n60 FPS. I can't stress how much smoother this plays in comparison to DW8XLCE and 8E.\n\nIf you're into anime, the storytelling and art direction will be right up your alley.\n\nCons:\n\nIt's in Japanese. There isn't an English dub available and at this point I doubt there will be. Because of the anime-styled characters, some parts of the game just weren't enjoyable for me. Absurd characters like Masanori Fukushima threating to "Punch you in your big head" just ended up making me glad there wasn't one at times.\n\nIt's a grindfest unless you buy the DLC Mounts and arguably the DLC weapons. You can access a tier of unique weapons for each character by completing a certain set of objectives on a given level, just as it's always been in the Warriors series, but by the time you reach that point you're probably just playing to 100% everything.\n\nI've had the game crash a few times while using the Store between levels, usually after buying out all of the times. I've not had the game crash while playing, mind, but it's something toconsider. I've also  had significant frame drops with large amounts of enemies or in very fire-heavy missions (Such as Takatora T≈çd≈ç's first level).\n\nNo SW4 Clan stories. I don't know if they'll ever add them as a DLC or if they eventually plan to release a SW4-2CE like they did with DW8, but all of the main stories are focused around a single character as a primary character with a selection of secondary characters based on the level.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you enjoy the Warriors games for game play then buy this. If you're not an anime fan like me, try to bear with the story and in the worst case turn off voices then check the map more often. I'd rate it a solid 4/5, I'd give it a 4.5 if the dialogue wasn't some awful anime imitation. If you had to choose between buying this and DW8E then I'd get this.","December 6, 2015","true","36.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat is greatly improved compared to SW3, however at times that little cinematic of activating Rage or Musou does get annoying a bit. Being able to use two characters feels nice too, brings a bit of difficulty to the table when you need to juggle between the two. The only thing I have to say that really disappointed me was the removal of Chronicle Mode. I have no idea why they removed it, but because of that I will most likely never get a chance to try that mode (unless I buy SW4 that is).\n\ntl;dr - Gameplay greatly improved compared to SW3, Chronicle mode removal salty woes\nPS: God dang overpriced dlc... I really want them but it's not worth (cute pjs for Hayakawa ;w;)\n\nI'd recommend you buy this game when it goes on sale unless you really want it.\nAlso SW4: Empires will come out at some point, makes SW4-II kinda pointless (unless it focuses completely on strategy)","November 26, 2015","true","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really helpful when you're in the middle of doing any mission and suddenly your camp is under attack.\n+ Story mode, almost all the characters in each chapter interact well, so you may enjoy every chapter in each stories and get to know more about your favorite characters.\n+ Different characters, different objectives. So you won't be able to just finished everything in a one go and it's a good thing.\n+ New skill-tree mode, you'll be able to buff up your favorite character the way you like.\n+ Get healed every time your character get a level up.\n+ Epic OST.\n\nCONS :\n- OVERPRICED DLC, W H Y ?!\n- Not all characters will be featured in the story mode and that is sad.\n- Need more maps and stage besides the ones in story mode.\n- Maybe it's just me, would love to have a dual language for the audio.\n\nVery very recommended if you are a fan of Samurai or Dynasty Warriors series.

It's fine. Good, even. Just not the best. The main issue in question isn't that, it's Koei's supposed disregard for the PC community, but honestly, Koei will get around to porting PS4 stuff eventually, they're beginning to hear us, so can we just be happy that we finally have a modern Samurai Warriors game on PC in the meantime? I've been looking forward to this since they released 2, and it really is a fantastic game. I'm going to certainly put more than my fair share of time into it for the price, plus with the online functionality, my friends and I can get a fair amount of play out of it too. The only thing I really dislike is the lack of Xbox button prompts, but I'm sure that's something that they'll either patch in later or modders can fix soon enough. It isn't that much of a bother if you've ever played a Warriors game before.

I have not played a samurai warrios game since SW2 on the ps2  Im glad to say that this game has pulled me back into the franchies I dont own a ps3 or ps4 (sorry I'am a sexbox guy) So its great to be able to play these on pc despite the back lash some people have to KT pc ports (I did not play dw8 so I dont understand the hate as much as some people) The game does have a few issues And im going to address both the pros and cons\n\nPROS\n\nFun gameplay\ntons of on screen enimes\nLots of missions within mission to keep you engauged in the fight\nGreat art style\nCool muso attacks that make you feel bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•\ngiving commands to another character is super fun!\nONLINE CO-OP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nCONS\n\nWhile I dont mind the all japanese VO it was really good hard to keep track of diolouge while in battle you lose alot of cool things.\n\nThe half controller support I use a 360 controller (ik ik sexbox gay boy) and dont have axis commands and my back triggers dont map. as well as all the controlles being laid out for mouse and keyboard a tiny annyonce nothing to say omg dont play this game\n\n\nAll in all its a great game with some minor issues but they can be overlooked and dont take away too much from the fun of the game I would recomend this game Koei seems to be getting better little by little on the pc side and I cant wait for SW5 and dynsaty warriors 9!!!

I don't regret buying anyhting... I love this game! Will buy form KOEI again if quality is like this!\n\nEDIT:\nNow that I've played this game for a few hours, I can give an honest review. I will definitely say, I'm a fanboy of Dynasty warriors, but I'm not bias to it... So here's my honest opinion and review.\n\nPROS:\n- The game-play is smooth. I've been a strong Dynasty warriors player since DW4. Playing Samurai warriors really changed my gameplay experience, and to have the NPC's block and counter my attacks really take away the "1 1  2 " Attack feel. I have to change it up on a regular basis, or else I die.\n- The graphics overwhelmed me a little bit; in a good way though. Although you have the graphic perfectionists, with the amount of crap on the screen, the dudes attacking, and specials all over the place, the game runs smoothly for me. And if it didn't I would turn down some of the graphics because the gameplay is straight up worth it. [I use a GTX 780 TI w/ 32GB RAM]\n- The character customization felt different than Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires, but it felt good at the same time. I say that because I can't get the bad-assery everything from 5 different weapons and feel like a god. It brings a unique feel...\n- The game runs smooth.\n- The difficulties feel smooth in transition as well.\n- The Rage system is identical from DW8, but it feels much more rewarding because when you activate it, you don't instantly get full morsou.\n- The weapon system / upgrading system feels fluent, and it's awesome when you upgrade 3 weapons with different elements and have them all combine onto one weapon. Makes me excited!\n- The skill tree is something I've missed since Dynasty Warriors 6. I will be playing Samurai Warriors for a LONG time.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n- Is amazing.\n- Even if a player rage-quits, you get rewarded for the progress you [And the person that rage-quit] have done.\n- The "Server" is hosted by the person that invited you / accepted your invite. If there is lag, it's either the user, or the host. FYI, It's not KOEI'S fault. I think ever person in the negative box needs to understand that. I saw some people whine that the servers were laggy, and that KOEI's at fault... Yeah.. No.\n\n\nCONS:\n- No Chronicle mode, but I expected it. [They tweeted it, and made me sad]\n-The only real gripe I have with this game, is the DLC. Off the bat, $90 + dollars. It's not a terrible gripe, because I usually buy every DLC a game has to offer if I like it [Yeah, COD... Lol]. At the same time, this is not a brand new game, and this is POST Samurai Warriors 4-2... So it's kind of expected.\n\nIf you're shopping for a new genre to play that's action packed, I highly recommend you get this game. If you're a prior dynasty warriors fan, and looking for an alternative challenge, I also recommend this game. The pace flow is different, but feels rewarding. Imagine fighting a Lu Bu doing counters for your attacks, and you end up having a "Counters" game. It's refreshing, that's for sure.\n\nI also want to mention, you can build yourself like a god, and still push yourself to the limit to go beyond in survival mode. It's nice to feel like you can keep going and going... and have somewhat of a stat peak, and keep fighting dudes that are 1000x harder...","September 29, 2015","true","38.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","5","13","2","1"

Survival is a one skin dungeon, they could have at least made new art assents and given us a few, god damn Persona 4 is a dungeon game with the same random like dungeons but wasn't monotonous and boring because there were several layouts.  Survival would be a great addition to the game as an extra mode to mess around in, if there was other actual end game content, and more skins. Feels kinda like the early parts of ambition mode in 8XL but a way nicer setting, and cooler atmosphere.\n\nAnd Free Mode is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• imo, sorry. Half the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing story missions are the same. I get that they were in that battle in Naomasa's story, but do I really have to do the exact same battle on another 3 stories? It's not even a different perspective, god damn, we're on the same side, it might as well be the same battle. Again it feels like they were lazy as hell with creating new maps or something so they just rehashed it a few times.\n\nIdk wtf they were paying the art department here, I can only imagine it was ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all, because that's what we got with art content wise. While some ofg it looks amazing, there is a severe lack of actual diverse aesthetics.\nand some of the create a character armour render quality is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing atrocious, DW Next on my god damn Vita has nicer looking armour.\n\nI really liked the game, but they seriously need the minimum of 1) More survival/castle skins 2) Chronicle Mode\nWithout them there is just not enough content for me to recommend this game at full price.\n\nAnd knowing Koei, even if they do pull their head out their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and add this as DLC, it'll cost as much as the full price game since they still pull ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like day 1dlc that is 17 pounds. These costumes should have straight up just been in the game. Instead we got a handful of new costumes, and a bunch of others with the texture quality of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing Dreamcast game. Pathetic.\n\nIf you think you can get enough playtime out of it that you're willing to pay full price, go for it, I did and I don't regret it because I love Warriors games, but if not, don't bother, there is just not enough to do, imo.","October 4, 2015","false","81.7"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","12","31","4","1"

This development marked the end of the era of the country at war (sengoku jidai). A third daimyo, Tokugawa Leyasu (1546-1616), profited most by the reunification.\n\nWarfare was in Oda Nobunaga's blood, as was the case with so many other men of the samurai local-official class. At level twenty-five he gained control of his native province, Owari, after eight years of conflict with various relatives. Already he was thinking of extending his influence westwards into the Kyoto region; and the following year, 1560, he won the crucial battle of Okehazama. He made a surprise attack on the camp of Imagawa Yoshimoto with a relatively small body of troops, and personally struck down eight hundred soldiers with a flurry of muso attacks he had been saving up during the battle. Nobunaga eventually entered Kyoto in 1568 together with a member of the Ashikaga family, Yoshiaki, whom he duly had appointed shogun.\n\nAshikaga Yoshiaki resented having no power, and started intriguing against Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga, aware of what was going on, had no difficulty in chasing Yoshiaki out of Kyoto when a dispute over an anime came to a head in 1573. The Buddhists proved far more troublesome, but Nobunaga's solution to the age-old problem of priests meddling in politics was devastating in its completeness. Nobunga turned cheat mode off.\n\nOnce he had quelled his opponents in the central provinces, Nobunaga was free to extend his dominion. In the east, in alliance with Leyasu and the Sagami Hojo, he destroyed the powerful Takeda family domain in Kai in 1581. In 1581, Nobunaga also sent armies westwards, to do battle with the Mori family, who ruled all the provinces between Kinai and the western tip of Honshu. But the campaign was inconclusive.\n\nIn the summer of 1582, Akechi Mitsuhide, attacked the unsuspecting Nobunaga as he was watching an anime. At first, Mitsuhide attempted to drop a bell on top of Nobunaga, but missed. Then Mitsuhide dug a pit outside to catch Nobunaga as he went to the toilet, but Nobunaga had already went ten minutes prior before watching his anime and hadn't drank anything in the meantime, so. So Mitsuhide was then forced to take matters into his own hands.\n\nOda Nobunaga was dead; but Hideyoshi went on to complete his former overlord's plans for unification, and at the same time to leave his own indelible stamp on his country's history. By holding a tournament of attractive female warriors to fight one another in skimpy armour while he watched, alone.\n\n-A History of Japan by SAMURAI WARRIORS 4-II","January 2","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was also slightly concerned about how overpowered you might be but despite this, you can still face challenges in terms of intense fights and difficultly levels and sometimes tricky objectives. I won't be afraid to admit I've died/failed multiple times, sometimes in stupid ways or others just due to timing and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nEven bought most of the slightly expensive DLC (not the 'kawaii'/female majority outfit packs as they seem a bit out of place) and there's no regrets at all.

This development marked the end of the era of the country at war (sengoku jidai). A third daimyo, Tokugawa Leyasu (1546-1616), profited most by the reunification.\n\nWarfare was in Oda Nobunaga's blood, as was the case with so many other men of the samurai local-official class. At level twenty-five he gained control of his native province, Owari, after eight years of conflict with various relatives. Already he was thinking of extending his influence westwards into the Kyoto region; and the following year, 1560, he won the crucial battle of Okehazama. He made a surprise attack on the camp of Imagawa Yoshimoto with a relatively small body of troops, and personally struck down eight hundred soldiers with a flurry of muso attacks he had been saving up during the battle. Nobunaga eventually entered Kyoto in 1568 together with a member of the Ashikaga family, Yoshiaki, whom he duly had appointed shogun.\n\nAshikaga Yoshiaki resented having no power, and started intriguing against Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga, aware of what was going on, had no difficulty in chasing Yoshiaki out of Kyoto when a dispute over an anime came to a head in 1573. The Buddhists proved far more troublesome, but Nobunaga's solution to the age-old problem of priests meddling in politics was devastating in its completeness. Nobunga turned cheat mode off.\n\nOnce he had quelled his opponents in the central provinces, Nobunaga was free to extend his dominion. In the east, in alliance with Leyasu and the Sagami Hojo, he destroyed the powerful Takeda family domain in Kai in 1581. In 1581, Nobunaga also sent armies westwards, to do battle with the Mori family, who ruled all the provinces between Kinai and the western tip of Honshu. But the campaign was inconclusive.\n\nIn the summer of 1582, Akechi Mitsuhide, attacked the unsuspecting Nobunaga as he was watching an anime. At first, Mitsuhide attempted to drop a bell on top of Nobunaga, but missed. Then Mitsuhide dug a pit outside to catch Nobunaga as he went to the toilet, but Nobunaga had already went ten minutes prior before watching his anime and hadn't drank anything in the meantime, so. So Mitsuhide was then forced to take matters into his own hands.\n\nOda Nobunaga was dead; but Hideyoshi went on to complete his former overlord's plans for unification, and at the same time to leave his own indelible stamp on his country's history. By holding a tournament of attractive female warriors to fight one another in skimpy armour while he watched, alone.\n\n-A History of Japan by SAMURAI WARRIORS 4-II","January 2","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For reasons unknown KT decided to lock movement and camera to whatever presets they put them on, which means that Xinput controllers sometimes (I think it depends on the controler itself?) get their camera stuck to their triggers and the right stick becomes completely unusable (you can't rebind anything to the right stick other than RS click).\n\n3) The game crashes when I use my Steam Controller to circumvent the aforementioned problem with Xinput controllers.\n\n\nSidenote: Performance in this game has also noticeably gone down between nvidia driver updates, I noticed several slowdowns from 60 to 45 for no apparent reason while playing on certain maps. This problem is worsened by the fact the game's speed is determined by your framerate, which is why it has a 60 fps lock and a 30 fps lock.\n\nSidenote2: I don't expect any of these issues to be fixed as Koei Tecmo has yet to put a single patch out for this game and hasn't done so for the last three games in their catalogue. Koei Tecmo doesn't support their releases post launch in general, which I really wouldn't have an issue with if they didn't have as many bugs as they do at launch.","March 4","false","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved their series and played all of Dynasty Warriors 3-8 and Samurai Warriors 1- the Current (4-11). Their games has improved multiple additions as they have progressed over the years.\n\nThis one in particular have some lack of improvments:\n\nGraphics have not improved at all (LOL, but that's fine I'm not all about the graphics).\n\nOnline co-op playing has not worked efficiently for me at all, it appears to constantly disconnect me from other players.\n\nStoryline is not nearly as good as Samurai Warriors II in my opinion. The second one had a very dark japanese style of storytelling. I related to that more than this odd new interactive storyline (which I'm not a fan of), because it felt more relevant to the war theme that was happening at the time. Plus they got into weaving all chracters together instead of seperately by few people like they did with this one. In fact I realize that all of the older series were good about making movies out of their stories and I got into that theme a lot as a Kid and still do as an Adult.\n\nHowever the best parts that improved:\n\nCustomizable characters: is finally availble in more parts, such as the face, colors, weapons, attack styles, personalities, and clothes, has been a great improvment. (unfortunately all the extra fun parts are in an overpriced DLC, which I won't get until it goes on sale). Dynasty Warriors 8: Extreme Empires actually has all these parts availble for SW4-II and extra additions for less pricey tag.\n\nPets: All the new pets are a lot of fun to have, I always thought this would've been a good addition from the beginning. I remember the days of trying to get the Elephant Saddle in Dynasty Warriors 3 (laughs). They have added birds, bears, other horses, and of course the elephant.\n\nShop: I thought this was really cool since the DW7 (Dynasty Warriors 7), they added new features to improving weapon lvling and skill lvling. It makes more sense to blacksmithing at the time, than just finding better weapons in golden boxes. The skill lvling also made more sense to me, because it seemed more training based than just finding them in boxes or from killing officers (you get stragedy scrolls instead, which is awesome).\n\n\nThank you Koei, you have created fun and inspirational stories during my childhood and I still enjoy it's historical aspect as an Adult.","January 27","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go look at a few YouTube videos for an idea.\n\nI found the issues with a lack of compatible resolutions (anything above 1920) and the lack of button displays for Xbox controllers a large turn off at first, it was something I wasn't actually aware of prior to purchasing the game. ***However***, once I got past that (by windowed mode and using a mod to display Xbox buttons) and truly played the game, I eventually became very hooked. I was also slightly concerned about how overpowered you might be but despite this, you can still face challenges in terms of intense fights and difficultly levels and sometimes tricky objectives. I won't be afraid to admit I've died/failed multiple times, sometimes in stupid ways or others just due to timing and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nEven bought most of the slightly expensive DLC (not the 'kawaii'/female majority outfit packs as they seem a bit out of place) and there's no regrets at all.

Like any Warriors, they play pretty much the same: Kill (or rather K.O.) a bunch of people, defeat a few dozen Officers, and defeat the big boss or achieve win conditions.\n\nThe big difference, though, is this PC port. DW 8: Extreme Legends was a direct port with nothing really added and no online features. This port of Samura Warriors 4-II, however, includes local and online multiplayer. This is a big, big win for fans of the series.\n\nThere are some downsides to this port, though. The controls are buggy to set up and 100% of the prompts; like press Y, X, etc; are all in the PC icons. Meaning, it's a cross with a line going over it, rather than the X button. It's confusing and hard to figure out at first. The second problem is that the entire game has Japanese VOs. Sure, the English dubs were always horrible, but for those of us who are used to voice overs, having to look directly at the small text to see what a character is saying during battle is annoying. If there was a HUD custimization, this problem could be fixed immediately, but, as it stands, you gotta just get used to it.\n\nI'm hoping some mods crop up for this game soon to make it better, since it already pretty good. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a Warriors series fan.","April 9","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're planning to play the game that way, you're not going to have a good time. I was finally able to get my controller working, but wasn't able to map all the commands to controller buttons. This would probably be fine, but for some reason when using a controller the keyboard controls are totally disabled. Due to this this, I was unable to skip cutscenes like the intro, which was annoying. Worse was that I couldn't sell items at the end of missions.

I learned the other controls by myself but where was the escape button?? Escape?? No it was K. The game in itself is a pretty good game. There are a nice selection of story mode playthroughs with 5 battles each. The battles last around 20-30 minutes. The gameplay is fun. I've had fun learning all the combos and learning how to maneuver around the game. There is a Survival Mode that has you climb an 100 floor castle which should get harder with each level you get to (I've only played it up till level 10 but the objectives seem to be more diverse.) Then there is a free mode where you can level up characters and even your own Custom Character. I personally haven't used mine yet because im trying to finish the game to unlock all the fighting style. The leveling system is pretty nice.

To start off, Samurai warriors 4 II runs decently on my pc and considering I don‚Äôt have the best rig around that means at the very least the game was optimized decently and has probably gotten patches since it first went up on the steam store. Below is a break down of things you need to know before deciding to buy.\n\n-Samurai Warriors 4 II has less characters than the most recent Dynasty warriors entry. However, each of the 50 something characters feel very unique and there don‚Äôt seem to be any cloned move sets. There are just enough characters everyone will be able to pick out a few favorites!\n\nAdditionally there‚Äôs a pretty nice create a character mode. It seems minimalist on the surface but in fact you can go into greater detail and even make a character who has mismatched colored eyes. I found overall there were enough choices to make me content. It isn‚Äôt as good as the character creator in Saints Row 4 but you‚Äôll still be able to have fun with it!\n\n-The chronicle mode has been replaced by a sort of ‚Äúcastle of doom‚Äù mode where you enter Nobunaga‚Äôs haunted manor and face steeper challenges the higher up you go. The ‚Äúchallenge portion‚Äù has you complete specific challenges to get rewards whereas the ‚Äúraid mode‚Äù version of the castle merely has you fighting increasingly tougher foes.\n\n-The gem system has been replaced by a tome system in which you collect different colored books from fallen officers to unlock the skills and buffs for each character on a hexagonal grid. It‚Äôs very similar to the leveling up system in Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor‚Äôs Edge.\n\n-There‚Äôs no English voice acting but the written translations of what‚Äôs going on seems good enough.\n\n-Even on ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù the game can be pretty challenging on certain maps and enemies seem more prone to block or counter you. The artificial intelligence here seems just a bit more ‚Äúaware‚Äù then it has been in past musou titles.\n\n-The story mode is more character driven here than it was in the original vanilla version of SW4. Believe it or not there are some rather touching moments but when you‚Äôre not reaching for a handkerchief you‚Äôre having to endure some of the cheesiest camp ever cooked up in the land of the rising sun! However, most musou fans are accustomed to this as these games are very ‚Äúromanticized‚Äù and take their liberties with history. SW4 II is a lot like ‚ÄúGame of thrones‚Äù only it doesn‚Äôt take itself quite so seriously! Sure, people die and hearts are broken but there‚Äôs a distinct lack of blood, gore, incest, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Then again, depending on who you are that might be a good thing! Grim-dark realism isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.\n\n-Weapons are now upgraded in shops by fusing them together. Fusing weapons of a similar type is the best way to get results but it‚Äôs not necessary. Those of you familiar with the Orochi series will adapt to this type of upgrading right away. It‚Äôs pretty much the exact same system.\n\n-Combat in SW4 II is distinctly ‚Äúfaster‚Äù than in other musou titles. You can literally dash around at lightning speeds while knocking enemies together into the air as if they are a demented Katamari ball of human meat! ‚ÄúTeam combos‚Äù make a return too as when you‚Äôre close to your partner you can combine your might for some screen filling spectacles. Of course every character has their own signature attacks as well.\n\n-There are at least a few memorable emotion inducing soundtracks that really stand out and the music overall fits the theme of the game nicely.\n\n-On the battle field you can now switch between two characters with the mere press of a button. Believe me, this comes in handy!\n\n-Controller support included!\n\nOverall I ‚Äúdo‚Äù recommend SW4 II BUT I have a few caveats. One is that none of the characters gradually get new alternative outfits as they are leveled up. (Like in Warriors Orichi 2-3) Sure, you can get a ‚Äúbathing towel‚Äù for two female characters but that‚Äôs it. Prey your pockets are steep cuz it‚Äôs time to make way for DLC! Want extra levels? Want some sexy eye candy? Want some nice audio tracks from previous games? You can certainly have it but you‚Äôre gonna have to sell your organs or newborn child to be able to afford it all.\n\nIt was nice how in past musou games there were more unlockables but it feels as if SW4 II was a bit ‚Äúgutted‚Äù to string us along with multiple paid transactions.\n\nYou mad? Yeah, I don‚Äôt blame you and I even understand why people might sit out on this title because of the dlc shenanigans. Sure, musou games have had dlc for awhile now but the prices seem to be getting higher and the amount of ‚Äúin game content‚Äù to unlock is shrinking. SW 4 II makes that more painfully obvious than any warriors title before it.\n\nI love Koei/Tecmo but it‚Äôs my humble opinion they should treat their fans better. When the bulk of dlc content equates to over $100.00 (More than the game itself) it‚Äôs time to reprioritize the current business model!","June 4","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
