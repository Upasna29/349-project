"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flinchmeister/recommended/291480/","flinchmeister","flinch1031","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flinchmeister/","145 products in account","Alright, guys. Buckle your seat belts because this is gonna be a long review. Please remember that this consists of my opinion.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nWarface is a first-person shooter that has a Call of Duty-esque vibe to it. While some call it a CoD ripoff, I tend to disagree. Some people like it more than CoD, some don't. Having played both, I personally find Warface more entertaining than the more recent installments of the CoD franchise (i.e. MW3, Ghosts, Advanced Warfare).\n\nCAN I RUN IT?\n\nI have a modern day low-spec PC and I can run Warface comfortably with minimal to no lag (EDIT: by lag I mean framerate drops. You're welcome, salty guy in the comments. I took a whole minute out of my day to satisfy you even though I guarantee you will never read this review again.). Sorry about that. Anyways, obviously, it will run different for everyone. If you know your computer specs, you can use this website to find out if you can run it (No download required):\nhttp://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=1359&game=Warface\nI have found it to be pretty accurate for most games.\n\nSPECIFIC TOPICS\n\nHACKERS\nWhile many reviewers say the game is full of hackers, I disagree. I have played Warface for a reasonable amount of time and have not come across any hackers. The way the game is designed, it is common for a skilled - let me say that again, SKILLED player to obtain 50-60 kills in a single team deathmatch game. While it isn't too common, it isn't a rarity either. Newer players will commonly mistake these skilled players for hackers, but they are clearly not. However, I'm not saying there aren't hackers, because I'm sure there are.\n\nPAY TO WIN\nMany reviewers also say this game is pay to win. You can purchase Kredits and boosters that allow you to level up faster and purchase weapons and items that are superior to others. However, I have found that when I play matches I have more difficulty winning against skilled players with typical gear than players with lots of gear that just suck. So, yes, you can buy better stuff, no, it isn't that noticeable in the game.\n\nGAMEMODES\nThis game has three major categories: Co-op, Versus, and Special Operations (I have not yet unlocked Spec Ops so it will not be covered in this review).\nIn Co-op, up to five players can play in Regular, Skilled, and Advanced missions to obtain checkpoints and goals in order to get experience and money. (I recommend learning the basics of the game before jumping into Co-op)\nVersus is where you will be most often. You will start out being able to play Team Deathmatch, Free for All, and Plant the Bomb (which is basically Casual mode from CS:GO). After achieving rank 9 you will unlock other gamemodes like Capture (Capture the Flag), Storm (Attack and Defend), Domination, and a couple others that I can't remember at the moment. Players below rank 9 are considered "Rookies" and players above rank 9 are considered "Professionals". Rookies can only play with rookies and Professionals with Professionals.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCLANS\nThis game has clans, where your clan name appears above your username. I don't know too much about clans, but I know there is a way to play clan versus clan.\n\nTHE FREAKING SLIDE FEATURE HOLY CRAP\nOne of the selling points of this game is the slide feature. This is the coolest, most ridiculous feature I have ever seen in an FPS game. It is amazing. While you are sprinting, you can press a button (I don't remember the default key) to slide across the ground. You can ADS (aim down sight), shoot, switch weapons, reload, etc. while sliding. There is nothing more entertaining than sliding by an enemy with a sniper rifle or shotgun and shooting them in the face.\n\nCLASSES\nThere are 4 classes: Rifleman, Medic, Engineer, and Sniper. Rifleman has an assault rifle or light machine gun, a pistol, a frag grenade, a knife, and ammo boxes to replenish ammo for you or a team mate. Medic has a shotgun, pistol, knife, grenade, health kit (for yourself or a team mate), and a defibrillator. Engineer has a sub machine gun, pistol, knife, grenade, armor patches (to replenish armor for you or a team mate), and a claymore. Sniper has a sniper rifle, pistol, knife, and grenade.\n\nTEAM ASSIST\nYou and your team mates can help each other get to higher elevations by one team member giving the other a lift. You would be surprised by how many people will actually take 3 seconds out of their day to help you up a wall. I expected it to never happen, like trying to get helped up in TDM in CoD, but surprisingly, a lot of people will help you out.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\nYou can customize both your outfit and your username display in Warface. There are different helmets, boots, gloves, and armor that each have different stats and features. For example, a certain type of helmet will allow you to see enemy claymores and mines. You can also customize the way your username appears, with a certain pattern in the background and icons next to your name (these things have to be unlocked by getting achievements).\n\nBUGS/CONS\n\nSERVER LATENCY\nUnfortunately, the servers are not very impressive. Some servers are absolutely fine, but sometimes there are servers where it takes a fraction of a second longer to see that you got the kill (this is not my internet, this happens with other people too)\n\nTEAM COLLISION\nTeam collision is a little wonky in this game. Instead of feeling like you hit a brick wall like in CS:GO, you have more of a push-back feeling like running into a powerful fan. If you're not careful, you can fall of a narrow ledge if you and a team mate try and go at the same time.\n\nTHE RANKING UP BUG (Don't worry, it is only aesthetic)\nEDIT: THIS HAS BEEN FIXED AS OF October 2015\nWhen you rank up, it will tell you that you rank up to a rank higher than what you are. ALWAYS. It is not too big of a deal though. In the bottom left corner of the regular menu, it will show your correct rank number and name (For example, Rank 9: Private). On the experience progress bar, it will tell you what your next rank will be (For example, NEXT RANK: Private First Class) This is also correct information. However, when you actually rank up, it will tell you that you have become a rank one higher than what you are. So, when you reach Private First Class it will have a message that says You have received the rank Specialist! even though you have not. However, in the menu it will say Rank 10: Private First Class and the progress bar will say NEXT RANK: Specialist. So it's not a big deal, but definitely a noticeable one.\n\nCHOOSE YOUR NAME WISELY\nWhen you register for a Warface account, choose your username wisely. You will only be given the option to create your name once, so be sure its the one you want. If you decide someday that you really want to change your username, you can contact crytek support and they will change your name for you (I know this because I mispelled my name upon registry). They will only allow you to change your name once.\n\nVERDICT\n\nOverall, Warface is an extremely entertaining game for people that like the FPS genre. Although it has some issues (like all games), they ultimately don't affect the game as a whole all that much. I intend to put many more hours into this game. And in the end, DOWNLOAD IT! It's free to play so why not? If you don't like it, no harm done. There's an uninstall button for a reason.\n\nIf you liked the review, please let me know by hitting the thumbs up button below. Thanks, guys!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burn20/recommended/291480/","burn20","B.U.R.N","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burn20/","120 products in account","Well , some friends have finally convinced me to play this game. When I saw the trailer I was very confident and excited about this little title crytek have decided to launch. It showed me pretty interesting mechanics and things I have never seen in a free to play game. And when i actually saw that crytek made it i jumped up and i told myself : this means a new era for free to play games.\nWell , i was wrong . I was so very wrong.\n\nThe game\nThe game focuses on straight infantry combat. You start the game and jump right in the tutorial with no explanation about what is going on . Some female voice tells you everything that you need to know about classes , movement mechanics , weapons etc. After you finish the tutorial you get a weapon which only lasts a week ( I will talk about this MAJOR problem later on ) . You get to choose whether you want to jump in a game through matchmaking or through dedicated servers. I truly recommend dedicated servers because you can find a game faster and you skip the 20 minutes wait time until you find a server that is empty in matchmaking.\n\nThe gameplay\nThe gameplay itself has some next-gen elements in it , such as : helping a teammate climb a higher structure by boosting him up , reviving ( not really next-gen but oh well ) and also  SLIDING  . I said SLIDING in bold text because i want to point out that it is OP ( OverPowered )  , meaning that when you slide , you can also shoot. This makes it so that when you see a dude , slide and shoot towards him and he's dead. No matter his skill , level etc , he will not notice you and you will get an easy kill. It was slightly nerfed since i first played this game in the closed beta , but it is still OP.\nThe game also has classes , which are primitive and remind me of Battlefield 4 . You get the same generic classes you see in every shooter ( medic , sniper , engineer , and rifleman ) . The one that somehow stands out is the rifleman , which is somehow a support from Battlefield , but with the ability to give himself ammo without droping it .\nAnyway , you've probably played other shooters and you know how they handle.\nThe gunplay is very unbalanced. You start out with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons which are actually waterguns because all their stats are set to 1 ( out of 100 ) , and all of your enemies are higher levels with weapons that seem like very small miniguns combined with Counter Strike AWP's . In other words , you will lose every single battle if you don't have proper cover.\nThe maps are very small . Actually , they are smaller than Nuketown in Call of Duty . No need for more words here\n\nThe main problem with the game\nMICROTRANSACTIONS EVERYWHERE!!!!\nYes , you will be swarmed in little ads with weapons or clothing that doesn't do anything . These items will continue to appear on the screen until you buy them . And the worst part ? You will struggle to kill and kill and kill for money , money , money , and when you have enough money to buy another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ item with all the stats 2 , you will rage and throw your PC out the window when you will notice that it will only be available for one week . Of course , until you buy a Premium account that will cost extra money ( real money )\n\nThe final verdict Overall , i DO NOT recommend this game. Don't let the screenshots and trailers fool you. It's not worth it. It will never be , because this is what the corporations do to the developers: They make them create unfinished games like this one\n\n3.5/10","October 10, 2014","false","2.6"," 1,656 of 1,901 people (87%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","87","656","1","138","96"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/--zero--/recommended/291480/","--zero--","Meem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/--zero--/","27 products in account","UPDATE: 5/13/16\nI RAN OUT OF SPACE TO TYPE THINGS\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n***State of "Pay to win"***\nKredit items have made their way back into the game somehow, box weapons are now available in kredit boxes as "earth shaker skins", it's the same exact weapon just with a different coat of paint and buyable with kredits. There are also now "berets" that are reduced repair cost Warlord helmets which are arguably the best in the game. Quite frankly this kinda bothers me, because over the past few years they were trying to steer clear of this sort of thing, only to start bringing it back.\n\nRewards are mostly the same, progression is hindered without buying Mega VIP.\n\n"♥♥♥♥ you, buy our boosters".\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*\nSkilled mission without boosters\n$330-ish (varies depending on region the mission is in)\nAR-GAR rifle permanent purchase\n$42,000\n\nRepair on LMG4 after 12 minutes in skilled game room\n$160\n$330-160=$170\n\n$42,000/$170=247 games, provided you complete every single skilled you run also assuming you do not have any other degradable gear on. At an average of 12 minutes per mission it would take you 50 hours just to be able to get the AR-GAR rifle permanently.\n*\n\n*=reward amounts have changed slightly, but the idea is the same, kinda hard to make money without VIP.\n----------------------------------------\n\n***Cheaters***\nFairfight is in need of serious tweaking, cheating is going back to near pre-fairfight levels, you will find a cheater in every other room throughout the day in PVP.\n\nThere have been actions taken recently to enforce TOS, so be wary.\n\nDO NOT SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ANYONE\nDO NOT JOKE ABOUT CHEATING IN CHAT\nDO NOT WILLINGLY PLAY WITH CHEATERS (leave the game immediately if you see somebody blatantly cheating)\n\n\n***Lag/bugs/performance***\nThere have been some improvements to recent "freezes/frame drops", but they are still present and hinder gameplay massively. Netcode hasn't changed much for the better, so expect to scream at your screen frequently when you see blood pouring out of an enemies face and not getting 1 hit marker. Or "tanking" and teleporting. Bugs are everywhere in this game, from the spectator bug to weapons switching themselves back from selecting a smoke.\n\n\n***Gameplay***\n--------------------------\nPVE\n\nAI has degraded massively. PVE isn't nearly as fun as it used to be, it's almost as frustrating as PVP at times. Compared to last year, bots don't behave intelligently or normally like they used to; some walk off of spawn areas on elevated postions and basically suicide, others will walk directly to players and draw their pistols, they also like to twitch in place and have dance parties gathering in circles.\n\nBoss AI is the single most frustrating thing to deal with right now, they went from something players could learn how to deal with to being random and straight up bs sometimes.\n\nHeavy gunners target the nearest visible target or the last player to damage them, when they reload they can turn away from you... if they turn their back against a wall you can't damage them and have to spend that much longer waiting.\n\nMech's have a similar targetting system now, which makes hitting them so much harder when the mech is turning constantly.\n\nThe crown system is really only useful to players without a clan or that isn't able to make it on the clan ladder, the crown weapons are basically just a way to get box level weapons if you don't already have some (you will eventually get at least one by rank 20-30). Crown gear is nice to have but you end up wasting them because of how the rental system works (unless you plan on playing 24 hours a day). The bosses now make getting crowns kinda hard with pugs/random players.\n\nQuickplay matchmaking is based on rank, you won't find rooms easily unless you are higher ranked.\n------------------------------------------\n\nPVP\nSince Ranked matches were implemented the standard browser is VERY empty, making quickplay the only way to play certain game modes.\n\nTDM is your standard game mode. Aside from the small map sizes, the mode itself is fine and enjoyable.\n\nStorm had the potential to be a fun game mode, but coupled with the terrible autobalance system Warface has...\n-Instant respawns; if you get on the bad side of autobalance and your team decides it doesn't want to play the objective, offense and defense is impossible. You can be the best player in your server and it would be impossible to capture a point alone when you have an endless horde of players on defense spawning in as fast as they mash the spacebar.\n\n-Extremely one sided maps and general bad design. Some maps are extremely hard on offense (High Hill).\n\nDestruction isn't very popular, even though it's not a terrible game mode.\n\nPTB is popular among higher ranks, simple and competitive.\n\nFFA isn't as popular as you would think it would be, but it's fun enough.\n\nDomination is probably the least played mode in the game, it isn't that bad, it's just not that good lol.\n\nCapture is another elimination based game mode like PTB.\n\nRanked matches are currently the biggest POS in the game, you get matched with players of any rank, and half the time your opponents just leave the game giving you a free win, and there is absolutely nothing gained from ranking up at all.\n\nPVP currently is not very fun or rewarding due to terrible netcode and cheating, I do not recommend playing anything other than PTB regularly\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***Weapons/Gear***\nThis game has a hard time differentiating between weapons, and class based gameplay is hindered by gear and certain weapons. There are probably 3 or 4 smg's that are literally the same thing, there is a vest that negates a sniper shot, there's an SMG with the same damage as top tier rifles.\n\nThere is almost no reason at all to use certain weapons in the game if you have a box weapon or a good shop weapon. Nobody is using anything other than the best they have, you won't even see certain weapons being used in the game in PVE or PVP. Weapon stats from worst to best have wayyy too much of a gap... Why are half of the guns in the game even in the game??? (most of these are vendor items)\n\nWarlord gear dominates pretty much every other piece of gear in the game, but you can't maintain them all without VIP. Vest's with explosive protection pretty much save you from 1 grenade and leave you with 10% health to be 1 shot by the next player who see's you. Rapid fire protection sounds good in theory, but is pretty much useless unless somebody is using those bad vendor guns I mentioned.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***Community/Service***\nThe forums ("Warface hub") is basically a place for players to vent their frustration about lag and cheaters. Community moderators have been "hired" for a lack of a better word, but they don't have all the answers and are basically there to lock threads and delete posts.\n\nThe support site is basically "we work whenever we feel like it" and pre-typed responses. Don't expect a helpful reply in a timeful manner.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n***Final word/TLDR***\nA unique gem in the f2p market that is plagued by bad management and low quality of service. Cheaters are an issue just like most free to play games at some point or another. And "Pay-to-convience" in the form of progression.\n\nThe ONLY things that makes this game worth playing is the game mechanics, weapon collections, and (if you are a vet player) the bonds you make with clanmates raging about this game. I won't change my recommendation, because I still think this is a game people should at least experience once. If you can bring yourself to buy the boosters and devote time to the game, PVE at the very least can be enjoyable with friends.\n---------------------------------------","April 10, 2015","true","604.1"," 335 of 367 people (91%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","91","335","367","27","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krizzeus/recommended/291480/","Krizzeus","Krizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Krizzeus/","267 products in account","Before you say that I barely played this game then let me inform you that I played this game when it was in closed beta testing as a browser game about 10 months ago. I just downloaded it to try it now that its on steam to see if there are any big changes and here is what I found.\n\nThe game still has the same horrible cash shop as before and I really dislike cash shops like this where you can buy weapons and gear for real money, or you can buy them with ingame credits that takes a while to earn and the weapon only last for about 7 or 14 days (alot of guns are permanent though). The game does have decent balance between all the guns but I still don't like the cash shop system it has and you need to repair weapons.\n\nI play a bunch of different games so I don't have the time to no life in this game for 7 or 14 days and grind. The best kevlar and helmet can only be bought for the co-op currency and only last 14 days. That system really sucks for me since if I buy something that last 14 days but I only play 7 days then I obviously lose on it. I am also not interested in the co-op part of the game.\nThe cash shop also seems to rotate a few weapons every 2 weeks that are only available for real money and only last 7 days.\n\nThe game has very small maps, granted some people might actually like that but I really hate these incredibly small maps where you can spawn and throw a grenade to the enemy spawn, it also just encourages a bunch of nade spamming and camping and spawn killing.\n\nThe dedicated / peer 2 peer / lobby server system is a good idea with potential but as it is right now after you play 1 map it takes forever for the next one to start on most servers because people always seem to leave and the host has to start each new match manually it seems but this could be cause the game is in beta. There are also always people that lag in every single match.\n\nThe games graphics are not that good on max settings. I know graphics are not everything but when they keep using it as a selling point and even on steam they keep bragging about "cryteks cry engine" for example this is what it says under features of this game: "Expect the best – Crytek's trademark quality meets free-to-play gaming" You kinda expect them to deliver but they really don't, this game looks like its from 2008.\n\nSo to sum it up: Game has bad cash shop, small maps with nade spam and campers and spawn killing, lobby server system with hosts that is buggy, laggy and slow. Graphics are not as good as they advertise them to be. Overall "feel" and "smoothness" of the game is really weird in my opinion and I just don't enjoy it that much. If you play this game then please look at the characters movements and stuff in the game and you'll see how sluggish, weird and awkward everything is.\n\nKeep in mind this is just my opinion of the game, feel free to download the game since its f2p and try it for yourself, I am sure plenty of people will like this game.\n\nOh for all the people defending the game and saying its in beta, then yeah it is, but its been in beta for like 1 year now and the same problems exist now as they did back then, so to me that is no valid excuse. If you like the game and thats your opinion then good for you, but please stop defending the game by simply saying "its in beta, what do you expect" bla bla bla.","July 1, 2014","false","6.1"," 3,236 of 3,914 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","236","3","2","227"

It had many flaws then and was clearly not finished.\n\nLittle has changed. The servers are still a mess, the weapons are unsatisfying and the UI is awful.\n\nIf you want a fun tactical shooter, play a CS. If you want a realistic shooter, play ARMA, or Insurgency. If you want a casual, no skills needed shooter, there is CoD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/recommended/291480/","sdoots","Sdoots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/","354 products in account","Warface is a bad game.\n\nLike most F2P games, you'll need to make an account. No big deal, just a hassle. You also will have to put up with Warface using its own independent launcher, which means it updates outside of Steam. When Marvel Heroes has shown that F2P games can update from the Steam platform with few headaches, it's hard to give launchers a pass anymore.\n\nAnyways, the game proper is very fond of its status as a co-op focused FPS. And Warface is, in fact, a co-op focused FPS. On the surface, it looks like you have a great new game for you and your buddies. Each day, a new rotation of missions is put in play, requiring you to complete the lower tiers of dificulty before the harder missions become available. So you'll do some mindless shooting, then get down to more objective based missions, and then get your ♥♥♥ handed to you in the highest tier content. Fun, right? No. Not fun. Don't you ever make that mistake again.\n\nThe thing about this content "climb" is that there's no matching progression on the player side. You'll easily complete those first two missions each day, and then naively jump into the newly unlocked mission only to get absolutely slaughtered. You might make some progress, but eventually, there's a point where the game reminds you that you aren't using the "cool stuff" yet, and will have you looking for the "quit game" button.\n\nOn top of its hamfisted attempt at forcing players to spend money to have fun, the game doesn't always tell you the whole story. When you first start the game, you get a message saying that you can do a quick tutorial, and as a reward, they'll give you a free gun, a pair of gloves, and some in game currency. Having played the game in an earlier beta, I jumped on that offer.\n\nOf course, after completing the training and looking at my inventory, I discovered that both the gun and gloves were set to expire in 24 hours. Nowhere did it tell me that beforehand, and they had never said it'd be a permanent reward, but it still comes across as gross and impersonal.\n\nThere are four classes in Warface, but for some reason, the devs have locked two of them away until you reach certain points in your ranking progression. This is great, because every match needed to be nothing but guys with sniper rifles and M16s. Who needs medics and engineers? This wasn't the case in the earlier build I played, and is a mindboggling change. Do they think players won't understand how the complicated mechanics of "equip this, click to heal" work?\n\nThere is PVP as well, but it's an afterthought that you'd be better off ignoring. Honestly, I suggest you ignore this game entirely. Everything is designed in such a way that they hope you'll be tempted to open your wallet (Hey, you may be dead, but if you spend some money, you can revive yourself. Blatant disregard for our own games design is meaningless when it means making a quick buck!), unlocking new guns, attachments, and equipment is both luck and a grind. You have to select one of the three you'd like to work towards, and you can't choose which item in each you are working for. So if you don't want that sniper suit in the outfit section, well, it's going to stay the only thing you will get from outfit until you give up and unlock it over something in weapons or attachments. Great.\n\nI had last played Warface during the closed beta, what feels like a year ago now. With the release on Steam, I was surprised to find that the game has actually actively become worse. The developers think you are an idiot, and will spend money at the slightest provocation. Don't prove them right.","July 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 227 of 295 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","227","295","0","16"

Well, I'll start out by saying that I was part of the very early closed betas of warface, and played it almost daily starting around Febuary 2013 until about November 2013. I had a large group of friends I played with, and one by one they slowly stopped. Back then, it was pretty buggy and there were a lot of hackers, so once I saw that Warface was posted on Steam, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nI really genuinely enjoyed playing Warface. Cumulative between betas, I invested about 250-400 hours. (All stats and time counters reset every time a new beta started, or large changes were made so it was hard to keep track.) It was a great free to play game with a lot of maps and options. Around this time one year ago, they implemented the kredit system, so people could invest real hard earned money for weapons, boxes, armor, etc. I, being very into the game spent about $200 (regretfully) over the course from October to November 2013. I was dead set on getting the PEG Bullpup shotgun. All $200 was spent, and I was left without the shotgun. A friend of mine rolled ONE box, and got it first try. I was furious. Ultimately, this is why I stopped playing almost a year ago.\n\nFast forward to when it posted on steam, I decided to reinstall the game and try again. Now, when it posted on Steam, you could use the actually gold currency to buy boxes. I still had about $800,000 from when I played, so I said screw it and tried for the PEG Bullpup again. (Kredits are the real money currency, and gold is acquired from PVP and PVE missions) If you have played Warface, you can understand JUST HOW MUCH $800,000 is. I used every freaking dollar and did not get the gun.\n\nTL;DR The gameplay is great, if youre in a lobby with well rounded players or have some friends to play with. The pay-to-win factors kills any enjoyment of actually unlocking stuff.\n\nI'll probably continue to play this game, and hate myself for doing so.","October 14, 2014","false","22.4"," 325 of 449 people (72%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","72","325","449","47","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/291480/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","OVERVIEW\n\nWarface is a first person shooter that mix PvP & Co-op element. It is developed by Crytek which they are known for their WOW graphics in their Crysis game. This game seem to take ideas of Call Of Duty military shooter,Battlefield class system mix with Crysis real-time weapon attachments. The question is. Is the game good enough or it just another generic shooter that we play over the past 10 years ?\n\nGAMEPLAY : 7/10\n\nWhen you start off the game,you are given to create your own soldier. Sadly all you do is just choose faces and all of them are generic looking. Before this game even come out on Steam,they removed a female characters due to controversy. Now all you get is just another every generic soldier with zero personality.\n\nHere is the images of the female characters :\nhttp://media.pcgamer.com/files/2013/10/warface_featured.jpg\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/dkp34kx2p/warface.jpg\nhttp://www.war-face.ru/sites/default/files/13/05/new-female-characters.jpg\n\nYou basically have 4 classess total to choose from and all of them play differently with each of them having their own pros & cons. The problem is that you need to play certain co-op mission to unlock the medic & engineer. Seriously ????\n\nYou able play either Co-op modes or PvP modes. The Co-op modes basically have seven mission. Even though certain mission offer different objectives,it pretty much barebone with no effort put into it and it hard to find match due to afk host. You could play with lesser player but you will die even more faster because of no backup. The Ai is simply a charging idiot and they don't take cover unless they are inside the building. The PvP modes offer six types of modes to choose from. Those six modes is nothing new and have been done to death in many first person shooter game.\n\nUnlike certain games where you can charge and almost own most people,this game require teamwork especially you need somebody to help you climb a certain obstacle so that a plus.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nWhile the game looked quite good for some people,i expect it to be even more better considering it is built in CryEngine 3. However since it is a free 2 play games and many people with low specs PC wanted to try this,i let it slide.\n\nThe environment and texture details on some terrain,objects and weapon are neatly done. The character models is not what i expect to see in a CryEngine games but it acceptable nonetheless.\n\nMy only complaint is that like most shooter is the color settings. Most of the times i stare is puke brown environment which gives an impression that this game had a very dull feeling into it.\n\nThere is not much graphics settings you can fiddle around with. The interface is well done and doesn't block most of your view.\n\nCertain animation that plays out are done badly as well as the ragdoll physic which felt stiff.\n\nAUDIO : 7/10\n\nWhile certain guns actually sound good and packed a punch,some of it just sound bad like an air gun or pee shooter.\n\nAs far as i know there is barely any ambience in the game which make the game feel lifeless.\n\nVoice acting is pretty ok,nothing extraordinary but it good nonetheless.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 4/10\n\nTo be honest the game get extremely boring very fast. It bugs me why this game isn't in early access version since it lacked some content especially the shop.\n\nPvP modes is extremely generic and co-op modes that only offer short lasting fun.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 6.3/10\n\nIt up to you whether you want to try this game out but i wouldn't recommend this game at it current state despite it acceptable scores. The whole game just felt lacking in content and it need some polish. It still p-i-sses me off that they remove the female character in favor of making a generic male characters. Not to mentioned the game is pay 2 win too so yeah you might want to avoid this game.\n\nGRADE : D ( Not Bad )","July 2, 2014","false","1.2"," 84 of 119 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","84","119","0","6"

Crytek started loosing money...\n\nIt was a shock for me and for a last minute attempt they put thier cryengine up for sale but it was not doing so well so they made *WARFACE* A free to play tactical shooter,to show off cryengine, but people I dont think realised that... people hated the PAY2WIN which you know,  im not fussy about I just enjoy the game but not so long ago... Cryrek went bankrupt and shut down... it was a sad time for me and every Crysis fan in the world... and that is why I recomend this game, grab a friend play Warface, its the last you`ll ever see of Crytek, no more Crysis, no more games...\n\n♥Goodbye Crytek♥","July 16, 2015","true","8.7"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","43","55","8","5"

It’s full of hackers.\n\nCrytek use Fairfight to try and stop them and they have built a report feature into the game but when you report a cheat nothing seems to happen.  For every hacker that’s banned several more seem to appear.  This leads to lack of trust amongst honest players and genuinely good players being accused of hacking all the time. Often it’s hard to have any trust that the person who won the round did it fairly, there’s so many hackers who knows.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic and very addictive, the weapons feel great to use, loads of good upgrades, it’s certainly a great game but expect to see plenty of cheaters – For me this outweighs all the good aspects it’s a thumbs down unfortunatly.\n","May 27","false","133.5"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","1"

While it can be a fun enough game, there's a fair amount of cons that ruin the fun. I do and don't recommend this game, and here's why :\n\nPros :\n-Guns don't completely overpower one another\n-The game keeps you going by having to unlock things\n-Most Co-Op missions are swapped out daily\n-Fair amount of upgrades for your character\n-Co-Op requires a good amount of teamwork\n*This also means that the team has to consist of at least 3 of the 4 classes with a team of 3^, if you want to be successful\n-Easy-to-use controls\n-Actions are easy to do and are beneficial\n\nCons :\n-Co-Op isn't that great, gets boring after the first few co-op missions\n*The game requires players to play Co-Op to unlock some new gear\n-Most weapons require real money to keep permanently, instead of 1, 7, or 30 days\n-PvP isn't very fun after a while due to various reasons:\n*People dropshot too often\n*Spawn camping is insane\n*Medics serve little purpose in PvP since you can respawn right after death\n*Maps are incredibly small, disabling a need for any tactical play\n*Snipers are rendered useless on almost every map, due to the small map size\n-Co-Op gets to be a bit repetitive\n-Great weapons are cheap, allowing new players to get an amazing weapon\n*This is both a pro and a con, but listed under con because it takes away some of the purpose of Co-Op\n-Medic is used more for close quarters rather than reviving teammates\n*The medics are equipped with a shotgun, while other classes aren't\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anybody who's played Fps's (First-Person-Shooters) such as CoD when it was good (Before MW3 in my opinion), Battlefield, and Rainbow Six. Don't expect the game to be amazing, for me it's more a game to play when I'm bored with nothing else to do.\n\n\n","November 13, 2014","true","19.2"," 316 of 518 people (61%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","61","316","518","29","9"

Guns take forever to buy because earning money is such a grind, and when you eventually do earn enough money for a new weapon guess what? You are only able to use it for a limited time. Reminds me of that one f2p Combat Arms, or even AvA. . Moving on to the co-op. The co-op is so painfully generic and is still probably more fun than playing pvp because of no overpowered opponents. You can also potentially grind the co-op missions against AI to earn currency that buys you weapons and gear that could even aid you in pvp. In the end the game wants you to buy currency to get the best weapons and gear possible.\n\nThe game is only a 3gb install, so if you are that desperate give it a try, and maybe play 2 or 3 matches and judge it for yourself. The starting weapons and gear are decent, and I was going positive every round with them too. In my opinion though, it's another pay2win f2p game that is just way below average.\n\nPros:\n- "Team Play/Tactical." (Co-operation is needed)\n- Starting equipment is good. (Still possible to do well in game)\n- Co-op can be "fun."\n- Swapping weapon attachments on the fly. (This is probably the best thing about the game)\n\nCons:\n- Earning cash is a grind.\n- Movement is clunky. (Rocks in your boots)\n- Pay2win. (It's possible to just outright buy weapons and gear)\n- Buying weapons is basically a renting service. (Basically buying an item to try it out for 7 days)\n- Graphics are way below average, Battlefield 2 kinda looks better in quality.\n(That is if you care how the game looks, some people don't care)\n- Minimal options in the menu. (Again that is if you care, about FOV, and different graphical options)\n- Gun play is clunky.\n- UI is a mess. (Constant menus)\n- All the maps feel the same. (Maps are so generic, no point in caring about what map you are on)\n\nI'd give it an honest 5/10\nBelow average but still worth a try I guess...even then if you want a tactical shooter you should try Counter Strike, or Arma.","July 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 93 of 142 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","93","142","0","2"

It's impossibly generic, remarkably fake, ludicrously detrimental to your health, and yet, somehow, still mildly enjoyable.\n\nThe Good: The class system is robust, but still largely functional, the weapons are decently balanced, and it looks pretty darn good, while not being a massive resource eater.\n\nThe Bad: Absolutely no originality, the transition between levels is a Disneyland kiddie ride, and the conrtrols are a tad... off-putting (for me at least)\n\nThe Ugly: The "Crowned" items give this game a moderate case of "Pay2Win" Syndrome, and you help your teammates cllimb walls by shoving your fingers up their butts. :c\n\nTL;DR: A nice, casual, generic, free shooter that's great for killing time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hobokiin/recommended/291480/","Hobokiin","Copenhagen Long Cut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hobokiin/","120 products in account","Terrible. Wasted a few GB of space on my harddrive, and a night of downloading on my terrible internet (DSL, live in the middle of nowhere). Do not waste your time with this pile of garbage. On the website, " Players can also slide" is used to advertise some of the *very few* features of this game. Players can also slide? Really? It is clear that there are really no other good examples to use for advertising this game. There's a reason it is free to play. But then again, plenty of other things are free too, such as dog feces, rotten food, used condoms, trash, etc.\n\nPay to win. You can chose to grind for countless hours to earn a gun. The items you buy last for only 7 or 14 days, then you have to start all over again. I personally do not have the time or attention span to grind this game non stop, only to have my efforts taken away in one or two weeks. Or you can waste your cash on items in-game. Of course you can buy a gun permanently, but you HAVE to spend real world money on it.\n\nGraphics are terrible. All the settings were maxed out, on a machine that is more than capable of running most games on max settings, updated drivers, etc., still looked terrible. Normally, I don't mind bad graphics in a game. This game was advertised as having great graphics and the lot. Crytek brags about how "Immersive play is ensured with high quality graphics". The gameplay is far from immersive, and the high quality graphics is a blatant lie. While I don't mind bad graphics, I hate it when companies blatantly lie to the consumer.\n\nAnnoying. You have to sign up for some dumb GFACE account in order to play. GFACE is basically another rip off of Origin, which is already a terrible piece of software. That takes some time, then of course you have to confirm the email address. Obviously, the company sells your email address to some spam sites, who appear to assume that I must want to buy viagra or something. Luckily, I used 10minutemail.com to avoid the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Logging in to play the game each time takes forever to load. An easy solution would be to just use Steam, but for some reason the devs don't want to.\n\nI must admit a few things, or else this would be useless hate speech. The game is built off of a great, solid game engine. The engine gave it potential, but the developers ruined it. The size of game compared to the amount of content is not too bad. For example; Payday 2 has not a ton of content, but the game is massive (30+GB before a recent update). This game is very small, could be good space optimization or lack of conent, I don't really care either way.\n\nTo sum everything up, it is a game with great potential, ruined by greedy and lazy developers. Players, particularly ones with access to their parents credit card, will buy things over and over again with real world money. They will put a little bit of money in at a time, until they end up spending small amounts of money frequently in the same way that someone with a real world addiction does. The developers know this, and couldn't care less about the quality of their games, as long as that pay check keeps rolling in. I'm not really trying to insult the people that do the actual building of the game, but rather the people in charge of what gets developed, "executives", if you will. Yes, I know from personal experience how crazy difficult and time consuming it is to develop ANYTHING, even a simple terminal app with very basic UI. It hurts me to call a developer lazy, but I feel I must do so in this case.\n\nThank you for reading this guide, and please mark as "helpful" so that others may see this review as a warning before they waste any time with this game. Sorry for any poor English/grammar; I'm a gamer, not a professor.\n\nIn the event that this review gains popularity, and some foreheads start commenting hate towards me, I will not be replying.\n\nI will NOT be reccomending this game to my book club","July 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","2"

If you're into pvp/being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥/playing solo.. this ISN'T for you. If you won't heal your team mates, repair their armor or give them ammo.. sniper is the class for you.. but then we don't have alot of need for you.\n\nThe co-op part is very challenging at harder difficulties where you will need to coordinate and work as a team, while you can mostly just rush and shoot like a maniac on the easier difficulties.\n\nThe difficulties are "initiation", "regular", "skilled" and "hardcore", in ascending order, obviously.\nWhen you reach skilled, you start to realize how much you actually need your team. Hardcore is impossible if you don't work as a team. You will need someone to do two of the following; keep you stocked on ammo, repair your armor and heal you. This while you do the third one to the others.\nGames are played in groups of FIVE, so you can experiment a bit with a set up, you might even need a sniper, what do I know, right? ;-)\n\nMy final words are these;\nIt's definitly worth a try if you like co-op games, the pvp part is just not worth it.","July 16, 2014","true","23.6"," 79 of 126 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","79","126","0","2"

Even if you buy certain items you'll notice soon enough that you'll also lose alot of Warface dollars with each repair of your purchased item. Each map you play will cost you a certain amount of Warface dollars just because of the repair they charge you. The more expensive your purchased items are, the higher the price will be for the repair.\nSo, the more you play, the more money you'll lose unless you don't use your pruchased items.\nThe only way to be able to play the game properly is to buy alot of kredits (which again cost alot of REAL money!!!) and once you've done that you'll see that the game is a bottomless pit. Even if you'd buy 12,000 kredits (which is € 99.99), you'll end up buying kredits again if you wanna keep on playing the game the way you like it.\nThe game itself is very good but the fact that it is only based on dragging money out of your pocket makes it a game I really do NOT recommend. The more you play, the more repairs you'll have. The more expensive items you've purchased, the more money you'll lose due to each repair.\nTo be able to play properly against "powerful enemies" you need to unlock certain weapons and items and for that you need kredits. Kredits can only be purchased with REAL MONEY!\nBecause of the "repair of each purchased item" and the whole "item rental" idea you'll always end up losing money and crowns. SO THINK MORE THAN TWICE BEFORE YOU START SPENDING MONEY ON AND IN THIS GAME!!!\nThe weapons in de dlcs are inferior to those you need to unlock which ultimately can be done by spending money... AGAIN!\nAnother downside in this game is the very high number of hackers and cheaters which is I guess because the game is free. And as a matter of fact playing against these hackers and cheaters will only cost you your hard earned Warface dollars and crowns because of the repairs you have to pay each time you play a map. The repairs are only for the purchased items, so if you don't wanna have any repairs, you need to play with the default equipment.\nThe players you have been playing with recently aren't visible in steam either, which is also very strange. In fact unlike other games only a few things about this game are visible in steam.\nFriends cannot be invited to the game through steam and your friends also need to have at least rank 9 in Warface to join you in a PvP game. The last is to prevent the noobs from being butchered by the pros but it also makes playing with your friends in a private room impossible unless they ranked up enough.\n\nNowadays "free" games take more money out of your pocket than a game you have to pay for...","July 18, 2015","false","124.3"," 67 of 105 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","67","105","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdehBox/recommended/291480/","BirdehBox","^1BirdehBox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdehBox/","114 products in account","I'm going to start this off by saying that this game USED to be fun, it used to be enjoyable and playable, playing against your own rank and with guns that were relatively the same as everyone else's. But all of that has changed. They made the game even laggier than it already was for low ended PC's, they made it even more pay to win than it already was and even more BUGGIER than it already was.\n\nThe Bad\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe hit detection is horrible, sliding messes it up and causes a massive confusion among players as to why they won't die. Head glitching, is a major issue among snipers, as only snipers can kill the snipers due to the innacuracy of most weapons. I can get an 8 kill streak by spraying with an assault rifle, and get taken out by someone sliding. This is when you know that not much skill is taking place in a game.\n\nThe game is more pay to win than ever, I might as well say pay to get anything past the starter weapons. I personally just launch a game, go in and kill people, and with weapons that cost money, this is impossible. I can be top of a team, as an entirely f2p player, just to have the match end, and my gun repair costs being more expensive than my income from the match. I ACTUALLY LOSE MONEY FOR DOING GOOD.\n\nThe community is terrible, occasionally you may run into the scum of the world which I don't even have to describe, if you can name it, you can find it. I can tell my team to heal me, give me ammo, give me armor, and no one will even respond. All everyone cares about is taking as many kills as possible... Not the Objective... Not the teamplay... Not even the sanity of others.\n\nThe game is way too fast paced. Grenades are thrown halfway across the map, while running and jumping. Explosions all around and no way to escape the death that is about to turn a corner and murder you. If you have a lower ended PC, you can't even catch up in fps before you're dead. Yeah sure, you have a lot of health, but what is it worth when that person turning a corner has a 1 shot shotgun?\n\nThe developers are greedy. Never once have I seen an update for this game, and liked it. I played this game a year ago, and there wasn't half as many purchasable items as there is now. Their updates never fix anything, resolve issues the community has with the game or even helps the people who are actually good at fps, be anywhere close to being good at this game.\n\nYou need a separate account from steam, to play this game. I see several problems with this.\n\n1. Hackers can just create a new account with a new email, and get right back to it.\n2. Anyone that plays with higher ranking people will just create a new account, and start killing fresh noobs.\n3. It requires a 2 step process, to get into a horrible game.\n\nThe game is slow in every aspect. If you want to join a server, you'll have to wait 3 minutes for the game to find you a lobby, then when the game launches, another 2 minutes for everyone to load up. When you get to the end of a game, you get a nice pointless cutscene pointing to a team, which then takes another 2 minutes to load back into the lobby. I probably spent more time loading than I did playing.\n\n\nThe Good\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was able to uninstall quickly.\n\nOverall Review\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game is broken, those playing might not be aware of it but it is. Do not get this game if you have a slow PC, are easily angered or just downright hate the idea of a fast paced shotgun spraying game filled with kids.\n","June 29, 2015","false","48.9"," 132 of 222 people (59%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","59","132","222","35","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadster/recommended/291480/","roadster","Breaking Bad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadster/","72 products in account","My Background in other FPS games (context): 1,500 hours in CSGO. Thousands of hours in the Battlefield franchise. A few hundred hours in Call of Duty games.\n\nMaps and Game Play: The Warface maps are small--smaller even than Counter Strike, which is criticized for small maps. I'm not impressed with the Warface maps. They don't lend themselves to holding angles like CSGO. They aren't big like Battlefield. They aren't even tactically as good as COD. I struggle to understand the map design. They don't promote skill based play.\n\nSo if we're not holding angles and have precision based shooting like CSGO. And we're not dealing with a larger, tactical map like Battlefield. What are we doing in Warface?\n\nYou can do these unrealistic, arcade style slides? 9 times out of 10, I easily kill the arcade slider in close combat.\n\nThe other terrible game mechanic is toggling rapidly between laying prone and standing up. You can switch so fast that it looks like a  supernatural zombie. In medium to close combat, expect the prone toggler but its not that hard to spray them down.\n\nI enjoyed playing the game, but the maps and gameplay options just get old. The prone toggling and arcade sliding, while fun at first, don't lend themselves to long term game play.\n\nPay to Play or Win: You can pay for better weapons. Some claim you can get these weapons for free by grinding XP. Yes, you can.\n\nBut you can't afford to use them afterwards! Try using some of the best weapons, armor, boots, etc in the game. You will pay HUGE repair costs after each mission. You will pay more for the repair costs than you made on the mission. Forget pay to win. It's pay to play.\n\nThink about it. It's a free game. Repair costs are there to force you to pay to use the weapon. The whole game mechanic is designed to force you to spend money (or the game can't exist). Or not be able to use the weapons you either purchased or unlocked through grinding levels and XP.\n\nHacks: If you have played other FPS games, you know there will always be hacks. Rather than a real anti-cheat that detects when the game's memory has been compromised, they opted for Fair Fight. Fair Fight is a performance based anti-cheat, where if you play substantially better suddenly you can be banned. There's other factors as well.\n\nThe problem is hack sites that sell wallhacks and aimbots also provide guides for getting around Fair Fight. A lot of it is common sense about doing better slowly, not following people through walls, not following people who can't see you, etc.\n\nI've seen more wallhacks in Warface than I saw in CSGO, Battlefield, and COD combined. It's infested. There's even people in game advertising hack sites. It's easy (but not always reliable) to scream aimbot in any game. The truth is, any aimbot shot COULD have been made by a skilled player. It's easier for me to spot a wallhacker and in Warface, there's always going people who ALWAYS know where everyone is.\n\nI have seen dozens of people Fair Fight banned. I just think with the guides out there for getting around Fair Fight, many are getting around it.\n\nDevelop a real anti-cheat that detects when the game has been hooked.\n\nSummary: If you want a Battlefield type of game, with super small maps, less tactical options, and prone togglers, then play this game.\n\nIf you get beat in other FPS games, just spend money on this game. You can buy super fast boots that make you run much faster. You can buy health regenerating vests that will take you from near death to 100%. You dream it--you can buy it. And maybe even win, assuming you find a game without a wall hacker. ;)","January 16","false","35.3"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","28","39","3","3"

There are several issues which seem to ♥♥♥♥ off the majority of the people who play or attempt to play it. I'll try to provide some clarity in the murkiness of other reviews.\n\nThe game is set in a dystopian-future senario, which completely lacks originality: there is some big evil multinaitonal corperation that has taken over the world's economy, resulting in the loss of nations in the traditional sense and a new age of tyranny. This organization uses a corrupt mercenary force known as "Blackwood" to keep the peace and enforce the will of the New World Order. Standing against them is a band of spec ops soldiers from across the globe, who have teamed up to form a rebel group known as "Warface."\n\nWarface has two modes, versus and co-op. Versus is your standard multiplayer experience, with four classes that have distinct weapons and distinct abilities at your disposal (Assault/Soldier, Recon/Sniper, Demolitions/Engineer, and Medic). Generally speaking, as is with most FPS's, multiplayer is multiplayer, and since the game is from the same company (EA) as the Battlefield series and is, as I believe, based off of the game Crossfire, there is nothing particularly new and exciting or innovative about versus.\n\nCo-op is where Warface defines itself as a game apart from the rest. In Co-op, teams of between 2 to 5 players take on the roles of the four classes as members of the Warface rebel group, and complete missions which change every day based on map, objective, and difficulty. Daily, there are 6 missions: 1 or 2 initiation-level (for new players), 1 or 2 reuglar-level (once-you've completed all the training for the different classes), 1 skilled-level (the general "medium" level), 1 hardcore-level (for experienced players), and 1 tower-level (a sort of arcade mission where you progress level by level up the tower of Blackwood's HQ). The maps, and furthermore, the routes and objectives in said maps, for each of the difficulties, changes daily, as said before; I only mention it again because I thoroughly enjoy this element of randomization that requires you to be on your toes every day. Because of this, a frequent Warface player who has become dedicated to the game will be rewarded by ever-changing gameplay.\n\nThere are, unfortunately, many problems that arise when it comes to co-op, which has dissuaded many people from playing this most unique and exciting mode of Warface.\n-1) Anyone with connection issues or graphics issues will find that, in co-op, where truly team-based play is required, such issues are compunded and result in greater frustration and a terrible gamign experience for all.\n-2) Too many players approach this game like it's Call of Duty. Which means that they run around selfishly focusing on getting kills, instead of working together as a team to complete objectives (whish usually involves killing lots of opponents anyway). Such players will not share their ammo (if they are soldiers), provide covering fire for teammates (if sniper), replenish teammate's armour (if engineer), or heal others (if medic). If even one of these duties isn't done, then the whole team is guarenteed to lose.\n-3) The co-op gmaing community is generally unfriendly towards new players. They automatically assume that all pople who play immediately after completing trianing missions should be able to complete even the hardest difficulties (which aren't even availible unless you've completed the easy difficulties!). They hurl names and will refuse to help new player sor overlook obivous deficiancies, thereby destroying the cohesiveness of the team even further.\n-4) It can be difficult to unlock new guns. You have to buld up one of the variety of Warface currencies by completing missions, which never give you enough, so that you can choose from what is daily a small selection of weapons, some of which you cannot purchase permenantly.\n\nBut I still believe that Warface is one of the best FPS's out there. In co-op, I have finally found the kind of game I have been waiting for for years: a truly team-based mission experience that is challenging, ever-changing, and truly unique. Despite the difficulties and problems, I still love this game, and would recommend it to anybody looking for a genuine team-based FPS experience.\n\nI rate Warface at 7 out of 10.","July 24, 2014","true","49.1"," 71 of 119 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","71","119","0","7"

I decided to write this review and come up with a counter argument for each of the most popular criticisms.\n\n"Pay to win" Its F2P what do you expect?  They do need to make money!  Its actually much less P2W then other games I've played.  The P2W part is that you can use real money to buy "Kredits" which you can use to buy in game items xp boosts and revive coins, I'm going to address each of these seperatly.\n\nWeapons: Most of the weapons you can buy with Kredits you can also buy with in game money and only last a certain amount of time therefor making it under powered.  Even if you can't buy it with in game money you can usually find a gun almost equal to it and buy that, even if you had all the best items in the game a guy who just started playing could beat you, its more about skill than anything else.\n\nXP Boosts: Pretty much what it sounds like, you get x amount of xp toward the next rank for completing a lvl and an xp boost increases the mount for a bit, not not necesary not OP not a problem.\n\nRevive Coins: The most P2W item in the game, basicly you use revive coins when you die (ONLY in PVE not PVP) to come back to life, you have a limit of 3 per lvl, kinda P2W'ish but not horrible, you can choose to buy them or not you can have fun either way.\n\nMy final point is that its free, even if it isn't as good as Battlefield or Call of Duty its fun and its something new and different, why not give it a try?  It might surprise you.\n\nlooking through the most helpful reviews this week i noticed that most of them are positive, aparently the negative ones are from a long time ago before the game improved.","August 24, 2014","true","145.0"," 68 of 117 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","68","117","6","2"

Also, I'm not sure how P2W comes into play during the game, but I didn't explore much.\n\nI only managed to squeeze out three matches before I ragequit. One co-op and two PVP, FFA and capture the point(? didn't catch the name).\n\nThe co-op was just a wreck. My friend and I drop right into the action, this is great, I kill around 10 enemies before I start running out of ammo, as does he. I see the yellow ammo icon above his head and with my deductive and reasoning skills, I figure that means I'm some type of ammo bearer and I need to replenish his ammo, either that or they're just saying he's low on ammo. I'm pressing buttons, going close to him and pressing 'E', nothing works. So I assume our ammo refills after a wave and continue playing. He dies, and I use my final clip to eliminate the enemy in front of him and run over to help. From my Call of Duty co-op skillz, I assume all I have to do is run over to him and press 'E' and my character will pull out some small thing, stab him in the face with it and he'll be all better....it doesn't happen. I'm smashing 'E' all around to no avail, then he says 'There should be a message that says Press E to revive', but I didn't see that. Then I take on about three other enemies with a pistol and finally die. This was all within 2-3 minutes of the mission, we hadn't even moved out of that grove yet. That's a good introduction to the game, even though I'm aware that I did NOT complete the tutorial, where are all the tooltips?\n\nWell, we decided to join a PvP match next. As a decent CoD player, I'm quickly getting excited as I plan to do well with the first gun at least. We join a FFA already in progress and I'm introduced to this incredibly frame stuttering. Every few seconds, whenever I pull a grenade, if someone comes into my screen, what's going on? I manage to pull through, though. What really irked me was the size of this map, I failed to get the name but it seemed to be a really small village with corners EVERYWHERE. I couldn't even count to 5 before someone spawned out of the area I JUST spawned from and unloaded a shotgun into my back. I finished at around 12/12, but didn't let that discourage me, as the next game would surely be better since I would be starting along with everyone else at the same time.\n\nSo back on the menu, I hit ready and await the game to start. I sit there for about 1 minute before I notice it says everyone else is already in game and I'm just ready. I see a green message on top telling me I'm connecting, but nothing's happening. So I try to quit, but there's no clickable back button or X button, so I have to ALT-F4 the game.\n\nI quickly rejoin my friends game and at this time, we're playing some type of capture the three points in succession game. Which, at first, was going fine. Then I had a sudden lag spike. I hope in the future this game handles lag a bit better than just continuing my character's motions. I somehow managed to run all the way into enemy territory even though I wasn't pressing anything. But it was temporary and went away after that one death.\n\nI can't remember any landmarks from the map other than this Chinese circle area on the final area capture. This map did seem to suffer from the same issues of the previous map, it's too small. You can barely (if you can) hear foot steps, so you don't know where the enemy is coming from. I don't like that your character has to vault over objects in a cinematic way, it's not a movie. I also can not stand this stuttering, seriously what is going on? I'm getting around 80-90FPS.\n\nAnyway, most of these issues are just specific to me, I'm sure most other people don't have stuttering issues and have played through the tutorial...and have not gotten their game stuck in the lobby screen. But I'm notorious for having issues with games other people love. I wouldn't play it again, but maybe you may like it, give it a go, it's free.","July 3, 2014","false","1.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It just doesn't engage me. Maybe it's just the fact that my teammates are all snipers. Maybe it's because I'm the one that always gets smacked and killed by a shield. Maybe it's that teammates half the time don't care that I get hit by the shield, and just watch as I die. Co-op sucks, unless you have good friends to play it with.\n\nNot to mention the shop system isn't that good either. Wait, so you buy a gun permanently, but you have to REPAIR it for use? Why not just rent it, then, since you're going to be spending money to use it anyway! (I hate rental systems, but the repair system seems just as bad to me.)\n\nIf you didn't read my little rant, the game is little more than an irritation to me. I wouldn't seriously recommend the game.\n\n5/10, not bad ideas, but not very enjoyable.\n\nEdit: Even if the game has been changed in updates, I don't plan to return to it.

It's probably the best out of every shooter i played.\n\nGood:\nThere is somth about it that's so satisfying, it's like all shooter combined in one game made in the best way possible. It's a twitch shooter, but it is also very tactical, which i absolutely love. It's this mix that makes it special. I love being able to shoot-and-run-instant-respawn in a small map, but also have the option to use tactics, such as placing a claymore at a choke point or at a hallway to prevent enemy from coming at you, healing after i get shot, picking the best spot, and shooting other people from behind while sneaking in order to minimize death count, with a silenced smg. I have not experienced this in other games. I play COD CS:GO BF4,3 Hardline beta etc. (your prolly thinking hey that's in every shooter ever made, dud,  but it was way more usable and satisfying. It has more substance if u know what i mean. It's just the way i feel i guess)\n\nReal time switching of accessories is amazing. Say i have an assault rifle and have 3 different optics to chose from long range to short range and you can switch between them depending where your enemy is at, Crysis style. This game will satisfy your uniqe weapon accessory itch, as it has meny of them.\n\nGuns have a great feel and weight to them, nice sound, and that woosh ffffsssss from a high rpm silenced smg never gets old. Great graphics and sound for a fast paced shooter. The ce engine holds up nicely. No complains. I did have a glitches with my graphics, but switched the drivers to stable release and went away (amd r9 280x 14.4) <- if u get glitch switch to stable driver 14.4\n\nCONTROLS ARE AMAZING. They completely nailed the controls. I mean the way you move around and mouse movement. It doesn't have any weight.. if u know what i mean, like in bf3,4.. the difference is huge and what kept me playing untill:\n\nBad:\nThe F2P model is not good at all, and certain items you get make the game so unbalanced, it just doesn't make sense.\n\nAfter i reached a certain rank, i could not play in the "rookie" channel anymore(where there are servers made by new ppl). I am forced to play with the "Pro" chanel. Where basically ... you got it.. i'ts channel where the top players play. They have all the cool ♥♥♥♥ you can think of. from bullet proof vest that take 3 magazine to kill and can resist grenades and claymores (all exploding same time). to automatic shotguns, one hit kill sniper, etc.\n\nThe player count is too low. I mean, you will not be used to this. I doub't there are even 100 people playing. That's like a server in some other games lol.  There are three channels Rookie Experienced and Pro. After you done with rookie, you go straight to pro because there are 0 people playing in Experienced (which would have been the second step for me).\n\nThe difference is that in rookie channels, all the people there are new or trying out the game. They will be very bad at playing and certainly do not have the best gear(they don't care enought to buy weapons) and when you go to Pro channel, all the poeple playing are very serious about the game and have cool gear, which they bought or unlocked. I am not trying to blame on P2W model, but these "two groups" of players are extremely different.\n\nAfter u done with rookie best thing to do is open a new account and start playing rookie again...\n\nWhen i was playing in rookie I was thinking, wtf are these people giving negative reviews, P2W and all... I never spent money and was getting 35+ kills and 10 deaths every match. Was having a blast, Top of the leaderboard every game...\n\nI think this game needs more players to be better to minimize the disparity of certain group skills.\nIt needs to be more defused. E.G Allow other higher ranked players to join with lower rank players. You can not force them to play at a certain way!! The game has massive potential.\nI'll keep an eye on this...","August 19, 2014","false","45.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The publisher obviously saw that was a mistake and eventually moved it to Steam, a much wiser decision. As for the game itself, its a Call of Duty Style FPS that boasts using the CryEngine despite not exactly being the pinnacle of everything the engine has to offer. The gameplay is everything you would expect from COD except being F2P. The game has the basic modes you  expect from this type of game, which may be disappointing to those looking for some variety, though the game offers a FANTASTIC Co-op experience with you and several other players progressing through levels and defeating enemies and bosses. It does have some technical issues and a lack of modes, but despite this, if you're sick of paying $60 for the same COD game every year but still want to scratch that itch, pick up this game, Blacklight Retribution, or Soldier Front 2 and save yourself the money.\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ Gameplay is solid\n+ Graphics get the job done\n+ Is a Free alternative to buying COD again\n+ No annoying killstreaks or perks to ruin the game\n+ Guns/Gear are permanent with both cash and in-game points.\n+ Maps are FREE, no map packs.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n- Gameplay & Modes while fun, lack in variety\n- Community is small\n- Community is filled with toxic kids\n- Sometimes frustrating hitboxes\n- Mines\n\nTHE UGLY\nThe fact this game started as a terrible browser only title\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIf you love the COD gameplay, but hate paying $60 plus map-packs, this is a good alternative. i'd also recommend Soldier Front 2 or Blacklight Retribution along with this one.\n\nGreat 8/10","August 16, 2014","true","42.9"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","31","55","9","4"

However the cons cancel out the pros and then some in my opinion.\n\nPros:\n\nLots of maps\n\nMost maps are well designed\n\nClasses are balanced\n\nRuns great (was staying above 100fps maxed out on my mid-range rig)\n\nQuite a lot of modes\n\nA few colorful maps that come as a surprise (the Brazil map is beautiful)\n\nThe hub is well done and clean (I really like how you add on attachments)\n\nSlide function is really fun and fluid\n\nSome team work aspects are cool, like helping one another to reach places.\n\nFree\n\nNot a big download\n\n\nCons:\n\nSome maps are copied and pasted\n\nit will cost you OVER $400 to purchase all the permanent gear and weapons\n\nVisuals are sub-par for a Crytek game\n\nHit detection is pretty awful\n\nSeveral modes are just poorly executed compared to other games\n\nOptions menu is lacking FoV and other things\n\nNo way to search for servers via Ping\n\nTutorial is awful, and leaves a lot unexplained. (it gets explained later when you unlock more classes, but stuff like weapon melee, sliding, and other basic mechanics should be explained in the FIRST tutorial not later)\n\nSuffers from the same thing that BF4 does where some icons like revive and where the bomb is are just WAY too big.\n\nPay2win in the sense that you can buy objectively superior gear, however you do have to work to unlock it so it's pretty\nbalanced at first.\n\nNEWB CHANNELS ARE NOT RANK CAPPED!!!! This results in experienced players coming in and making the game extremely unfun for new players.\n\n\nOverall the game's cons out weigh the pros so I have to unrecommend, however it is worth a shot right now since as mentioned it's not a big download and as of now since everyone is new it's pretty balanced, however I don't see this game having a long life span unless they fix the hit detection and server searching.

I had a lot of "pay2win" weapons, but at some point i realized, russian Warface was really a "pay2win" game and you need to pay, if you want to survive. I stoppped playing Warface for something like 1.5 year and played CS:GO instead. Now i found a europian version of it, and the only thing i can say about EU Warface is - ITS AWESOME. You dont need to pay, you can easely buy everyting for in-game cash.\n\n9/10  :)","April 4","true","418.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

Also the AI seems to need work, due to the fact that either no enemies spawn, or masses of them spawn in one position, all of a sudden; as well as this, they randomly spin around and glitch very often.","July 4, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Okay, well just to show that I'm not just some new player crying about being beaten. I would like to start by saying I beta tested this game on my Xbox 360 and back then it was so-so, more good than bad really. Then I come to play it on PC and at first it wasn't so bad. But honestly after awhile the "Pay to Win" and the Hackers get to be too much.\n\nIn one game I was shooting a guy in the back and he magically killed me with his GUN without even turning around to look at me. Not to mention his gun was killing almost everyone in one hit.\n\nI've had people survive shotgun blasts even though the shotgun was pretty much in their gut. I'm sorry, no amount of body armor is going to stop a shotgun from splattering your spine against a wall when it's directly pointed against you.\n\nYour shot patterns quickly become unrealisticly inaccurate during substained fire. I know accuracy goes way down the longer you hold down the trigger. But when you start watching your shots outline enemy targets who you have your crosshairs directly on and isn't anymore than 40 meters at the absolute most. It's a pretty good sign that there is a problem.\n\nSpawn Camping is a regular thing in these games. There is nothing stopping anyone from coming into your spawn and killing you without giving you a fighting chance. I'm shocked I haven't seen a whole team get locked down by just explosives alone. Seriously, whose bright idea was it to allow players to enter the enemy spawn and kill them without mercy? Sorry, I like a hardcore shooter as much as the next person. But I do not like hardcore BS shooters...\n\nI'm not even going to cover the other issues I have with this game.\n\nIn the words of one review on this game - It's a great game to uninstall.","September 1, 2014","false","10.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

I saw a lot of nice, permanent, guns for a good price of something like $3700.\n\nKnowing i already got $3000 for completing the turtorial, i decided to try and finish a game.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of trying to find a game without spawnkilling, hacking russians, i found a nice game.\n\nI did fairly well actually. I got 20 kills and died 5 times (i'm not new to fps game you know).\n\nThinking i would have a new gun in no-time, i was excited to see how much money i would get from a pretty good match.\n\n$44.\n\n44 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for being good at the game.\n\nIf you are not good at the game but have a huge wallet you will be rewarded with a truck load of money and a high-five of the developer saying: ''You done did good kid.''\n\nThe developers don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about how much skill you have. They only give a ♥♥♥♥ about how much money you have.\n\nThat .50 sniper that the russian guy had you say? You can't even get that ♥♥♥♥ for in-game money. Not even for 1 day. And the only stat that is worse on it, when you compare it with your stock sniper rifle, is the magazine size (from 10 to 6).\n\nOh. And did i mention the bulletproof vests already? I was sneaking up to a guy and emptied half my magazine into his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ only to have him turn around VERY SLOWLY and 3-shot me.\n\nAND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST PART!!!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS ♥♥♥♥ING SLIDING!!!\n\nI'm not even going to tell you about that.

Looked it up, downloaded it, and went straight into co-op with them. Having played a variety of other shooters, I could pick up the Sniper class and do pretty well at it, and this is because the game is, well.. generic. I have now been playing a number of days and I think I have enough to talk about in order to review it.\n\nTHE CONS:\n- Pay to win. Unfortunately like many F2P games, it falls under the P2W category. Their VIP booster makes the levelling up and gear-unlocking pace acceptable, without it, it would be hella slow. Also, the highest end gear can only be rented, giving the rich a fairly significant advantage in both weapons and armour.\n- Versus is frustrating, feels buggy and is dominated by those who can pay for renting the high-end gear.. 'nuff said I think.\n\nTHE PROS:\n- Co-op gives the class system a meaning and I've found it to be pretty enjoyable with friends. We've played it a lot, only really being held back by the fairly small range of maps available at any given time.\n- Each class has its own role and gameplay attached to it. Whether it's ammo restocking/armour or health restoring/reviving, each utility has its place.\n- Your team composition going into a difficult mission becomes pretty important. This seems to go out the window in versus, but has its place in co-op. A side note would be that the co-op missions do actually involve making some tactical decisions - sure there are plenty of manic points where it becomes more like an overwhelming deathmatch vs bots, but there are enough times where you have to plan things out in advance.\n\nSo, back to the tl;dr again, it's a free game with some fun elements to it in the form of co-op. Whether you'll like the rest of it, or play it for more than a short period of time I don't know, but I can't say no to recommending you try it.\n","August 24, 2014","true","41.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Weapons take forever to unlock and it's extremely hard to get an upper hand against enemies with better weapons.\n-Net code issue.

I would say co-op is where the game shines. Even while playing with random people, players are still being kind to one another and players are helping the inexperienced players.\nOverall, I had a great time with the co-op gameplay.\n\nThere are 4 classes you can play as, as you progress through the co=op missions:\nThe Assault, who can give ammo to teammates.\nThe Medic, who can patch up his teammates health (Very Important).\nThe Engineer, who can patch up his teammates armor and deploy charges.\nAnd finally, The Sniper, Self-explanatory.\n\nFor those people who say the game is Pay2Win, you can still do pretty well with the default M16 (it's not that bad). Yes, the cash shop has pretty expensive items, but you don't need the "paid weapons" to do good.\n\nSo, should I recommend it to FPS fans?\nWell...Definitely yes,the co-op experience will give you a blast, especially when playing with friends. The multiplayer is your generic as your multiplayer experience can get (In other words, nothing new here).\nHowever, I wouldn't spend money in the game, like I said before, you can do pretty decent even with the stock weapons.\n\nI hope to see Crytek making more interesting games in the future.","July 4, 2014","true","2.1"," 40 of 75 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","40","75","0","2"

But overall it's just a fun game to play (especially with good friends).\n\nThe weapons unlocked from the vendor are in fact very good, even in comparison to "OP" weapons which you can buy for real money. Too many low-ranks think that they don't have a chance against rank 50+ players just because these high-ranks often own pay2win weapons. Just unlock all weapons and try to find a weapon that suits you and your play-style best before spending real money.\n\nChanging your weapon's attachements, like muzzle, scope and so forth is also a good feature (you can do this during a match, too).\n\nThe graphics are "ok" in my opinion. I'm playing on low settings anyway (because of the microlags).\n\nI don't play Co-op/Survival that often but it seems to be well thought out. "Tower Raid" is pretty cool, you get plenty of money, experience points and vendor points. You get even more of that for Zenith/Marathon and Hardcore (time/money-ratio).\n\nEDIT:\n\nI stopped playing Warface almost a year ago. I wrote this in present tense but the following things might have changed already. Will have a look in a week and edit this review if that's the case.\n\nThere are too many pay-to-win weapons that are way better than most vendor weapons (in the past you could easily wreck people with low cost vendor weapons like the MC 255, ST-AR, FY-49 and Everest, just to name a few) and now there are even more hackers in this game, which already made playing really fustrating when we initially started playing Warface","April 18, 2015","true","770.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is a multiplayer game with different modes of PvP and co-op. PvP contains known game modes like Team Deathmatch or Deathmatch but also more interesting as hunting where the player is thrown at a map at night and limited visibility. Cooperative mode is the best mode for it to farm a lot the money in the game and levels, but we might be boring due to the repeatability of the mission. There is a mode that is very similar to co-op and it's called "Special Operations" or something like that but you need to sue tokens to play nad as a reward you get a crate with some stuff. As for the game engine it's a CryEngine  so the game looks nice but also will run on slower computers. Optimization is at a high level, because my PC is not the best but I play the game on high without any serious lags. Sound system is good and also has a full Polish language but also has other languages ​​that are describe in the store. In the game for the money earned, you can spend it on buying weapons permanently or for a few days, and also to repaired them. In my opinion, the game is nice and if you are looking for some distraction for a few hours from CS or CoD you should check this out. At the beginning of play you will be playing with beginner players so there is a lot of fun but after reach the better rank game drop us to the advanced league Where micropayments starts to begin but still you can play but it is very hard due to the fact that most players use really good weapons what will contribute to many deaths by what the game does not rely on the skills but on the contents of your wallet. In addition, the award after finishing the round are really very small so that I was forced to play on a set of beginner because I could not afford to repair weapons.","March 28","true","33.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Best of all, the class system in the game forces you to work as a team, providing a perfect mix of tactical play styles as well as arcade-like play styles.  The game has near-perfect balance, and the devs are always in touch with the community.  Absolute best free to play out there.  100/100\n\nP.S.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the "lack of hit detection" is not a bug or a flaw in the game at all.  There is bullet travel and bullet drop in the game, so bullets don't always register immediately when shooting at longer ranges.

Honestly I have a very mixed opinion on the community as a whole. On one hand I've been blessed with the good fortune of playing with some of the most helpful, friendly and skilled random players on here. On the other hand, I've also had the bad luck of playing with some of the most tribal, unfriendly, condescending, mean-spirited elistist on here. There's the noticable segregation between high ranking and low ranking players. Most high ranking players just flat out refuse to play with anyone lower ranking than themselves so they just kick them for no real reason most times. It's pretty much a random roll of the dice of whom you'll be playing with. Sometimes I wish there was an in-game avoid player button. It's truly a game you want to love but it just won't let you because of certain game designs and technical problems.\n\nFor starters anyone who has played this for at least a couple of rounds will notice that enemies appear out of thin air at certain points on the map either in front of you or behind you if you're moving too fast through a map. There's the Mech end stage boss and the helicopter end stage boss which for some reason have magical weapons that don't overheat or need reloading EVER. Spec Ops soldiers feel cheap no matter the difficulty setting and the equipment that is supposed to counter act its vision impairing laser don't work either. Repair cost are tricky and yet ridiculous at the same time. Even if you didn't use a weapon you had equipped during a match, you still are forced to repair it after a match is done. NO EXCEPTIONS. Initiation missions are rendered useless after you finished it the first time to unlock the other difficulties: Regular, Skilled and Hardcore. Why you ask? Because initiation mission pay is crap and more times than not, doesn't cover the repairs after you've completed the mission whether or not you were damaged playing through. If anything initiation missions should just cover all repair cost after you've finished it after the first playthrough.\n\nEvery now and then you'll get some knuckleheads who will come down with "Rambo/Call of Duty Syndrome" and think they're invincible and run into a hail of bullets ahead of the rest of the team and get killed early on or immediately. Then there's the problem with people not playing their role properly. You've got medics who think and play like they are riflemen. Your team is bleeding to death and soaking up bullets and this hard charger is leading the group like he has no med pack at all. Then you've got riflemen who think and play like snipers (Not saying you can't shoot enemies at far distances but let the sniper do his job). And in turn snipers who think they are riflemen (You have a x5 scope why are fighting at close range charging groups of enemies?). And then there is the problem with people playing the engineer. These people don't even attempt to heal the team's armor barely ever.\n\nBut by far the biggest pet peeve I have with this game is the sometimes constant badgering done by dead teammates to try and rush the living teammates to the next checkpoint because they can't wait to respawn. These are the knuckleheads that are too impatient to let their teammates safely cross checkpoints without being swarmed by enemies shouting GO!,GO!, GO! or HURRY UP! or GEEZ WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG!? People who give into these rude demands usually find themselves knocked down by an unknown riot shield and beaten to death or get shot to death by a spec ops they didn't see. Moral of the story: Never take advice from a dead man....\n\nThere is a Pay 2 Win aspect to this game but not to such a horrible degree other games do it. Namely warlord gear or any other armor that let's you regenerate health within a certain amount of seconds. You don't have to spend actual money to get this gear. You can grind missions and buy it with in-game cash so it's not necessarily exclusive to people paying cash for items. But it does make co-op missions feel cheap sometimes. You start to realize some of your teammates aren't as skilled as you once though. They're just regenerating health like some sort of weird mutant super soldier soaking up a jillion bullets in their chest and skulls\n\nIf the issues I have addressed don't bother you to much, then feel free to play this game. You might like it more than you think because if you take each review as fact or truth and not just opinion then you'll miss out on many other games besides this one. I enjoy the co-op here because it's one of the few experiences that really forces you to work as a team because the moment you don't, you'll realize how fast your team will fall apart (especially on insane difficulty). It's a game with flaws I won't lie to you there but if nothing else, it's one of the more fun distractions that deserves at least a single playthrough.","December 7, 2014","true","147.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

And when jump magically spread out more.\n- FOV is lesser than 90 apperently. Is this...\n- In widscreen, you have lower vertical fov somehow. Your vision is cut lesser top and bottom view than a 4:3 resolution.\n- Viewmodel, not related to actual or too close. Where in your view, your melee can magically reach even you just swing it around your cheeks.\n- Don't have static crosshair. Or a 2nd option for custom dot crosshair, just a dot really.\n- Anyone who uses 'macro' (rapid single click per second) have more accuracy and recoil recovery than everyone else in normal full auto fire.\n- Might need to put in 'Love Shot' concept. Since people complaining, "I thought I shot you!" or "Wtf I hit you first!". But the Hit Reg is already terrible itself in PvP. So not sure.\n- Abit of grinding for money and later unlocks.\n- Need to unlock FPS max. How can it lag even with a good Nvidia 900M or above?\n- Need to unlock Monitor Refresh Rate. Is up to only 60Hz? Unlock it, some people want to play a smooth game with no stutters. (I am playing games with 120Hz, need this high for a smooth video game recording too)\n- Some weapon reload animation have too much dancing, deceptions causing. New players might find this irritating. "I thought the magazine already slide in and lock".\n\n+ Beside all above, this game is good with their PvE especially 'Special Operation' missions. For now, is not recommanded for rank gaming and PvP.

Maps.\n\nThe maps in this game are smaller than a grain of rice, everything's close quaters and there's just stuff thrown in your face everywhere no matter where you go. It's nearly impossible to tell where you're being shot from sometimes and honestly it seems as if Shotguns dominate this game rather than being balanced all types of weapons and classes.\n\nNearly all the maps are just mirrors of one half being flipped around to make another, little to no variation in the terrain at all and a lot of verticality (maybe a little too much). The spawn system is probably the worst I've ever seen, generally only spawning you in a select area usually out in the open and unprotected. Very easy to spawn trap players if done right  which can be very frustrating.\n\n2. Movement.\n\nThe movement in this game feels really sluggish and clunky rather than fluid and dynamic. Players have the ability to slide and go prone which is usually two features you don't see in most F2P games like this.\n\nThe problem with these mechanics is that they're easily abused because there's little to no animation when dropping down to go prone or when sliding meaning you can be in a gunfight with someone and then near instantly have them dissapear onto the ground with little to absolutely no time to react; nearly a free kill 100% of the time if you will.\n\nOh and there's no walk function either, found it really interesting how this game has features you don't normally see but doesn't have a walk function.\n\n4.  Play 2 Win versus Pay 2 Win.\n\nIt's possible to Play 2 Win with a lot of dedication, but this game is definitely Pay 2 Win otherwise.\n\nThe majority of the guns you can buy at the start of the game are timed and can only be bought permanent with real cash, however there are weapons that you can buy with the in-game currency that are permanent but takes an unreasonably long time achieve.\n\n5. General.\n\nThe game itself feels sluggish and slow even though the maps are very small and close quaters, games take forever to get started for how long they last without ever really seeing any action. The game-play itself is rather campy in my opinion and badly done due to how the maps are designed. The game doesn't really reward skill, just who has the better weapon and who can abuse the movement mechanics enough.\n\nThis game isn't worth the time it asks for.","November 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","0"

The enemies have their weapons exponentaly higher that you, and no checkpoins where you can restart from (whole team) If the enemies in this game were real they wouldn't need body armour. I would give a thumbs up only if they fixed the game's appeal to spit in your face reapeatedly\n\nEDIT (one month later): so I tried for a third time to like this game,  I really have, but I want to take back the quote of mine about the third level, because the level  I was talking about just moved places on the missions board. also in the discription of this game it says something along the lines of New Missions every day... this was not just a mission that came to show itself again, I saw for about a week whaen i first played this that this certain mission wouldn't go away,  I checked back a month later and saw the misson was still there, just in a different spot.  But the Idea of this bad level was either to captivate players with a level that takes half an hour to complete if you pay 10 or more dollars on the weapons, or an gruelingly hard level that is way too long for no back story to  make people spend lots of money on the microtransactions.","July 1, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a lot of modes for PvP, Storm (A bit like rush in battlefield). CTF well... name says all. TDM and last but not least FFA!\nPvE contains several missions, and there are a few new ones every day.\n\nThere are a few difficulties to choose from when doing PvE; Initiation, Skilled, Regular, Hardcore and Tower Raid. The tower raid is pretty much survival, with a lot of floors with a large variety of enemies, the higher you get the better the rewards. And hardcore actually is kinda hardcore ;p.\nThe game requires a lot of teamwork for you to be able to win.\nThe PvE maps are mainly objective based apart from the tower raid.\nGameplay is fast paced.\n\nThere's an ingame shop in which you can buy guns/skins/armor etc. You can unlock stuff in the ingame shop by just playing missions. You can buy items with either real money or ingame cash (Which is really easy to get). Most guns are perm. IT's totally fair.\n\nI would really recommend this game!","July 2, 2014","true","72.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a multiplayer experience, the game functions similarly to Battlefield, having 4 different classes all resembling those in BF3, but horribly unoptimized for team play. The only class I found any use for was the Medic, based on the fact that he can revive teammates (which is crucial in Co-op, your dumb teammates drop like flies from rushing into conflict too fast), but with one major downside: his weapon of choice, SHOTGUNS.\n\nThe shotguns are so broken in this game, it's hard to describe without snapping my keyboard in half from rage. Basically, every shotgun in the game fires a horribly inaccurate 4 to 5-pellet spread that can only one-shot an enemy if at point blank range, making the medic's offensive capabilites practically nonexistant. You can't rush in, shoot the guy who just gunned down your teammate, and then revive him, you fire about 3 shots before you finally kill the bugger, and by that point your teammate is pretty much dead anyway. This game flopped so hard they removed it from the Xbox 360 store just yesterday, Feb. 1st, 2015, less than a year after its release, so what does THAT tell you about the game designer's opinion of this steaming pile of trash?\n\nOverall, this game isn't fun, it's broken, and it's the second biggest failure Crytek has made in the past 3 months, the first of which being Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, but I'm not gonna get into that.\n\nIf you want any more information on how much of a disappointment this game is, go watch Matimi0's review of it on YouTube, he does a lot more explaining than I did because I only talked about Medic, because it's the only class I played and it's the only class I gave a crap about playing.","February 1, 2015","false","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You give your team mate a bunk up then he helps you up, it's a great touch as is the baseball type slide feature. It's also got some ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ideas like having to pay to fix your rifle and gear which takes half your money that you earn each round, which is also pitiful. More annoyingly, you can't search for a server close to you, it just gives you a slot so connections are widely variable which means lag is a massive issue. I've had my end give me a kill then his end catches up and say that no, I actually died. You can't play like that. Your shots just go through people because they have already ♥♥♥♥ing moved and the connection hasn't caught up.\n\nAlso one plays to the classes. Medics don't revive (although the defib in this game is the worst designed feature I've seen) and riflemen never resupply. Every round I've played people are in it for themselves, they don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about you or the team. There are hackers everywhere and no one cares. I will never understand that mentality. I'll probably put a few more hours into it, because I haven't found a good FPS yet that I can just play a quick round or two whenever I want but I know I'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with the community here very quickly. So I can't recommend this game even though the game itslef is good, it's the community that ♥♥♥♥ it up and my search for a decent FPS continues. Also, ♥♥♥♥ EA.","April 30","false","53.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To me, Warface is essentially Call of Duty but without all of the ridiculous stuff like quick scoping (at least I haven't noticed any of that), it feels like it's more balanced and every player has a fair opportunity right off the bat. However, no game is without negatives so let's break down the positives and negatives in a list.\n\nThe Good:\n- Balanced play style\n- Real time weapon attachment system that allows you to switch out things like scopes and grips mid battle without having to wait until the round is over to edit the classes.\n- Decent graphics even at the lowest graphic quality\n- Movement and aiming feels very smooth (if you've played a lot of indie FPS games you know what I'm talking about)\n- Runs perfectly fine on a stock computer from Walmart that's a few years old (you don't need a super computer to run it)\n- The starting gear isn't as powerful as the gear you can buy later on but it's still good enough to win with, it doesn't feel under powered\n- In game points earned from each round that can be spent on new equipment\n- Sliding feature is unique and there are spots on some maps specifically for this, such as a small hole in a fence that you can slide under (some other FPS games have this but most don't)\n\nThe Bad:\n- Some equipment can only be purchased for a limited time before it expires and you have to purchase it again (this is extremely annoying if you don't have a bunch of time to play the game every day as your equipment will be expired whenever you come back to it)\n- Killcam shows who killed you and their position but it doesn't show the kill from their perspective\n- Getting killed by a grenade doesn't show the enemy that threw it\n- Some of the maps have a poor layout for a shooting game and force you to go to specific places or through choke holds which make it easy for the enemy team to spawn camp you and stops you from discovering your own play style\n- Characters feel like they have no weight as you can walk up to a teammate and push them around and off ledges (this is really annoying when you're laying prone and a teammate walks by and pushes you out of position)\n\nCould Be Added:\n- Killstreak rewards like airdrops or missiles (similar to Call of Duty)\n- Killcam through the perspective of the player that killed you (killcams like this are great for learning new positions and techniques)\n\nBugs/glitches:\n- There is only one glitch that I've found and it allows you to see through a piece of cloth that you normally wouldn't be able to see through on the Airport map, however the amount of area that's revealed when doing this isn't really beneficial to the player enough to give them an advantage or warrant fixing immediately, just something for the developers to watch out for and possibly fix in an update.\n\nConclusion:\nOver-all I think this game is great! It's very well balanced so you can get right in without dying every two seconds and it feels really smooth. The constant reminders of micro transactions are a bit annoying but I understand that developing a game like this isn't easy or free so I don't hold it against them too much. They have to make money some how to support future development and marketing and I think more people should take that into account before judging a game for micro transactions. Without a way for developers to make money we would have a lot less free games for you to add to your collection.","May 18, 2015","true","53.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NexLupus/recommended/291480/","NexLupus","Winston Churchill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NexLupus/","69 products in account","A pretty good game, but a bit unrefined.\n\nYou buy different guns and items with ingame currency which you get from playing. You can buy guns and items for real life money, but they are reskins of the stuff you buy with the ingame currency. So it is NOT "pay to win"\n\nEverything is not available from the start. You choose either a gun attachment, a weapon, or a price of equipment to unlock. Then you unlock the chosen item by playing. You can only progress in one of the items each match. But you can change between the three without any loss in progress.\n\nThere's two main game modes. "Co-op" and "vs".\nIn "Co-op" you and a team of up to 5 play towards an objective. There's always 6 different missions, and there changed every day. The missions have a slightly strange difficulty curve. Some missions I got through without dying one single time. Other missions the whole team failed before we could even reach the first checkpoint.\n\n"VS" is your standard type of gamemode where there's two different teams. Theres the standard "team deathmatch" "Free for all" "Plant the bomb" Then there is "Storm" where you capture three points on the map in succession. "Capture"- A variation of capture the flag. And lastly "Destruction" where you deliver three air strikes on the enemy position. One team must hold the position on the map located in the center of the map.\nI think the maps is a bit on the small side. Theres really no room to be playing sniper.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 7/10. It is still in beta, and I think it could be a great game.","July 14, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game says, oh, we have parkour, you can do it in every map! But really, it's just some obstacles in the way with an option to either walk around them, or jump over them.

First, the shop. Why the hell wolid you put an option to RENT A ♥♥♥♥ING ITEM AND HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO BUY IT FOREVER?! Enough said.\n\nThe maps are in very tight spaces. This game says, oh, we have parkour, you can do it in every map! But really, it's just some obstacles in the way with an option to either walk around them, or jump over them. But the idea to help a friend up a wall is pretty creative.\n\nThe combat is fairly fast paced, but if you don't have decent weapons, YOU WILL DIE HORRIBLY. Without good equipment, you're basically a useless sack of ♥♥♥♥ being pelted by a dozen bullets of highly OP npcs, or players.\n\nStill a decent game tho.\n\n7/10 Would be a useless sack of newbie ♥♥♥♥ and die horribly again.\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

They were right.\n\nWarface, made by some Crytek dupes, uses the Crytek engine. Whatever that means. It has vaulting! Ooh! Helping others scale up walls! Aah! And it  really fricking sucks!  Waah. . .?\n\nSo, Warface is yet another modern/slightly futuristic FPS. It fights right in with Call of Duty and Battlefield. Has the same four classes: Rifleman (an assault character with an assault rifle that assaulting gives ammo assault boxes), Medic (a mister doctor man), Engineer (some guy with an SMG. There are also absolutely no vehicles to repair. He's sorta useless.), and Sniper (recon guy that hangs back near the spawn to pick off scrubs with 420 scope shots). They differ not a single bit. I've also heard none of these guns in real life. Not even a friggin Glock or 1911. It sorta stinks. Yet another bland shooter.\n\nThe snowy shots they show do not exist in game for as far as I can tell. Mainly urban, jungle, and sandy type maps that I've played. They're pretty bland, and seem to have no real creative-ness. There's a dock level. And a jungle level. And a city level. And a motel level. And another level. Pretty poor.\n\nThis game, like any other free to play, has microtransactions. Want some cool crud? Get KREDITS! Want a neat yellow covered thingamajigger? Get CROWNS (which are useless). Want a permanent weapon? Get KREDITS!\n\nYes, the main, gaping flaw of this game is that you cannot get permanent crud.  You gotta use Kredits or keep extending the lease to keep your guns after a day.\n\nAlso, let's get to the OP slide tackle. Shift (which is only a toggle, not a hold (can't change it as well)) and then pressing F will initiate a slide that let's you look super baller and super OP. They only way to screw up the slide tackle is if you miss. Which is never. If you get slide tackled, then RIP. You can nearly never return a slide tackle.\n\nAlso fire hurts you. That's weird.\n\nIn sum,\n\nPros +kinda free. . .?\n+pretty ok gunplay\n+community doesn't really care\n+fire hurts you. Yay realism?\n\nCons -microtransactions around every corner\n-takes AGES of grinding to unlock crud\n-you have to keep EXTENDING YOUR LEASE ON WEAPONS AND GEAR\n-VIP bonuses last a mere hour\n-slide tackles that are OP\n-stupid AI in co-op\n-non existant community\n-another mediocre and bland modern FPS. Can't they go back to Korea or Vietnam or something? That'd be nice.\n-freemium","April 11, 2015","false","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Classes should be playable.  No one is allowed to get rezzed because no one has medic unlocked is just a bad plan.\n\nThe mouse's aim speed literally changes at random at all times.  I cannot hit anything because it decides it's going to go way faster or way slower basically at the drop of a hat.\n\nThis game has hard-locked, memory-dump-and-bluescreened my Win 8.1 machine twice in only an hour's playtime.\n\nI uninstalled this already.

But the idea to help a friend up a wall is pretty creative.\n\nThe combat is fairly fast paced, but if you don't have decent weapons, YOU WILL DIE HORRIBLY.

I would not reccomend the game yet, unless there's a server fix because it's really annoying to lagg around even thought you pay good money for internet.","July 21, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I remember playing it a couple of  years ago in Russia on a distribution platform called Games Mail.ru.\n\nThe game was fun and at that point it seemed good if it was not a freemium game where to really play you need to pay more than you would pay for CoD or CS:GO, which are much better games. Now playing it again after these years on Steam and seeing that it has a BETA badge I am surprised.It has not changed a lot and I feel there is no effort put to improve it. Besides what annoys me that I get message that I am running out of memory when playing it. I played the version on Mail.ru and it never did that. Maybe it has something to do with my newer PC, but other games work fine such as Assassin's Creed 4 and Witcher 2, or other FPS games such as CS:GO.\n\nThis game is very dissapointing.

Really nice PVP and PVE modes, great graphics and gameplay!\nIt's a proper free-to-play, since you can have lots of fun without spending a cent in it - more games should be like this.\n\nBut, there is a huge problem: hackers.\nWhen you first start playing, it's all good because you are matched with players that have similar levels, but once you reach about level 9/10, you automatically join a "higher level" of matchmaking and you're matched with players of very high levels. If you got used to nice balanced and fair games, I'm sorry to disappoint you by telling you what happens now... yeap, you guessed it: ♥♥♥♥ing hackers EVERYWHERE. My first game in this new matchmaking system and I caught two hackers in the same game, aimbotting and wallhacking... this really ruined the experience for me.\n\nI still recommend this game for what it is as a FPS, and I still play it for the co-op experience, but something has to be done to stop or minimise the amount of hackers in Warface.","April 6, 2015","true","22.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Having some much fun, Will do a more detailed review once i've put a few more hours into the game.\n\nEdit:\nSo basically the game is split into 2 parts: versus and co-op. The Versus is pretty lack-luster in my experience, the objectives are all very simple and nothing in the versus forces players to take advantage of the team-based classes of the game. The maps are all so small and tight that it just turns into a grenade-spamming, corner-camping brawl. There's no regenerating health or armor in this game, so you tend to be worthless after a kill as your health and armor will stay low. Now, it can be repaired by team-mates of course, but it won't, because there are only 2 classes that can repair you and the odds of both of them getting to you before someone sullies your face with buckshot is quite low. In fact, the game is so campy that medics are simply not played right now. That's right, the versus takes such low advantage of the class system that they basically made the most important class obselete. Frankly, the versus isn't worth your time.\n\nHowever this game shines in co-op. The co-op missions force the use of all 4 classes, and after you play for a while, you begin to appreciate how it's designed. All 4 classes in the game are support classes and going through any mission without one of each class is incredibly difficult. The engineer gives armor which protects you from burst damage like grenades, missiles, and sniper rounds; whereas the medics protect people from the sustained damage of going through extended battles. The soldier replenishes team ammo and sniper is the most prolific at taking down high priority targets that the other classes don't have the range to shoot. When playing the coop, anytime a single class dies the mission becomes incredibly difficult; forcing your squad to play smart and get to know each other.\n\nThe game forces you to depend on your teammates which is a blessing to the coop and the bane of the versus\n\nLeveling up is kind of a grind, like in most f2p's, but the way you unlock things is kind of interesting. There are 3 types of "vendors" that you can switch between at any time and whichever one you have selected you will get progress toward unlocking that item. It randomly selects what your reward will be by picking from a pool of variably rare items. It's not too bad, since unlocking things isn't too slow and once you unlock something it is always unlocked. The attachments for guns are quite numerous and can be swapped out in-game which is very cool. The game gives you 2 ways to buy things, you can rent things temporarily or buy it permanently. The rent option is basically there to try something out before you buy it. If you buy something, you will have to pay to upkeep it but the cost is not overly grievous. To be honest, I'm not sure what the point of it is, it seems like an unnecessary tax. You only have to upkeep the equipment you use so if you buy something and don't use it right away, it won't degrade. Basically, the f2p system isn't as flawed as the early reviews make it out to be.\n\nThe games biggest problem is simply a lack of content. The versus modes are limited and all lacking in depth, the maps are also limited in number in very lacking in depth. The co-op missions are very deep however, but also lacking in quantity. There are 3 new missions every day, but that gives you a very harshly limited time to complete the hardcore missions and also they just recycle the same 6 or 7 maps each day. The paths are always the same and the spawns vary slightly so there's just a flat out lack of content. Also, the player base (at least in NA) is small atm, and can make finding groups difficult when your not playing during prime time. Just convince your friends to download it and try, it's free and a ton of fun with some friends.","July 1, 2014","true","16.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","2"

Some I've come to like more than others. Warface is in that category for sure.\n\nSo what makes this title stand out of the crowd you ask? For starters, it's built off the trusted CryEngine. Other major F2P titles are on outdated engines. Take for instance Combat Arms and Crossfire. The benefit of having a better engine is that it looks better, feels more responsive, and is less prone to abuse. Common "glitching" isn't to be found in this title due to having a engine that works so much better.\n\nGameplay because of the engine is also better. Player vs. Player maps feel more rich and detailed to a higher degree, and COOP play feels better and more dynamic. The interesting thing about COOP is that you can earn "Crown" points by completing the challenges given to you (beat the level in a certain time, etc.). These points can be used to buy limited time upgrades. That being said, AI needs work still in COOP.\n\nDownside is certainly GFace account system. This game does not directly interface with Steam, and thus requires you to remember details for a useless account.\n\nThe silly weapon rental system found in other games is also here, along with in-game currency. There's this odd weapons/item progression system I still don't get. You can select one of 3 different areas to focus your XP gains in, and unlock items/weapons from that area.\n\nIf you want to spend a few hours here and there on a casual FPS, this is the place to go. Warface is certainly more worthwhile than Combat Arms and Crossfire – the two major competitors to this title.","April 12, 2015","true","24.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","2"

Yes.\n\nPlaying mostly PVE playlists the game can be extremely fun when with a group of players that know their role and work well in a group setting. Missions and tower raids are reminiscent of mmo raids somewhat, except with a FPS vibe.\n\nThe A.I. can be lackluster at times, but the mechanics of the game are sound. A band-aid dispenser, a bullet hose, a welder, and a snipper all have useful roles. Customization is is nice as well, with all gear, guns, and outfits being available with the in-game currency. While shooting can be shoddy due to lag, guns are satisfying. From personal playtime most guns are fun and viable to use. In a PVE setting the best of the best of the killing machines is never required. The UI is simple and easy to navigate.\n\nThe developers have been very active with the game such as daily map rotations, promos for free gear. and updates/hotfixes. Guns and gear also have a cycle as well. In fact, many recent changes have been for the better, with the shop changing to in game currency reducing the pay-to-win structure that turned off many players in the past.\n\nSadly though the community and its mentality of its players makes this game a total turn-off. Playing with randoms is damn-near impossible; players vote-kick without reason, people loving to micromanage and ♥♥♥♥♥ about everything other players do, and while hacking is seen once and while due to no real anticheat system, players accuse others non-stop of being a hacker/cheater more than the actual act itself. The paranoia and ego of players in this game is sickening. I can see competition in PVP happening, but when everyone is going towards a common goal in PVE, who really cares if someone can get more kills than you? ITS PVE.\n\nI love the mechaincs of the game and focused effort to make teamwork prosper, but the community makes it fall flat. If you want to deal with squeakers calling haxxxx and people thinking its time for xxXX420nosc0peblazeitXXxx this is the game for you. Otherwise, into the trash it goes.","May 25, 2015","false","61.3"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","18","34","3","0"

Many people will disagree, but I can see fun in this game. What I don't like about this game is that you need to RENT weapons unless you spend real money buying "Kredits" to PERMANENTLY buy a weapon. If you're like me and rely on a single weapon to pull through, I suggest becoming skilled with the stock R416 (OBVIOUSLY nothing to do with the M416, even though they're practically identical) or renewing the same weapon over and over again. There's also a strange unlocking system, where you can progress in one of three "sections" (or they say "vendors") I guess: Weapons, Apparell, and Attachments. I think that's what it is like. So basically, you turn on one of the three, progress like any Call of Duty game, then you will get the weapon. I believe it's a permanent if you unlock a weapon from a "vendor," 'cause i got a reflex sight under "attachments" that I can use for any weapon. It might not be.

The part that shines through for me is the Co-Op mode.  You have choices of initiate, regular, skilled, and hard.  The levels and requirements swap out each day to give you a different experience.  The biggest downfall of this game is that it is extremely held back by the micro transactions.  You can play all the modes and levels but guns and armor is very limited until you have many hours or have dropped some cash into it.","August 20, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But this is just your basic shooter.\nSo here is just some stupid pros and cons.\n\nI know I haven't played this on the PC a lot, I have played this on my Xbox 360 A LOT before.\n\nCONS:\n\n-I ABSOLUTLY HATE how you haft to pay for EVERYTHING if you want to get some guns fast.\nYou can play this game OKAY for completely free, but just getting new guns (that are actually good) can take DAYS\n\n-You can't hold down shift to sprint (I have looked at the settings)\n\n-There is the stupidest hitmarkers\n\n-STUPID SPAWNING! There is only 1 spawn for EVERY SINGLE MAP IN EVERY SINGLE GAME IN EVERY SINGLE TEAM! Which means you can get completely R4KT'D BY FREAKING STUPID BUTT HOLES ALL THE TIME!\n\n-The maps are WAY too small, but it gains itself with A LOT of places to hide.\n\n-Damage is really low (kinda expected from a CoD copy off or something)\n\n-Very few graphics quality settings (but I don't really have a problem with it)\n\nPros:\n\n-Gunplay is decent. It has sprinting, ADS, crouching, proning, jumping, basically same as CoD\n\n-The attachment system is AWESOME, changing attachments while in game is pretty sweet.\n\n-CO-OP is decent and clever, you really haft to team up with your classes and such to actually win, and there is sometimes MECHS THAT KICk BUTT!\n\n-There are a quite a few maps\n\n-There are a quite a few guns\n\n-It is pretty basic and you can learn quickly\n\n\n\nOverall, if you like CoD or other FPS', but don't have the money, this is a great substitute and keeps you playing if you don't pay anything.\n\nBUUUUT if you do have the money but your like, "OH BUT HERE IS A FREE FPS HERE WOOPIE!" then this game completely SUCKS BALLS compared to battlefield or CoD.","December 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just expected more and its just an out-of-date console already.  Warface was incredibly easy to jump in and start murkin lol. I am already biased though, as i love Crytek in the first place... where i have to point out that the look and feel of this game seems "just right" for a fps. Granted there are some weird bugs to be aware of (I got spawned in the Chinook after joining a game then fell 300 feet to my death), but they wont discourage you from playing.

Pretty good game, for free2play game.\nStill, it has many errors, bugs and problems.\nHere is some most annoying problems: game crashes JUST before you have your experience points and money and all that kind of stuff.. at some maps, enemies just run to wall when you are right behind them, and when you are trying to stab them, they do not die.. When you shut down the launcher, steam does still think that the game is on and you got no other way to play something than restart you computer (trust me).\n\nWarface is CoD remake with badder EVERYTHING. (Craphics, gameplay, details, story, weapons etc)\nIt has several gamemodes like Versus (PVP), CO-OP (PVE) and SURVIVAL (PVE).\n-In CO-OP you will be ALWAYS trying to kill enemies in moving vehicle (that is harder than you think),  trying to save same kind of vehicle, destroying motherf*cking godlike robotmachine and after all, trying to get strangers to do what you say.\n-In versus you can choose between tdm, dm, capturing 3 controlpoints, capturing case and cs go competive.\n-In survival you just survival. Its boring, you can play one match in day (you gotta one accest coin in 3.00pm), but still it is the best gamemode in game.\n\nSo, if you dont got any money to spend games, go ahead. Play.\nJust remember, that you still gotta pay to win.\nSeriosly, I dont recommend this.

The gameplay is average at best and it feels very awkward. The gameplay in pvp is too fast at times not because of the gameplay itself but because the maps are too small. The fact that you can die so fast in pvp defeats any cooperation between each other with classes and it becomes your below average fps.

I would have played a lot more but this has become unplayable. I doubt I'll install again even if there is a patch that fixes the player base. Honestly. The people I have reported are still playing and there is no dev support to removing or any consequences for using hacks. PvE content is decent, but PvP which is what most people are playing this game for, are pretty much going to be ♥♥♥♥ed over. But you can always hack, won't be any consequences to you.

There are a lot of negative reviews that need justifying. This game is in NO WAY P2W. There are micro transactions sure. But they aren't game breaking in any way. On top of that, there is a renting system. This renting system is pointless in my opinion, but good if you wanted to try a weapon out for a day or more. You can unlock PERMANENT weapons with leveling up and if you pick the weapon option. This is one of the funnest FPS games I've played since MW2. Sliding doesn't make people invincible although they do need to fix the hitboxes to make it more reliable when shooting at them. All in all, this game deserves a better rating then what it gets from people who play for 30 mins and quit because they don't get into the game enough to see how wrong they are.","April 27, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty good game, for free2play game.\nStill, it has many errors, bugs and problems.\nHere is some most annoying problems: game crashes JUST before you have your experience points and money and all that kind of stuff.. at some maps, enemies just run to wall when you are right behind them, and when you are trying to stab them, they do not die.. When you shut down the launcher, steam does still think that the game is on and you got no other way to play something than restart you computer (trust me).\n\nWarface is CoD remake with badder EVERYTHING. (Craphics, gameplay, details, story, weapons etc)\nIt has several gamemodes like Versus (PVP), CO-OP (PVE) and SURVIVAL (PVE).\n-In CO-OP you will be ALWAYS trying to kill enemies in moving vehicle (that is harder than you think),  trying to save same kind of vehicle, destroying motherf*cking godlike robotmachine and after all, trying to get strangers to do what you say.\n-In versus you can choose between tdm, dm, capturing 3 controlpoints, capturing case and cs go competive.\n-In survival you just survival. Its boring, you can play one match in day (you gotta one accest coin in 3.00pm), but still it is the best gamemode in game.\n\nSo, if you dont got any money to spend games, go ahead. Play.\nJust remember, that you still gotta pay to win.\nSeriosly, I dont recommend this. BTW, sorry for my bad english, it isnt my native language..","March 18, 2015","false","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I play alot of tactical FPS games like ArmA and Insurgency, but sometimes I need a break from the slow paced gameplay. And that's where this game comes in.

Many people will disagree, but I can see fun in this game. What I don't like about this game is that you need to RENT weapons unless you spend real money buying "Kredits" to PERMANENTLY buy a weapon. If you're like me and rely on a single weapon to pull through, I suggest becoming skilled with the stock R416 (OBVIOUSLY nothing to do with the M416, even though they're practically identical) or renewing the same weapon over and over again. There's also a strange unlocking system, where you can progress in one of three "sections" (or they say "vendors") I guess: Weapons, Apparell, and Attachments. I think that's what it is like. So basically, you turn on one of the three, progress like any Call of Duty game, then you will get the weapon. I believe it's a permanent if you unlock a weapon from a "vendor," 'cause i got a reflex sight under "attachments" that I can use for any weapon. It might not be.

PvE content is decent, but PvP which is what most people are playing this game for, are pretty much going to be ♥♥♥♥ed over. But you can always hack, won't be any consequences to you.

There are a lot of negative reviews that need justifying. This game is in NO WAY P2W. There are micro transactions sure. But they aren't game breaking in any way. On top of that, there is a renting system. This renting system is pointless in my opinion, but good if you wanted to try a weapon out for a day or more. You can unlock PERMANENT weapons with leveling up and if you pick the weapon option. This is one of the funnest FPS games I've played since MW2. Sliding doesn't make people invincible although they do need to fix the hitboxes to make it more reliable when shooting at them. All in all, this game deserves a better rating then what it gets from people who play for 30 mins and quit because they don't get into the game enough to see how wrong they are.","April 27, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However now I cant stop playing it! The in game kredits you can buy go to mostly cosmetic things such as calling cards/character skins/respawn tokens(Respawn tokens are for co-op missions) Also as far as I can see they keep updating the game often, and have fun little events to win some cool ingame prizes.

They force you to pay to even have a chance to pay for repairs even for non-paytowin gear. The regular top gear for ingame money cost more than you earn in a game to repair.\n\nSlidefest. You are appearantly frictionless in this game cuz you slide for 5-10 meters on any surface. While sliding you also have no accuracy penatly like you can actually aimdownsight without any problems during a slide. Very realistic.\n\nThe slidefest range and speed and the fact that the paytowin shotguns have a huge range with oneshot potential in ANY bodypart is killing the game.\n\nClaymore mines that stay even when you die also make the game quite boring but thats just a slight bad part. Imo in games like this claymores or any rocketry weapons don't fit in at all to begin with.\n\n----\n\nThe possitive thing is the tempo and the maps are mostly quite well made. In the early game where not so many paytowin people are you can actually play fair. I came in 1st place 90% of the time up til lvl 13 where you jump up to meet any higher level players which include all the paytowinners. After that I stuggled hard to reach top 5 any game.\n\nI do think you should pay to play a good game but forcing players to pay the way they do it is purely boring and really killing the game.\nI Play Path Of Exile which is also a FreeToPlay game but they have a non-paytowin system.

Warface is intresting. The gameplay is really fun, the levels are no pushover... and... it's still in beta. Usually I get quite lucky with early access games like this, but this time I did not. An hour or so into the game, while having a grand ole' time, the game sound cuts out, and in it's place comes an alien-like sound. It changes from sounding like an SSTV transmission, to pac-man, multiple times. I asked my friend if he was having the same issue and he said no.  I thought the sound might have been my speakers, as they are really old, but turning off the game revealed that is was in fact Warface. Aside from that bug, gameplay is great, and the mechanics need a bit of work but thats to be expected. Try it out for your self, play with a friend, whatever. It's worth a shot. Give Crytech's first F2P game a chance. Oh, and the graphics, It was easy to tell that the textures were designed so machines that aren't beasts could play it, which is welcome.

Except I just can't play the darn thing. I just bought an Alienware R15 for $1,200 and I can't play Warface? Every attempt to log in is given "login failed", "connection timed out." What really doesn't make sense is that I played close to 40 hours on a Hewlitt-Packard with Intel's Pentium D over the 2016 holidays before my Alienware arrived. How does a system more than 8 years older play a game like Warface with no problem and yet a brand new Gamers laptop can't touch it? All my other Steam Games work way better on my new Alienware. And when I looked for a phone number to call SteamPowered there is one number for reaching known parties extensions that I think is for employees and there is no way to get a live person on the line.

(Permenatly that is)\nNow before I finish this review, lets recap some points I made above.\n\n"Weapons are a bit, unbalanced."\n\nFrom my experience, The guns can be sometimes, way to OP.\nI shot a guy in the face with a shotgun, he survived, then he 1 shot me in the body with the AK and I died.\n\nWhat is logic?\n\n"Not pay-to-win :D"\n\nYou don't have to put money in to get good weapons, good armour, good gear, you just have to unlock them, like in the old games.\n\n"You need "Kredits" to buy skins for your solider. (Permenatly that is)"\n\nThe skins don't really affect your character, (hence the name "skin") But, I don't really get why someone would spend money on a skin that doesnt even make your character better.\n\n"Grenades are a cluster♥♥♥♥ in this game."\n\nWhen the match starts up, you look at your teammates, they pull out a nade and throw it,  As you watch him throw it, you blow up.  Why? Because it's Warface.  Deal with it.\n\nNah I was joking.  In my opinion, grenades need to be toned down a notch, as they can kill you instantly without a Anti-Explosive vest in a close range.  Players in a small map usually stick together and throw all of their 'nades at once, which creates a bombardment of 'nades.  (Means you're ♥♥♥♥ed)  They do this everytime, which of course, makes me whine like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.  And sometimes, they get inspired by terrorists and run up to you with a live grenade.  (May they seek the 12 virgins.)\nOverall, the game isnt so bad, it's rather quite fantastic as a Free-2-Play shooter\n\nWhat do I rate this game?\n\nA 7.5 / 10","March 10","true","107.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The in game kredits you can buy go to mostly cosmetic things such as calling cards/character skins/respawn tokens(Respawn tokens are for co-op missions) Also as far as I can see they keep updating the game often, and have fun little events to win some cool ingame prizes.

There is no way to play with a friend on the same team on versus (no way to strategize with a friend). It is too easy to hack the game because Crytek put NO anti-cheat measures into the game. In the many games I tried to play I found multiple hackers using aimbots and wallhacks. When I want to play a co-op game I like playing with 1 friend.

However now I cant stop playing it! The in game kredits you can buy go to mostly cosmetic things such as calling cards/character skins/respawn tokens(Respawn tokens are for co-op missions) Also as far as I can see they keep updating the game often, and have fun little events to win some cool ingame prizes.

Even Team Fortress 2 looks better and that game doesn't have graphics as one of its top prioritys unlike Crytek do and fail to deliver with gameplay (With a few exceptions). The game also stutters during combat which also gives you an unfair disadvantage resulting in you rage quitting. Also this game is a COD clone. Dont fight me. It is.

When I first starting playing it there were very few game modes to chose from.  The coop screen had only three difficulties; easy, medium and hard.  The versus (I don't really remember what everything looked like) had maybe team death match, plant the bomb, and free-for-all.  Special Operations were included in coop originally, but several additions to SO were put in, which made it stand out as one separate mode.  The original SO had just tower raid, which was 18 floors of increasingly more difficult AI's attacking you with shotguns, knives and other explosives; and just MAYBE Cold Peak.\n\nWith the doubling of coop missions (now Easy, 2 normal, 2 hard, and one insane), tripling of versus (now free-for-all, team death match, plant the bomb, bag-and-tag, storm, capture, and domination), and tripling of Special Ops (now tower raid, Cold peak, and cyber horde), this game has been my most played game for over 2 years.\n\nThere was just a recent update called "Operation Coliseum" which I haven't played yet (cuz I'm writing this review), I don't know if it's Special Ops or not yet.\n\nCoop missions start with your team (consisting of between 3-5 players depending on which difficulty your on) entering the map in a chopper, rather than just spawning in the map randomly.  After leaving the chopper and walking a bit away, it will fly away far beyond the map's exterior and not show up again until the end of the section.  Once in the map, players much work as a team to complete the mission by killing all enemies (called "Blackwood), including regular, on-ground fighters, snipers, shields and machine gunners.  There is a mid-map boss called a heavy gunner which can only be killed by shooting him in his back with heavy fire.  One good way of killing him is by flanking him and waiting for him to have his back towards you.  Once he starts to reload his machine gun, the sniper and medic can reek all havoc on his back and kill him.  I have been in games where 3 or 4 veteran players automatically, without thinking, go into strategic battle alignment and kill him instantly.  It is POSSIBLE to kill him yourself (I speak from 2 experiences), but you need to be patient and resourceful for a long time.\n\nTowards the end of most games, there is a boss called a "mech", which is very hard to kill.  You have to use bazooka-like guns to shoot him in his belly several times before he falls.  When he is down, you must shoot the top of his head until he dies.  Repeat several times.\n\nOnly 2 maps have an enemy chopper to destroy at the end.  To destroy them all you have to do is shoot it with bazookas like 10 times.\n\nI know I'm going on and on about this game without really REVIEWING it.  So here's my opinion.\n\nOne of the pros to warface are the games modes.  There are 15 possible games to chose from (listed above), and dozens of maps to play them on.  My favorite modes are storm, plant the bomb, capture, insane, and easy.  I can complete easy by myself so I usually just find 2 or 3 noob players to carry them through it.  On the dark side I usually need 3 or 4 veteran players to carry ME through the insane maps lol.\n\nThis game needs two things: A single player campaign (or better yet a campaign where a team of 3 or 4 friends can play through several hours of Blackwood enemies and missions, all in one big "story") and a decent voice chat.\n\nOne con to this entire game are the hackers.  In EVERY SINGLE MAP there is at least ONE hacker who has an outrageous KD who no one can kill.  Luckily Crytek has implemented "fair-fight" into Warface, so every few days I get a worldwide notification that "so-and-so" got banned for life.\n\nThat's all from me, I highly recommend this game for anyone who likes immersive coop missions and severely intense special ops.  Its free and only takes 2 hours to download.  HAVE FUN!!!\n\nAlmost forgot, most of the original coop maps aren't available thanks to the new updates and maps that come out every few months.","March 31","true","591.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Warface is one of the best F2P FPS's I've played in a while, since the main reason being that buying Kredits (in-game currency that you have to pay for IRL) is totally optional and not mandatory, I've managed to get a lot of items without spending a cent.\n\nConclusion:this game is worth trying if you don't mind grinding a bit to get weapons and equipment,it's fun and interesting. In the end it's a better alternative then A LOT of the other F2P FPS's out there. You can get any gun you want permanently if you just work for it a bit.","May 19, 2015","true","351.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An okay timewaster.\n\nPositive:\nThe coop isn't too bad and seems to have different missions every few days/weeks. Difficulty is quite challenging and needs the team to work effectively together instead of running headfirst into the horde alone. Mech bosses look cool but can be absolute BS with their nonstop rocket spam.\nDespite so many cashshop items the versus seems suprisingly balanced at first, though there is a slight class imbalance.\n\nNegative:\nAdvertisements and "offers" for cashshop items everywhere. Lag pretty much at any given time, long loading times and unnecessary long waiting time for the result screen before you can click back to menu/lobby. Massively stupid enemy AI and glitchy gameplay now and then. BS enemies like riotshields who rush and instantly knock you down everywhere. Snipers have a 50% miss rate simply due to lag, shotguns are awful to useless past the 5 meter mark.\n\nIf you are searching for a good online FPS (especially VS) avoid it.","July 10, 2014","false","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

These items include weapons, different pieces of armour and accessories (new sight, sniper tripod, silencer, etc) which you use in game to set your weapon up to your specifications.  There are obviously extra perks, weapons and boosts you can purchase, however, the game is very enjoyable without them.\n\nWarface is updated fairly regularly and there are different game modes to play too which helps to prevent the game from becoming too monotonous.

Did I mention medic is OP? I didn't? Well, most medics use OP full-auto shotguns or OP pump-shotguns. If you play medic, you're going to win.

Players are all nice.\nThe multiplayer is a 16 players max, which is alot and fun, and coop is 5 players versus the server/computer, which is tons of fun.\n\nThe weapon customization is pretty big, I would like some more options like painting, decals and more (If they are aready there, sorry im only rank 11).\nAnother customizationsis the outfit and bages to decorate your nickname.\n\nOne problem I have which isn't major, is the cost.

What I like about this game is that you have to earn your gear and weapons and Armor by playing Co-op matches and Multiplayer now if you play Multiplayer here is a tip play as the engineer its one of the best classes to play you can put a claymore or any other mine down at a spot at it stays there even after you die and if you put it down where alot of people run you might get lucky and get a mine kill of a double kill the engineer is very good class for close up counters and Ambushes The sniper is also good if you are is a good spot. The Medic has a shotgun so if you get close up and personal make sure you can shoot fast because it only take one wrong move and you are dead and finally the Solider the all around class is a very good class for close med or long range but dont get cocky because alot of players think because they are soliders but anybody can kill soliders with a simple grenade or mine","August 13, 2014","true","35.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(if you want to affoard a good weapon)\n\nAnd there is a resurrection coins which you can resurrect from dead in co-op only which you need it mostly in Survival & Tower Raid mode and if you don't have these coins then you're doomed! you can earn 2 coins by loging in into the game 7 days in a row  which is not enough at all! so you have to buy them by spending Kredits & as i said before you need to SPEND a real money to get those!\n\nThe biggest problem of all is the huge amount of HACKERS in both PvP & Co-Op!! I've spent so damn hours and I'm still level 20!! and then i've got a new friend request and i accepted and he was level 1! after 5 days he is level 35!!!! it turned out that he is a freakin HACKER! i can't believe that someone just by shooting in the sky got to this level.. And me by playing so damn much still in that level!!! that's really NOT DAMN FAIR!\n\nSo overall this game is a total waste of time & money!! the only people who will enjoy playing this game are 2 kind:\n1- Rich\n2- Hacker","February 4, 2015","false","290.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
