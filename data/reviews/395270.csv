"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/395270/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nA Wolf in Autumn is a short puzzle adventure game that was released in October 2015, being developed by David Szymanski. As you get told when launching the game, it is intended that you finish it in one sitting, which takes about an hour.\n\nYou play the game as a young girl, and you find yourself in a forest at the start of the game, locked in a shed by your mother. To begin with your mother and surroundings seem very peaceful, but this soon takes a dark turn. Gameplay is from a first person perspective, and the main tasks involve solving puzzles that use real world logic. The puzzles do require some thought though; you shouldn’t be put off by the starting area as that is the one I found the most difficult. I’m not ashamed to say I spent at least ten minutes trying to get out of the shed only for the answer to be extremely obvious. You are able to pick up objects, but sadly you can only have on item in your possession at a time, meaning a lot of running back and forth to get items is required.\n\nThe game is run using the Unity 5 engine, and whilst the graphics aren’t the best, they do portray the darkness and surreal atmosphere very well. The game does have some nice lighting effects as well. It can be run on pretty much any resolution up to and including 4k.  The voice acting of your mother is very well done too; I genuinely got scared towards the end of the game just from the sound of her voice.\n\nWhilst there isn’t a very deep plot to this game, there are still some underlying potentially disturbing themes on show, and is not something which people who are easily upset by such things as child abuse should take lightly.  Maybe the developer is trying to show us something through the story, I don’t know, but I found it very interesting to see how the plot unfolded.\n\nAs you can see from the amount of time to play the game, I didn’t find it all that difficult. If you apply logic to the puzzles, you can easily work them out, and often just pausing for a moment and thinking how you would get out of this situation yourself is usually the write answer.  I completed the game in about half an hour.  Some might think that is short for any game, and I can see why, but I was enthralled with the game from the get-go so I am not going to complain too much about the shortness.  I have seen that you can complete puzzles in more than one way as well; this may add a little replicability but I am more than happy with just the one play through to satisfy my experience with this title.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing; it is running on a very well matured engine so it should be expected.\n\nI enjoyed my time playing A Wolf in Autumn, not all horror experiences have to include an abundance of jump scares to be classed as scary; the atmosphere and undertones of this game are scary enough for me. The price of £1, 59 is fair, regardless of the length of the game. The developer has put plenty of hours into making a really good game, and that is definitely worth the £1, 59 in my eyes.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I'm not ashamed to declare that I'm addicted to beautiful, elegant and eerie atmospheres that he creates, veiling disturbing realities. A Wolf in Autumn is no exception.\n\nThe sun raising on a beautiful shore line, waves cradling the shore on endless motions, bathed within the rays of sun themselves... Is this the scent of sea? No. Lights do shimmer through an old wooden wall, crafted either lazily, or without much skill. We are able to see an autumn garden through the cracks between planks. We are in a shed. Who are we? As we get out of the shed, we encounter an odd mechanism. As we push the button on the strange machine, a woman's voice calls us to warn that there are wild animals around. "Go back to the shed, sweetie. There are wolves in the woods".\n\nA Wolf in Autumn presents us a dreamlike experience, in which we take the part of Autumn, a 9 year old girl. She is in an autumn garden and wanders around, hearing her mother's voice through some strange machinations around. As we keep our progress, things do take a turn for a darker nature. Concepts such as pride, nature, innocence and responsibility are discussed, and we once again face that the reality itself is much cruder and darker than any monster under our beds could possibly be.\n\nThe narration and the voice acting of the mother come into a spectacular combination, and carry you though a genuine uneasiness. Graphics do hail from basic unity, but seeing the display of light, shadows and colors in this specific manner, you are reminded that this is a game by David Syzmanski. Added background noises; growls, swaying trees and mechanical sounds, this is a brilliant success on atmospheric horror yet again!\n\nAs for gameplay, it might be defined as a short atmospheric horror + walking simulation with puzzle elements. It is a bit hard to tag these games with a genre, but I can most certainly tell that they carry artistic and philosophical quality. The whole game wouldn't take more than an hour, and it is intended to be completed on one sitting, as David Syzmanski's most games. So, there is no save game feature. We move around with WASD and carry some items to complete some basic puzzles. We are not capable of carrying more than one item at any time, so if we'd need the same item again, we have to look around to find it. I know it sounds a bit annoying, but it is a choice for story purposes. When the reason behind is explained, you'll be shocked. I promise.\n\nA Wolf in Autumn is a short, deep and dark experience rather than a game. I wouldn't recommend any game coming from David Syzmanski if you are looking for an adrenaline rush. If you'd like to indulge yourself with a shiver and some pondering afterwards, you are welcome.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","3"

As said before Szymanski doesn't shy away from darker themes and he surely isn't afraid to hold back here: what the voice says to you, its extremely violent and hateful tone and the details of certain events are truly unpleasant.\n\nI think it works so well cause, without spoiling anything, the story is about events that do happen in real life and I like to think that certain actual facts can be way scarier than an imaginary monster due to the fact they do really happen and'd affect us, people we know or be something we've seen in a newspaper.\n\nThe gameplay itself is decent, you'll have to explore around to find tools and then use the right one on the right object: sometimes the solution might be less straightforward than it first seems and a couple objects/ levers might require you to think a bit. There's not much of a challenge though, the game is more interested in telling you a story rather than challenging your brain.\n\nA Wolf in Autumn felt like a distilled form of what the dev is known for as a short and extremely unsettling journey that, when played in the dark and with headphones on as recommended, game me a few goosebumps due to how immersed I was in a truly unpleasant and quite real scenario. It's a game I recommend as an example of psychological horror done right.","October 27, 2015","true","0.7"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","2"

As with his pervious works, he takes a psychological horror concept and really drives it home using minimallistic and yet lush and evocative scenery with a short tale attached. To tell you any more than what is in the store page would be a disservice to a person wishing to play this, so I wont go into my personal thoughts on the story, but I will say that it is quite compelling.\n\nThis time around, the Unity 5 engine, but without using stock assets. This marks an evolution in Mr Syzmanski's development ideas and skills, as previouosly, he used stock assets (to perfection). Actually, if you were to play each of his games in order of release, you would easily be able to track a clear progression is ability and skill, with this game as the current culmination of his previous efforts.\n\nAs with previous games, this game makes heavy use of the interplay between light, darkness, and shadow to emphasize the desired atmosphere. Additionally, the original soundtrack and sounds further enhance the experience. All was done in outstanding fashion.\n\nAnother appealing aspect of this game was the 45 minute to 1 hour length. In my opinion, it was the perfect length to accomplish the goals it sets out to accomplish.\n\nThe controls are simple WASD with R/L mouse to pick up, use, and drop items, and shift to run, since walking around exploration games slowly is always something of a chore (in my opinion. I appreciate it when devs include running despite it not being strictly necessary).\n\nThe puzzles in this game werent too difficult to solve, but were clever, making good use of the items available in the game without getting in the way of the experience.\n\nAnyway, I can go on and on about this game, but I will simply close out here by stating that this was a special experience and I was glad for the opportunity to play this game.\n\n9 out of 10.\n\nPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog#curation - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","November 1, 2015","true","0.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","3"

There isnt any exactly, IMO there could have been more in depth puzzles, bigger areas and more content to explore but for the price you pay i cant complain, and im sure theres people out there who dont enjoy puzzles being too in depth or tedious anyway.\n\nOverall a great little game (and little it is) one your only gonna play through once, easy to understand, easy to play, with a freaky storyline that keeps you on your toes until the end and a few not so cryptik puzzles along the way, just wear sunglasses is all i can say :D\n\n","January 5","true","1.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","1"

I'm a solid fan of this developer in general, but I don't think this is his best.\n\nFirst, I've played through it twice now and the story is... less clear than I would like.  That's both good and bad.  The story is clear enough that I know it's not supposed to be clear.  I'm fairly sure I understand the high-level backstory behind the two characters.  I'm also reasonably sure I understand the "perspective" that causes some of the rapid swings in the environment and other oddities.  But there's the lingering sense that I'm missing something.  A feeling as if I've managed to figure out the backstory while somehow overlooking the plot.  It's odd.  What I think I understand isn't a bad story -- it has some very intriguing themes going.  It's just that they don't seem to be going forward.  At all.  Like unearthing the backstory IS the story, but nothing moves forward once you grasp the setup.\n\nSecond, though the game does explain why you don't have an inventory...  I'm still more inclined to just call the interface "unfinished."\n\nThird, it can be REALLY hard to see where you're going the first time you play.  This has pros and cons.  Pros: atmospheric, very pretty, appropriately creepy.  Cons: can occasionally get lost in a seemingly infinite black void because you can't tell the difference between lack of light and walls.\n\nAll in all, rough around some edges, but an interesting experience I wish we saw a lot more of!","January 30","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

You can hold one item at a time to carry and use and drop, but there are duplicates of the important ones. The mechanics make this an adventure, but that's not what it is about.\n\nThis game appeals more to the emotions than to logic. Who are we, where are we, and why is everything so strange and fearsome? Even more than in the free Fingerbones, Szymanski manages to aim from the surreal straight into a reality that is uncomfortably close to home. There are no cheap tricks, the chills does not stem from the unknown, but from reminding us of the known that is so terrifying.\n\nThe 3D modeling is crude but effective, the sound effects and voice carry the game.\n\nThe game is only about an hour long. The author recommends that it be played in one sitting (you can't save), and with headphones, and while you can do the headphones or not (a good sound system is probably better), having an hour in a dimly lit room with no distractions seems a good way to play this.\n\nIt's good.","February 5","true","2.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

People may differ on what they conceive as horror, but for me, this is a horror game. Yes, it continues the sort of exploratory and puzzle style with focus on narration and story from the dev's previous games, but it is terrifying to me.\n\nIt begins with some text that appears straightforward, but then gets increasingly intense as the text screens progress, accompanied by some very aptly ominous music. And that's just the prologue before the game begins. You awaken to find yourself in a bright, oversaturated, and mesmerizing arboreal environment. And things seem pleasant again. Yeah, you're locked in a shed, but you easily get out, and you're able to communicate with your mom. But as you begin to explore your surroundings, things get more unnerving, and you find yourself feeling more vulnerable.\n\nThat's much as I can really describe of the setting without spoiling anything. The story in AWIA is a bit vague and unclear at first (and even a little after a second viewing), but it's not a disservice to the game. It's a very surreal experience, and the game does an excellent job of slowly giving more information to the player about who you are and what is going on. It's actually done very well, and adds to why the game is so scary to me. I can't really say much, but just the little bits of flavor text when you pick up certain items, or enter certain areas help to convey, although not so subtly, very organically, bits and pieces of your character (like why you can only carry one item at a time).\n\nSpeaking of flavor text, the dev mentioned to me in a previous comment how one of the things he added in The Music Machine, was a larger variety of objects in the world to interact with because he felt that it added immersion. I definitely agree, and it was one of the things I liked in TMM versus The Moon Sliver. It gets even better in this game. When you attempt to use certain objects to deal with certain puzzles, there's actually unique text describing why your item doesn't work, instead of a generic “this item does not work here”. It's great, and I could be wrong, but I think there are also different ways to solve some of the different puzzles. All this just adds to the immersion, that you really are a little girl just fumbling around trying to figure stuff out.\n\nAnd as you try to figure stuff out, the game may seem a bit slow at the beginning (at least it was for me, because I could not figure out many of the puzzles without quite a bit of roaming about because the...trigger points aren't as obvious), but it's quite rewarding, and like many good horror films...it gets increasingly disturbing as you progress, until you get to the final sequence and it's just snowballing in your face.\n\nOverally, I greatly recommend this if you're into the previous games by the dev. And even if you weren't, I feel like you might have a different opinion about this. The game is much more intense. The puzzles are much more interesting. And the voice acting is incredible (as I said, this game legitimately scares me. It's emotionally taxing for all sorts of reasons). The story and characters seem rich. I say seem, because again, it's a bit unclear. But as I said, it's not a bad thing, and I look forward to additional plays, and looking through internet discussions to piece together exactly what is going on between the girl and her mother.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, and very fitting as you'll find. The music is excellent as with the dev's previous works. And at the end of the day. It's cheap, it's a quick play (under an hour). If you're looking for a quick, immersive, horror experience but with more emotional and narrative substance, I'm not sure you can really do better than this.","December 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I'll try my best, however.\n\nWhile this is a short game, it is certainly not a bad game. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The colours almost seem to bleed out in this game, particularly in the outdoors area. In my eyes, that is intentional and you will understand why as you get further into the game.\n\nLittle creepy touches add a nice feeling to the game. Reading the descriptions that Autumn says when clicking on items can shed a lot of light on what is really going on.\n\nOne thing did annoy me a little, and that was the fact that I had to drop the flashlight to pick up a different item. Depending on how far the location is that you need to use the other item, you can find yourself stuck in the dark for a bit. That certainly was not enough to dampen my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThis is a game that will make you think at the end of it, and may induce you to play it again just to see how differently you see things at the beginning, and how they tie into the end.\n\nI highly recommend this game as it is a lot of fun and does make you think about it after you have reached the end.","November 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Szymanski's storytelling prowess shows itself in every image, every sound, and most game interactions, creating an exploration of a topic that many other games shy away from (listen up 'cause gaming needs this. It's important).\n\nA lot can be said about a user interface this smooth and simple that still yields so many different possible actions, but I still felt like there were unexplored gameplay possibilities this time around. Previous games felt tight and concise, without a wasted mechanic or item. Everything fed the tale, and the tale fed everything. Ultimately, I felt that the puzzle elements here could get in the way of the meat-and-potatoes (except where the two intertwined to wonderful effect with the button messages reacting to player actions).\n\nSymbolism appears in abundance, and Szymanski uses that to reinforce the game's themes in smart ways. This is a game that will ask you to think about its content after it's complete. Maybe even play it a second time to help tie all of its elements together. It adds up to a whole that is equal parts thrilling (hinted threat), engaging (inquisitivity), and repulsive (overt threat). A masterful combination of horror craft.\n\nThe main takeaway is this (TL;DR): David Szymanski keeps getting better, in every sense. Technical improvements are obvious through screenshots. This game contains more classical game play than his previous titles. His stories are just as powerfully delivered as they have been since Fingerbones hit the indie horror scene.\n\nAnd while some may contend that the game is too short (it is quite short), I contend that that is at least partially the point. The origins of literary horror took root in the short story, in the compact punch that format delivers best. These games are the interactive manifestation of that early horror tradition. You can't have Stephen King's long-winded ♥♥♥ without Poe, Hawthorne, and Lovecraft. And we can't rightly have unique interactive horror experiences without our short-form pioneers. Again, the work is important.","October 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Once you've played it for about 3 minutes you get the hang of it and things shouldn't be to difficult, but they are made in a clever way. But if you're stuck just use a walkthrough, nothing wrong with that.\n\nI mean.. I don't really know how to properly review this game.\n\nYou play as a little girl with one hand as I understand it, you're in a locked in a shed which you complete a puzzle to get out of, you then recieve a message from your mother, once you progress in the game you get more increasingly aggresive messages from your mother.\n\nThe gameplay for what kind of game it is, is great, the story is... fine(when I say story I mean the dialouge and the text you're introduced with/the game ends with).\nIf you're familiar with this developers previous games then expect the same atmosphere, and strange game in a different setting.\nThis developer really knows how to do psychological horror the right way, great to play in the dark.\nThe game is grim, the atmosphere is dark.\n\nIt's hard to not spoil the story when talking about it so I wont. Experience it for yourself.\n\nI don't want to go into it more. Try it for yourself when you're in the right mindset, it's short and cheap, nothing to lose.\n\nBut, as always with these games, you have to play it when you're in the right mood/mindset to properly enjoy it, to get what you want out of it.\nI think everyone who already enjoy games like these, strange games, walking simulators etc... know what I am talking about.\nI personally don't think you can just go into a game like Gone Home at anytime, you have to be in the correct mood to really enjoy it.\nIf you know you're not in the right mood then wait and play it when you are in the correct mood.\n\nBy the way the starting area of the game has extremely bright colours, they actually made my eyes weird.. I don't know how to explain, so if you have any health related issues with that then don't play this.\n\n\n\n*One thing I always recommend developers of games like this is add some achievements. It does sell your game to completionists who want 100% achievements in games. It doesn't take much effort to add some, just do it.","April 7","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In David's games?\n\nThis is it. I'm done. Whatever I could say afterwards would be pointless.\n\n///////////////////////////////\nEjem.\n\nA Wolf in Autumn is about a girl locked down in a shed. The first puzzle is quite simple, but what I liked the most was the fact that there's not just one way to solve it. And the ones who follow may have another solution as well...\n\nWhile other David's games puzzles are easy to solve (or almost nonexistent) this change is, I can tell, for the best (even I got stuck once).\n\nThe music in this game is less present as in The Music Machine, but it does sound good, and the ambiental sounds are well placed.\n\nIt also has dubbed text! However, as English is not my primary language, even though I could understand the 95% of the words spoken, subtitles would be a nice addition.\n\nGraphics have improved since last time, although I'm not very picky with this things as far as it looks nice and run smoothly.\n\nFinally, the story is really great, as you don't know anything until it's too late... And perhaps even then you won't.\n\nI personally recommend A Wolf in Autumn if you enjoy story-driven games, puzzles, and a little of horror in the cocktail.\nAnd it's now just a single euro! Buy! Right now!\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nEspera.\n\n¿Es esto.... un menú en condiciones? ¿En un juego de David?\nYa está. Me rindo. Cualquier cosa que pudiera decir después sería en vano.\n///////////////////\nEjem.\n\nA Wolf in Autumn trata de una chica que aparece encerrada en un cobertizo. El primer puzle es sencillo, pero lo que más me ha gustado es el hecho de que no hay una única forma de resolverlo. Incluso los puzles que le siguen pueden que tenga más de una posibilidad...\n\nMientras que en otros juegos de David los puzles son fáciles (o inexistentes), este cambio ha sido a mejor (incluso me quedé atrancado una vez).\n\nLa música está menos presente que en The Music Machine (otro juego del autor), pero suena bien, y los sonidos ambientales están bien implementados.\n\n¡Incluso tiene voces en el juego! Eso sí, puesto que mi idioma principal no es el inglés, pese a que entendí muchas palabras, unos subtítulos hubieran venido bien.\n\nLos gráficos han mejorado desde la última vez, si bien es cierto que tampoco me preocupo por ellos, siempre y cuando funcionen bien.\n\nFinalmente, con respecto a la historia cabe decir que está bastante bien. Sin desvelar nada lo único que puedo decir es que no sabrás realmente nada hasta que sea demasiado tarde... E incluso entonces quizás tampoco.\n\nRecomiendo personalmente este juego a aquellos que les guste los juegos con una buena historia, puzles y, por qué no, un toque terrorífico. Y además, ahora mismo vale un euro. ¡Corred, malditos!","October 27, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/night_trekker/recommended/395270/","night_trekker","night_trekker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/night_trekker/","481 products in account","David Szymanski is one of those indie developers making "games as art." Even to open-minded players, that can be a turn-off. There is no lack of pretentious, patronizing, and often preachy nonsense out there, and that can understandibly sour gamers towards arthouse titles. But unlike those developers, Szymanski is creating profound, memorable experiences with compact, well-written narratives, and he is doing so with no agenda but his artistic vision.\n\nMy first of Szymanski's games was the free Fingerbones, which was strong enough to get me to pay for futher games. The second was the powerful The Moon Silver, which is by far my favorite of his stories. And the third is A Wolf in Autumn. All three games place an emphasis on psychological horror, and all three are short, playable in a single one-hour sitting. All three contain characters constructed through text, audio, and, for the playable characters, gameplay. You generally won't see character models on-screen, but that doesn't detract from the experience. Anyone who has played a well-crafted text-heavy game (or read a good book, for that matter) knows memorable characters are created through writing, not through visuals. Gameplay can be described, and not inaccurately, as "walking simulator with puzzles," and that's fine.

Made sense to me as where I lived had more Ukrainians than French people. The problem, everyone in my class already spoke Ukrainian, so at times I sat in my desk bewildered as the students communicated to the teacher in a language they were already familiar with. She gave me the feeling that I shouldn’t really be there, and made no attempt to make me think otherwise. So after I learned the alphabet, I quit going. Never heard a word from her.\n\nThat’s how I felt at times during this game.\n\nAlthough right from the start reading is involved, most is learned from visuals and sound, designed in a very unique, and sort of “troubled” way. When I write the word “troubled” I mean at times I actually felt so, and found myself inside the mind of this troubled little girl, getting a rough view of her world.\n\nWhat is supposed to make the story work is what we’re NOT told. Call me crazy, (pun intended) but for me these psycho games at times just don’t work. I’m not familiar with the problems this little girl dealt with. It was hard for me to pick up on what the designer was trying to convey; which, after giving it some thought, is simply genius.\n\nWhy genius?\n\nBecause the game successfully instilled in me the confusion that would be in the mind of this little girl; by making common objects that I came across look, strange, and noises that I heard, bizarre. So the story becomes fully developed in a symbolism that implies a horrific event. I was at times looking around wondering, “what the heck is going on?”\n\nTo me, that’s what made it amazing. I didn’t like the confused feelings I had during the game, as at times things weren’t making sense. But then I thought, perhaps that is exactly how this little girl felt!\n\nSo if you decide to play the game keep in mind that although it is a simple story it will require some thought for you to determine the true relationship between the mother and the daughter.\n\nThe voiceover for Autumn’s mother is impressively done emoting concern that often shifts to psychotic.\n\nI have to admit that although there is a fascinating story here, at the end I didn’t really understand what I had just played through. But then again, perhaps that’s what the designer was trying to do. Give me the feeling of such a life at the hands of such a parent that at a tender age would make me feel “what am I doing here and why?”\n\nIf you’re panning for something different, this game will not disappoint. It’s short, or long, considering how well you can put two and two together when solving puzzles.","April 4","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like the love child between David Lynch and Silent Hill told as a children's story, so if any of those things strike your fancy you will probably be glad you took the journey. Like Szymanski's other games the music is absolutely gorgeous, and the ending is emotional and poignant. Some people may not like the graphical style, but it's a unique palette for a "horror" game and that's commendable (I'm so tired of desaturated earth tones). I found the shadows outside distracting, but it didn't detract from the overall experience.

Expect a quick game, 30 minutes to an hour. You play as a young girl, locked in a shed and told to stay put. But ah, intrepid souls, we must escape. After the start up screen there is a bit of reading for the intro that vaguely sets the mood and gives a sense about what the story is going to be. As far as horror games go, this has some potential, and there are a few moments that are scary, but overall it falls more into the "a little creepy" category. From stumbling into the dark basement and scrambling for lights, to the howling of wolves just beyond the fence, the game never quite consistently reaches fear, but settles on more of a sense of unease. This isn't a bad thing, and I applaud the dev for avoiding use of jump scares and other poor horror tactics.\n\nVisually, the game does its job well enough, I could tell what's what and no textures or models were so bad they gave me pause. There is, however, one glaring exception. The lighting outside is really not good. I'm not sure what mood the dev was going for when he set those colors, but wonderland acid-trip was probably not it. With the colors a little too bright and the shadows  too dark, solving puzzles outsides becomes kind of a headache because of the contrast. Luckily, because of the games length you quickly descend into the basement, where the colors are more subdued and the darkness is more fitting and atmospheric. So although the terrible outdoor lighting gets the game off on a bad foot, it doesn't ruin the game by any means.\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple, with several ways to solve many of them that are intuitive and logical. I would like a little more challenge, but I would rather have logical, simple puzzles, than challenging illogical ones. Not much more to say on these.\n\nThe story is simple, and could use some fleshing out, but for how long the game is it tells a pretty complete tale. Adding a few more puzzles and some more interactive story telling aspects could really help give the character a face, since even at the end I still know very little about her. As a psychological horror game goes, A Wolf in Autumn is acceptable, but there could be so much more. I would love to see it move through more phases, showing us a little more of each "layer" of the main character.\n\nEvery now and again, a tin box in the middle of the room will light up and start beeping, which means you have a message from your mother waiting. The beeping wasn't too bad, if a little grating, but I feel like some of the horror was taken from the game by the fact that the tracks have to be played maunally. Also, as a note to the dev, why use the tin box when you already have a radio item that you can interact with? I feel like that could have been used, with static signaling when a message was available. Just a thought. The female voice actor used was good, although not stellar. There are no points where I was blown away by how good or bad she was, but she played the part and delivered the lines in a way that was consistent.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed A Wolf in Autumn, although not the scariest horror game I've played, it did capture my curiousity with an interesting story. Id like to see where else this developer goes, since he seems to have a decent grasp of what makes a game scary, but needs to gain more experience in game design before he can really implement it.\n\nTldr; This game is very indie, expect that. It is also very much worth 2 dollars, so you'll be getting what you pay for, but expect 2 dollars worth of game.\n\nNote to Dev: I really encourage you to make this game again later on, with more people involved in the design. I like the story and direction, and I would enjoy learning more about the characters and playing through the puzzles.","October 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite all its flaws, the game still has something going for it, and it was better that I was expecting for a cheap indie game on steam. I would recommend checking it out, but only if you are willing to spend the $1.20 on a something that has quite a few flaws. If this is was a mod for another game, or realised freely, I feel that I would absolutely recommend it, but the extremely short running time of this product, combined with the relative jankyness might make it hard to justify the price, even if it’s less that an packet of chips. While this is a very interesting game, I’ve seen a number of projects that ellipse the scope of this game be released as mods, such as the original version of the Stanley parable or The Worry of Newport, so that may also make the purchase just that much more difficult. However, if you have $1.20 left over from selling your steam trading cards, I would say give it a go.

Even to open-minded players, that can be a turn-off. There is no lack of pretentious, patronizing, and often preachy nonsense out there, and that can understandibly sour gamers towards arthouse titles. But unlike those developers, Szymanski is creating profound, memorable experiences with compact, well-written narratives, and he is doing so with no agenda but his artistic vision.\n\nMy first of Szymanski's games was the free Fingerbones, which was strong enough to get me to pay for futher games. The second was the powerful The Moon Silver, which is by far my favorite of his stories. And the third is A Wolf in Autumn. All three games place an emphasis on psychological horror, and all three are short, playable in a single one-hour sitting. All three contain characters constructed through text, audio, and, for the playable characters, gameplay. You generally won't see character models on-screen, but that doesn't detract from the experience. Anyone who has played a well-crafted text-heavy game (or read a good book, for that matter) knows memorable characters are created through writing, not through visuals. Gameplay can be described, and not inaccurately, as "walking simulator with puzzles," and that's fine. That's all that needed.\n\nThere's not much I can say specifically without spoiling the experience of A Wolf in Autumn. When it intends to be beautiful, it's beautiful.

Along with great atmosphere the story itself is quite interesting as you start off not knowing anything about your character and it is only with more exploration and progress you delve deeper into the dark fathoms of your characters life.\n\nHowever there are a few things that could be improved on , such as constantly having to drop one item to pick up another, which is explained why, but drags the game out a little longer when it really doesn't have to as there is a point where you end up in a dark room and you can't keep your flashlight on you whilst using other items . Although it does state it is a short horror game I had it completed in like 30 minutes or so which you could argue is worth the 79p I paid for it as it is a really good experience and I guess I am left with wanting a bit more , but the more I am wanting is perhaps more backstory to the character and a bit more explanation. But then again the game does give you enough and I guess you are left to finish it off in your head.\n\nOverall i would give the a game a 7/10 based on how cheap I got it and how much I enjoyed playing it.\n\nWorth a playthrough at least.","December 23, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very short from start to finish, about an hour, but is still fun. Feeds on certain senses to cause the fear it drives to obtain from the player. Not a bad game for the right price, pick it up for under a dollar if you can, but would not pay more. Had fun overall and will probably play again somewhere down the road.","February 16","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just finished this game, so thought I'd write a short review.\n\nI enjoyed the story. It wasn't at all what I thought it'd be, which is by no means a bad thing. This is more of an example of 'the game existing simply to be a vessel for the story,' rather than a game with a story tacked on as an afterthought. (if that makes any sense?)\n\nI generally enjoy games with a good and/or mature story, as they seem to be hard to come by. A Wolf in Autumn certainly delivered. While I was hoping to see relationships or inspirations from the things the dev mentioned (Sound and the Fury, Silent Hill 2, Mulholland Drive) as I love each one, I could find nothing. Not going to knock any points though. (Although on a personal note, I'd be curious to know what about/what parts of the game the dev feels were inspired by these things.)\n\nI did pick up the developer's other two games as well, and I'm looking forward to seeing if they are just as engaging.\n\nA few... well, not really cons, per say...\n\nI've got a i7 5930 and a ASUS Strix GTX 980Ti. I can run GTA V in three screen surround mode maxed out and my temps don't get as high as they do in this game playing in 1920*1080 borderless windowed. Generally my CPU temp is 28-33C at idle depending on ambient room temp, and GPU is 30-34C. This game had the CPU up to 45C and the GPU up to 76C. I opened my GPU manager and set a custom fan profile, which I've never done before, simply because of the extreme temp increase this game caused. It just seems like this game may not be very well optimized.\n\nLast thing is that, if you are epileptic or have photosensitive seizures, The contrast in the opening area, as well as the choice of lighting can make it hard on your eyes and head. Soon after you reach the basement, there will also be a badly flickering overhead light. A few minutes after the basement light came on, my head hurt so bad and I felt so drained I had to take an extended break. (Hence the long play time for what is a very short game.) So just be aware.\n\nAll in all, good game, great story and well worth the asking price. Enjoy.","March 15","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, Fingerbones was a delight for a earlier piece of work from him. This title on the other hand, felt like a step back, perhaps even lazier project? Compared to his other titles, this one is just alright. As a standalone affair, I say it builds up environmental atmosphere wonderfully but lacks much in the way of an ellegantly designed story. It did not provoke emotion, it just confused me. When I finally understood, I felt cheated.\n\nIn summary, you get what you pay for I suppose. Excellent environment/voice acting/ sound track. A rather lack luster writing. Good introduction piece but for fans of his stuff, you'll probably feel let down.\n\n7/10","November 29, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read this only after you've played the game and you have your own opinion of it :) Otherwise, you know - SPOILERS :)\n\nSo this game, I feel is obviously about the drama between a mother and her daughter. The mother has lead a heavy, very heavy life, full of mistakes, full of wrongs. She has only her pride left... barely.The daughter sences this and much more. She feels her mother's pain and wants to help her. But she's refused. The game takes place in a nightmare, hence all the tripping colours and weird machinations. At first I asked myself if this is a metaphore for a womb and escaping from it. Close to the end you cut some bloody ropes, which remind me of umbelical cords.\n\nI believe the mother can\'t let her child go and wants to protect her from the evil in the world... I honestly feel for her. I have a friend for whom I have the same feelings. That's why Autumn is in a cage, going in circles, always thinkering with stuff. Which makes her mother furious: she can\'t control things she doesn\'t understand! That\'s why she stops her constantly.\n\nAt one point you are attacked by a spectre of a black wolf. I honestly shivered in my entire body, such a good moment. I believe the wolves represent the evils that might afflict women: abuse, a wasted life, dead hopes and so on. The game is both very sad and very scary, when you really think about it. If you know someone, a man or woman, who might be abused - help them, be there for them. And love your children... I think this game is about those things...\n\nThank you for reading, and to the creator(s) keep making games like this :)","June 1","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
