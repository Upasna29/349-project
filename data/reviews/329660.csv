But the way this game is and others in the bundle are incomplete. There are no in game instructions for controls. Couldn't even fire a torpedo in training mode. Also the links on the right to find this info do not open.\n\nEdit there are PDF files in the game folder with this info","December 13, 2014","true","0.6"," 48 of 69 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","48","69","8","6"

Goes into submarine charts, historical details, indepth controls. This is the kind of manual you kept on hand while playing and constantly referred back to, sprinkle in a bit of roleplay vibe to your game session and there might had been a fun gaming session in that in 1985! It looks like if you put in the the effort the game had the potential to maybe reward you for your effort with some primitive pixelated naval battle action.\n\nCons\nThe game is mathematics heavy it seems , and even if it worked the UI's reliance on the manual, and the cryptic nature of everything weighs the game down so much that it sinks like a rock right away in my humble opinion\n\nThe keyboard controls dont work, and apparently you could play with an old school joystick somehow, I pressed every single key on my keyboard through all 3 game modes and NOTHING happened. The game manual hints at IBM keboard controls located inside the cover of the manual but i dont see that this would help given that I tried everything.\n\nConclusion :\nMore a museum piece than a game, this is a piece for the most hardcore collectors, ultra retro gamers, and bundle hoarders. Everyone else should steer WAY clear.","October 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","74","31","42","6","1"

It is the oldest game on steam. I found out that submarines are a human equviant for dog whistles\n10/10 would bleed from ears again","April 23, 2015","true","0.5"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","26","38","17","0"

I own and play this on Nintendo. One of the best games ever. Posted to Steam really sucks. Controls (if you can call is that suck) , visual are nothing but dots on a screen where Nintendo Entertainment System puts this to shame. Do not buy this game. I got it cheap on G  2  A cheap and wish I could return the key for my money back.  You can't even use steams normal F12 overlay to show how badly this game sucks. No intro music, game style layout sucks, if I could beat someone in the face for stealing, I would beat that bass ted that uploaded this game to steam. Do ..... Not ....... Purchase .......unless you want to waste your money. I'm really disappointed as I thought I was going to have fun as I did on NES.
