This game used to be planned as a "recode" that was supposed to "Change Primal for the better." They kept making dates and time frames for this game, and everytime it drew near to that said date it got delayed for another 2 months. The developers teased us with this amazingly good game. Only having turning out to be a completely broken FPS. Then due to "Legal Reasons" for god knows why. If it was really that big of an issue, why did they never give us a heads up? Then decided to sell this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for $20 in Early Access. Planning to "Help develop this game with it's community to make it better." Better my ♥♥♥. The entire Early Access was spent readying the economy that isn't even worth having because everyone sells things for over $200. They never even bothered with balance. The old veterans and such who played the Original Primal Carnage left within 2 weeks from how disspointing this sad excuse of a game is.  Then all that was left over were the 6-12 year olds that don't know jack ♥♥♥♥ about games saying everything in Extinction is perfect and balanced. Then they want to say 1.3 was garbage? This game is completely broken with over 120+ bugs and issues in it's current build, and I'm not kidding you when I say that. I've actually counted. Which is quite alarming due to the fact they fully released this.\n\nThe community is probably the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding when I say that. Everyone just tries to be a special snowflake and tries to be cool making unfunny MLG, disorder, and racist jokes all day flaunting the $300 skin they got by stealing their mommy's VISA card when they weren't looking. For some reason they call Feathered Raptors Floofies, Floofbutts, and Floofs why I have no clue but it makes me cringe just typing it. They rush and beg devs to push out updates that aren't finished leaving the game worse and worse. Like said earlier. All the people who actually play this game for TDM left because it's broken as hell, same with Get to the Chopper. So all that's left is "Freeroam" A gamemode where players could walk around and enjoy the maps. But no, the little 12 year olds took over and now call this gamemode "roleplay." Where kids pretend to be things they're not. (Seriously there's like 5 guides on this ♥♥♥♥.) If you even go near one of these kids while they're "Roleplaying" they'll scream at you and call an admin for no reason. Which brings me to admin abuse. This game is the biggest example of admin abuse. The devs left testing commands in the game so admins can spawn unstable AI that crashes your game. Admins can also just spawn grandes and do a napalm strike on your ♥♥♥ for no reason. They can turn on GodMode so they can just kill you over and over, they can spawn OP weapons. They can also summon 20 flares at once just to burn out your retinas. So yeah, great community we got going on here.\n\nThe devs are just as bad. They say they're busy working on the game pulling all nighters for it, when in reality half the ♥♥♥♥ they worked on gets cancelled, delayed, or scrapped. They make updates seem like holy grails and they turn out being dissappointing buggy messes. The Content Update 1 that just came out barely got tested because they thought it'd be funny to release an update 12 hours after the testing group got the build after 2 months of nothing. Because yeah, that's how making a game works. Meanwhile the devs go completely silent for 4+ months because they're busy on our next dissappointment, I mean update. Featuring even more Unecessary ♥♥♥♥ like: 2 New Game Modes! Because yeah, that's what everyone wants... More things with No fixes... Moving on to the skins. Jesus Christ the skins. The skin makers get praised like they're gods just because they made a ♥♥♥♥ poor texture on a Dinosaur. No matter what they do, they could upload a picture of dog ♥♥♥♥. The little kiddies would still want it in game, Half the skins look like they're made in MS Paint with very few good skins here and there.\n\nThe gamemodes are completely broken. The newest game mode called surival, is the biggest let down this game has had so far. The "Advanced AI" That they promised locks onto you like a heat seeking missile, slashes you once, stands there and then lets you shoot them in the face. The Bosses are horrendous. There's only two. One which was barely tested and lets you just kill him. The other is an OP killing machine that annihilates the whole team in one hit. The OP boss, being an Acrocanthosaurus has a stomp radius like he's Godzilla and can kill the whole human team in one stomp. The other Boss which is an Alpha Novaraptor stands there and just lets you kill it. Seriously, all you need is a netgun and you can insta-knife kill him. But who cares about this at all? The current build literally bugged the game so bad it destroyed the game mode so you can't even play it at all.\n\n\n\nThe rest of my review will be in the comments, due to the review limits.","September 11, 2015","false","153.1"," 535 of 715 people (75%) found this review helpful 115 people found this review funny","75","535","715","115","81"

What most people are complaining about is the fact that most servers are free-roam/role-play servers instead of TDM or GTC.  This WAS true, but as more people have become aware of this problem, more and more TDM and GTC servers are popping up.  The new update also added a new game mode called "Survival", and it's pretty fun, and Survival servers have been replacing free-roam servers.  The loot system has also been improving, especially now that their is a new member of the dev team to make cool skins.  Of course, there are still bugs and balancing issues, but these should be fixed over time, and are largely the results of a whiny community.  In the end, if you were a fan of the original, and you have patience, I would definitely reccomend Primal Carnage: Extinction.","June 7, 2015","true","59.9"," 178 of 230 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","178","230","13","0"

We'll get on to the other things in a bit, but let's talk about the near non-existant PVP.\n\n\nPrimal: $extinction features awkward paced aimless movie bad guys versus over-sized chickens moving around with their heads cut off, combat! <- yes, we and our fans consider this "Fun & Balanced" combat!

I would recommend staying away from this game and just buying the prequel. This sequel (if you can even call it a sequel) has been nothing but frustrating from development to the release. I'll consider changing my review if the game ever gets fixed but I don't have high hopes for it.\n\nHere's the gist.\n\n-edit-\nSo after a few broken updates, I still can not in good conscience recommend this game. DON'T get tricked by the flashy updates. Survival mode online is completely broken. I tried hosting a server for friends to join but they couldn't find it. We tried joing official servers but one of the official servers was set to wave 999 and wouldn't let us begin the match and another 2 servers were at wave 1 but we still could not start survival mode. It may require 5 people to join to start the match (which is ridiculous since no one plays this game anymore) but don't bet on this game working properly. The game is still unbalanced and there is still a cash shop.\n\n\nPros\n- Graphics are decent\n- A few new maps\n- The sound is decent\n\nNeutral\n- There are 5 semi new dino classes. They are basically reskins with new skills. (This adds to the balancing issues though)\n\nCons\n- There are major balancing issues (More down below)\n- There are still bugs that prevent you from joining a server\n- Not much was really added into this game that wasn't in the prequel\n- The loot system and cash shop were really the only addition (unwelcomed imo)\n- T-Rexes and Spinoes are cool in the beginning but eventually you get annoyed at always having 3 OP tyrants glitching through walls to eat you\n- The community (in Team Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper) really aren't that fun\n\nThe main problem with this game is balancing. The humans are so nerfed that there might as well be a steak costume class for them. There are 5 human calsses but only 3 of them are useable. The pathfinder (Shotgun) and trapper are way underpowered. The dinos win almost every match with twice the kill count as humans. And as a result, everyone always wants to play on the dino team and the team balancing is so broken that you'll probably always play as the humans. Most of the maps are very open which is great for the T-Rex and Spino that just chase you down as soon as you spawn. And there are very few places for humans to hide so be prepared to be swarmed by tyrants all the time. And be careful hiding behind walls b/c tyrants love to phase through them to eat you.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not entirely sure why the developers made this game. Except to con people out of cash. The only reason to play this game seems to be role playing as a pretty dinosaur. Seriously, I'm not joking. Most of the servers are actually role playing.","May 21, 2015","false","12.8"," 215 of 327 people (66%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","66","215","327","31","7"

There is no point in buying or supporting it, the main servers don't work, and all the decent servers are privately run by "The Killing Crew" some gaming group that seems to have banned about 30% of the playerbase from their servers, essentially making the game unplayable for them(full disclosure, I was also banned). I don't understand how a company can remake a game using 95% of the assets while adding so little new content, and yet the game isn't even as playable as the already buggy original version.\n\nI can't recommend this game, and I don't want people to support this company.","February 20, 2015","false","21.1"," 128 of 195 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","128","195","9","3"

I spent almost 2,000 hours playing the original game, and I have to say that this game isn't fun to play at all. I thought during it's Early Access period that this game would get better, but it really didn't get too much better. The game has horrible balance, hit detection, hitboxes, and dinosaur movement.\n\nThe game is also mostly filled with Roleplayers. There is no competitive community for this game like the original game had. Being a competitve player of the original, it just disappoints me to see Primal Carnage: Extinction become the game it is currently. The game seems to mostly revolve around people sitting around in servers and waiting for loot to drop.\n\nThe whole game just seems to rely way too heavily on it's economy system. This game seems to be more about Quantity over Quality. Gameplay doesn't seem to be a priority for the developers which is saddening as that's what made the original game so great. The original game had excellent gameplay, and it was much more fun to play. If this game stopped being updated, it'd probably die quicker than the original would. Except for the Roleplayers, they would stay.\n\nAll in all, this game is simply not worth it. Even it's name "Primal Carnage: Extinction" isn't right as the game simply has no carnage happening. If you want a game with carnage and action, go play the original Primal Carnage. It's cheaper and it's more fun than Primal Carnage: Extinction.","July 15, 2015","false","115.2"," 70 of 100 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","70","100","8","6"

It's based around online matches in which humans wage war against dinosaurs.\n\nIn Primal Carnage: Extinction, you, the player must pick a team - Prehistoric Dinosaurs or Human Beings. The gameplay is a vastly different experience for both sides. As a human, you will be playing through first person view like any normal first person shooter. As a dinosaur, you will be playing in third person like the average action/adventure game. This makes for a brilliant change of pacing and strategy when each round is done and you may change teams.\n\nThere are many classes in the game, plenty of dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs from the first game and a few new ones which is pretty cool because if you've played the old ones, you know the variety was sometimes lacking in the dinosaurs department. Sadly, there is a definite lack of environment variety making it unfair for newer players who may be overwhelmed by lingerers who've memorized the two favorite maps which is basically being overplayed constantly.\n\nWhen comparing the game to the first one, you'll find that this game is essentially the same thing as the first one but with more polished gameplay mechanics and prettier graphics. The dinosaurs look much more believable, the animations are smoother  (still not perfect) and the characters seem easier to control as well.\n\nThe game's real issue is that the core game has some of the poorest balance I've ever seen in a muti-player game. There's nothing worse than being on a human team trying to fend off 10 raptors. There IS an auto-balance thay occurs in the game if the two teams are unbalanced numerically but that's pretty broken considering a player can switch back to their original desired team after spawning, unbalancing teams yet again (happens all too often, unfortunately).\n\nNow the next issue is the lack of servers to play real matches. Now I'm not sure what the developers are getting at here but I've seen some weird crazy stuff playing this game. The role-playing servers, for one, are creepy and unnecessary. They seem to be always filled with the same people who want to waste the day role playing as a dinosaur recreating Jurassic Park scenes. There's no objectives in role-playing servers, nor is there any deaths. It's a waste of a server.\n\nThere's another useless server where it's just an empty room but filled with pre-set dinosaurs that do not move. They just stay there, stuff like this doesn't make too much sense to me but at least that one has an objective.\n\nSeeing this kind of things makes me certainly understand why veterens of the first game are angry with this new installment and refuse to play it.\n\nIn short, this is a prettier version of the first game, with tighter controls but ruined by broken balancing and (mostly) useless servers. I expect to install this game in a couple years and see the same exact people playing on the exact same 2 levels on the good servers while seeing different people on the role playing servers but with a big head hack.\n\nIt seems the game has lost it's vision and it's soul. I cannot recommend this game, at least not at this point of time.\n\nI don't usually day this but if you read this review and don't take it seriously, please do some research so you know what you're getting into. The core game gets repetitive and just plain wierd fast due to poor choices by the server hosts and the development team alike. Unless you have a strong affinity for dinosaurs and you don't mind being in a chat room full of kids who do their best to pose their human characters kissing a dino for screenshot then you may want to stay clear of this game.\n\nThis review was based on experience from a few months ago, bought at full price.","January 19","false","10.4"," 57 of 83 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","57","83","6","11"

What started out as a recode to fix the increasing issues of the original PC became a whole new game all together that changed eveything about it. What was once a well balanced and competitive game that I spent over a 1000 hours playing turned into a buggy mess and now in the latest incarnation has completely wiped out the balance and competitivness of the game and turned it into a loot generator. Hop on and you'll see plenty of loot servers where you can go AFK for hours and "earn" skins that you can sell for hundreds of dollars on some occasions. No joke.\n\nSeriously?\n\nGet real.","March 5, 2015","false","2.2"," 86 of 135 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","86","135","8","9"

Also, apparently you can find your own reviews helpful and funny? I guess it's good to shamelessly promo yourself sometimes.\n\nDon't get trolled by the positive reviews. This game is getting better, though it still has a ways to go. The concept is good and the game has potential to be fun, though I'm mostly here to get loot and sell it. Already made my three bucks back. Went and bought Hatoful Boyfriend. It's apparently my happy game now. And trust me, you'll need a happy game if you decide to buy this.\n\nThe T-Rex and the Spino's vacuums have been adjusted, but they're still there and they're still a problem.\n\nNext we got Pterasaurs. Pterasaurs are good, in my opinion. they require more skill to use now.\n\nThe Dilosaurs and Raptors received a damage buff and are good now. Perhaps humans and dinos do a little too much damage now, but that will be sorted out.\n\nCarno paragraphs left intact, because the devs left them intact in the game.\n\nThen there's the Carnosaur, or however you say that name. The Carnotaur is often overlooked because of all the other broken stuff in the game. People claim the Centaur is the most balanced class, but it is, in fact, not. Anytime the humans group up, these Carnatosaurs will rush in and kill everything. And that's exactly what they're supposed to do, is break up groups of humans. However, when the Carne Asadas manage to get humans in cramped locations, they can devastate the entire group faster than a person can react. You see, when a Carne con chile is rushing, it also has the ability to bite, thereby doing double damage. To a human, this is known as the Half-Life. It only takes two hits like this to kill a human.\n\nNow you might assume, correctly, that if a moving object hits a wall, it'll stop. Well not in this game! If you were to approach a Carnosaurataurus running blindly into a wall and not moving, and make contact with it, you would take full damage and be sent flying. It really is incredible how the devs have implemented the ability for dinos to use voodoo magic.\n\nFinally, the last piece wrong with the Carnos. Normally, if they hit a human with their ram, they can't hit them again for another five seconds or so. Well if they were to restart a sprint by, oh I don't know, pressing Shift again multiple times, they can hit the human multiple times within a second. This is known as Obliteration because no human standing against a wall ever survives.\n\nNow on to the humans. The humans do more damage now.\n\nNademando was nerfed, though Commando still good because human damage buff.\n\nI still avoid using Pathfinder, though Pyro is certainly getting better.\n\nThe trapper is excellent at taking down Pteras, Dilos, and Raptors. The problem is, their nets sometimes bug out and just fizzle away, not affecting anything. There's something about projectiles in this game that just goes wonky because it happens to the Commando's grenades, too. Mines still do team damage, makes me laugh every time.\n\nThe scientist has the strongest damage of any human in the game. People have the nerve to get mad when the Scientist no-scopes them when they're close. Are you kidding me? They're actually calling for the scientist to only be able to fire the rifle when scoped in. Some people man... smh. They need to reduce that zoom on the scope if they want to take away the ability to pull a trigger.\n\nAlso, aiming down the scope is horrendous. The Scientist is apparently a Black Ops trained sniper because she doesn't breathe, at all, when aiming. It really throws me off. Not to mention, even if you've got your shot lined up and everything. Even if you've accounted for wind speed and all this other Call of Duty stuff, the shot just misses. The trail from the bullet, lmao, even if the trail of the bullet passes through the dino's character model, the shot might not register. Where did the bullet go? Who knows. It's like we're working with Magic Bullets used to assassinate JFK or something.\n\nThere's also a ridiculous amount of friendly collision in this game that screws people over. You can't shoot nets, grenades, anything through allies so grouping up gets counter productive.\n\nThere's still a lot of people who can't connect to the economy server and therefore can't earn loot. Score.\n\nAs of now, I can't recommend this game. It's better, but not best enough.","January 9, 2015","false","153.4"," 122 of 198 people (62%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","62","122","198","54","26"

I bought Primal Carnage: Extinction at the start of January and boy was it a broken mess. The balance was terrible, a lot of bugs, and everyone moved at 1000 miles per hour. When I saw the game was finally released, I expected to play it and it still be a broken mess, however I was shockingly surprised that it was actually playable now and it was superior to the original Primal Carnage.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with the series, this game is basically a FPS/TPS where one team plays as dinosaurs in third-person and the other team plays as humans in first-person. Each side has different classes. Humans have classes like a sniper, a trapper, and a pyro. Dinosaurs have classes like the T-Rex, those spitting dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, and the raptor. This of course is to just name a few.\nThere are several gamemodes like Team Deathmatch (the main gamemode) and Get to the Chopper (a Def/Atk type gamemode), and with Extinction you now have Dino Deathmatch and Roleplay (ughh). Most servers you'll see will be running team deathmatch or roleplay, with a few rarely playing the other gamemodes.\n\nFirst off, this game is pretty well balanced. Both sides are fun to play, so you won't dread switching teams. There are a few balance problems here an there like Pathfinder still being overpowered as hell. Other than that, it's the most balanced the series has ever been. The graphics are really good looking now, and much improved upon since the original.\n\nOne of my main problems with Extinction is the changes to human outfits. In the previous game, all the classes wore different outfits and were easy to tell apart. For some reason they decided to give the Scientist, Commando, and Pathfinder all green outfits this time, so they can sometimes be hard to tell apart. This also brings us to the next problem.\n\nThe developers decided to take a page out of TF2's book and have hats and random drop skins and outfits. If you think it's hard to tell apart classes now, wait till you see someone running around dressed up like Santa Claus (yes this seriously exists), or wearing completely different items than the default model. This also takes away the style of the game especially when you see a dinosaur wearing earmuffs. As you'd expect this leads to an extremely toxic community and speaking of which...\n\nThe community isn't the best in the world. You have people focused on getting drops, others forcibly dieing, and let's not forget the roleplay servers. This isn't RP like's Garry's Mod. There's literally nothing to really do in these servers except walk around yet half the servers (and just to let you know there's probably 20 servers max) are roleplay and another 1/2 are dominated by 24/7 single map servers. The previous Primal Carnage game got to the point where the only active servers at certain times were roleplay servers. Right now there's a lot of active people, but there's a chance that once the newness wears off from the game, it could become impossible to find a server.\n\nThere are a few bugs here in there like spawning above water thus dieing and the infamous crazy legs. The biggest bugs right now are related to the netcode. If you have a tiny bit of lag you'll be unable to pounce as the raptor even after the lag ends, also there's extreme amounts of rubberbanding. You can swoop down as a pteranodon, kill someone, then half a second later be at the top of the skybox even though you did just kill someone on the ground. Not uncommon to be walking on a 2nd story platform for several minutes then to randomly rubberband to the ground floor. Although these bugs shouldn't take too long to fix, and not a huge deterrent from playing.\n\nI recommend buying the game, you'll defiantly get your moneys worth of enjoyment out of it.\n","April 10, 2015","true","10.3"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","27","36","0","0"

Animations are choppy making it difficult to know if a Dino is lagging or simply being poorly animated. I dunno. I'm going to give this more time. But my first impressions aren't great.\n\nThis game also impliments a TF2 type item drop for custimizations for your humans and dinos. A side effect of this is you'll find people sitting afk in matches quiet often.","April 5, 2015","false","1.7"," 78 of 127 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","78","127","3","2"

The recode was intended on being the exact same original game, but all polished and with all of the silly additions from Primal Carnage 1.3 gone. Instead, Pub Games decided to take over, change LWM to Circle 5 and remake the game for a brand new profit that will never come to be.\n\nDuring the sale of July for the original Primal Carnage, Lukewarm Media sold over 2,500 copies. During this brand new release, they didn't even sell over 230 copies and 100 keys were given away to those who refused to pay money for the same game and they had every right to do so.\n\nHonestly, the only pros I can tell are the graphics, but even then, the original Primal Carnage has the same graphics.\n\nCons\n-Animation are either stiff or too bendy\n-Dinosaurs attack too slowly\n-Human weapons fire too slowly\n-Collision testing was obviously not done as you can fall through the map and most of the map is awkward to fly/walk around.\n-Some spawn points you are above the actual landmark. For example, I spawn as a Pteranadon and I am walking in the air above the cliff I'm supposed to be on.\n-Flight animations are innacurate and poor. Diving is VERY slow.\n-Chat cannot be used if you intend on using the letter T due to the fact that it will erase what you typed prior to it. You have to use the console command which is ~ and use the command 'say', then space, then type your message.\n-Balancing seems to be in the human's favor\n\nAll in all, this should have never been something that anyone should have paid for. If you're really desperate, just get the original, it is a heck of a lot better than this.\n\nYes, it does say 'Early Access', but they also say that "Most of our core gameplay mechanics are complete, and we feel that the game is in an enjoyable state."

This is esentially a remake or recode of the original, but one that runs 30x better.\n+ Graphics are still up to par with the style and setting of the game; landscape looks lush and awesome, the models look defined and detailed.\n+ DLC from Primal Carnage, their first game that this one is basically a clone of, carries over into this game, so your raptor skin, assault skin, etc etc will be carried into Primal Carnage: Extinction.\n\n- Servers can't seem to handle the influx of new players as of this time; some games lag so badly the game is nearly unplayable, others won't let you join a team and glitch out, others kick you from a match for various reasons.\n- Class balance is slightly off on this, as the Pteranodons seem to be bullet sponges and the Spinosaurus is now playable in TDM. Changes may come later as this is still a WIP game but tweaks are needed on some classes, both dino and human.\n- Not free :( "Primal Carnage 2.0" as this was once interanlly known as was supposed to be a massive, free tweak of the game to weed out all the old game engine's problems. Lukewarm has since been absorbed and is now known as Circle 5 Games, who had other ideas and have since released a for-pay remake of Primal Carnage. Some may like it, others may not.\n\nThis game is shaping up to be fantastic though. It has its issues but this a WIP/Early Access review, and I'm sure by final release from now until then that many issues will be addressed and fixed. It already feels much smoother than its parent game - of which it is a re-made clone - so I have faith in the developers to continue making what I think is arguably the best dinosaur vs human FPS game to have ever been on Steam.","December 7, 2014","true","77.7"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","45","71","3","1"

While the concept of this game is great, it does only appeal to a small niche market of players. Over the last several months I have done my best to support this game as much as I can. Alas it has gotten to a point where I have pretty much lost faith in Circle 5 to deliver a game worthy of the name.\n\nGame is in PEA and will be there for some time. PEA = Perpetual Early Access. C5 consistently miss all their marks for a timeline they setup for completion. When game was originally released as EA, it was slated to take about 45-60 days  reach completion and be a full release. This time has long come and gone and game really looks no closer to being completed. As such, I am now referring to the game state as PEA.\n\nPros:\n• Fun game and great concept (Humans vs Dinosaurs)\n• Good price point for a game of this caliber\n\nCons:\n• Game is still VERY buggy as dev's try to figure out the version of Unreal they are using\n• Game is a massive headache for host\n• A pain to update - Each update you have to re-edit your server config\n• Server will not run as a service\n• Steam is required to be running for a server to appear in browser\n• No anti cheat, no proper working rcon, no proper server logging for stats\n• MOTD is a joke\n• Loot system and cosmetic items that have ruined the game\n• Most of community is toxic and only care about loot and not playing game\n• Q&A department fail miserably and do not properly test updates being released\n\nI could easily continue on. Bottom line the cons far out weigh the pros for this game, and I honestly do not see it getting better in the near future. For this reason I honestly can not recommend buying this game at this time.\n","February 26, 2015","false","183.4"," 69 of 118 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","69","118","6","9"

So far what i've seen I can say that the game has beautiful graphics, good animations and is pretty unique.\nBut the game is still in early access, so it has A LOT OF BUGS and the gameplay is pretty unbalanced. All the humans are a bit underpowered, but pretty balanced, and so are the small dinosaurs even thought that the have different abilities. But when it comes to the big dinosaurs like t-rex and spinosarus, they are overpowered. Someone playing a t-rex can easily just mash at least 3 equally good human players before it goes down!\nSome bugs make the big dinosaurs wallhackers. They can often stick their head through a wall and kill you. It's not just the walls, too many object have no collision detection so you can see/walk through them.\nI hope that the devs will complete the game like they say, and make it better than the previous game. Extinction is good for beeing alpha. But if the bugs and gameplay not will be fixed, I will not recommend the game for a price over 5 euro. But for now, I'll recommend it since it has potential","February 18, 2015","true","8.4"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

Yeah. the community there is a nice community.\nNow, not all the people who play Primal Carnage: Extinction are bad people, of course. A lotta nice people and nice friends play this. It just so happens this game is overrun with trolls. And is considered to be known for its acidic community. I have a few friends on XBOX ONE who NEVER even TOUCHED this game, but have had friends who have and say all but the same thing.\nAnyhow, I play it rarely these days and really gave up on caring about this game. The developers want money which, for the record, would probably get MORE if they made every skin and some maps DLC packs rather than makign a profit off of the cancerous market. That is just my opinion. So even those who run the game and all are not to tango with much.\nThere are a few nice developers, of course, but only a few.\n\nSo yeah, there is my review. Other than that, the game has some amazing graphics, it is fun to play (when not facing the cancerous community), and yeah, kinda good.\n\nBut do I truly recommend it? Ehhh..

The maps in PC:E are all "re-done" maps of the original game save for 1-2 that are original to this game, the addition of the TF2 feel of crate drops and a store is nice and allows people to be a little more unique for stand alone skins that can be purchased but over all you'll end up running up $20 for a small handful of skins/items depending on the class you play.

I really can't recommend this game due to the HUGE unbalance that's going on in it.\n\nNot only can many servers be scarely populated in this game, meaning your teams can consist of just 3-4 people on each team. And just to salt the wound on that problem, the 2 sides way unbalanced with the dinosaur side being way superior to the human side.\n\nExample, human vs raptor.\n\nHuman has:\nGuns\nSmall amount of health\nSlow and easy to hit.\n\nRaptor has:\nHigh agility\nTake a ♥♥♥ load of damage (Seriously, they have 300HP and bullet resistance or something while a human have like 100-150)\nIs quick and hard to hit\n\nI know this will just bring up "Erh, ma gurd just git good" but i don't think that arguement is valid in this case when you can't get good because your target is twice as strong as you, 5 times as hard to hit as you and 10 times as fast as you. I shot a raptor with 3 shotgun buckshots to the chest when it was right in my face and it still lived to attack and kill me (though undoubtedly with little to no health left when it was done)\n\nSo you got those things jumping around like crazy, one along being enough so you need about 2 team member to take one down and then you can get a huge bulletsponge tyrant against you to worry about while also having these raptor buggers jumping around. And you all know that will happen since you buy this game to play the dinosaurs, and of course everyone picks the dinosaurs and of course everyone will hate me for this review as like 80% of the playerbase plays raptors in this damn game, but as far as i see it. I don't like a game if you're going to make it 2 factions against eachother and then have one be WAY stronger than the other.\n\nThere are dinosaur vs dinosaur playmodes which are really neat but those also suffer quite alot as if you play a tyrant class you'll certainly have a great time trying to fight like 4 raptors running around bitting you. You'll be a sitting duck more or less.\n\nThis game version of the game wasn't made by the original developers and that REALLY shows as the people who made this must've been dinosaur rights activists that buffed the dinosaurs a ♥♥♥♥ load compared to the old game, it also doesn't help that much of the new animations in this game are REALLY stale compared to the old game, so the developers of this aren't the most knowing ones either.\n\nI say get the original version, it's way superior and more balanced than this version. You can also get the old original version way cheaper than this one.","May 5","false","10.4"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","22","34","2","0"

That's not exactly a good or a bad thing. The whole problem is that it's always that the human team spawn in a random place and the whole team is huddled up somewhere. But the spawns are random and you get separated from everyone if you die. Then there are the straggler dinosaurs that just kill you on the spot because there's no one to help you.\n\nWhat I would like to see is being allowed to spawn on a teammate or spawn on like flares, mines, or health packs which can be dropped by your teammates. That would allow more teamwork involved and not just have pyros holding down m1 whenever a dinosaur shows up and you die anyways.\n\nPlaying as a dinosaur, it can be really frustrating. You are very limited but yet overpowered. It seems that it's always in one favor of a single team. The dinosaurs have their own possibilities but if the humans are actually compitent, you're done for. What you would normally do is just pick off straglers that just spawned. But that's no fun.\n\nThe last thing I want to see is having more dedicated servers. There are very little for this game and you can't play anything except for team deathmatch or dino deathmatch. It makes gameplay very limited and you don't have that much to do.\n\nThe good part of this game is that the gameplay is great and you can run this game on a lot of computers. You don't need a beast of a computer since you can just turn down your graphics to low. It helps a lot unlike all the games you see out there. The gameplay handles really nice but what I feel missing is a lot of variety.

Heres my persnal preferences on what can make it better and the Pros and Cons of the game now\n\nPersonal Preference-First of all, variety is key. Here is an example: Rather than have the same four types of chocolate bars for sale, it would be much much better to have the same four bars, but have them in different styles/flavours/colours. The new skins are doing well to add colour, but giving people more of a choice will increase the amount of people wanting to put more hours into the game.\n\n-Dinos-\nCarno class- New subclass = Pachycephalosaurus** (Game needs a herbivore), Majungasaurus, Rugops.\nTyrant class- New Spino subclass = Suchomimus,Baryonx,Therizinosaurus.\nTyrant class- New Acro subclass = Allosaurs, Albertosaurus, Torvosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus (Giganotosaurus is always an option but it would need to be buffed in size)\nCompy needs its own class as opposed to typing in the class 17 on the command code, throw in a MicroRaptor sub class as well with the notable difference of being able to glide.\n\n-Humans-\nDog class- People would be surprised how often i've seen this asked for across forums and videos and in game, there is already a dog model in the game and i've seen people use it, have it as its own class.\nTank class-I've long asked for this to be put in. It could be a mecha, giant robot suit like from Avatar or even add some form of prehistoric animal that is controlled by the humans, the possibilites are endless.\n\n\nPROS\n-More variety in servers now (HOORRAYYY)\n-Loot system is slightly better (WOOOHOO)\n-Acros can't Godzilla stomp half the server anymore (LAWWD HAVE MERCY YESSS)\n-The new skins are adding so much colour to the game which makes it stunning to look at (Still havent gotten any of the new Tyrant skins from a drop..but for people who have AWESOME!)\n-Gameplay SEEMS to be a bit smoother, not as much lag (*CLAPS*)\n\nCONS\n-Humans Classes still suck bawwls. Everything out side of Pathfinder (to kill the Tyrants) and Trapper (to insta kill the wee little raptors) is useless.\n-People calling for those two classes I mentioned to be nerfed cause they are too OP...this community irks me I swear which ties in hand with my next Con.\n-The Human-Dino ratio is still off. People generally only play Dinosaurs and if they get put on the human team, they just leave and rejoin the Dinosaurs. I get its a Dino game but this just means that there has to be something done about this because it kills the competitiveness.\n-This game needs a LeaverBuster. Now obviously not for Free Roam or the RP servers, im tempted to say leave the Survival out. But I mean specifically for TDM. It's unfair that people either hog the dino team as a whole or hog the Tyrant classes by suiciding (this needs to be fixed) and when they get put on the Human side they leave and just go into another TDM or just rejoin the same lobby. A leaverbuster that puts a time-ban on players leaving/joining TDM servers would discourage this greatly (LoL does this and its worked out ok for them).\n-People going AFK in TDM need to be kicked a lot quicker as they make it look like the numbers are more even when its really just 4/6 humans vs 10/10 dinos (just an example but its rare you see AFK dinos).\n-A lot of the community are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...i'd be as bold as to say its not far behind the CoD or LoL fanbases in terms of saltyness or immatureness\n-AND FINALLY, Raptors are still far too hard to hit, i'd say out of 100 shots vs raptors, i've landed about 30 in the past two days. Do I have rubbish aim? No, I play TF2,CoD and other shooting games just fine and my aim has never been an issue. It's more the fact that raptors are still speed-blitzing or insta killing almost everyone before they take sufficient damage to kill them. Honestly amping the flame thrower class would solve a lot of these problems but then the devs have more negative feedback from butt hurt dinos.\n\nSo yeah, verdict now is get it if its on sale, im still not sure about getting it on full price.\n\n6/10","November 9, 2015","false","372.0"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","21","33","3","15"

I love it and I commonly play, I have been playing it since it's early stages in Early Access so I have seen the ups downs in balance and the way things work.\n\nThe last couple of patches have made this game playable and A LOT MORE BALANCED than it used to be, of course there is rrom for improvement and honestly the best thing about thi is the devs are ALWAYS LISTENING and will take what is said and will improve upon it if they are able to (as well as they are the nicest folks ever). Yes they game is still buggy as of launch but do you expect ad online game to be shiny and perfect upon release to the masses? I know I don't and if you do you ain't getting spoon fed all the time that's for sure but I digress. The game is very balanced right and there are a few things that need to be patched but give the devs time and they will be patched.\n\nThe community is double sided but isn't ANY community? I go on the forums regularly and a majority if not most of the people there are some of the nicest and most supportive people I have ever met, constantly doing things for each other, organising events and giving feedback on the game. Of course there are those people you will DETEST but we ALWAYS meet those kinds of people. Everyone has their own tastes when it comes to this game whether it be mindless killing in TDM (or DvD), objective based games in GTTC or roleplaying on the numerous roleplay servers. I dabble ina ll of them so I have pretty much seen all sides of the community at this point.\n\nThis game is a sequel to it's predecessor Primal Carnage. Now you may think? "ERMAHGURD Y DO I HAZ TO BUY DIS AGEN!!!111!" well it's simple. It isn't Lukewarm behind this game, it's Circle 5. Stuff happened, Lukewarm disbanded so that got rid of Primal Carnage: Genesis (which is on hold) and the free 2.0 revamp update for the game and then some of them came back and formed Circle 5 and of course they needed money so they re-made the game from what was the 2.0 update and re-released it which is fair game when you need money in order to make something better and the previous game wasn't cutting it. So all is fair here.\n\nThe loot system and economy was a big change with this game, it made a lot of people loot MAD with the skins for Dinosaurs. I know I am slightly mad for them because there are those diserable skins I want and I am currently trying to collect one of each skin but it gives something for you to work towards if you so wish to. I ultimately play this game for fun and loot drops are just a bonus for me but you get free stuff so YAY! The loot craze has died down a lot now and a lot of people are putting their rare loot into lotterys and competitions so other people have a chance so you won't see too many people go "No loot?" when nothing drops.\n\nThe game is mindless fun and it's amazing like that. You get to play as DINOSAURS FOR GOD'S SAKE, FREAKING. DINOSAURS. There is some bugs that need adressing and they will be fixed soon enough, the devs plan to keep updating the game as well, the first content patch is estimated to arrive at the end of this month which will include more skins, the very much anticipated crafting system (so hold on to those duplicate items people) and a new dinsoaur, Acrocanthosaurus so the devs don't plan to give up on his game any time soon.\n\nThe devs are a bunch of dedicated people, the community is awesome and the game is all around fun and enjoyable. So i HIGHLY reccomend this game if you want a glorious;y smashing time.","April 4, 2015","true","064.8"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","0"

That's exactly why it's been given to us in Early Access. The game is meant to be buggy, so we can find the bugs. We're here to help the Developers fix this game. It's severely broken in a lot of ways, but just because they're called developers doesn't mean we don't have the right to take part in molding the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/conscriptx/recommended/321360/","conscriptx","Conscript","http://steamcommunity.com/id/conscriptx/","678 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHello,\n\nSo I am one of the people who ended up buying Primal Carnage while it was on sale to get the discount on Primal Carnage: Extinction. I am simply making this post to provide some feedback for the game.\n\nBefore I give some feedback I will say that I enjoy this game and that I think it has A LOT of potential. Some people ingame tried to get me to compare this to Orion and to that I simply say that Orion is more of a Killing Floor style game where zombies were replaced with dinosaurs and the people were put in Halo suits and some vehicles tossed in. In other words comparing Orion to Primal Carnage is just silly because you can't compare player controlled dinosaurs to computer controlled.\n\n1) Dinosaur View. The most mind boggling thing I immediately noticed when playing is that dinosaur's don't have a first person view. It hurt my insides, badly. There is another game where players are given the choice between playing as an alien creature or as a human and that game is called Natural Selection (or Natural Selection 2) that some of you may be familiar with and while I'm not comparing this games all I have to say is that the aliens in that game are first person view and that is a feeling that dwarfs 3rd person view beyond words. I need my dinosaur immersion. I need first person view as a dinosaur.\n\n2) Communication. There is none. Humans need some form of Radio Menu where they can talk to each other in order to point out dinosaurs. This radio menu can be as simple as "I see a dinosaur over here" to let everyone know.\n\n3) Game Modes. I tried two game modes, Team DeathMatch and Get To The Chopper. My TDM experience was as expected, a lot of killing followed by a lot more killing. GTTC consisted of all the humans standing behind this unpassable barrier as snipers shooting at an entire dinosaur team of flying dinosaurs, not the best. When I saw this game through videos and screenshots and before I blindly bought it I thought that this game would be a small scale tactical game of dinosaurs vs. humans. Perhaps a 5v5 or something where the humans would have to hold an area while dinosaurs tried to push them out or something. I hope there will be something in the future because I think this game has A LOT of potential in the competitive field.\n\n4) Weapons. Ok so humans are hardcore dinosaur hunting and killing machines... who hipfire? We need iron sights, I feel like a small child at an arcade shooting my gun in every direction.\n\n5) Limitation. Dinosaurs are a pretty fierce force to be reckon with from the start, now make their entire team T-Rex and it is essentially a wall of teeth coming at you and you won't be able to kill them before you reload. Default limitation should be put on larger dinosaurs such as a MAX of 2 large dinosaurs and perhaps a MAX of 3 flying dinosaurs.\n\n6) Mobility. Rather than have humans run at the speed of The Flash it would be much more beneficial if there were climbable ladders, treehouses, more open buildings for us to maneuver through and hide inside. I feel like my only option is to run at lightning speed instead of using the enviornment to my advantage.\n\n7) Destruction. Since my previous feedback of humans needing more enviornmental mobility such as climbing ladders and treehouses than dinosaurs would need equal footing because the only dinosaur that can reach anywhere off the ground are the flying ones. Larger dinosaurs (or even the charging one) should be able to ram trees or whatever building the human climbed up and knock them down either killing or injuring the human. This would provide a more ever changing enviornment which players have to constantly adapt to in order to win.\n\nThat is my basic feedback on what I think this game could use in order to create a true action packed experience of a real survival of the fittest.\n\nWhile I also notice some balance issues such as the flying dinosaur being able to pick up players non-stop without risk and the raptors being able to pounce on humans risk-free I think that perhaps the humans should have an escape method from this pin instead of being helpless. This suggestion of course would encourage a lack of teamwork since the humans could just go solo if they were able to escape from such a pin but the flying dinosaur is able to fly away just as fast as he arrived while carrying a full grown human in his talons which makes saving the human almost impossible. The raptors are immobile while doing their pin so I can understand why you can't break out but the flying dinosaurs need a significant speed reduction after abducting a human.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, if you did.","December 11, 2014","true","2.2"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Novadog/recommended/321360/","Novadog","Novadog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Novadog/","12 products in account","Now\nI'm going to come in from a view that is mostly unbiased.\nAs I have only played the first game for half a year.\nThis new one, I was on and off since before the official release.\nThis game and the one that came before it has always had it's ups and downs.\nBut the same will be said of any game. The importance is in the developer's willingness to expand based on what the players want, or what they are talking about.\n\nAs a player, nothing is more thrilling than the concept that you and the community have daydreamed of something until nights end, only to find out it's going to become a feature in an update or new game! Extinction brought a lot to the table, they offer many graphic features that you can tinker with as well. Many may complain about the lag this causes right off the bat. However the common case is that the system has put the settings at the max that your computer CAN handle, but not always what it will run smoothly on. I suggest playing with these options and lowering settings here and there for those experiencing choppiness.\n\nBut besides the look of the textures and models themselves, a fresh perspective was clearly taken on the environments and the level of detail in realism. I can't exactly count how many times I've stopped to see rain trickling down a metal sheet or became enthralled by sand blowing off the edge of a cliff, only to be shot down as a result of my appreciation for such features. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nThis game is not just for PVPers. PC may have begun with this concept in mind and the main theme of the game is still PVP. It's entire structure is crafted to support the needs of players fighting other players. However there are little tid bits that suggest the developers have noticed and even supported their more artistically inclined audience. Not just the environments, but the addition of features that allow you to set up a functioning role player server. Such as allowing an endless number of folks to be dinosaurs or humans, picking out maps that were made with tons of little hidey holes and good story telling scenes, and even turning off PVP completely so that no one can be ripped from their scene by a trigger happy trapper or that one rex who is just having a majorly bad day and only the feeling of something squished between his toes is going to change that. It's very humbling that the developers are willing to listen to and welcome all of their players, even ones they might not have expected to have. Many young and old dinosaur lovers have flocked to the game. And they were not met with failure to take their passions seriously. The makers have stepped up, revving the diversity of the species and the correction of their anatomy to please the hardcore dino-fan.\n\nSuch aspects may seem small in comparison to what one might expect from a game about 'I shoot you, you chomp me.' But it's proof that Primal Carnage is a game run by folk that can and will always evolve. The fact that we can put faith in how much our opinions mean to the developers is something many more games need today. I hope that in the future it becomes a MUST to please your players.\n\nAnd before anyone thinks I forgot, yes I will remark about the game-play itself because even as an .. obvious role-player myself.. I too partake in the -carnage- on and off. I'm not satisfied with only one aspect of the game and if I try to go too long without either, it becomes boring fast. Sometimes the intricate tales of monsters lurking in the forest makes me restless to go unleash those skills against others in PVP, and as previously stated, the game is built upon the idea of PVP. You can choose your class of human or dinosaur. And though a majority of us obviously enjoys hurling ourselves on a human, turns are taken to make it fair for everyone. The human classes are nothing to sneeze at either. While I always feel a bit dull in comparison to the beast I was moments before, I quickly get over it and focus on fighting again.  It's equally as satisfying to group up as humans and gun down a pack of raptor. Depending on what game-style you're best at, it's very important to find the class for you and start practicing it right away. (The community itself has made MANY guides on the tactics of these classes.)\n\nAll of that sounds like too many good points right? Well that's not even all of it, I just knew that no one would read a review this long without being paid generously. But for those who only feel safe purchasing a game after they have seen the flaws they are dealing with, well I'm here to deliver that unbiased opinion just as I promised. Like almost any PVP game, the community itself is fast paced, a lot of them are very young players as well. You may find an army waiting in a server to CAPSLOCK at you about your tactic verses theirs. However you may also find a community of well rounded adults who simply play the game and don't need to make remarks on others to validate themselves. My advice for those bouts of sour saps is to ignore them. Even if they call you or your game-play some ridiculous names, you just keep being you and have fun!\n\nAnother issue would be a pickle of bugs here and there this early on. Please make note of the DATE of this rating because the game is practically  brand spanking new of this year, you simply cannot expect everyone to have found every bug yet. When they are found, they are fixed. But they do exist and when you find them you are encouraged to report them instead of quit the game. Be a contribution to the betterment of the game!\n\nThe last topic I can offer is .. one I don't fully understand but have heard of among the other players. General issues running the game or lag or bugs that no one else seems to be experiencing. All I can say is that I have never personally experienced any issues like this on PC: extinction. These problems may be to do with something on the players end that can easily be searched up on a forum and fixed.","April 9, 2015","true","36.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Good examples: the graphics are upealing as well as the animations, good auto balince, includes different ways to injoy the game with roleplay, freeroam, team deathmach and dino deathmach, survival, and get to the choper, custimizable player modles. Now with skins, i feel the loot drop systum is a little broken. Some people seem to get lucky and receave lots of rare and legendary loot. As for casual players, they seem to only get uncommen loot as a lucky loot drop. This is, in theory, because of time spint playing the game. The more you play the game the higher posibility of a rare loot drop. In my openinon its a little stupid for those who don't have time to play the game or don't wish to wast their time on it. Then u buy keys and unlock crates and reaceave nothing good for the $20 they spind on keys. Then they buy them off market for $100s. In the end I think its worth playing more for fun than paying to look the best. It's still a fun and enjoyable game non-the-less and worth the money u pay for the main game.","December 9, 2015","true","980.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

Although they did seperate it into an entirely new game, I do love all of the improvements on it thus far being only a BETA. The graphical difference because PC and PC:E is very different. Extinction's graphics are 10x better, as well as more optimized in my experience. Gameplay seems a lot smoother. The faster paced combat is something I still need to adjust to coming from the original game, but it's growing on me. I LOVE the fact you have to actually work hard on playing a Raptor in Extinction opposed to PC. Although I do slightly disagree with Pteras being so simple; yet I do highly appreciate and love the effert they put to simplify it's flying mechanics making it easier for Ptera fans and lovers to play as enjoyment. I never find myself getting bored of playing Extiction yet so far. Each match I find enjoyable and new ways to practice and play the game as well as help as much as possible with the development of it by providing information on bugs and possible suggestions of fixes.\n\nIf you've never played any of the Primal Carnage games, I do recommend trying out Extinction due to it being the newest and as it's still in BETA to watch it grow and develop. Overall, this is my small summary.\n\nPros:\n~More optimized, smoother graphics\n~Higher end textures\n~Improved maps and lighting\n~Smoother overall gameplay; although faster paced.\n~New abilities/weapons for both Human and Dinosaur as well as seperate abilities for Sub-classes\n~Steam Economy seems very promising in the near future\n~Current combat keeps you on the edge and lookout; makes it more enjoyable\n\nCons:\n~Combat is a tad fast at times, makes it difficult to land proper hits as a Human or Dinosaur\n~Small bugs that prevents entering a server or crashing after one or a few matches\n~New items in your inventory sometimes taking a while to load for use\n\nInbetween Opinion(s) (totally your choice whether these are good or bad):\n~Fast Combat\n~Raptor pounce being more difficult than the original Primal Carnage\n~Jumping being more spammable\n~Pteradons being more flexible, more simple to play\n~Raptors being more difficult to play\n~Tyrants being equally as easy to kill at times; but can also be easily over-powering depending on your playstyle\n~Dilo's Stamina runs out fast and must recharge by roaring; although the the Roar meter takes a while to refill\n~Tyrants not being able to heal as effectively by eating humans opposed from the original game\n~Humans running faster and longer than some dinosaurs at times\n~Humans possessing sometimes their own 'one-shot' attacks and methods (even to Tyrants)\n\nMost of this review is purely just my honest opinion of the first week of release for Extinction. My opinion on the game may or may not change for the better or worse once it is developed more a few months into the future. I suggest buying and trying out the game before placing any proper judgement based off this review!\n\nMy rating for Extinction: 7.8 out of 10","December 6, 2014","true","819.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It has a reasonable amount of classes and Dinosaurs to play as, graphics look pretty damn nice, and a good amount of maps (though most servers only like using the same old maps like docks over and over).\n\nThere is no progression system so you don't unlock anything as you play, so the only replay value is just being in the mood to play. You do get random drops as you spend time in game that can give you boxes you open with real money or skins which is nice. For some reason though, everyone is ridiculously obssesed with getting new skins, to the point that a good amount of servers are just free-roam with people being AFK for drops. If you can ignore that and find a good server with 20+ people then that wont matter when your having fun.\n\nThere is ALOT of room for improvement though, including fixing the glitches and collision detection with walls, but for 7$ on sale I definetly got my money's worth, and it'll satisfy my Dinosaur addiction till Ark leaves Early Access :)","February 5","true","58.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","1"

Each of them having their own kind of weapons and equipment.\n\nPathfinder uses a shotgun and a pistol, along with the choice of flares to blind the dinosaurs or hatchets to throw. I find him most effective against big dinosaurs like Spino and Carno.\n\nScientist is basically a sniper. Uses a sniper rifle and also can use tranqulizer guns to slow down dinosaurs. You are given a choice to run with a first aid kit to heal you and your teamates or with sensor mines, to spot any dinosaurs near them.\n\nCommando uses an assault rifle that has a grenade launcher. He fires a hail of bullets to deal some massive damage to both small and big dinosaurs. Supplied with the choice of ammo boxes to supply teamates with ammo or frag grenades.\n\nPyro has a flamethrower that is also a chainsaw. He deals tremendous amounts of damage up close. He also has a flare gun to ignite a dinosaur at a longer range. You are given a choice of a molotovs or impact grenades to run with.\n\nLast but not least for the humans is the Trapper. He runs with a net gun and two revolvers. He traps smaller dinosaurs and kills them. You can shoot big dinosaurs with nets but it will only disable their attacks for an amount of time. His equipment is only limited to a land mine.\n\nThen there is the other team you are able to play as, dinosaurs! This is again class based but with more variety. There is the Tyrant classes, Predator classes, Flying classes, Spitter classes, and the Bruiser class. Each dinosaur also has it's own roar to buff itself or teamates.\n\nThe Tyrants have the T-Rex, Spinosaurus, and the Acrocanthosaurus. All of them have the ability to eat a human whole and regain a little health from it. But each has a second attack and roar that is different from each other. The T-Rex can swing it's tail to hit any human behind it, and it's roar increases attack damage of your teamates. The Spinosaurus can use it's huge arms to swing in front of it, and it's roar increases teamates defense. The Acrocanthosaurus uses a stomp that sends a large shockwave injuring and killing any humans to close, it's roar regens health of teamates.\n\nThe predators use stealth or cunning techniques to hunt down the humans. These predators are Novaraptors and Oviraptors.They both can pounce on a human to kill. The Novaraptor's roar gets rid of all it's stamina, but makes you able to attack much faster. Making this useful to take out groups of humans camping in a building. The Oviraptor roar outlines humans through walls.\n\nNext is the Flying classes. There is the Pteranodon and Tupandactylus. They both roar to spot humans. The Pteranodon can pick up humans and rop them from a lethal height. The Tupandactylus though travels at a high speed to ram a human, possibly off a high cliff or building to injure or kill.\n\nSpitter classes are dinosaurs that spit and poison to kill. They consist of a Dilophsaurus and a Cryolophsaurus. The Dilo can spit to blind and damage humans. They can also bite to poison and damage the human over time. The Cryo though uses his spit as a main weapon. SInce the puddles it leaves over time will damage humans and it's bite will only damage, but not poison. Both their roars regains their stamina.\n\nLast is the Bruiser class. The Carnotaurus is a hit and run class. He runs very fast to headbutt humans. He can also bite to do damage. The Carno roar allows you to regain health from damaging a human while charging. Sadly the Carno is alone in the Bruiser class.\n\nNow that the very long intro to all the classes is done, what about the gameplay? I must say each class is pretty well balanced and shows it's strengths and weaknesses a lot. ( I am a little unsure about Pathfinder, he deals so much damage.) My experience with it was fair. They made gameplay a little smoother and easier to understand. I have played on TDM and GTTC and they both are pretty fun. Dino vs Dino mode is also pretty fun. They did add a Co-op mode, but I have yet to play this because every server there is, is always full, empty, or everyone just leaves after I join. Which leads to one problem this game suffers from.\n\nThis game and it's server's are very whacky. Almost every populated server is TDM or Roleplay. After playing TDM for so long, it gets boring. Playing an objective based game mode like GTTC is near impossible in a populated server. Which is unfortunate, I find GTTC very fun with a lot of players. I'm not to big on being friendly in servers. Also since there isn't many players for PC:E, making even TDM games with only maybe 6 players. TDM with low population isn't very fun, all the dino's have to do is play has a Tyrant and the game is pretty much won for them.\n\nThis game also introduces a loot system. (Pretty much the same thing TF2 has.) You can customize both your humans and dinosaurs with hats, skins, and camo's. Though you can find pretty much every hat and skin in the game. You can even find vey rare things like Legendary quality items. I even found a key once!\n\nIs this community better or worse than other games? I think this community is better than most. Most people tend to get along and congratulate people on a lucky find or skill shot. Many offer trades for skins and hats. And I rarely see people insult others. I have yet to see any cheaters or hackers.\n\nImprovements I think the developers can do: Slightly increase the reload time for the shotgun. Hit detection is pretty weird, espacially with the net gun. Small bug fixes like the ragdolls or minor animation glitches.\n\nDo I think this game is worth your 19.99? Honestly, no. At least not right now. Wait till the game is discounted or more players and updates appear. I think this game deserves a fair 6.5/10 I hope to see you all in game soon!","August 15, 2015","true","29.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I also heavily followed the game's development in the years leading up to its release, so it does mean something to me.\n\nThat being said, I am for the most part quite dissatisfied with the direction the game has taken. I should first get out of the way the evident fact that Primal Carnage: Extinction is more like "Primal Carnage: Rebooted" because the *first* game was ruined by shoddy development. The developers didn't seem to know what they were doing with the game, and that led to progressively worse "updates" that ultimately warranted a fresh start.\n\nAs it is now, Primal Carnage: Extinction has a lot going for it, but once again it lacks sense of direction or purpose. It seems the game has succumbed to the overhwelming pressure of obnoxious roleplayers who for some inane reason bought an FPS game to play The Land Before Time With Guns. "Free Roam" gamemodes dominate the multyiplayer servers, and at any given time there are only two or three actual deathmatch or any other relevant gamemodes to play. Clearly when it comes to dinosaur games, players want to just ~be a dinosaur~ without necessarily killing and getting killed in a fast-paced FPS environment, and the Primal Carnage developers have adjusted poorly to this audience by simply letting the game drown in a cesspoll of unengaging free roam servers.\n\nAs it is right now, I absolutely cannot recommend it to any prospecting players. There are plenty of upcoming new dinosaur games around the corner that have the right idea, like The Isle, Mesozoica, and Saurian, so I would recommend just saving your money for those games.","June 3","false","15.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

(which means free Volcanic Spino, yay!)\n\nOverviewPrimal Carnage was a game I had a lot of fun on a few years ago but also I got pretty bored of it. There were only 3 game modes and only one that you could ever really find a match in, Team Deathmatch. I got pretty excited when I saw the developers were re-building the game, and the screenshots they were releasing were so good looking. I got pretty annoyed when I found out that they had decided to turn all this awesome new content into a semi-sequel game. So here it is at last, Primal Carnage: Extinction. Upon first starting up the game its immediatley obvious how much nicer the UI and graphics are. However you immediatley run into the same problems with only being able to find team deathmatch games. However, this time the developers have added loot into the game. This may sound very cool, however it is annoying as less and less players are playing on proper game servers and are instead farming the loot system on 2:00 long match, loot servers, This sucks. It means there is only ever about one fully populated server so it can be hard sometimes to find a good game. However, the core gameplay has been refined, so if you can put up with the small amount of players then extinction is a very enjoyable experience.\n\nPositive\n+ Graphics\n+ Gameplay\n+ Skins\n\nNegative\n- Loot Servers\n- Lack of Players\n\nConclusionPrimal Carnage: Extinction is a very enjoyable game and one that I will continue to play, however it is brought down by how common the loot servers are, balancing issues and the lack of players, especially those playing other game modes.","February 19, 2015","true","85.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

And if the devs dont censor you dont worry the community will, why? cuz its der favorite gam and they wuv it!\n\nAnd oh boy will you love seeing roleplayers everywhere! since the game cant hold up on its gameplay the devs cater to the roleplayers by adding only dinosaurs and no new human classes, making humans stale on top of boring and not fun to play.\n\nIf you want a good dinosaur game, go get the original primal carnage, its better in every aspect, as for this avoid this game, as Jeff Goldblum said: That is one big pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEdit: and incase you are wondering why do i have so many hours in a terrible game? well to abuse the economy ofcourse, you will be surprised how much roleplayers will pay for awful low effort recolors. This game is literally paying me to play it and i still cant stand it, what a waste of a game.\n\nEdit: The game is dying cause the devs are incompitent, greedy, lazy, and just love to make up excuses instead of fixing the game. Soon the game will die out like original and only the fanboys will be left defending the devs and buying 400$ reskins.\n\nAvoid this dying game with the one of the worst devs ever, if you want a dinosaur game go buy Ark.","June 24, 2015","false","287.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","19","34","7","0"

Such as some of the animation transitions and a few other nit-picky things.\nSome people have been reporting CTD's and crashed at the end of matches, but I have yet to encounter these problems myself.\n\nAll-in-all though, Primal Carnage: Extinction has many advantages over its predecessor and is a major upgrade.\nAll of the maps have been completely overhauled and now look fantastic, the design and graphical quality is far superior and contributes to a more immersive and satisfying gaming experience.\n\nThe different species of dinosaurs within each class now have slightly differing abilities which adds variety to gameplay whilst providing players with a wider range of play-styles. The human weapon system has also been revamped with all classes now having a secondary weapon as well as the addition of support roles (i.e. throwing down health or ammo packs). This, I feel, helps to make the game a lot more balanced. (Providing people utilize teamwork, of course!)\n\nThe movement and the attacks of the dinosaur classes takes some re-learning, but once you get used to it you'll have no problems. Definitely worth the purchase, especially if you enjoyed the original Primal Carnage.","December 4, 2014","true","60.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game feels to me like it could be a fresh beginning, and I really hope I'm not wrong. The only thing that is bugging me right now, is the fact that controlling the dinos and characters feels... awkward. Attacking is a gamble, hoping to hit whatever is in your general aiming direction. Strafing feels way to jumpy for me, but animations, sounds and graphics are all as I hoped they would be. Overall, I would recommend it. It just has too much potential to not get it. So, stop reading this and play this game!\n\nEDIT (june 26th, 2015)\nAfter the recent content update end several patches that focused on bugfixing, I'm glad to say that the game is looking very good now. A new playable dinosaur has been added, as well as a great variety of skins to collect and trade. Controls feel better than ever and the game is now fair to both human and dinosaur. If you do not own this game yet, I highly recommend you buy it right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Airyll/recommended/321360/","Airyll","Airyll","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Airyll/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATED ON: 7th December 2014 @ 4:16pm GMT\nPatch #: 2\nCurrent build as of the time of update: 465417\n\nBig Edit: Review overhauled completely to make up for the big changes to the game in the last two patches! Enjoy~\n\n~~~ In-depth NEW!!!~~~\n\nPrimal Carnage: Extinction is the long awaited "update" promised to players of the original Primal Carnage after the abysmal 1.3 update broke the balance of the game almost entirely. The lack of transparency around Extinction - original named the "Primal Carnage 2.0 recode" - is something that should be made a note of before you do consider making a purchase of this game.\n\nThe game itself was released riddled with bugs, several of which that made the game unplayable for many, a chore to run for any length of time, impossible to host a server on and brought many disappointments in terms of skins for many players who found their DLC hadn't carried over. However, the developers have been working extremely hard to bring out content patches to fix stability and server issues (with two patches since early access release, already!) and have also greatly improved on the issue of transparency with the opening of a trello board. They've also been very active in responding to the community and issues posted (you can actually see two dev posts on this review in the comments) and have clearly dedicated a lot of time to a community that was, at launch, feeling neglected and perhaps a little bit betrayed.\n\nOriginally, when I first wrote this review, I didn't recommend the game. When patch #1 was released, this recommendation did not change, though I did praise the team on doing a very good job with their swift response and the obvious fixes.\n\nAs of patch #2, I feel like I can recommend this game as an early access title immediately for any who own the original Primal Carnage to get the discounted price. For those interested in the game, I would also recommend purchasing the first game, and then PC:E at a discounted price so that you can perhaps experience and compare yourself. I would hesitate to yet recommend this title at full price for now, but with the progress of each patch update and the continued communication from developers, I also wouldn't tell people to avoid the game if they had an interest.\n\nPositive things to note:\n- the graphics have been improved from the first game, with map overhauls, animation improvements and a better optimisation by comparison.\n- new animations specifically give a more fluid and natural feel, though some might also call it "floaty" and this is definitely something that your personal preference will effect. Overall, I feel that they're much nicer and they give a much more natural movement to the dinosaurs, in particular.\n- many mechanics have been changed for the betterment of the game. Although it still needs to be balanced, I will not hesitate to say that the majority of these changes (not all) are an improvement over the way they used to be. With some tweaking, they will be excellent.\n- the UI has been greatly improved upon, making it more user friendly and visually appealing. No complaints here, it's a small change that makes a big difference to aesthetics.\n- an economy system for skins, new weapons and cosmetics is, to be honest, a much better way of dealing with additional content than paid DLC is. Although again, this will be something you need to decide for yourself, I can say that I personally like it, and look forward to playing games to try and get the drops I really want. I think this is a very positive change to encourage playtime for the collectors and encourage trade between the community.\n- as far as the developer team goes, they seem to be making every effort to communicate properly, make sure there is greater transparency for the community, and patching the major issues fast. While this doesn't necessarily effect gameplay technically it is definitely something to make note of, and a very positive change that is very welcome to see after the earlier silence.\n- the dedicated server hosting tool has been improved, several bugs have been fixed on this end and the utility of the tool is much better. A welcome improvement I'm very happy to see, though I still need to do testing to see if server passwords are broken.\n\nMixed points of contention\n- the tyrant classes were far too powerful in PC 1.3, but as of PC:E patch #2, they still feel a little underpowered for their intended purpose. This is also in part due to a continuing hitbox error I seem to be noticing, though hit detection has improved somewhat. Generally, I would like to see the tyrants a little bit more tanky or the humans have their damage reviewed. It's still very buggy and tyrants still die far too easily. That said, however, practise does make perfect, so if you are struggling on your tyrant to deal with a 1v2 and perhaps even a 1v3, I'd recommend practise first before lodging a complaint. It is still very possible, you just need to play much smarter than of 1.3. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n- the speed of classes seems all over the place. Some of the changes were necessary. Balance is, however, still needed. That every human seems to be a world record holding sprinter is a concern and something I feel needs to be looked at.\n\nNegative points for consideratoin\n- the game will still CTD now and then on leaving a server. I don't think this is specific to my machine, but it's not a major problem either. Just something to be aware of.\n- hitboxes still seem terribly out of whack and balance is definitely required here. This will hopefully improve as the stability increases further (as it has for the last two patches) and balance can be looked at properly.\n- some people are still struggling with their DLC skins, which is understandably disheartening for them and is something to be aware of if you own PC 1.3 DLC.\n- although the optimisation has improved vastly from the original game, moving away from the comparison, some maps on PC:E could do with optimisation passes. Patch #2 has seen the first optimisation pass of a map, which is promising and a step in the right direction, but be aware that is only one map of several.\n- collision detection, while being worked on and improved, is still in need of a lot of checking in many places. It's still very possible for tyrants to reach places they shouldn't be able to in a number of maps or to almost "glitch" their way up gaps if they hit it at the right angle and a certain speed.\n- mobility for classes, not just speed, seems a little off. Tyrants turn slowly when they walk, as expected, but can turn on a dime when sprinting, despite the increase in momentum suggesting they would need to turn slower. Some review is needed here. Similarly, class attack speeds need to be reconsidered.\n\nOverall, the game still needs a massive balance check, and for picky players it might be worth avoiding the game until patch #3/4 when the dev team have had a chance to review such things. The fixes to stability are fantastic and I hope that game stability continues to improve and that the community and developers both continue to monitor it. And, again, I think it's really important to praise the developers for their continued communication with the community, which is going a very long way and ultimately making all the difference in the world.","December 3, 2014","true","226.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","10"

I'll be listing the pros and cons of this game and why you should and should not get it.\n\nPros:\nOkay so, this game is really enjoyable because:\n1. So fun killing dinosaurs and eating people as dinos.\n2.Wide range of classes which all have their own unique abillities for any situation.\n3. Humans have their own unique weopens in the game found nowhere else like a netgun and a sick flamesaw! (Flamethrower and a chainsaw attatched to it pretty cool right?)\n4. Easter Eggs and secrets!\n5.Extremely fun to play with friends who have the game.\n6.Competitive gameplay\n7.One of the best dinosaur games you'll find on steam, most of the others aren't really good other than Ark and maybe a few others.\n8.Trading system and buying and selling loot you get in the game.\n\nCons:\n1.Old game (Primal Carnage) had some features not in this game but I guess this game is still better only due to the fact that the devs are still working on it and bringing back most of the stuff in the old game and some new stuff too!\n2.Glithches, there are 2 types of glitches in this game: 1.Funny glitches, these include hillarious ragdoll animation glitches where the dead corpse goes crazy and all over the place. 2.Glitches that crash the game. Now these happen rarely or maybe it's just because of  my computer XD. Well if this happens to you a message will pop up and will quit the game.\n\nOverall even if it's a bit buggy Primal Carnage Extinction is still a very enjoyable game and is one of the my most favourite games of all time. 8.5/10","September 29, 2015","true","436.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I almost lost hope in PC completely and stopped updating myself on news.\n\nI now regret that decision because Extinction goes above and beyond what Primal Carnage was.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics, They are even better than the first game in both style and immersion, and yet somehow my friends that couldnt play the original can play this game? GREAT!\n\nSecondly? The gameplay, its extremely smooth, though I admit Its balanced slightly in the dinosaurs favor. And it dosent help that most players in the game dont understand "Teamwork". However its still a blast even when you lose, and its even fun when you play as HUMANS, YES I AM SPEAKING CORRECTLY, Playing as "boring" humans is just as fun if not more enjoyable then dinosaurs! The controls are easy to work with and everything feels clean as a whistle.\n\nThis game has its fair share of bugs, but guess what? 2 patches ago the game was 10x buggier, and the devs went ahead and... whats that...? LISTENED TO THE COMMUNITY?! Yes they added features and fixed bugs that were suggested/reported by the community, they have even made some SKINS by community request.\n\nOn top of all that its in EARLY ACCESS, that means they are going to be adding more content, and unlike games like cs:go and tf2, I find crates to be enjoyable, as a rare item is rare enough to be rewarding, but not so rare its near unobtainable.\n\nOverall I HIGHLY recommend this game, and i give it...\n\nStory:2.3\nSound:6.8\nGraphics:9.2\nGameplay:8.7\nDevelopers:7.9\nOnline:8.1\n\nOverall:\n8.2 / 10","February 10, 2015","true","28.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's fun, has BEAUTIFUL graphics, and has the most hilarious ragdoll poses.\nSome people may disagree and say it's not THAT great, but it is. I mean, what game can have a freaking RAPTOR drive a motorcycle? PRIMAL CARNAGE EXTINCTION DOES. Now the only downside of the game is the lag problem. I've had the lag since I first got the game, and it became steadily worse. Fear not though, because I have the solution for this problem! I have found that if you turn ALL the settings down to low and have the FXXA thing on bloom, then the game will run smoothly. It may cost you the games precious graphics, but hey, who would play a game that lags so much it's like the 1980's first computers? I wouldn't! Now along with the lagging is the problems with humans when your a tyrant. Let's say your a T.rex and you're having a good time in the basic testing map when, "BLAM BLAM!" A human under the bridge shoots you! You stop and look at the human and roar, hoping to make them stop. The human takes the roar as a sign to continue to shoot and wastes their ammo on you. You get ticked off and run away, but the human, being the ♥♥♥♥ head they are, follows you and continues to shoot you. You try and turn around and eat them, but they run away, leaving them open and practically commanding you to give chase. You chase them around until they jump into the water and swim down. You swim down after them, hoping to bite them and eat them. The human goes farther down and hides in the tunnel, now shooting you. You immediately realize this could be your demise and struggle to get out, your health dropping like a rock on a cliff. The human takes one more shot right when you get out and kills you, they then quickly get out and start to T-BAG your body. You rage in chat and curse at the human, calling them mean names and then quitting. This stuff has happened people! And it's not stopping. Now besides the lag and the annoying troll humans, the game is great. You should TOTALLY a buy it, you'll have a blast playing a game that took 65 million years to be created ;) (yes that was a reference to Jurassic Park)","May 3","true","158.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

The actual game and concept is good, the devs are still updating the game, it looks nicer than the original it's more balanced and forgiveing of newer players but it was one of the worst, cancerous communities out there. And there isn't much of a player base to  begin with. As for if I would recomend it..... idk most servers are just role playing servers and there is pretty much only one tdm server running so long story short this game is definitly an aquired taste but I have a lot of fun with this game but I also see people who hate this game.\n\nRECOMENDATION= wait for this game to go on sale before you buy it. The only reason I'm giving it a thumbs up right now is because it has greatly improved from past updates that were extremly unbalanced and just not that fun to play in\n\nMy final score for this game would probably be a 5.5/10 or maybe a 6.5/10 on one of it's good days.","April 25","true","87.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

Post patch.\n\nWell, this game is now better then the original! Now that the majority of the bad bugs have been taken care of, Extinction is difinently worth playing now. The gameplay is faster-paced then the first, dinosaurs and humans control excellently, and loot drops are starting to come along in the form of a couple new dinosaur & weapon skins. Here's to hoping the human equiptable items & dinosaur cosmetic items are coming very soon.\n\nPros:\n-Tight controls overall.\n\n-No more abusing of terrain like in the old game! Ever since the 1.3 patch in the first PC, everyone abused rockclimbing glitches. Can't do that anymore.\n\n-Playing as the humans is a tense, fast-paced experience. Though humans seem to move a bit fast. Maybe slowing them down a bit would fix this.\n\n-Dinosaurs control better then in the original Primal Carnage and is extremely satisfying. Sprinting with a dinosaur actually feels faster and does not have an annoying blur effect to simulate fake speed like in the first PC.\n\n-The enviorments are much inproved over the original. Maps are more vibrant with detail to the foliage, buildings and terrain.\n\n-Humans have a larger variety of weapons & items at their disposal. More options are going to be added over the following weeks.\n\n-Loot is only awarded at the end of a game, meaning players can't log on and then quit the game once they have their stuff like in TF2.\n\n-Cosmitic skins and items can be mixed & matched, giving a better variety of customization than the first game.\n\n-Most of the existing effects look good. The fire does looks a tad odd, but that doesn't make a flaming carnotaurus barreling straight towards your face any less scary. XD\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Some of the animations on the humans, particularly their walking animation, could use some work.\n\n-You can win crates in your loot, but there are no keys to unlock them yet. :(\n\n-Some of the weapons sound pitiful compared to their counterparts in the first game, particularly the shotgun and rifle.\n\n-The pteranodon's grab feels fantastic overall, but it seems a bit to forgiving, as humans will constently be gravitated into your grasp that should have missed. They need to decrease the grabbing zone a bit to balance how easy it is to use.\n\n-On the other hand the raptor's pounce could have a slightly wider grab range. You can't jump if you aim past the pounce range. Having a quick-pounce option but just quickly clicking the pounce to just leap in the pointed direction would make it better.\n\n-Could use a little more detail in a couple of the maps. One example is the Atrium C map, where the map event sets the dome to lockdown and zaps everything inside the dome to instant death. There are no electical effects when this happens. Everyone just dies. There needs to be an electical shock overlay or a flash on the screen to complete the effect, otherwise it seems a bit lazy.\n\n-Still a few random bugs here and there. One persistent one at that at the beginning of a match, the top & bottom of the screen are cut out by black bars, block your HUD. They will eventually disappear, but its still a bit annoying. Another glitch I recently found was that after a match an error box will appear and the game crashes, however this happens after the ending screen during map transition, so it doesn't effect your loot drop.\n\n\n\nAll & all, if you are a first Primal Carnge owner, jump at the chance for the $3.00 price. If you were thinking of getting the first Primal Carnage, get this instead. It has what the first PC had and more in the near future. The first PC in its current 1.3 build is filled with unbalanced classes and glitched up terrain, and they aren't gonna update it anytime soon. Extinction however has a bright future with more fairly balancing, more maps, and customization options","December 5, 2014","true","468.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I figured it was just a patch they wanted to get paid for.\nAfter playing it, I know now that I was completely wrong!  Primal Carnage Extinction does feel like a sequel, and a major improvement at that!\nIt is well worth the $3 for those that own Primal Carnage, and well worth the $20 for those that don't!\n\nThe game feels much more fluid, a lot of the bugs or annoyances that were in the first Primal Carnage are no longer present, and the steam economy integration is a great idea in my opinion!\n\nAt this point, the only recommendation I would make to the devs is the following (Cons if you will);\nHuman Animations are done very poorly, particularly their movement animations.\n\nMake more items marketable on the steam economy.  So far, every one that I have gotten is nonmarketable, but is tradable.\n\nMake it so that some of the areas the Tyrant class cannot normaly enter, does have a route in, but is somewhat difficult and easily defendable.  Most of the time the Humans camp these areas the entire match.\n\nBoost Damage a tad on the Human side.  So far 90% of the wins has been on the Dino team.","December 4, 2014","true","44.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Dinosaurs are now incredibly inaccurate when it comes to movement (yes, I know, it's early access, but a raptor that can't instantly break into a jog - something humans can do - is stupid) and the whole 'skins are seperate dinsoaurs with different abilities' just seems stupid to me. Pteranodon used to take skill to operate, now it's simple and so dumbed down I can't believe I used to even play the class. The raptor-pounce mechanic of summoning a waypoint to perfectly plan your assault is ridiculous, and Spinosaurus has overall more power than Tyrannosaurus (same with Cryo being better than Dilo). The weaker dino's just appear pointless to me, and the Dino camera angles just seem utterly wrong. Moving is better in the original.\nI actually think the Human team is ok, and the new physics and graphics are beautiful, though.\nSo that's it really. I hope it'll be better in the full release, preferably more like the original with dino-movement.\n\nI don't recommend it YET. I hope that will change upon final release + updates.","December 7, 2014","false","40.8"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","24","45","2","2"

Devs are more interested in releasing economy patches than actually fixing their game. They don't have any idea how to balance their product or even make it playable in the least.\nthey've released 3 balance patches since the launch of EA in December or so, and they've all been bad at least and absolutely, completely terrible at most.\nthey broke everything that was fine in the first game and added completely stupid, unbalanced, BROKEN mechanics in this one (ptera grab, Scientist medpack, Commando grenades, Carno turn radius)\nBut instead of fixing anything they release 2 bad patches seperated by weeks and then release 3 economy patches within a week just so they can cash in on gullable people who can't see how trash this game really turned out.\nI'm uninstalling this game until things turn around, because at this rate it's just a cash grab that isn't fun to play, and the community is unrelentingly blind and childish.\nDon't buy this game. It's 100% not worth it. Unbalanced, poorly made, Greedy Devs, childish community.\nGo play something else, Dying Light, Skyrim, Counterstrike, anything, not this hogwash ♥♥♥♥♥.","January 18, 2015","false","42.9"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","27","51","7","2"

However with early access you will notice that bugs are everywhere...as the days, months, years go on they will patch the game to make it better. The Dinosaur physics are MUCH improved and the graphics seem overhauled for the better. I am excited for the new "Loot" system and I LOVE the customization option...however their really isn't much to customize with right now since the game is in Early Access.

The trick is; you must fire where your enemy is going to be instead of where it is.

I finally write a review. If you want to play on max graphics, I suggest a computer with a good graphics card. If not, medium and low work fine for me. Anyway, this game has many bugs that are quite funny and sometimes disturbing such as rag dolls after death. Other bugs like spectating glitch when trying to avatar a class your spawned as admin, and crafting/skin/inventory errors, aren't so pleasant. The game is simple and truly beautiful in my opinion. There are many ways to customize your own dinosaurs/humans, too. The only thing I don't like about the skins, is how surprisingly high priced they are. 30+ USD? Wow. Also, dinosaurs are a little be too strong. Humans should be buffed a bit, but I guess with enough skill it is possible. It's a great game for Dinosaurs vs Humans if you want to hunt or be hunted as a dinosaur, or be killed constantly by them along with blowing them up. I do indeed recommend this..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupDoods/recommended/321360/","SupDoods","Zayelphi ❣","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SupDoods/","27 products in account","I love Primal Carnage. I played the original since release when I was 12, and I have loved it ever since. The concept is amazing, who doesn't like being a tyrannosaurus eating humans, and who doesn't like being a commando blowing raptors to bits. Extinction (now having been released for over a year now) has made a slight improvement over the old one. Better graphics, more content, bug fixes etc.\n\nBut, it has a long way to go.\n\nThe original has imo much better gameplay and actually more balanced teams, as I still play it and often win as humans. (Surprised?) The deathmatch system in the first one is much better, and is overall I'd say funner than the DM in the second one. I also like the fact (even though I am a skin collector) that no-one really cares for skins in the first one. You just load it, select a server and play. No faffing about skins, market or whining that you haven't got a feathered raptor.\n\nThat brings me on to the cons of the game. The community is lovely at most, I met some wonderful people on this game who genuinely play for the fun. However, there is that dark corner of the community that beg for skins, riddled with trollers and hackers. I do enjoy the addition of the loot system, though. The skins are remarkable, and do add that creative side to the game, with moddable features on its way. The multiple skins of the game bring pros and cons to the game.\n\nMoving on to another con, the gameplay and the unbalance. The humans have a massive disadvantage to the dinosaurs. The shotgun for the pathfinder is way too weak, the dinosaurs don't take fall damage and the numerous amounts of tyrants each round make it hard to play as the humans. However, when you are winning as the humans, it beats the dinosaurs by a long way.\nI also think they nerfed the rex too much. He is literally a walking free kill. His trample does not insta-kill (which I think it should, an 8 tonne animal steps on your head? You are going to die. (Do correct me on my accuracy of weight, too. xD) And if they do buff him back up, I'd also expect to see a similar tyrant limit to the first game. Apart from that problem, I think the dinosaurs are way over-powered and it takes a lot of skill and teamwork to win as a human.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this game on a daily basis, from hanging out with friends to playing deathmatch, I definitely recommend it. But do not expect perfect gameplay, as there are still balance issues and some problems with the game that need addressing.","February 3","true","495.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

None of the classes are fun to play, humans just get mowed over by dinosaurs especially since the human to dino ratio in an average server is 2:3. The guns are inaccurate, also hitboxes are completely broken so most bullets are not registering when they should be. Mind you it has been like this since the game came out. The raptor pounce has also been broken since release, and the devs keep claiming that they are constantly working on these issues. They need to stop making promises they can't keep.\n\n90% of the servers are set to free roam. They are populated by either people idling to get drops or children who like to roleplay their fantasies of being a demon tyrannosaurus or the raptor squad from JW. The devs accomodate these people, mostly because they are milked like cows buying poorly made skins from the marketplace. I myself have left this game running for hours and hours and have managed to make some steam bucks by selling the cosmetics.\n\nThis game clearly has no idea which direction it is going in, and the developers are obviously incompetent. I am only scratching the surface of all the issues in this game, but I am not going to waste any more energy on it and uninstall. I closely followed Lukewarm media's original Primal Carnage since early alpha, and it meant a lot to me. This game is one of the biggest disappointments of my life.","June 5","false","741.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What I mean by that is a for a while there were problems with the game such as low player counts and balancing issues. However, the devs are working hard (probably) and these problems are starting to go away (probably). So just be aware that there may be some bugs or balancing issues. So, now to the actual review.\n\nThe Dinosaurs\n\nThe dinosaurs in this game are actually suprisingly well modeled and animated for a non-"AAA" game. The controls are fairly easy but some dinosaurs need more skill than others. There are a few issues like tyrants being killed very quickly but other than that they are incredibly enjoyable.\n\nThe Humans\n\nThe human team used to be underpowered, but now they have the choice between a lot more guns some quite powerful (i'm looking at you SPAZ) so the humans at times can seem a little bit OP. I myself am terrible at playing as a human but perhaps many of you are a lot better than I am.\n\nMarket and cosmetics\n\nOne of the things about the devs is their love for adding skins. This can be good or bad. It's good because you see a variety of different characters on the field but is bad because in the dark ages it seemed to be the priority. Recently, a workshop was added where players can add their own skins and the ones with the most votes get added into the game, meaning the devs can focus more on the actuall game.\n\nGame Progress\n\nWhile the devs used to take a while with many update delays, like I said they're coming out of the dark tunnel now and we are getting updates each month. It's because of this consistency that the playerbase has grown quite a bit. Now, there is a slight problem with that, which is the one thing trying it's best to keep PC:E in that tunnel and I think it needs an entire section for it...\n\nFreeRoam servers over TDM\n\nIf you look at the server list if get the game, you may notice the ratio of FR to TDM servers is around 25:1, and the two TDM servers there are full. That is one of the main problems with the game and to boost it even more there was a recent update with a new Free Roam map (it's a cool map but 95% of servers are on it). To be honest though, it's not as bad as back in the dark ages. Roleplay dominated the Island of Primal Carnage, and there was an uncontrollable amount of dirty dinos around every corner. But like I said that was back in the dark ages and I quite sure that doesn't happen anymore (well, I haven't set foot on the MPCQ servers in a very long time so I can't be sure). You might hear while playing the game about Get to The Chopper (GTTC). This gamemode was fun but servers hosting it are practically non-existent now. But, a huge revamp of the gamemode is on it's way so you might see that in the near future.\n\nSummary\n\nPros:\nDino gamplay is good\nScenery is nice\nMore frequent updates now\nBalancing is ok\n"Dark ages" have almost ended\nNew content on the way including gamemodes and dinosaurs\n\nCons:\nWay to many freeroam servers\nTyrants are killed quickly\nSome remanents of the dark ages are still here\nSome members of the community are... well like most 11 year olds you see in gaming so it's really not that different to other games I suppose.\n\nOverall, I think if you have a passion for dinosaurs, teeth ,flamethrowers with chainsaws underneath, machinegun-grenade launchers, shooting things, eating things and patience for updates, this game is for you. After all, it's basically TF2 with f*cking dinosaurs! If however you have no patience, like to be as salty as you can in the chat and have a passion for dino romace... please leave me alone and don't touch me *cowers in corner huggging knees to chest*","March 28","true","357.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Game balance has been improved as well, now giving humans a chance to actually beat the dinosaur team if the classes and weapons are properly used.\n\nWhile some of my old complaints remain, mostly on the in-game market and the way it turns skins and cosmetics into highly overpriced items, PC:E developers have shown they are looking foward to keep improving and expanding on the game, a new, promising, "Survival" gamemode has been added as well new weapons, a new dinosaur class and maps, all these free of any extra charge.\n\nAfter months of being skeptical, i can finally see some progress on the game being made and potential for it become even better, because of this, and the fun i´ve had playing the newest versions, i find PC:E worth recommending.","February 1","true","053.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I don't regret buying it. It's an awesome game and I think it deserves a little more attention. It's true there are some issues with it, but it's a new game and they could (and hopefully will) address any problems. I particularly enjoy the new game mode, Dino deathmatch, because I feel it evens out the odds a little. I find that the humans in this game (and the first one) are underpowered compared to their Dino enemies and it takes the fun out of playing when you are dying every time you so much as take a step anywhere alone. Unfortunately the Dino deathmatch servers end up empty fairly quickly.. Anyway it's a fun game and worth getting, especially while it's on sale.\n\nThe movements feel fluid to me, despite what I've been told. The environments are beautiful as well. I've heard people complaining that it is buggy to all hell, but the only bugs I've encountered are:\n-Carnos have been freezing it seems. I've seen a few players (every now and again, not constantly) be unable to move suddenly as a carno.\n-When hit by certain things ptera/tupa gets glitched to some random part of the map and/or gets a really weird speed boost.\n-(This is one I've experienced, I don't know if it's a common problem) SUPPOSEDLY the different numbered crates give out different things if you buy a key for it. I recieved a "Crate #3" which apparently turned into just "Dinosaur crate" like the one I had sitting in my Inv which was disappointing concidering I bought a key just to open that one :\\n\nOtherwise I'd give it... 8-9/10 at least for what it is right now.","April 9, 2015","true","407.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

People probably think I'd be somewhat insane to put that much time into a game like this, but lemme say what I gotta say about it first.\n\nSo here are a few of the things in this game that greatly appealed to me\n\nOne of the most interesting things about this game is that it is one of the few dinosaur games out there where you can play as a dinosaur against other humans. I only know of 2-3 other games that share this function, making it a standout in the genre\n\nThe graphics for this game are absolutel BEAUTIFUL. A lot of the maps and models have a very realistic feel to them, even if it is exaggurated to some extent.\n\nThere are many very nice skins in this game. A number of which I've been collecting. Ranging from raptors with quills and feathers to tupas with larger crests.\n\nThe skins are usually cheap. Now I'm guessing you're gonna see the market and complain about skins being up for $200 dollars and whine about it being expensive, but how many of the people who see those prices know how much certain skins in games like CSGO can go for? Tens of thousands of dollars in some cases...\n\nTheres many other positives for this game, and overall, I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a competitive or casual shooter, any dinosaur lover, anyone looking to invest in the economy, and anyone looking for a fun game.","March 18","true","736.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

Ok now let's start off with the basics this game is just plain awful. Let's make the dots that we ALL love so much.\n\n1. Awful Fps almost on any server you go on even if you have an amazing computer it will lag regardless no questions asked  mainly because they didn't think through how the foliage and trees and certain gun fire would work they just plopped it in and left it.\n2. Too expensive for what it offers ok so let's get off to a really known and annoying subject for players Little to none content. Whenever you want to play a match 80 percent of them are empty and the ones that actually have people in them are roleplay servers and basictesting that's what i see on a regular basis if you find an actual gamer server with people in it it's not gonna be alot it's also rare! This is really annoying for gamers that don't have too much time on there hands as i don't feel like playing servers with nothing in it and admins destroying everything (basictesting) i also don't feel like going on a server where players are starting familys with dinos... (Roleplay) Now im going to say this before people find this and start yelling at me i do not dislike roleplay i just think it's really dumb that those are pretty much the only populated servers.\n3. Greedy game developers they made this game 13 more dollars than the original primal carnage for basically nothing. Your spending 13 more dollars of your money for this piece of crap and getting little to any content when you can just go and buy primal carnage which is actually better. The loot system is also really poor as it doesn't have a very smart concept and all you get are boxes yea? It's really rare to get any skins at all so if you want to look good you have to either buy keys or go to the market which is really crappy i don't ever spend money on in-game items if i do it's rare because i think it's a crap concept the only type of in-game item i can see myself buying is diamonds or something like that i'd rather earn my loot. Back to the key system even when you force yourself to buy keys and open the boxes it's so rare to get anything nice as i normally just see people get ugly blues which is depressing at least in most games opening boxes can earn you some profit. Obvious greed of the developers.\n4. I've seen quite a few people mention this and i know it too this game was in development for quite a while they had enough time to make this game Dinosaur game of the world but instead they barthed out this 90 percent of the maps i can find bugs and glitches and missing items also did i mention that half of the maps even if they were finished would be ugly anyways most people will disagree with me on this but im telling you these maps are just plain bad we expected to see epic graphics 10/10 matches awesome content and maps that looked like they came from 2030 (just an expression) Im sure many people were hyped by this and are know cringing at the sound of it.\n5. The one concept in this game that is actually good is profit making if your a lucky guy and are getting all the legendarys you can earn a pretty penny buy selling the skins and may earn yourself a couple better games.\n6. Complete unbalancement if you find yourself in a good old deathmatch with a fair amoutn of people and you think you've finnally found the perfect server heh-heh-heh well good luck actually getting anywhere everytime you play as a carnivore humans will shoot at you then jump in the water or hid in tiniest of crevices now most people will say but it's the only way i won't get eaten which is true but it should not be. What's the point of a shooter if all your doing is hiding? one tactic that drives me insane as a raptor are sucicide bombers these players have no choice there just flat out terrible gamers. As a carnivore you are much too overpowerd than humans which is the main reason humans always hide they make it so you can nearly never be hit as a small dino and give the tyrants too much of a upper advantage against the humans sure with enough firepower you can slaughter them but if you got someone who is extremly skilled as a tyrant you've already won the game.\n\nIn conclusion there are just too many things wrong with this game for it to be fun or at all good after the time they were given and the time they still had to fix the game all they did was continue making more skins and BOXES!","February 16","false","57.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

As a fan of the original game I find this insulting.\n\nAn ingame shop with overpriced items such as player skins and keys which allow you to unlock the ingame items you pickup while paying. This wouldn't normally be an issue if items in game didn't cost hundreds in real life money to buy.\n\nAdmins join in on the few deathmatch servers available with indestructibility and the ability to drop unlimited grenades while playing as a dinosaur.  The majority of servers are roleplaying kids and the community is cancerous, they will attack you if you call an admin out on cheating in game.\n\nThe game is also very buggy and the developers seem lazy. Do not buy this game.\n\nRefund request sent.","December 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","4"

My time playing this game. I went through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roleplay phase. Let's not talk about that... Ever...\n\nNow I mainly play the game because it has nice dinosaur models to look at and There are quite a few. And mess with people as usual. However that does not make this game good. The animations are so slow and lazy, along with the gameplay that is lackluster and far from balanced.\n\nThe original Primal Carnage is better than this in so many ways. The feeling of weakness as a human was great. We had to group together and try to survive as raptors and pteras dogged us the whole way. I can't understand what the developers had in mind when they made this. The original was very balanced.\n\nAlong with all that, Their additions of "New" dinosaurs are just reskins of others. With SLIGHTLY different abilitys. The most creative they got was with Acrocanthosaurus, it has a nice skin and has deviated from the other tyrant classes. Faster with less health and AOE.\n\nMy final verdict is 6/10 due to the bad animations and the lazy addition of dinosaurs.\n\nEdit: I feel that 7.5/10 is a better rating, since it is still relatively fun to play, and I usually find myself playing it.","January 1","false","132.8"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","6"

I've spent too much time on it... Great game for any dinosaur-fan!\nBut......\n\nPros:\n-Skins, so no dinosaur is the same.\n-More dinos then other Primal Carnage Game\n-Fun games (If you can find one)\n-Dinosaurs! (Must I need to say more?)\n\nNotes:\n-Good maps\n-Okay graphics\n-Does not need a perfect computer to run game well\n-Freeroam/RP: Yes, I like to RP occasionally, but to actually find decent people... Different Story.\n-Still fun to run around as a dino\n-Okay communtiy (There are so many different kinds of people in this game, I cannot pick a side directly)\n\n\nCons:\n-Skins: (Yeah I know I noted this as a Pro) Accoring to everyone in the community, ever, the better skin you have, then the more people should like you and respect you. Wtf?\n-Skins part 2: Shure the skins in this game are really nice, but to get a nice one, you have to spend about......... $400+ on it.\n-Horrible human gameplay: the humans have been incredibly nerfed and you might as well be throwing rocks at the dinos.\n\nSo, if you enjoy just being a dinosaur, worshipping the player with the best skin, RPing (Sort of), or eating humans because they are pretty much always your dinner, this game COULD be for you.\n","October 11, 2015","true","580.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although, this game does have a few flaws at launch..\n1.) No voice chat yet.. there will be voice chat in the future since there is a push to talk option in the key bindings, but voice chat itself hasn't been added to the game at the time of writing this review.\n2.) It is freaking HARD to use a teradactal (the flying dino).. Its a cool idea.. but with the low health and the grab box for lifting humans in the air.. just doesn't work so well.\n3.) The reload time for the trapper human is insanely too long.. if you miss... you're fkd and its super easy to miss when dinos are running past you at super fast speeds.\nAnd those are really the only flaws I can come up with, Which really are not even that bad,, but are bad enough for me to complain about..\nI reccomend you buy this game, I feel like it will become a big game!

There are bugs, some of them bad, but they will be fixed. My main problem at the time of this writing is balance. A game built around dinosaurs and humans should be hard to balance, but the previous Primal Carnage actually pulled it off and made a pretty balanced experience. This game, on the other hand, is not so. Fixed limits of tyrant class dinosaurs (the Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus) mean you can get the maximum 3 in a game when there are only three on each team, and tyrants can be a tough to kill if there is only one human per tyrant. The game's raptors are under-powered, while the Pterasaurs are rediculously overpowered. Many human weapons are underpowered and don't do the damage they should. On to non-balance problems, the big thing is match stability and fairness. First, matches will sometimes just randomly end in the middle, which can be quite annoying. Second, you choose your team at the beginning of every match of team-death-match, meaning that if you have a slower connection than others or are just slower to click, you can be stuck on the less-popular human team for many matches to come.\n\nThe thing is though, this is Early Access and the devs care and listen to players, so these problems should all be fixed relatively soon.\n\nOverall, it is a fun game if you can stay in a match and alive long enough to really play. Right now, I would rate it 6/10. However, once they fix the aforementioned balance and stability issues, I would easily rate the game higher, and even more so when they begin releasing new maps, dinosaurs, skins, and weapons.","December 6, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Animations are nice, could use a tiny bit more work.\n- Sound: Decent. Roooar! *T-REX*\n- Gameplay: A bit buggy, glitchy and laggy sometimes, needs some balancing, but extremly fun.\n- Support: Seems good, active and rapid development.\n- Wishlist: Native Linux support, more maps, dinos, weapons, game modes and last but not least; some vehicles would be nice too.\n\nRuns fine on Linux via vanilla Wine & Crossover. See here for more information: http://steamcommunity.com/app/321360/discussions/0/624076851154761778/\n\nVerdict: I like dinosaur games, I love the Jurassic Park series (looking forward to Jurassic World). This game is fun, but it also has a lot of unused potential, which could be worked on to improve even further. Highly recommended to dino-fans, recommended for everyone else. Tip: Buy the original Primal Carnage, get Extinction on 50% discount afterwards (deal ends on 28th of Feb. 2015)! Two games for the price of one.\n\nPS: Be sure to check out what the devs are working on and what they have planned for us here: https://trello.com/b/dqOgPeuk/extinction-roadmap","January 28, 2015","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The updates are not helping. As I stated before, it needs to be more focused on gameplay additions and fixes as well as pushing for final release of the game. Also it needs to be adding an actual timed leave penalty because someone didn't get the Dino team for a round even though the next round you're guaranteed the Dino team. Adding a time penalty before joining another server or rejoining will greatly reduce the dino hog issues and people leaving the server because they didn't get what they wanted. Yes this is proven to work. Just look at Guild Wars 2 dishonor system as an example which greatly fixed the player leaving problem.\n\nAlso the RP servers.....finally went into one. Never going back in. Special snowflakes everywhere. I RP in Guild Wars 2, and what I see in an RP server on this game was utterly disgraceful.\n\nAlso the game needs proper server distribution of population and less free roam BS. Seriously make the server setup much like Left 4 Dead 2. If they want to play TDM, have an algorithm will pick for them. This will consolidate players better so gameplay actually happens rather than 90% RP and Freeroam. If a player wants to RP or Freeroam, they can host their own server.\n\nI'm not even gonna go into the economic system now...\n\nI'm a diehard dinosaur lover and this game just make me further dissapointed. :/ I can't get behind it. Wonderful idea of a game, poorly executed now.\n\n********************************************************************\n\nVery awesome shooter. There really isn't anything like this game besides Team Fortress 2 and even then. It's a very original idea that should be supported and encouraged to continue. If I need to relax on a game, I head to this one over any other game.\n\nThe down side is that it does have massive bugs still, even with its (finally) beta release. It's worth the price, but they really should focus on balance and bugs rather than the economic system or skins right now. Crack down on those gameplay problems first before adding a large amount of features to the game. That'll retain players far more than just offering content.\n\nThe community is getting better, but there needs to be a better overhead on staff management of the game rather than community management. People aren't really trained to handle problems with others unless they have prior CSR experience. A good reporting system would be nice.\n\nAnother thing is to encourage more of the Team Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper games. Everything is all about Free Roam and Roleplay right now. As fun as those can be, it loses the fundamental part of what the game is and is advertised. It's dissapointing to try and find a decent TDM server that is not Contingency or Docks and usually see none.","December 17, 2015","true","91.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The updates are not helping. As I stated before, it needs to be more focused on gameplay additions and fixes as well as pushing for final release of the game. Also it needs to be adding an actual timed leave penalty because someone didn't get the Dino team for a round even though the next round you're guaranteed the Dino team. Adding a time penalty before joining another server or rejoining will greatly reduce the dino hog issues and people leaving the server because they didn't get what they wanted. Yes this is proven to work. Just look at Guild Wars 2 dishonor system as an example which greatly fixed the player leaving problem.\n\nAlso the RP servers.....finally went into one. Never going back in. Special snowflakes everywhere. I RP in Guild Wars 2, and what I see in an RP server on this game was utterly disgraceful.\n\nAlso the game needs proper server distribution of population and less free roam BS. Seriously make the server setup much like Left 4 Dead 2. If they want to play TDM, have an algorithm will pick for them. This will consolidate players better so gameplay actually happens rather than 90% RP and Freeroam. If a player wants to RP or Freeroam, they can host their own server.\n\nI'm not even gonna go into the economic system now...\n\nI'm a diehard dinosaur lover and this game just make me further dissapointed. :/ I can't get behind it. Wonderful idea of a game, poorly executed now.\n\n********************************************************************\n\nVery awesome shooter. There really isn't anything like this game besides Team Fortress 2 and even then. It's a very original idea that should be supported and encouraged to continue. If I need to relax on a game, I head to this one over any other game.\n\nThe down side is that it does have massive bugs still, even with its (finally) beta release. It's worth the price, but they really should focus on balance and bugs rather than the economic system or skins right now. Crack down on those gameplay problems first before adding a large amount of features to the game. That'll retain players far more than just offering content.\n\nThe community is getting better, but there needs to be a better overhead on staff management of the game rather than community management. People aren't really trained to handle problems with others unless they have prior CSR experience. A good reporting system would be nice.\n\nAnother thing is to encourage more of the Team Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper games. Everything is all about Free Roam and Roleplay right now. As fun as those can be, it loses the fundamental part of what the game is and is advertised. It's dissapointing to try and find a decent TDM server that is not Contingency or Docks and usually see none.","December 17, 2015","true","91.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Keep in mind I have 300+ hours on the original game and 80 on this one. Love the developers behind the game and the community that plays it, etc.\n\nHere's why PCE is better than the original PC:\n- Still has developers devoted to it.\n- Loadouts, DLC, gamemodes, and a new class.\n- Plenty of class and weapon choices.\n- It has an economy made up of skins and hats.\n\nHere's why it ain't:\n- Controls feel like PC did a metric ton of meth.\n- Seriously, the controls are worse than if I tried playing PC blindfolded, drunk, and hung upside down.\n- Some of the new mechanics I mentioned earlier don't make much a difference.\n- The diverse choices of classes and weapons are either fairly similar to one another or just lazily made.\n- Economy is a very bloated feature. There's plenty of it, but only a few good items belong in it. Not to mention humans get little-to-no-attention in DLC. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOUR MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE ECONOMY. Seriously, there's a big, big chance you'll be disappointed with what you don't get.\n- Servers aren't the best if you are out of the states/europe. Anywhere else in the world and your kinda burdened with lag.\n- While the map design is eye-candy in this game, they really aren't balanced.\n- Since release, the biggest content update is ANOTHER new Tyrant and a single gamemode containing only one map. The gamemode is fun for a while but does get repetitive and pointless after the first few minutes of playing it.\n- There's only going to be one more big update for a VERY long time as the developers are going to halt any development on the game to work on PS4 port.\n- Again, the controls. They're cringeworthy bad on the dinosaurs. A freaking human can circle-strife a raptor. Dilophosaurs can just barely sprint to catch a human.\n- Human hit-detection is pretty poor. Aiming feels sluggish.\n- The animations for humans and any other animations that aren't featured in the original game are pretty bad. The only good animations are recycled from an animator who has left the team.\n\n\nI really tried to like this game and I'm going to keep on trying because the majority seem to find this game good. I want to think the game is good since I did love the original and the devs who are making this game. Maybe I'm missing something but this game is probably one of the worst I own in my library.\n\nAs of 7/28/15, I suggest you don't buy this.","December 12, 2014","false","251.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The flame at the end of the pyro's flamesaw is EXTREMELY annoying and needs fixing.\nGraphics: Ugly: This touches on the AOEs a bit. The netgun can mis by miles and still "hit". The raptors can pounce over humans, yet still hit them. Tyrants will bite and somehow eat humans five feet away. The acro can not even bite the humans properly, and must be a few feet away.\n\nOverall score: 8/10\n\nAudio: Good: The audio genrally triggers on cue, and is quite good overall. You need to hear it in person to really tell, and I have only had one problem with it.\nAudio: Bad/Ugly: The only problem I have found is that when either a chainsawing pyro or a netted dino is killed, the sound will loop for a really, really long time.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10\n\nNPCs: Good: The dinosaur NPCs are fairly well made, and do not have those corners where they cant go. While still being balanced, they also pose a fair challenge\nNPCs: Bad: I have seen a bug many times where an NPC will go back the way it came, causing the round to be unwinnable and infinite until it comes back\nNPCs: Ugly: Too few NPCs. There is only really dilo, novaraptor, oviraptor, alpha raptor, huntraptor, and boss acro. There are not enough NPCs for the solo mode to be that fun, and this drags it down a lot.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nAdmins: Good: There are a few decent admins who kick the right people, not not many.\nAdmins:Bad: Most, as in 99% of the admins (espescially on freeroam servers) and kick people for no reason. I saw one kick someone for "writing in caps". He did not wright in caps and in fact the admin wrote in all caps.\nAdmins:Ugly: Pretty much the same as I said before, there abusiveness is getting out of hand, and fast, some become admin just to use admin commands. It needs to be stopped.\n\nOverall score: 2/10 (Yes I know this does not have anything to do with the game iself, just thought I might point it out)\n\nCommunity: Good:Most of the community consists of the nicest people, that will willingly help a new player out\nCommunity:Bad: Thought there all very few, there are the occasional turd going "Noob I will rek you all and win im the pro" and when they die "HACKER IM TELLING!", it is rare and thay never stay on for long.\nCommunity:Ugly: This brings me back to the abusive admins...\n\nOverall score: 9/10\n\nOther:Good: Runs on almost any computer. Genrally quite good gameplay.  Controls are easy to learn. Skin crafting is pretty good\nOther:Bad: Acro AOE, really needs fixing. Tyrants can grab you by sticking there head through the wall.\nOther:ugly: If you made it this far, good job! you get to hear the worst part of this game. The balancing. Dinos are much more powerful than humans in team deathmatch, and so many people are dino-hogs, triggering autobalance, and ruining the game for everyone.\n\nOverall game score: 7.5, good overall, but a few issues here and there that despreatly need fixing\n\nLast Note: If i missed anything, please leave in the coments!","December 16, 2015","true","238.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The autobalance in this game needs to be better or the team system goes back to the way it used to be because you have people that just sit at the team screen spamming dinosaur and never playing humans this caues fair players who actually play humans to rarely be able to play dinosaur because the human team has little to no players.\n\nThere are some bugs in this game especially with the pouncing. There have been instances where i have pounced on a human and its all going well but somehow the game says he shot me and that im dead. Another one is when you pounce on a traper there is a chance that you will get netted and the pounce will fail or you'll continue the pounce but once finished you will be stuck there netted.\n\nIf you can fix these faults you will have a good game but to make it great Lukewarm media will have to make a system in the game like leveling or something because the amount of players playing the game rises high at the release but after that it quickly drops soon losing all players.\n\nWith these faults the game is buggy but you will get occasional games that are very fun and because of these games i do recommend this game, especially to the people that are only in it for the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs are amazing!","July 9, 2015","true","43.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoGeek65/recommended/321360/","DinoGeek65","DinoGeek65","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DinoGeek65/","51 products in account","At first this game might just seem like a remake of primal carnage with a subtitle and some new skins, but dig deeper and you will find it has many new features and improvements over the original. One of the biggest changes is that humans now have a secondary gun option and have items which they can throw, which can help teamates or hurt dinos. The introduction of the acrocanthosaurus is something great that the original never had or is going to (probably), and is not just a different looking tyrant that does the exact same thing, all three tyrants have ups and downs. The spino has the most health but is the slowest, the t-rex is slightly faster than spino but has a bit less health, and the acro is the fastest but has the least health. There is also a new mode similar to call of dutys zombie mode, but with dinosaurs! It is called survival, and like its name suggests, you have to survive against many waves of dinosaurs, 20 to be exact. Wave 5 and 15 are specials waves, so far being a compy wave and hunter raptor waves. Wave 10 and 20 are boss waves, so far being a alpha novaraptor and acrocanthosaurus. There is only one map so far but more will be added in future, as well as more bosses. There are also a few new maps, and while I still think the original maps are best, they are nice additions to the game. The only problem i have with this game is that a lot of servers are roleplay servers, but there are still a good amount of team deathmatch and survival servers, but hardly any get to the chopper servers, which is a shame. Another problem i have with this game is that it has slightly worse optimization than the original, which is odd considering this had more time to improve its optimization, so people who could not run the original primal carnage very well will have even more trouble running this game, but im sure the devs will sort it out. So in conclusion if you were a fan of the original or just a dino fan in general, I would definitely reccomend this game :)\n\nEdit: Since the November 15th update optimization of this game has been improved dramatically, so even if you dont have a great pc or laptop, it should run just fine now. They have also added many new and interesting features to the game, which you can view on the community page","August 24, 2015","true","183.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

The flame at the end of the pyro's flamesaw is EXTREMELY annoying and needs fixing.\nGraphics: Ugly: This touches on the AOEs a bit. The netgun can mis by miles and still "hit". The raptors can pounce over humans, yet still hit them. Tyrants will bite and somehow eat humans five feet away. The acro can not even bite the humans properly, and must be a few feet away.\n\nOverall score: 8/10\n\nAudio: Good: The audio genrally triggers on cue, and is quite good overall. You need to hear it in person to really tell, and I have only had one problem with it.\nAudio: Bad/Ugly: The only problem I have found is that when either a chainsawing pyro or a netted dino is killed, the sound will loop for a really, really long time.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10\n\nNPCs: Good: The dinosaur NPCs are fairly well made, and do not have those corners where they cant go. While still being balanced, they also pose a fair challenge\nNPCs: Bad: I have seen a bug many times where an NPC will go back the way it came, causing the round to be unwinnable and infinite until it comes back\nNPCs: Ugly: Too few NPCs. There is only really dilo, novaraptor, oviraptor, alpha raptor, huntraptor, and boss acro. There are not enough NPCs for the solo mode to be that fun, and this drags it down a lot.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nAdmins: Good: There are a few decent admins who kick the right people, not not many.\nAdmins:Bad: Most, as in 99% of the admins (espescially on freeroam servers) and kick people for no reason. I saw one kick someone for "writing in caps". He did not wright in caps and in fact the admin wrote in all caps.\nAdmins:Ugly: Pretty much the same as I said before, there abusiveness is getting out of hand, and fast, some become admin just to use admin commands. It needs to be stopped.\n\nOverall score: 2/10 (Yes I know this does not have anything to do with the game iself, just thought I might point it out)\n\nCommunity: Good:Most of the community consists of the nicest people, that will willingly help a new player out\nCommunity:Bad: Thought there all very few, there are the occasional turd going "Noob I will rek you all and win im the pro" and when they die "HACKER IM TELLING!", it is rare and thay never stay on for long.\nCommunity:Ugly: This brings me back to the abusive admins...\n\nOverall score: 9/10\n\nOther:Good: Runs on almost any computer. Genrally quite good gameplay.  Controls are easy to learn. Skin crafting is pretty good\nOther:Bad: Acro AOE, really needs fixing. Tyrants can grab you by sticking there head through the wall.\nOther:ugly: If you made it this far, good job! you get to hear the worst part of this game. The balancing. Dinos are much more powerful than humans in team deathmatch, and so many people are dino-hogs, triggering autobalance, and ruining the game for everyone.\n\nOverall game score: 7.5, good overall, but a few issues here and there that despreatly need fixing\n\nLast Note: If i missed anything, please leave in the coments!","December 16, 2015","true","238.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pridagio/recommended/321360/","pridagio","Primitive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pridagio/","35 products in account","Redoing my review for the 3rd time now after playing the latest version of the game. Keep in mind I have 300+ hours on the original game and 80 on this one. Love the developers behind the game and the community that plays it, etc.\n\nHere's why PCE is better than the original PC:\n- Still has developers devoted to it.\n- Loadouts, DLC, gamemodes, and a new class.\n- Plenty of class and weapon choices.\n- It has an economy made up of skins and hats.\n\nHere's why it ain't:\n- Controls feel like PC did a metric ton of meth.\n- Seriously, the controls are worse than if I tried playing PC blindfolded, drunk, and hung upside down.\n- Some of the new mechanics I mentioned earlier don't make much a difference.\n- The diverse choices of classes and weapons are either fairly similar to one another or just lazily made.\n- Economy is a very bloated feature. There's plenty of it, but only a few good items belong in it. Not to mention humans get little-to-no-attention in DLC. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOUR MAINLY INTERESTED IN THE ECONOMY. Seriously, there's a big, big chance you'll be disappointed with what you don't get.\n- Servers aren't the best if you are out of the states/europe. Anywhere else in the world and your kinda burdened with lag.\n- While the map design is eye-candy in this game, they really aren't balanced.\n- Since release, the biggest content update is ANOTHER new Tyrant and a single gamemode containing only one map. The gamemode is fun for a while but does get repetitive and pointless after the first few minutes of playing it.\n- There's only going to be one more big update for a VERY long time as the developers are going to halt any development on the game to work on PS4 port.\n- Again, the controls. They're cringeworthy bad on the dinosaurs. A freaking human can circle-strife a raptor. Dilophosaurs can just barely sprint to catch a human.\n- Human hit-detection is pretty poor. Aiming feels sluggish.\n- The animations for humans and any other animations that aren't featured in the original game are pretty bad. The only good animations are recycled from an animator who has left the team.\n\n\nI really tried to like this game and I'm going to keep on trying because the majority seem to find this game good. I want to think the game is good since I did love the original and the devs who are making this game. Maybe I'm missing something but this game is probably one of the worst I own in my library.\n\nAs of 7/28/15, I suggest you don't buy this.","December 12, 2014","false","251.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The updates are not helping. As I stated before, it needs to be more focused on gameplay additions and fixes as well as pushing for final release of the game. Also it needs to be adding an actual timed leave penalty because someone didn't get the Dino team for a round even though the next round you're guaranteed the Dino team. Adding a time penalty before joining another server or rejoining will greatly reduce the dino hog issues and people leaving the server because they didn't get what they wanted. Yes this is proven to work. Just look at Guild Wars 2 dishonor system as an example which greatly fixed the player leaving problem.\n\nAlso the RP servers.....finally went into one. Never going back in. Special snowflakes everywhere. I RP in Guild Wars 2, and what I see in an RP server on this game was utterly disgraceful.\n\nAlso the game needs proper server distribution of population and less free roam BS. Seriously make the server setup much like Left 4 Dead 2. If they want to play TDM, have an algorithm will pick for them. This will consolidate players better so gameplay actually happens rather than 90% RP and Freeroam. If a player wants to RP or Freeroam, they can host their own server.\n\nI'm not even gonna go into the economic system now...\n\nI'm a diehard dinosaur lover and this game just make me further dissapointed. :/ I can't get behind it. Wonderful idea of a game, poorly executed now.\n\n********************************************************************\n\nVery awesome shooter. There really isn't anything like this game besides Team Fortress 2 and even then. It's a very original idea that should be supported and encouraged to continue. If I need to relax on a game, I head to this one over any other game.\n\nThe down side is that it does have massive bugs still, even with its (finally) beta release. It's worth the price, but they really should focus on balance and bugs rather than the economic system or skins right now. Crack down on those gameplay problems first before adding a large amount of features to the game. That'll retain players far more than just offering content.\n\nThe community is getting better, but there needs to be a better overhead on staff management of the game rather than community management. People aren't really trained to handle problems with others unless they have prior CSR experience. A good reporting system would be nice.\n\nAnother thing is to encourage more of the Team Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper games. Everything is all about Free Roam and Roleplay right now. As fun as those can be, it loses the fundamental part of what the game is and is advertised. It's dissapointing to try and find a decent TDM server that is not Contingency or Docks and usually see none.","December 17, 2015","true","91.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The flame at the end of the pyro's flamesaw is EXTREMELY annoying and needs fixing.\nGraphics: Ugly: This touches on the AOEs a bit. The netgun can mis by miles and still "hit". The raptors can pounce over humans, yet still hit them. Tyrants will bite and somehow eat humans five feet away. The acro can not even bite the humans properly, and must be a few feet away.\n\nOverall score: 8/10\n\nAudio: Good: The audio genrally triggers on cue, and is quite good overall. You need to hear it in person to really tell, and I have only had one problem with it.\nAudio: Bad/Ugly: The only problem I have found is that when either a chainsawing pyro or a netted dino is killed, the sound will loop for a really, really long time.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10\n\nNPCs: Good: The dinosaur NPCs are fairly well made, and do not have those corners where they cant go. While still being balanced, they also pose a fair challenge\nNPCs: Bad: I have seen a bug many times where an NPC will go back the way it came, causing the round to be unwinnable and infinite until it comes back\nNPCs: Ugly: Too few NPCs. There is only really dilo, novaraptor, oviraptor, alpha raptor, huntraptor, and boss acro. There are not enough NPCs for the solo mode to be that fun, and this drags it down a lot.\n\nOverall score: 6/10\n\nAdmins: Good: There are a few decent admins who kick the right people, not not many.\nAdmins:Bad: Most, as in 99% of the admins (espescially on freeroam servers) and kick people for no reason. I saw one kick someone for "writing in caps". He did not wright in caps and in fact the admin wrote in all caps.\nAdmins:Ugly: Pretty much the same as I said before, there abusiveness is getting out of hand, and fast, some become admin just to use admin commands. It needs to be stopped.\n\nOverall score: 2/10 (Yes I know this does not have anything to do with the game iself, just thought I might point it out)\n\nCommunity: Good:Most of the community consists of the nicest people, that will willingly help a new player out\nCommunity:Bad: Thought there all very few, there are the occasional turd going "Noob I will rek you all and win im the pro" and when they die "HACKER IM TELLING!", it is rare and thay never stay on for long.\nCommunity:Ugly: This brings me back to the abusive admins...\n\nOverall score: 9/10\n\nOther:Good: Runs on almost any computer. Genrally quite good gameplay.  Controls are easy to learn. Skin crafting is pretty good\nOther:Bad: Acro AOE, really needs fixing. Tyrants can grab you by sticking there head through the wall.\nOther:ugly: If you made it this far, good job! you get to hear the worst part of this game. The balancing. Dinos are much more powerful than humans in team deathmatch, and so many people are dino-hogs, triggering autobalance, and ruining the game for everyone.\n\nOverall game score: 7.5, good overall, but a few issues here and there that despreatly need fixing\n\nLast Note: If i missed anything, please leave in the coments!","December 16, 2015","true","238.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has beautiful graphics and sounds, lots of playtime, decent content, and it's quite addicting. The only problem I'd say you would have is the fact that the game consists of so many Freeroam and Roleplay servers than TeamDeathMatchl. Even still, it's not hard to find a TDM server with decent amount of people. Another problem is the game is a bit unbalanced as of now, but it's definetlely improved from what it was in the past.","January 6","true","144.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I know this game will get better, the developers are trying as hard as they can and I respect that. I will change my review once the problems are adressed.\n\nPROS:\n-Very visually pleasing, good graphics.\n-Nice variety of skins/workshop.\n-Maps are well made and overall very aesthetically pleasing.\n-Fun gameplay as both humans and dinosaurs.\n-Great developers who try their best to help the community.\n\nCONS:\n-The lack of TDM servers (Team deathmatch)\n-Overwhelming amounts of Free Roam/Role play servers.\n-Some of the maps seem to be unbalanced towards teams. Dinosaur/human advantages.\n-Loot and skins. I love the skins personally, but they're way too expensive on the market. (Up to 100$ USD)\n-Unbalanced classes.\nOne of the greatest things that I have a problem with is the repetitiveness. TDM is fun, but there's only about 2-5 of those open and the rest are free roam. I want to play hunt, gttc, or many other great gamemodes but usually there''s never any servers like that open or with people playing them.\n\nOverall: This game is great but also has it's downsides which weighs more than the pros. I still have high hopes.","June 5","false","256.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Glitches to go around and balance issues out the wazoo.\n\nHOWEVER, what it does right should also be considered; The Devs are very attentive, patches are plentyful, the community's (mostly) excellent, and almost everything that made the first game amazing is back and better. The few bits that aren't, will be in due time. Especially if they continue their current rythm.\n\nIn my opinion, it boils down to this; If you're alright with Early Access games, get it. If it's on sale, get it. If you owned the original and have the discount, get it. Otherwise, may want to hold on just a wee bit longer.","December 24, 2014","true","177.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Let's be honest - it's hard to make a multiplayer game nowadays, when most of people play free to play games or some rather popular online titles and totally ignore the lest known out. So, is this game worth anything? I guess it is. It's probably the best multiplayer game with dinosaurs. I mean, it's fun to play team deathmatch where one team is full of people and other one is made of dinos. It's rather active, not like more popular online games, but still have some playerbase so you can be sure there is always someone to play it together. Maps are fun, game is rather balanced. What's also important, it does have drop system like in CS:GO - which means, you can earn yourself a few cents while playing, or finding yourself a nice skin for your dinos or humans. Items don't make you any more powerful, those are just cosmetic stuff which is good thing. Also, there are new patches still coming out, so you don't get an abandoned game.\nIf you want to play something other than MOBA games or online shooters with "good" vs "bad" guys you should at least try Primal Carnage: Extinction. You can't miss it if you are fan of dinosaurs!","December 26, 2015","true","150.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clockytheowl/recommended/321360/","clockytheowl","[FECP] ClockyTheOwl✟✟","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clockytheowl/","15 products in account","Hello Steam Community!\n\nWell, I finally have enough hours to write a complete and truthful list of concerns for Primal Carnage: Extinction. While I like this game, it has some major issues that should be understood before anyone buys it. I will, then, endeavor to point out some of these issues. Please remember, I am no expert on games or media. I am an aspiring engineering student with a good vocabulary. These are only opinions, and are in no shape or form certain undeniable truths. We are not talking about “a priori” knowledge here. Please allow me to share my opinions, if I may be so bold. :)\n\nEconomy:\n\nI feel that this is a major issue for Primal Carnage: Extinction. As of now, there are skins and textures that sell for ridiculous prices upwards of 300 US dollars. While it can be certain that “legendary” economy items are exceedingly rare, they are simply not worth that sum of money. This is even more truthful when one considers the fact that the game itself has very few players online. In a few years, these high-priced visual items will be almost worthless. I assume that many people will wonder why they went to such an extent to obtain them when they could have spent their precious time and capital elsewhere.\n\nFurthermore, these skins do nothing to improve the game. Many individuals on this game associate high-priced skins with experience, status, or skill. The logical flaws in this sort of assumption are too great to even bother covering. I am an extremely good player myself, and not one of my skins exceeds $30 in value. Still, I have been literally ridiculed by other players for my lack of quote, “skinz”.\n\nDespite these various issues, the developers seem all too poised to continue their economy efforts. It can be certain that while they did issue many fixes, they maintained a major focus on skins and economy. In my view, the excessive and illogical pursuit of the economy system has dealt the game a serious blow.\n\nCommunity:\n\nLet it be known that Primal Carnage: Extinction has a very polarized player base.\n\nThere are incredible people on this game. Many are extremely helpful, logical, coherent, understanding, and friendly. There are some truly good administrators on this community that genuinely care about providing a quality experience for their players. (I like to think that I am one of these, but I cannot commend myself for that would be biased.) When a question is raised, they rush to answer and help. When a troublesome person is spotted, they enforce the rules as necessary.\n\nHowever, some individuals are absolute rubbish. They are rude, arrogant, disrespectful, conniving, and deceitful. I cannot even begin to list all of the scams and devious ploys I have witnessed. The nature of the “economy” -which I have previously talked about- brings out the worst in some people. It is not uncommon to see individuals begging, scamming, and deceiving in order to obtain items. In addition to this, the game seems to be infested with trolls. As an administrator of a server group, I have watched individuals purposefully attack and disrupt a server’s functionality. It appears as if these trolls literally want to be kicked. In their mind, they can effectively destroy a server by injecting themselves into the session and deliberately inciting a virtual riot against officials. The entire process is sad to watch, and really speaks towards the community’s immature and delinquent views.\n\nI have observed many players who are dissatisfied with the fact that there are very few “deathmatch” servers. Their complaints are valid, as there are rarely any competitive community servers. As an administrator, I can verify one reason why this is so. It is nearly impossible to control the rage, frustration, trolling, and delinquency that such game modes attract. It is likely –although I do not claim to hold tangible evidence for this- that administrators find it easier to host manageable games.\n\nTo be forthright, this community both inspires and repulses me at the same time.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe final and most important issue regarding Primal Carnage: Extinction has to do with gameplay.\n\nThere are rampant glitches and issues in this game. From dinosaurs to humans, many weapons and classes can become bugged to the point that they can no longer be effectively used. One good example of this is the raptor pounce attack. When a player changes class to anything besides a raptor, they run the risk of losing their pounce attack’s functionality. This is a horrible issue for competitive players who want to attack the enemy using a diverse strategy, because it limits their ability to change into a more suitable class during different situations.\n\nThe team balancing in the game is inferior. On any competitive “deathmatch” game, most players monopolize the dinosaur team resulting in unequal matches. This is dreadful for anyone who cares to master both human and dinosaur gameplay, because it makes the human team a bad choice for anyone. When a match does start out with teams that are in the correct proportions, players often switch to whichever team is currently doing well. In most cases, players will abandon the losing team and join the team that seems to be more secure. In truth, the option to “switch team” during a "deathmatch" round should be abolished.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile I like this game and some of its community, I feel that individuals should be aware of certain things. I do not profess to know exactly what is wrong with the game. I have simply provided a list of things that, in my experience, trouble the game. I keep an open mind, and I never attempt to imply that I understand everything about the community. I am only giving you my experiences. On a more positive note, I think that game is quite good aside from these flaws. The lighting is spectacular, and the graphics are very pleasing. I would give it a 6.8/10.\n","December 4, 2015","true","051.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The community can not be pleased.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gameplay that is fast paced and requires you to be aware of your surrounding\n-The different classes for dinosaurs provides vastly different gameplay experiences for each one\n-The human classes also differ between each other to make it fun to play as each since they are easy to learn\n-Some really good maps that benifit both humans and dinos\n-The developers are pretty easy to reach and communicate with the fans on a regular basis\n-The promise for more features added each month\n-Currently 4 different game modes with 2 more being added in the future\n-The steam workshop is availble which allows people to make their own maps and skins and potentially have to be put in the game\n\nCons:\n-80% of the servers are freeroam which is mostly people pretending to be dinos or just idling\n-People tend to hog the dinos\n-Loot prices can be extremly high for a "legendary" skin but its not really a negative if your not gonna spend money on them\n-Get to the chopper mode is rarely played\n-There can be some strange bugs and glitchs every so often\n-Only a handful of maps are used in servers with the test map used quite frequently for some reason\n-Certain hours of the day there are very few people online\n\nIm sure im forgetting some stuff but overall its a great game that is only getting better since the developers continue to support it.","March 13","true","158.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I like sandbox games more than I do FPS but, there are some I can make an acception for such as Call Of Duty Black Ops 2, Call Of Duty Advanced Warfare, and this amazing game. When I first heard about the first Primal Carnage I thought it was going to be Jurassic Park team deathmatch with badass dinosaurs. So when I created my steam account, I purchased both the 1st and 2nd Primal Carnage and, the first was ok, but the 2nd was AMAZING. The graphics were very beuatiful and the design of the dinosaurs were like the classics but with a new, highly original, twist. The T-rex, Spino, and Acrocanthosaurs, can feel over powered at times but with teamwork from the human team the game can be challenging for both sides. Playing with both teams can be really fun, but the dinosaurs are the best with ariel and terrestrial maneuvering. This is the FPS I play the most, and would recommend this to anyone who likes FPS games and is sick of just regular C.O.D. team deathmatch.","July 9, 2015","true","17.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I love to play on it and I even  joined a fun group (DLG) from the server DLG: Chill and Kill.\nIt is my favorite server and I recommend checking it out! I really love this game's simplistic yet modern HUD/GUI while playing both the dinosaur or human. I really only play as a dinosaur though. My best and favorite is the Novaraptor. The game itself is stable too. The maps are well made and beautiful but if you glitch out of them there are parts where its not decorated as much. The models are very well detailed and I love the animations too. The keys and controls are very simple as well. However, as a dinosaur, its harder for those who cannot multitask with the keyboard and mouse at the same time, I would guess same with the human (Refering to a friend of mine). But then again it does have controller support so that definitely is another option for the player. Also the humans can get OP if they all stick together, same with the raptors (mostly to my opinion). But overall, I definitely rate this game 5 stars. I love this game and love to see it grow too.\n\n~Diamond\n\n(P.S. This is my first review also)","February 24","true","165.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It could be good. It SHOULD be good!\nReally, dinosaurs, boys! Is there any child in the world that never dreamt about being, just for a moment, a dinosaur?\nWhet? So few... Oh. Okay, well, it's just me and a bunch of crazy people, then.\nBut, nope. It's "barely above not that bad and fairly under good".\n\nThe not-so-original concept, Team Fortress 2 with giant saurians, is pretty fun and the game has its own good points.\nYeah, I know, we can play dinosaurs... Will you stop with that, Little Boy Who Speaks In My Head? I'm trying to write a review, here! And don't y.... Sorry. Where was I? Oh yeah! The good points! Well, good action, good classes, not too bad graphics, multiple ways to play the game (there's roleplay, on some servers).\nSeems good, in my book! (Well, okay, some animations are kinda strange looking and stiff, but it's not that terrible.)\nBut the game is rigged with bugs, glitches, errors and the likes. From what I've read, the devs often promised patches and corrections, but the said where rushed (seemingly under the pressure of the fans) and created even more mess. This is bad. Really.\nSomething else? Yup. Balance. This word makes no sense in the dino-world. Humans are quite well balanced, with good capacities and weapons, but the dinosaurs... WOW!\nFor starters, dinosaurs are completely broken, especially the Tyrant class. Way overpowered. Or, well, it wouldn't be if a team of players could only choose ONE Tyrant per team, or that for one Tyrant, two slots are taken in the team roster. But no. Here, people (some say they are kids, and I believe them cause someone I killed in PVP told me, with a childish voice, to go have seks with my own mom) make full teams of T-rexes and go ayneuss-blasting on the poor humans that try real hard to survive.\nI know, the game is still in development and the players can give feedback.\nAbout that, what I found is not really good...\nDevs rarely answer REAL questions. Ask about the new skins, you'll have an answer. Ask about the patching of a game-breaking bug, and you will have naught, except dozens of fanboys falling on your back as a swarm of romani people when you draw money from a cash-machine. (sheisse-storm in 3...2...1...)\nI don't know if it's the hard and complete truth, but I read that kind of things quite often.\n\nIn the current state of the game, I would not recommend it. But, who knows, it could get better.\nOnly time will tell.","February 14","false","38.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

It is essentually the same game but with a massive overhual of the maps and some different machanics for the dinosaurs. It looks stunning compared to the old game and some dinosoars now require a little more skill to use.\nThere are micro-transactions, but they are purely cosmetic, no pay to win here, and they recently made the skins marketable, making them much more accessible to everyone.\nWith the promise of new dinosaur classes coming to the game I hope this game will continue to be updated as I personally greatly enjoy it and find it an improvement over the old game.","March 17, 2015","true","216.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There are many modes to choose from such as, FreeRoam, Dino vs Dino, Team Deathmatch, Role Play, (GTTC) Get to the Chopper, and many more. It's a large vas world with many maps and wonder graphics. Mechanics are great but could use a little improving, but i assume once released to full version this will all be fixed. The game also features a Loot system which allows players to attain items in the game to customize there appearance.

For ♥♥♥♥ sakes, this game is not a game anymore. It's a total waste of $19.99, or the regional equivalent. I've been holding off on making a review of this game primarilly because I share the opinions of most people who were veterans of the first game, and for the fact that I had made a review of the first game explaining a bit why the original game was much more worth the asking price, but I never went into true detail about just how bad this game has become, but the bottom line is this;\n\nDo. Not. Pay. For. This. Game. In it's current state, it is quite possibly one of the best game concepts I've ever seen turn sour so quickly. If you want a real Dinosaur VS Human shooter, go buy the first game. While it may have animations that are less smooth and slightly dated graphics, it is much better than this pile of filth. So, let me go into detail about the worst aspects of the game, and maybe outline what is wrong and how it can be fixed. As much I dislike this game as it currently stands, I still do have hope that the devs might just get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix this broken gem so as to bring us a better game. Regardless, let's just dive right in.\n\nIssue #1 - Roleplay/Freeroam Servers\n\nOkay, this little gem is arguably the first or second worst smegma that has come upon the Primal Carnage community. It started in the original Primal Carnage, and it has just never stop. It has essentially snow balled into an enormous pimple on the ♥♥♥ of the Primal Carnage community. The game sells you an image of a shooter with a rather unique concept behind it on the steam page, but when you actually play the game, MAYBE one out of twenty servers is in fact a TDM/GTTC server. In the original Primal Carnage, it started with Dr. MPQC's Roleplay server. Now, I don't blame him for starting this entire plague of RP, but I'm not sure he knew what his server would spawn. From the few conversations I've had with MPQC, he isn't a bad guy. He still currently operates an RP server in PC:E, and it'd be ALMOST insignificant if so many others hadn't followed in his foot steps by making their own RP servers to the point where it's just everywhere. These servers are just plain disgusting to have spawned out of a competitive shooter, but I digress. It's not hard to imagine these servers spawning in the first place when you look back on it, seeing as how Primal Carnage was one of the more prominent games that actually allowed you to play as Dinosaurs, so, naturally, many Dinosaur fans, unlike myself and most others who actually bought the game, prefered to play a Tyrannosaurus just walking aimlessly around the map roaring at other dinosaurs rather than tanking in a TDM server, as there really was no dinosaur game before that allowed you to do such a thing, but regardless, it's nearly impossible to stop now, even with other games like The Isle surfacing on steam with a similar concept with a hardcore survival game twist to it.\n\nPossible Solution\n\nI don't expect any of the community to make changes, as the RPers out number the players who bought the game for it's intended use ten fold. I don't expect the problem to stop at this point, it is simply just to big, but there are ways that it could be, say, made into a game of itself specifically designed for the Weeaboos/Furries that frequent the servers. The only possible solution at this point would be the devs stepping in. Part of the reason that the "Freeroam" game mode even exists in PC:E is because of how much roleplay servers erupted in the original Primal Carnage. At the very least, they could remove the Freeroam gamemode and shut down RP servers. At the most, they could make a second open world RP based game that quenches the RPers thirst so as to keep the two player bases separate. Just a thought. Basically nothing can be done at this point, even my suggestions I just typed probably won't work in the long run, but it's worth a shot.\n\nIssue #2 - Balancing\n\nEven if you DO manage to find a server that you can join and isn't an RP server, you still need to look out for one more obstacle. Dino hogs. Unlike the old Primal Carnage, which wouldn't let you join the Dinosaur team if the Human team had too little players, Primal Carnage does nothing of the sort. The only balancing mechanic is the occasional auto-balance, which randomly switches players around the teams. However, you're able to just leave and re join as a Dinosaur even after the auto-balance. It's completely insignificant as a mechanic. The worst of the Dino hogs are the Tyrant hogs, which are basically kids who use no other Dinosaur but the Tyrants, and even then, they can't play for ♥♥♥♥. It's sad AND annoying.\n\nPossible Solution\n\nAgain, this is a problem that only the devs can fix. The balancing mechanics of the last game need to be included here or else this game will never match the original.\n\nIssue #3 - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Steam Market and a Cancerous Community\n\nPC:E intregrates a new trading system similar to the systems in DOTA 2 and CS:GO. While some of the skins look cool, it leads to dumb ♥♥♥♥ kids flaunting a rare or legendary skin that they got from a crate from one of the six keys their parents would buy them. The community of PC:E is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and trolls. In Primal Carnage, the only skins that existed were part of DLC packs that were sold from the steam page, not the steam market. With the new market system, some skins on Primal Carnage go for hundreds of dollars when they come out just because the demand is so high, meaning that the players who wish to sell these skins can name their price. These kinds of skins lead to boasting and even making fun of other players for playing any of the original DLC skins. I myself encountered an eight year old on a TDM server who would not shut the ♥♥♥♥ up that I had chosen the default skin before entering the game. Regardless, the community is filled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and I don't know how it even got this bad.\n\nPossible Solution\n\nThe devs can only fix this problem to a point. They'd make more money anyway if they would just switch back to the system of manufacturing skin packs rather than having an enormous trading system like there is now.\n\nFinal Verdict - 2/10, Better graphics and smoother animations than the original don't make up for the enormous problems that this game is riddled with. The original is a much better choice and much more worth the asking price.","April 14","false","191.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","2"

I honestly had high hopes for this game, but it has left me thoroughly dissappointed. The playerbase has shrunk dramatically, and there are hardly enough servers to play Team Deathmatch or Get to the Chopper. Game updates are far and few between, the community is very hostile, and gameplay and balance is much to be desired. And how is it that the animations and grahpics from the old game are better than this one?

The server list is being overun by FR or RP servers. I miss gttc and tdm!!\n\n#3.

After content update 1, this section will probably be removed.\n\nWhile before I said this game was buggy and unbalanced (although still recommended it), Patch 0.9EA fixed the game, and was backed up by patch 1.0.0. It's now brilliant. Soon, we get Acrocanthosaurus, AI, and new weapons. But let's not judge the game on what it will be.\n\nThis game, in its current state, is better than ever before. The original game's current state is nothing in comparison. While a couple of classes have issues, it's a fun, balanced experience. While this game is very similar to the original, it is more balanced, and has an extra amount of content, with more coming.\n\nA problem is, that a lot of the negative reviews give out lies, but are still said to be "helpful" here's the truth:\n\nSome people complain about lag. There are system requirements on the store page for a reason. If you meet them, and it still lags, then change your settings. It's amazing how many people complain about the lag but have never changed their settings. Ignore the lag reviews. And the people who complain about graphics are the guys who have had to change their settings down...\n\nThe reviews that talk about the game basically being the old one with a loot system are right. There is a reason for this. During early access, the devs wanted to get the game balanced. Now that EA has ended, new content is coming...\n\nThere is also a valid reason why this had to be a new game. Circle 5 had no control over Lukewarm Media's game, and therefore there had to be a new game.\n\nDon't believe the lies that some negative reviews tell you, this is the truth, and there is evidence on PC:E's official website at primalcarnage.com\n\nThere are some cons about this game, but the good outways the bad here:\n\nThis game is NOT, and I repeat, NOT about the loot. Some people seem to think it is, but they're wrong. The level of enjoyment would be just as good without the loot system. If you buy this game, just to make money from it, or to collect skins, you're doing it wrong. Play the game for the fun of it.\nSadly some people use bots to get loot, and it can ruin the experience. They will be banned from servers eventually.\n\nWhile some of the community can be childish, and rude,  generally the communtiy is nice, and you just have to ignore the bad people. The game is still fun with these people, but every game will have some.\n\nIf you can, host a server. There are places in this world that don't have any good servers, and you can help with it. Europe is lacking in servers, and so is Austrialia. Although, you can still have fun if you live in one of these countries, it would be nice if there were more servers (official would be best) all around the world.\n\nPros:\nFrequent Patches\nDevs who listen\nFun*\nAlmost prefectly balanced.\nCons:\nCommunity can be childish\nNot every country has a good server.\n\n*Depends on your definition of "Fun"\n\nGet the game if you want, but be warned about the cons. I recommend you buy it now, if you like Dinosaurs or FPS games, but wait until there is more content otherwise.","December 4, 2014","true","377.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The comminuty needs to be focused on gameplay and not just some look for your raptor.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the team deathmatch. in my opinion, its very unfair to both sides. The tyrants (Rex, Spino, and Acro) NEED to be nerfed or be limited to one at a time, they have insanely high health and are almost impossible to kill when there is healing for the dinos.\n\nThe thing about humans, OH ITS UNFAIR ALRIGHT! The people on the human team usually camp with friends near health and ammo boxes, it really gets on my nerves when i'm a raptor and i keep getting killed because i cant get to a corner in tine.\n\nI honestly think that team deathmatch needs to be improved greatly, but it is the core of the series and it is amazing for what it is now.\n\nSecond, lets talk about free roam. I absolutely see no purpose for this mode, you just walk around and look at stuff. i hate free roam, it has no purpose.\n\nThird, Get to the chopper. I feel that this gamemode would be amazing! if the community actually game the gamemode attention. it has potential but nobody plays it so my opinion of this mode is that it gets no attention even though it is really great for a gamemode.\n\nFourth and finally, Roleplay. DISCLAIMER, i love roleplay so i might give this mode a little bit more love than the others)\n\nRoleplay servers have amazing people but it gets too much hate. I honestly think if you like having dinos talk to eachother, than this is your mode.\n\nI dont know why it gets too much hate, it is fun to do if you are bored and want dinos to do their own thing as if you were a dino. the people on the roleplay servers are AMAZING and really kind, they let you join their rp most of the time and are just plain awesome.\n\nI think the game needs alot of fixing but if you exclude that, it can be a great game depending on what kind of person you are. it isnt as great as the original. i honestly love the game and the rp world of it. TDM is fun to play as it is the core of the series.\n\nTHIS IS MY OPINION.\n\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","518.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","1"

Primal Carnage Extincion however is not really like the first one.\nThe gameplay is incredibly unbalanced, while everyone tries to pick Dinosaur in the beginning of a round you're stuck with always playing Human, which wouldn't be as bad if human wouldn't be incredibly hard to play. Dinosaurs are clearly more powerful and all the balance that you could feel in Primal Carnage doesn't seem to be there anymore.\n\nSure, if you know how to play human right, you can get a lot of kills, but dinosaurs don't require this learning period that humans do.\n\nOne thing that also bothers me is that the Teamswitch at the end of the round like in Primal Carnage doesn't exist anymore. It just switches to the next map which leads you back to the "click Dinosaur as fast as possible"\nDuring everyone wanting to play dinosaur you'll also get autobalance quite often and have teams of 9 Dinos and 7 humans.\n\nKnowing how to play the game makes up for a lot of stuff, but not everything. While it can be incredibly fun to just knife Raptors to Death as a Trapper or Shoot Pteranodons out of the Sky as Scientist, it is also very fun to play as a Dinosaur, with their different abilities. Though it requires some learning time and good nerves!\n\nOverall it is a fun game, I would however recommend the original Primal Carnage for people who want a balanced competetive game.\nFor everyone who doesn't care about that stuff this game also has a big Roleplay community, Skins and better graphics than the first game. For people who like Dinosaurs and like to just look at them and chill out, walk around and chat with other people this game could be for you.","December 25, 2015","false","16.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","1"

The large dinosaurs are more like sitting ducks, and the raptor pounce is much more clunky to use. The humans' move speed is frankly much too high, in the original, being caught alone as a human meant certain doom, but now any human can 1v1 a trex if they just strafe in circles.\n\nEven after a year of early access, the game still has crippling bugs. More than once I have been spawned under the map. Large dinosaurs frequrently get completely stuck on objects, and Ive even had a few hard crashes.\n\nHopefully these issues can be ironed out in the coming weeks, but at the time of writing this review, I cannot recommend  this to anyone who isnt a major dinosaur lover.","April 16, 2015","false","5.3"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

I'm glad we were finally able to move on and revamp the game from scratch.\n\nHaving been on the Beta QA team for the last 5 months, I've seen PC:E evolve from a hilarious playground of bugs into something that's starting to feel as fast-paced and competitive as the original. And with a team of experienced and hard-working developers on the case, things are looking very bright for 2015.\n\nFinally, a word out to all those immature kiddies on the forums who made us laugh and cry with their impatience, conspiracy theories, and downright terrible attitudes.

So if you want my honest and lengthy opinion please check out the document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jpjFqwBNRJrJIZn6Jptcv3sMz-fSp_wbIWChqIm6L9U/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAbridged version\n\nVisuals, Models, Animations and Level DesignPretty game with detailed models and interesting level design, however lacking any newer content and mostly recycles assets from the first game with little innovation invested.\n\nGameplayGameplay is straight forward and to the point just as the first game however can feel worse in various areas.\n\nArchosaurs feel worse in terms of movement, weight, and attacks in comparison to the first game but is the most enjoyable section of the game\n\nHumans are more underwhelming than ever with very little weight or impact in their guns and players will get quickly bored of their repetitive and imbalanced game play.\n\nThe game's performance can be solid at points however game play is bugged with stuttering issues in mid-combat, health stations not working, bugged sounds, animations, soundtrack, and spawning issues.\n\nGameModesGame comes with four total game modes\n\nDeath Match-most commonly played\nGet to the Chopper-least commonly played but can be very entertaining\nFree roam (Role play)-3D dino chat for kids\nSurvival- Cod Zombies but with dinosaurs and more dumb AI than Orion Prelude\n\nMarketThe most innovation placed into the game however is flawed with its recycling and recoloring of older skins from the first game.\n\nVerdictLacking in terms of actual new content, the constant use of recycling old assets, and bugged and imbalanced game play. Extinction disappoints me more than it impresses. The most I can recommend for this is to wait for it to go on sale for less than $10.\n\nOnce again this is my more abridged version of my review, I go much more in depth with the game in my document so please check that out for more pointers and fair statements regarding the game.","April 10, 2015","false","105.9"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","0"

I'm really not sure where to begin, but how about I start with the bugs. Not too bad, especially considering its in early access, nothing paritcularly game breaking or anything. How about the game itself? Well, it is extremely hard for me to find a game that can entertain me, and this game is one of those that don't entertain me for long periods of time, but thats not why I'm even downvoting it. I'm downvoting it because of the loot system, for the most part. Look at the server list, and you'll see a barren wasteland of empty TDM and GTTC servers except for remote and sparsely populated ones, and then absolutely BOOMING loot servers that are 100% full.\nDevs, you know you have a problem when your players care about the loot and not the gameplay. It also doesnt help when it seems half-broken aswell, getting the same sandstorm ptera SIX times in a row and getting no alphas. Not even  one rare after about 20 crates, has happened to someone, who then had to resort to buying them off the steam market in order to get anything half-way decent. Also, Im one of those people who don't have a job quite yet, and the fact that the only way to open crates is to BUY keys. I have to ask my previously mentioned friend for money whenever I get a crate, hanging on to that glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I'll get a good skin. In case you're wondering, I only got one skin, atleast  until my friend had to trade a bunch of extras she had to me, then I got one, maybe 2 others that I already got from her. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones of course. I have seen very few if any new players that didn't have the original one, and to be frank, the gameplay is a bit lackluster.\nThe graphics are pretty good, but honestly who cares about that?  I don't think they should drop the loot system, just... change it in some way that I'm not entirely sure about. Maybe tweak the drop rates and make it so you don't have to buy keys, but instead drop them like crates? That would help with the younger people who dont have any money. Anyways, I just want you to know that I myself had the original game, and got it after hearing about it through youtube, and I just fell in love with the idea. There were times I really enjoyed it, too. But this game just isn't the same. I want the game to succeed, but its not going to at this rate.\nSorry for the rant, this is my first review, but I just felt strongly about this. I loved the original, but the loot system and what seems like almost corporate greed and just the gameplay itself just doesnt do it for me. I wouldn't recommend the game in its current state, especially when all the players care only about getting loot. I hope the devs realize what's happening and take steps in the right direction, get the sequel on its feet, but until then, Browse with caution.\n\nEdited by ~LS~ Spot_ON.

As a huge fan of the first and man hundreds of hours or gameplay on it, I am a bit sadden on the quality of the new game. I am not a fan of the slow moving dino heads and head bobbing. Also the graphics are hazy and the over all apperence is less sharp then the first. I am hoping this is just because its still in beta and things will get better. Other then that I love the new maps and the dino skins. Thank you for the Free Roam.

Primal Carnage is a fast-paced first-person shooter or action-packed third person offensive game. Basically, it's a deathmatch of dinos and humans. Both teams are equally strong in this game, but most people prefer the dinos, obviously. The difference of the graphics and maps are so stunning compared to the orignal game. I LOVE THIS GAME.

Not because the game is perfect but because of two things:\n\n1. Future of the game\n2. Net Worth (what you're paying and what you get.)\n\nMy previous review was completely against the game. As we know reviews can change with time, so here's the game's current status as it's been updated!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrimal Carnage is a classic game with tons of originality. Many consider it the birth place and best place for humans vs dinosaur gameplay triumphing over Dino D-Day. Now, there are two versions of this game.\n\n1. Classic ol Primal Carnage\n2. Primal Carnage Extinction\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClassic Primal Carnage arguably is what got the game into buisiness, it is the core that lead up to Primal Carnage Extinction's popularity.\n\nI typed up a 4 page explanation before my browser crashed, so I'll sum it up.Cons first, then pros at the ending of the review:Still Tons of skins,\n\n(occasional) Unprofessional ugly skins\n\nHUGE 2 YEAR FLoFF DRAMA,\n(See here parents, as a reviewer I must warn there are confirmed cases of sexual harassment, and a lot of them: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FLoFF )\n\nThe internet isn't always safe! Primal fails to adress the bloody issue for 2 years. During this time growing hatred towards a specific individual has taken place, IT'S MASSIVE. (About 45 and growing extremists) Steam landed him a 15 week ban proving primal is slow to respond.\nGood skins cost $400 or more and almost ALL (that are sought out for) are feathered novaraptors,\n\nDevelopers can have a tenancy for arguing with fan base suggestions.\n\nPromised content has delays\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWidely Agreed Con\nNow the PS4 gets all skins free with achievements! (this thread got taken down due to trolls, the thread removing instead of troll banning is netorious. It causes a lack of communication and may be responsible for devs ripping players off before an agreement can be made http://steamcommunity.com/app/321360/discussions/6/490121928350801031/#p1 ).... pc players are literally told "Just because ps4 works that way doesn't mean we're not working on our computer version's economy!"\n\n....\n\nPeople have paid $500 for skins already, Circle 5, and now PS4 gets them all free?... doesn't matter if you're "fixing" the current economy (Just making it less-unfair lol) IT IS TOO LATE you've ripped them off.\nPRO'S\nThe game has released a patch which optimized the game to an acceptable level. The game actually is fun and has operating killing servers now! The core mechanics are mostly fixed and teams better balanced. The current fan base is very very pleased with the results.\n\nIf you do buy I suggest joining groups like BoBo, NRiTH, DLG, or SiNG. They are highly organized groups with servers and plan EVENTS.\n\nThese events are spectacular and really bring the community together.\n\nDLG's Dino fight night (Players play as dinosaurs in a 1 v 1 battle. Takes place in an arena and the winner of the tournement earns player of the week! Or have your team fight rexes as boss fights. All this while being surrounded by raptors, ptras, and dilos watching you fight in an arena with a jam packed server)\n\nSiNG also has events! It's a little more mixed but very well structured and creative, (they guarantee proper treatment, admins on server at all times, orginization and own set of activities)\n\nThen BoBo has classic killing human vs dinosaur, done well. GO BOBO!! WHEEEW\nThe actual game without these groups? It wouldn't exist nearly as much.\nGroup links:\n\nSiNG: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SerenityinNightmaresGarden\n\nDLG: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DinoswithLazerGuns\n\nBoBo:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/BrotherhoodOfTheBlackOvi\n\nNRITH: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/raptorsintophats","October 19, 2015","true","220.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","33"

Primal Carnage is a fast-paced first-person shooter or action-packed third person offensive game. Basically, it's a deathmatch of dinos and humans. Both teams are equally strong in this game, but most people prefer the dinos, obviously. The difference of the graphics and maps are so stunning compared to the orignal game. I LOVE THIS GAME.

And oh boy is it fun, this game really can be quite fun and challenging with different classes on both teams both human and dinosaur, (personally i love being a raptor and slashing the hell out of people). and to add a sense of uniqueness to players there are many different wearable items and character skins to aquire, you get these from drops during a round, either in crates or you get the skin or weapons etc as is during the round. If you're lukcy enough to get a skin as is during a drop then good on ya! :D otherwise you get crates which can give you a number of things. Here's the catch with crates though... you gotta pay real money for keys to open these crates -_- oh joy! not.... especially considering the crates give random things so you may not get what you want even though you payed real money to get it.... ugh. And game wise i've found this was the second release to the original game Primal Carnage, apparently this was supposed to be an update to that game but instead they made it a seperate game and made us players re-pay for a different yet.. no so different version of the same bloody game we already had. WOAH cheeky much devs?! However aside from all that annoying stuff the gameplay itself is pretty decent and i get a satisfactable amount of enjoyment out of it. I think alot of gamers would like this game, however like many online games there are a few trolls or quite plainly rude idiots but we tend to shut them up or ignore them i mean just enjoy the game guys stop ruining it for us actual gamers who want to enjoy ourselves xD. Would i recommend this? well to people who like the idea of shooting dinosaurs or being a dinosaur and attacking people or things around those ideas lol then absolutely, if you are someone who doesn't like paying for little things that probably will cause more money spent on the transaction itself then.... probably no you wouldn't want this game. Oh but you can trade on steam so if you have generous friends then it probably will be easy for you to get the stuff you want. So pretty much all and all absolutely yes i recommend this to other players :D This game is incredibly fun for me and as time goes by it'll get better and better when the devs add more and more gameplay ideas and classes, etc. Lets hope they all won't cost stuff lol, i hope this review has helped interested and intrigued gamers about getting this or learning about the game.","August 7, 2015","true","127.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

There are so many negative reviews about this game, and I don't really understand why. I do know the balancing is bad, but I've been a dinosaur more than I was being a human. Being a human is fun too, especially when the T-Rexes, Spinos and Acros try to get you when you are hidden and it is impossible for them to get you. xD This game is addicting and I reccomend it to anyone that likes dinosaur games. Most people complain about lag but I have a laptop that does not meet the minimum requirements and I usually get 40 fps. Tip: If you get not much fps, just search up 'How to get better FPS'. That is what I did and I got from 20 to around 30-40. c; I shall not advertise here about programs that I use to get better FPS so if yer interested, just PM me. Alright. Let's end this.\nPros:\nGood graphics.\nEasy controls.\nSo much fun.\nVery addicting.\nFunny community.\nAwesome dinos you can choose.\nCool human classes.\nNot that laggy.

Well first off if you are new to Primal Carnage I would definitly recommend this game. The gameplay is enjoyable and It draws an incredible picture of how dinosaurs and humans would fight in an arena. I would warn you though the game is early access and does have its ups and downs such lag (which I have not experienced) and other things usually found in typical early access games.\n\nIf you are a dinosaur enthusiast who also likes first person shooters this game will give you quite a bit of satisfaction. While the price is high I will say that the devs are very vocal and do speak to the community on a regular basis. This does not mean that their are patches coming out constantly, but it does mean they listen to the community.\n\nTo Summarize:\nPros:\n-Was one of the first games that allowed you to play as a dinosaur.\n-Decent balance that is contantly being tuned.\n-Decent graphics.\n-Many maps to choose from.\n-Dedicated Servers.\n-A loyal community.\n-For now at least they are releasing updates and a very steady pace.\n-Will be part of the steam community market and will allow cosmetic skin drops.\n\nCons:\n-Some say the game is very laggy, this may be true on lower end machines.\n-Some of the controls can seem a bit awkward on the dinosaurs at first.\n-Some issues with balance between Dinosaurs and Humans, however I am sure these will be ironed out.\n\nAll in all I recommend this game for all to enjoy.","December 19, 2014","true","21.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/figtree1/recommended/321360/","figtree1","Figtree","http://steamcommunity.com/id/figtree1/","23 products in account","Pros:\n\nThis is a great shooter and feels a lot more polished than the original Primal Carnage. The maps have been expanded, new weapons added and the character selection screen improved. There is also more scope for customisation. I have had a lot of fun playing it and all things considered I would recommend it.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a need for more servers; unless you want to play in no kill/ roleplay mode, there's not much choice, maybe 2 servers that aren't empty.\n\nThe tranq rifle is one of two weapons available to the sniper class. It is however banned in most servers. You kind of feel like a kid in a playground being told off when an admin gives you a warning in the chat window. If you do not stop using the weapon you will be kicked from the server. Apparently this is because players have complained of motion sickness after being shot. In a game where the dino players have an advantage over the human players this makes the teams even more unequally matched. You could just as validly claim that the jumping raptors give you motion sickness.","August 1, 2015","true","217.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

I have no clue on what others may think but... here goes nothing.\n\nFrom my point of view, this game is fairly interesting~ that's if you want to kill but... however, there is a problem... there's not many TDM matches nor DDM matches. It's mainly Freeroam, Freeroam, and more Freeroam. So if you want to try to find a good TDM or DDM Server. Good luck, also... there's a thing called dino hogging and human hogging, in which is quite annoying as the other player cannot have a chance to be a dino/human. From one round to the next, dino/human constantly~ non-stop, sadly. Then you get those players who are fairly quite rude, they'd love to insult people over the stupidest of reasons. Sorry... but it is true. When you try to RP you see those mate beggars, skin beggars, and literally... -mating- RP's. It's natural and all but... seriously, some kiddo's play this game and it's rather not good to teach them -too- early. Think about the generations. q3q Also... there's some people who would love to assume some people are hackers when people who cheat can most likely get VAC banned easily if the system detects something on your computer that gives an unfair advantage. Lots of kiddo's on here... so be safe. Don't expect a surprise if one of them rage at ya'. xD Anyhow... the loot system. Uhh... where to start? Darn! The loot system itself gives really crappy items time to times, but sometimes if you're lucky you'll get a good item that you don't have-- yet. Considering I'm a Server Owner and quite lazy to do more typing in this review. I'd say PC:E is overall good if you wish to chill or release your stress unless an ignorant person comes in... just saying.","March 28","true","249.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","11"

But this game's custumization is the one I hate the most. This game costs $20, but the problem is that you still gotta buy stuff for custumization instead of just earning it in game like it supposed to be because it is a priced game. Another problem are the people, but this isn't much of a problem because it's the game's fault that about 80% plays Free Roam instead of Team Death Match which makes the game boring if you're like me who want's action.","May 22","false","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Aside from numerous balance issues, bugs, exploits, and unfinished maps, the game has become nothing more than an economy simulator/fashion show. Most people only play this game to get skins and show them off, or sell them on the marketplace for money. Alone, this is not a bad thing, but that is the ONLY purpose for this game now. Most normal play servers are empty. What you're left with are no kill RP servers, freeroam servers where you can have people who are upset that you're killing each other on it, servers that put limits on elements of gameplay (like no rexes, raptor pounces, etc), and loot servers specifically designed for people to gind for drops. the way the drop system works is that, at the end of a match, everyone has a chance to get somethng. the longer you play, the greater your chances. Problem is, you don't have to "play" to get something. You can sit idle on a server for long periods and still have a chance to get something. To top that off, there is a persistent bug that prevents some people from getting drops in the first place. In my opinion, the drops aren't worth the time or money people put into them. the rediculously rare alpha skins are "OK", but everything else is more like an existing skin with different saturation levels. It just screams "lazy" on the developer's part. Aside from skins for the dinos, you can also get recolored weapons for the humans which you can barely see most of the time. The most common drop appears to be dino/human crates. To open these you have to buy keys from the game's store. The amount you pay varies on your region and currency, but still feel too expensive. Worst part is, it's all a gamble. You will more than likely get duplicates of a common skin before you get anything remotely interesting. People have reported spending upwards to $200 on keys only to not have a single rare drop. I do not recommend this game. Maybe things will change, but I highly doubt it.","January 27, 2015","false","64.3"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","18","37","4","0"

What tearned out to be well "a load of poo poo". So not the best start. But they promised that all existing owners would get a discount, so I decided that my 400 hours on the original Primal will not go to waste. So I got this game and excitedly installed it, I could not wait. But after 30 minutes of playing it. Well dayum...  What happened man D:   The game was buggy, the graphics I felt where worst then before (I know graphics dont make a game, but it helps). I did try to get into it but the glitches where to bad. The Game literally crashed more then the carnos. At this point I decided to never touch it again.\n\nSo after a year, I was feeling brave, my heart full of forgivence, maybe I was being to hard on this game, I noticed other people playing it, so surely there was something to it right? And I found out there was a whole new system to get items as rewards, then I realised it required money, what I feel is a bit of a scam, but I was not discouraged, I must ride on!\n\nAfter a little while of playing I see they have fixed many of the original glitches, but... I dont think that counts for much when you replace them with a whole bunch of new glitches. But you know, I thaught that maybe instead of playing this competively, maybe its more of a game for just a laugh with a bunch of friends. So I decided to try join my friend in the game they where on. And at this point of me riding ever deeper, I feel my horse must have snapped its leg because here it went all wrong.\n\nJust by trying to join a game, the whole game crashed, I was not able to window out of it, even the legendery "Ctrl, Alt, Delete"  had failed me! In the end I had to resort to turning off my pc by the switch, whats the ultimate Taboo in the land of Pc. After this I had problems even getting my pc back on, what I can't entirely blame on the game.. but I havent ever had that problem with any other games soo....\n\nAnyway here is where my Adventure ended, at this point my "nope" levels where to dangerously high and I had no choice but to remove the game from steam. Maybe one day I will try the game again, but its gonna take a lot of convincing for me to even install it again now.\n\nAs for a rating, I would give it:    1 goldfish / 20 Sharks\nOne of my lowest ratings for any game yet sadly :s\n\nGoodluck to this game for the future but...\nAnyone who is thinking about buying it, RUN NOW, BE FREE!! Dont fall into the trap in which I did D:\n\nThnx for Reading\n\nps. Also all dem fanboys be giving me an old thumbs down on my review. I question why you would say this is a bad review since I have been truthfull all the way though.

We got no news for a looong time, then new forums came out.  The new forums revealed a new company taking over the game, and the "free patch" is now a new game.  Did I mention nearly all the original devs left after this switch?  The gameplay in the game is never fixed and the only things added are new broken classes and skins.  The economy is horrible, 2 cent skins only have around a 2% chance of dropping, and any skin of value NEVER DROPS or costs HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS on the market.  There is only 1 or 2 team deathmatch servers with players, every other server is a roleplay server.  And the gamemode Get to the Chopper hasn't had any players since launch. The only thing being "fixed" in the game are the demands for things to be nerfed from children.  Any hope for the game to be balanced is shattered, the devs don't listen to the people who stuck by the game and only kids who steal their mom's visas to buy falcons and keys.

I think this is a great game to review on and I hope you find this informative and somewhat helpfull, but please comment on if this gave you the info you wanted.\n\n~Gameplay~\n\nThis game has a good gameplay, along with it's new features from the last game "Primal Carange"\nbut if you don't have a "game good" computer I'd suggest putting the graphics quite low. This game has a new pounce option, Rex tail swing, Now you can spit with the dilo without roaring, and so on. Which is quite cool. I really liked these new updates.\n\n~Graphics~\n\nThis game has realistic and beautiful graphics. Although this sometimes will lag your game out so I mostly have mine on low wile I'm on a "Kill server" Or just regular playing the game. You can take the most amazing screenshots with this game. But! I've noticed that there is a slight problem with the missing textures when you put the graphics up high it does the purple and white textures which is somewhat annoying wile I am screening, And it would be really great if they could fix this.\n\n~Dinosaurs~\n\nThe dinosaurs and humans in this game are quite cool with new options. Starting out with the dinosaurs we have the Tryants. There are now 3 Tryants adding the new Acro being with the Spino and T-rex. In the old game The only Tryant was the T-rex and the Spino was a mod you could get along with the compy, which was only aquired it by downloading a link which sometimes isn't safe. They added the Spino and the Compy but the Compy isn't in a section which was a small dissapointment but you can type in "SetClassPawn 17" I believe.\nNow on to the "Predators" or the Raptor and Ovi classes. These two classes are pretty cool but finding the Feathered Raptors are very very hard and are sold in the market for hundreds of dollars which i find quite rediclious for a skin, I would prefer them to be atleast $50 or a small bit more so thay can keep their value.\nNext up is the "Flyers" Or the Tupa and the Ptera. These two classes have changed somewhat from the first game, They fly alot faster and now if you are in one place they dont just keep flying off to the corners of the map being annoying, but that movement sometimes glitches out and you stay in one spot but it still looks like you are flying in the regular flying position.\nNow the "Spitters" Or the Dilo and Crylo they now can both spit without roaring. The differences about these two is that they have 2 different spits: The Green posioning spit and the Purple blinding spit, The Crylo does the posion and the dilo does the blind. These are really cool dinos.\nLast but not least the "Bruiser" or the Carnotaur, This is a cool dinosaur but only has one option. There is no other dino relating to this and I really hope the carno can have another option but it's fine how it is. I like this dinosaur but the control is a bit buggy. Sometimes I can run and I accadentaly hit the wall but I rarely get stuck in the wall, It's not to big of a bother but i'd like to get this fixed.\n\nI'm not going into too much detail with the humans but there is new options for the humans like hatchets, flareguns(For the pyro), Landmines, sensor mines, and heath or ammo packets that people can drop.\n\nTo be breif this is a really thought out and great game that I really suggets you buy. there are so many skins and new ones to come according to the Primal Carnage gossip but I love this game and I hope that you will too.\n\nThanks for reading, Black","December 15, 2014","true","615.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I've only played for a few minutes and already don't really care for it. It's alright, and I could play it a little here and there when I have nothing better to do, but I'm pretty disappointed by it. The first problem was the graphical issues, which I noticed right away. If you run into a rock or fence, half your body will be inside the rock or through the fence. Then, there's the numerous grammar issues, mostly missing words all over the place, just giving a very unprofessional look to it.\n\nBut the biggest issue I have is that the single player survival mode is only playable as humans. As I said, I bought this primarily for single player, and obviously when you buy a game like this you want to play as a dinosaur, but playing solo I can't be a dino in a dino game! Except, of course, in the lame free range mode, which is boring and pointless. If survival mode was made playable as the dinosaurs and the graphical issues were fixed, I could definitely see this as being entertaining. I could even overlook the lousy (nonexistant?) proofreading (though it would be nice if that was fixed, too). As is, for my intended use, I wasted $7. And I was really hoping I'd enjoy it so I could buy a few more copies at that price as gifts for friends so once I get better internet we could play together. I guess I'll just wait for another sale after the developer hopefully fixes these problems.","May 10","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

It's reverted to being just like it use to be on PC, only now it has slightly improved performance (Graphics-wise) and an inventory system.\n\nOnly 2 new modes are introducted in the game at present; dino deathmatch (dino vs dino, but it is very buggy) and FreeRoam (no timelimit, no killcount.) Both modes are enjoyable but aren't without their faults; Dino Deathmatch limits the player to using the raptor, ptera, diloph and carno classes since the rex bite and tail whip have little effect and can easily be brought down by a pack of raptors. FreeRoam's only drawback is how boring it can become if nobody is roleplaying or if there is no prey to hunt; a much needed addition to FreeRoam to maximise its potential is bots for prey. I STILL hope this will be added eventually.\n\nThe graphics are roughly the same as PC, but are far less taxing on a machine and allow for better performance (we FINALLY got support for 32bit! No more crashing maps because of a bitwar mess!).\nSound hasn't changed; the sub-classes minus the Spinosaurus all reuse their dominant class soundfiles, and on some occasions the sound comepletely vanishes from the game with no logical explination or reason, and a restart is the only solution. (They say it is fixed, but it isn't.)\n\nNext on my list is the item drops; the skins, while a nice twist to drops, are mainly generic recolours of existing skins and some actually remove your camo and make you stick out like a sore thumb in maps. Not at all handy for a stealthy raptor or diloph...but the skins do look nice, they're just not that practical. The skin-system is also a monopoly, with players able to "farm" multiple crates and skins using a bot rather than playing themselves, and then selling the rarest skins for insane prices. Personally I would rather just buy the skin DLC like in previous PC, since I don't have the time or motive to farm for the ones I want, but I do see the appeal in keeping one skin set and ditching the ones you couldn't care less about.\nSo I don't hate the item-drop system, it's just the way the prices go insanely out of control, but then that's the players fault and not the developers.\n\nSpeaking of players...\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is it's community; the roleplaying section of the group is great! The people are friendly, the games are fun, but sadly this game is actually a FPS/PvP game and does NOT have what is nessecary for an MMORPG like many people want (a dinosaur and human MMO would be great!)\nSo while I do like going on FreeRoam servers for the occasional RP, I also like to go into the basics this game was originally supposed to have; sadly many of these servers are empty or are full of item farmers, children who clearly migrated from TF2 for the loot, or bots that have wound up on the wrong server to farm for items.\nThere are also still many issues still not fixed in this game that have been repeatedly addressed by the community.\n\nOld score: 7/10 (It was fun and buggy) My final overall score: 5/10. (Meh.)\n\n+Like the new modes and maps\n+Finally can have games with unlimited dinosaurs or no humans at all!\n+Still easy to play, but has a LOT of bugs (so it can be frustrating at times)\n+Skin drops are a good addition but are a bit out of control\n-Key prices are a silly price; £1.99 per skin or object from a crate, when you can buy a skinpack for the same price?\n-new sounds should be on the sub-classes instead of reusing their primary classes (STILL an issue!)\n-some skins are unpractical and the drop system is still messed up even after patching\n-sound and some animations randomly break\n-unusual lag in areas containing rain make those maps unplayable\n-chatbox vanishes too quickly and does not maintain previous chat if a game suddenly ends and a new one begins.\n-Item farmers in Get To the Chopper and Team Deathmatch can ruin those games (we call them "Empty players" or just "Empties").\n-Not enough reliable servers; many are laggy, the balance of FreeRoam, Team Deathmatch (Dino Deathmatch included) and Get To The Chopper are ridiculous and some servers will randomly crash and remain down all day.\n-Unresolved, reported, bugs and issues have caused many players to abandon the game and thus reduce the amount of players. Don't expect a server besides Item Farming ones to be completely full.\n\nSo...should you buy this game? AT any price but 1 of your currecny (be it Euro, Dollar or Pound) I would say no; get it when it's dirt-cheap or when it's free to play. Full-price is simply not worth it considering it is like PC only with item-drops and a few (and I say it again; FEW) new features.","February 8, 2015","true","45.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've never gotten to making a review of it before seeing how a lot of the old comments about the game were true --yes, even the negative ones--, but now I feel the need to jot down my opinions.\n\nPrimal Carnage: Extinction is a game about an organization of people who found an island filled with prehistoric creatures and have to kill every single one of them. The dinosaurs fight back to get rid of the humans and keep the island by doing whatever they can to fend them off, even if it means working side by side with another species.\nYou play as either the dinosaur or the human. In some game modes you can fight human vs human or dino vs dino. Now-a-days the most you'll see when you log into the game and look for a server it'll mostly be Free Roam, where you sit there and listen to people roleplay about dinosex.\n\nIfyouthinkI'm♥♥♥♥ingkiddingjustwaitinaserverforabit.\n\nNow lets hear our Pros and Cons on this game!\n\n+Pros\nPlay as a dino. Not many games do this, but having to play as an animal and literally 'hunt' these humans is really fun, especially if the humans are really good at what they do. You have to always watch your back, just like the other team.\n\nKill dinosaurs. Yeah, a lot of games have this feature, its a typical hunting game of man vs. beast, but in this one it's a lot more interesting because the beast is being controled by another person, in a team deathmatch!!\n\nGives you that rush of adrenaline everytime you hear that mother♥♥♥♥in T-rex. Its not just the rex though, its ANY dinosaur. No matter what you'll nearly ♥♥♥♥ yourself when someone out of nowhere blows your raptor face off or chucks you off a ledge before you could even react!\n\nHalf of the players are decent. Yeah, nuff said.\n\nSome cool maps.\n\nNice skins for customization on both teams.\n\n-Cons (oohhh boy)\nThere is a votekick system. Yeah, it sounds like a good idea to have so you can get rid of the pesky trolls that go around the server when a mod or admin isn't around, but its also been used countless times by butthurt dweebs we can't stand being killed over and over even though they were shooting or eating you. Doesn't sound too bad? Well, what if I told you that the kick system has three strikes? On the third strike, you're gone for good on that server and would have to contact an admin to get you back in. Still think its not bad? Let me also toss in that people who see a votekick pop up, no matter who is kicking who, always vote 'YES'. Why? No one knows! :o So unless a mod is there to save your ♥♥♥ or not enough people vote in the game, you're ganna have to exit the server and join back in so you won't get your strike, thanks to some pissy person and a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s :D\nAs a victim to this, take my word for it.\n\nThe mods and admins on certain servers. Not saying all of them, but I'm talking about the servers who intentionally kill with god mode on. No one can do anything to stop them from killing players that try to actually play the game or just want to chill. It just gets really annoying and its unfair when people are actively playing only to get killed by someone who isn't.\n\nI'm sick and tired of seeing every server play on the same map.\n\nI'm also sick and tired of t-baggers. ...Seriously, this isn't COD :/\n\nSuiciders. I don't have a problem with this because it just gives the team a lower score if they do, but a warning to people who find this annoying; expect people to suicide for a laugh or to avoid death by the enemy. Its mostly commandos with their gernade launchers, sometimes its just people who stand by a ledge shooting you so you can run toward them... only to watch them jump down...\n...like, seriously, what is the point? To me it only makes you look like a ♥♥♥♥♥ xD\n\nThe Free Roam servers with no tyrant limit. If you're a human and want to kill some dinos while chilling in a Free Roam, there is guarantee that the server would eventually be FILLED with tyrants. This is unfair because there is absolutely no way of surviving even if you have friends on your side. The tyrants are tanks that kill you in one bite (if they catch you), and considering that a wall of mouths is hunting you down, yeah, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nNow my favorite part of my rant- uh, I mean, opinion!!\n\nThe carno nerf. (And until this is fixed, my review is going to include this bull)\nAre you the type who likes to hit and run? Or just brutally run over anyone you see like the little ♥♥♥♥♥ that they are? (yeah, how dare they look at you funny, or try to shoot your precious dinosaur skin!) You like things that run sanic fast and can get away from gunfire at the speed of sound?!\n\nWell too ♥♥♥♥ing bad!\n\nMeet the carnotaurus! The most SLOWEST, most USELESS, most EASIEST TO KILL dinosaur in the game! The carnotaurus is a charger class that can't run for ♥♥♥♥ anymore thanks to the devs breaking those magnificent thighs to the point it takes a full year for it to start running where by then it would lose 1/4 of it's stamina, leaving you the rest to get away very slowly.\nCarnotaurus used to be one of the best classes in the game because it can get in and out of places in a heartbeat. It was the CHARGER, the one that would always get away or stick around to put a pesky human in it's place.\n\nBefore this god forsaken update the Trapper (a class that used nets to trap small dinos and prevent big ones from biting) was the master at catching and instant killing the little dinos. This human class was horribly nerfed to where the trapper is just as useless as the carno. Dinos have a greater chance of escaping nets and tazers now that the instant kill for trappers is gone.\nIf you think about it... what kind of ♥♥♥♥ing person takes their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time killing a raptor who is out to rip their face off? You now have to machette the ♥♥♥♥er until it's dead, and that takes way too much time and a waste of bullets if you chose to shoot it instead. It also takes little time for the raptor to escape the net and run off to heal.\n\nYeah no ♥♥♥ u game\n\n============================================================\n\nUPDATE :5/1/2016:\n\nThe game is still having its ups and downs, most of the pros and cons I've mentioned before are still there, but the good news is they made the trapper and carno how they were before. The trapper can one-shot netted dinos again with the knife and the carno is a beast once more.\n\nBut now I have another thing to add about this community just to warn the ones who are sensitive to this kind of behavior...\n\nRecently I've been getting a lot of hate just because I'm able to kill a few butthurt people. They began calling me names in the chat, and I'm pretty sure they were meaning to votekick me after I heard a few votekick 'dings' on a server who disabled votekick. I fear the community is only going to get more toxic from these people who can't play the game for the thrill. They'll start harassing you with foul language and never leave you alone in the server if you make them ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll eventually need an admin or mod to help you out and it just gets really ridiculous. Personally I enjoy watching people rage, but for those of you who can be hurt by these comments I recommend being very careful.\n\nThats all for now. Hopefully things will change. PC:E isn't a bad game at all, but the people here are just a real handful. Disrespectful, angry, and sobbing children is what this game is made up of with the exception of some really awesome people.\n\nYou have been warned. :I","March 7","false","442.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","3"

But lets start with the pros\n\nPros:\n-Everything looks much more detailed\n-Loot system, who doesn't love loot\n-Loading screens with hints and how-to's between each loading point gives the game a bit of background besides mindless dino/human killing\n-Every class has a seondary of some sort now, nice desert eagles lol.\n-Ammo and health packs from the commando and scientist make it a bit easier to say in top shape on the move and when you are low on one or the other, the ground supply crates glow a bit to show you where to go.\n\nNow for the cons which most of my issues aren't from the bugs but how they changed up the classes as well as the gameplay itself\n\nCons:\n\n-No longer a timer on Rex or spino after death, or a limited ammount...saw 3 spinos running around at one point.\n-Took away the grenade for the flamethrower dude (his name escapes me atm) and gave him a molotov...which doesn't\ndo much. That nade had so much going for that class, it gave the humans that bit of power it was lacking. Also i feel the chainsaw isn't up to snuff, kinda week atm.\n-Took away melee for all humans except for the trapper, which you have to right click a trapped dino to insta kill.\n-Scopeing in with the sniper seems a bit too narrow of vision\n-No more auto balancing....becuase we like being spawncamped by a team of 6 dinos when we only have 3 people\n-Ptrea...made it too easy to just grab people and fly off, used to be a challenge to swoop down and grab someone...now its just if you are close enough its good. Also its marker, doesn't seem to work atm, or atleast for me.\n-Raptor, I kinda like the fact you can't just spam right click and get the kill now, you have to aim it...but at the same time that aimer is a bit misleading, along with the fact the raptor has to arc his jump super high before he can land...which makes you a nice target for pathfinders. Maybe make the marker only go out so far, and put the raptors natural arc with it?\n\nAll and all I enjoy dinos, I enjoy dino games, if they keep at it I'm sure the game will get its deserved balance. Give it time people and things will eventually come full circle.","December 5, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game is already $20 which it isn't even worth that much, it would barely be able to earn a $10 price tag and yet they still shove micro transactions in your face.\n\n-Community & Servers\n\nExtremely disrespectful, and very under aged, have yet to meet one other good sport in the game, and its disgraceful. Also the servers are overloaded with Free Roam games, and almost every single one of them, if you enter them will have a dinosaur orgie or dino sex of some kind, mostly preformed by children under the age of ten, and if they are older they most likely have nothing better to do with their lonely life, then to virtually have sex with tyrannosaurus's under a waterfall.\n\n- Game Isn't Complete\n\nThere is way too much missing from this game to call it a full game, it should still be in alpha, maybe even pre-alpha.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nIf you want the classic Primal Carnage experience with Deathmatch's, Get to the Chopper, and Capture the Egg then go and get the original. If you want customization, and alot of horny 5 year olds hosting Tyrannosaurus Sex (See what I did there) servers then go with this alpha game falsely titled a non-alpha game. This game has alot of potiential with none of it successfully executed, so therefore I recommend holding off on purchasing this game until more progress is made.","February 25","false","7.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The T-rex is the most satisfying to play as. You have an amazing amount of health, but walk slowly, and if you can sneak up on a hunter, you can swallow them whole!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BKale/recommended/321360/","BKale","ϟRuvikϟ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BKale/","28 products in account","I wish there was a neutral option for rating this game, but I'll make do with a yes because at the very least it's better than the first. The levels look and feel nicer; old ones have been touched up and honestly the environments are absolutely picturesque compared to the first game.\n\nFrom what little I've played so far the balance seems a lot better between the two teams. I've played and am relatively alright at both dino and human, so no bias here. Admittedly haven’t played every dino, so I can’t cover them all… but I’ll mention what I have in a moment.\n\nAs human I love the new weapon system and the fact you can throw down ammo and health for your teammates. While playing every dinosaur is an adequate threat within reason. I like that ‘tyrants’ only kick you around now instead of instantly killing you by walking on you. I’d much prefer they were taken out of the game entirely but I know that if the devs did that their fans would have a shitfit so I’ll just keep the opinion to myself. They have the terrible ability to ‘vacuum’ people into their mouths, too, which is annoying. But overall they’re a bit easier to take on so that’s good.\n\nAs both dino and human I have a teeny issue with carnosaur. It no longer feels like a stealth class which needs to get the drop on people in order to achieve kills, which was what I enjoyed about it in the first game. Not sure completely what it is… but I’m not the only one who doesn’t feel quite right about it. It seems a lot harder to dodge even when you see it coming right at you. And a lot less fun to play.\n\nRaptor is perfect. Once you get the hang of steering with a mouse it’s a dream to play, and with the slower speed I actually have a chance of shooting it as a human. So long as my opponent hasn’t done what I previously mentioned, anyway.\n\nHaven’t played enough of the spitter classes to know much about them, but the one that shoots acid seems a little too slow for how big and conspicuous it is.\n\nThe drop system disappointed me with the fact it only drops crates… but hey what can ya do. Maybe they’ll actually make it useful later on.\n\nOverall it’s much funner than the first game to me and its nice not having someone hacking and ruining the fun for everyone every other time I decide to play. Gameplay seems more balanced, though it’s certainly not perfect. Not sure if it ever will be with the nature of the game, but it’s still better than the first.","February 5, 2015","true","255.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJBramble/recommended/321360/","DJBramble","SketchySaurian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJBramble/","15 products in account","Primal Carnage: Extinction was supposedly an "upgrade" from the original Primal Carnage however it wasn't, and still is not, the step up we were hoping for. Now, this review has been witten since the latest november patch and I am not going to be biased about any of the game's aspects there are still some good and bad features about this game and I believe that the developers can easily fix these issues and make this game as good, if not better than the original (although I doubt it).\n\nPros:\n- Dinosaurs\n- Fairly balanced gameplay (except for a few features I will get onto later)\n- More variety within the dinosaurs (dilo/cryo, etc having individual abilities) and some enhancements to some dinosaurs since the original.\n- A large variety of skins and/or cosmetics for both dinosaurs and humans.\n- Humans have more in depth features (new weapons, equip items, etc)\n- A large variety of in-depth, detailed maps\n- Fun easter eggs for you to search for (The egg is a lie.)\n\nCons:\n- Many bugs and glitches (although some have been fixed since this patch)\n- Tyrants have been seriously nerfed since Primal Carnage. Honestly, a pathfinder could go one-on-one with a T. rex. In the original, tyrants were mean't to be feared and required teamwork and skill to take down. Nower days, they represent little threat to even the average PC:E players. Why not add some sort of damage resistance to larger dinosaurs?\n- Pathfinders are insanely powerful, carnos are practically useless against them and tyrants even more so. Just nerf the damn shotgun to 300 damage tops.\n- Tranq rifles. Why were they necessary?\n- Roleplaying servers. In a fighting game, roughly 50% of them are diehard roleplayers. Pathetic. I don't mind freeroam as it allows the player to explore the various maps and apreciate the work gone into the game but we need more people on TDM and GTTC (although I do understand that the devs have no control over that but it is still a massive issue).\n- Which brings me to my next con: Get to the Chopper is dead! Why is no one playing get to the chopper anymore?\n- Terrible community full on players which lack any sort of skill in combat. Most result to spamming explosives, tranquilizers darts and pouncing. Those who do manage to get kills then go on to tea-bagging their victims. The rest of the community avoid combat altogether and become diehard roleplayers or spam skin/trade requests in the chat.\n\nIn short, it would not be entirely honest calling Primal Carnage: Extinction an "upgrade". If you want to mess around on freeroam or become a 24/7 roleplayer and create some sort of dino/humans-fire-breathing-hybrid-that-looks-like-it-cane-out-some-sort-of-cliche-anime then go ahead and buy this game. However, if it's co-operative fps action you're looking for then buy the original (surprisingly there still is a thriving community of players on Primal Carnage). Sadly, the visuals and skins were enough to keep me here...for now... However, I still have some faith in this game. If the developers actually took the time to read what the players want instead of cramming in more skins then maybe we could restore the franchise back to it's former glory.

(This could've easily been added to the original though)  Some of the skins however, seem really shiny giving them a faker plastic look.\n(Draw): The map are essentially the same they just added more vines here and there. (again something they could've simple added to the original).\n(Negative): Gameplay. I would've thought they'd have fixed some of the big loopholes that were in the original game (killing a tyrant while circling in its blind spot) sadly these are even more pronounced. The controls are slow to respond and they feel heavy.\n(Negative): Most people seem to understand this game was a money grab and as such there are fewer people that play it.\nOverall, it's disappointing.  If you did a side by side comparison of this game and its "predecessor" they both look essentially the same but the original plays better and actually seems more well balanced team-wise. When other new games come out (like with COD for example) there's usually enough new material to merit  them being their own freestanding game, I can't say that for this game.  It seems like a lot of time and effort were wasted creating a new game around material that would've been better suited as a patch or DLC.  If you want to spent a lot of money buying keys to unlock crates that may or may not have something good in them or just straight up dropping a ton of money to get the fancy skin you want then yea you'll enjoy this game.  If you want to blow up some dinosaurs up or eat some fleeing humans just get the original.\nI will continue to periodically play this game in the hope that future patches change my mind on it.","August 26, 2015","false","16.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This game was meant to be a free update, although it has been released as a new game due to copyright issues with developers switching. That being said, this game is now a lot better than Primal Carnage and many future updates are planned, so this game doesnt look like it is going to be abandoned. The game improves the core gameplay of the original carnage by polishing it and trying to make it more polished and refined. The dinosaurs are a bit clunky, but the devs have announced they are working on those problems, so thats nice. This game is definitely worth $20 for the sheer amount of fun you will get from it. Although i dont play this game religiously, i do like to play it every once in a while, and the hours stack up.

Do I recommend buying it at 20$? No, but if you had the discount(was 3 dollars) or a sale(under 10 dollars) comes up it is worth your money. Just to be able to ♥♥♥♥ around with nice scenery and have fun with friends. There are major things wrong and as a former QA member of C5 I just don't see it getting much better.\n\nMost of the community can be pretty decent. The main vice of the community is poor sportsmanship ( whether by abusing the OP classes/skills or just by a majority of them only playing one side which hampers those that play both sides evenly), short attention spans ( leading to market prices being crazy) and by far the worst thing I have seen is that very few understand the concept of seeding or playing on a low popular server. The last part leads to to very empty TDM servers and the oh so smart TDM players attacking those that rpers about it instead of actually doing something about it and honestly the server situation is only getting worse.\n\nBalance is close to good right now, but after this latest patch I loose hope that it will ever feel as good as 1.2 Primal Carnage and earlier. The game is getting attention paid to it by the devs and devs to respond to the community responses on balance. Which leads to mixed results and the new tyrant was shoehorned into the game in a way that made the other classes a much poorer choice to make. Subclasses should not work like this in any game.\n\nWorking game mods include TDM, freeroam(score doesn't matter, infinite time on a map, no team balance, and mostly used for roleplay), GTTC <get to the chopper only a few servers with this one (it's less popular) and the newest game mode Survival . A WIP gamemode of Dino vs Dino is availible but there are a few bugs with it, pretty fun regardless. Once DVD and Hunt come out I feel might be worth 15 bucks because of the teasers we've gotten for those game modes, but the core gameplay is still missing something to be really enjoyable in most game modes. A poorly implimented In Character(vicinity limited) chat and Out Of Character(server wide) talk have ruined roleplay because it is completely opposite with how normal chat travels. Like how do you mess that up?\n\nLoot drops are only skin related so all the crazyness about them is unnessary in my opinion. Yet there are still bots, dedicated traders and loot whiners about. The market is really unstable because of how expensive the newest fad skin can get and how fast older skins drop in price.\n\nThis game has potential. It always has but it seems to be a forever in the wrong hands to polish this great idea and base.","April 1, 2015","false","631.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong I like those servers I know how to roleplay well and crap but come on add some action in the game if this continues I feel like its not even going to be Primal Carnage anymore. I wish they would add more dinosaurs and more skins that you can actually buy in the content instead of hunting down people in the game servers of RP, FR it gets annoying. Another thing if your gonna troll make another server. Add dinosaurs like Utah Raptor or Dienonychus instead of Nova Raptor. Do something with the game instead of the smallest bugs and fixes.","August 18, 2015","true","68.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing really special here but not too bad either, unless you're talking about the large dinosaurs that manage to clip through the buildings and kill you\n-The sound is quite good, one of the few good things about this game, especially the T-Rex roar, reminded me of the original Jurassic Park\n-Quite a few maps and servers, though most of the servers seem to be full of people roleplaying and having dinosaur sex? If you don't believe me look it up for yourself, it's weird.\n-Some new maps, though nothing enough to make you buy this over the first\n-Interesting concepts being used, though probably a bit too advanced for whoever had the misforutune of making this game\n\nBad things:\n-The raptor spam is unbelievable, they have a stupid ability to pounce on you and pin you to the ground, the only way to get out of this is if someone helps you by shooting it. The result of this is most people camping in one spot because heading out on your own into the forest or anywhere else to experience the game like it was meant to be played results in you being pinned to the ground and killed, you can't even mash a button on the keyboard to get out and have a chance. The same applies to the pterodactyl which can carry you into the air, though it's not as overpowered as the raptor spam as it's easier for players to spot and shoot it's wings. However you should be able to get out of it's grasp by mashing a key on the keyboard which gets progressively easier the higher it gets.\n-The maps are buggy, large dinosaurs have somehow developed phasing technology to eat you from the outside of buildings, this hasn't happened often but it has happened before.\n-The trappers ability to fire a net at the dinosaurs can be unbelievably annoying and buggy, for instance I fired a net at a bloody pouncing raptor (Yes, I know) which should have incapacitated it on the floor, instead it didn't stop and still managed to claw me to death, even though it was wrapped tightly in a net. You might say it's momentum made it carry on, sure, but that doesn't mean it can still claw me to death if normally it makes it stop on the floor for about 10 seconds.\n-Nothing groundbreaking was added that wasn't in the previous one\n-I already mentioned roleplaying, as many other reviews here have, what idiot thought it would be a good idea for T-Rex's and pterodactyls to have children together? If you try to join a normal server you might have dificullity doing that too as I did on several occassions, and then you realise that over half the servers on here consist of roleplay ones.\n-Community is really not that great compared to the first game\n-Human classes are quite genereic\n-Dinosaurs due to being extremely unbalanced will generally win every game or at least all the games I played.\n-Maps overall tend to favour the dinosaurs, though this issue isn't as bad as the rest\n-Skins can be extremely overpriced, who cares if you bought one for $300? I don't, just played the damned game.\n-Economy? lol\n-Hoard mode is really repetitive.\n\nOverall as you've probably read maybe it's just because I don't have as much time on the game as some of the pros we see on the server, ranting about how good it is. Then again, judging by the other reviews it really is just a bad game that really doesn't live up the expectations of the first one.\n\nTL;DR - The game is buggy and broken, most servers consist of weird dinosaur roleplay with a bunch of 12 year olds and the community is rubbish. Play the original if you want a good dinosaur game, do not waste money on this garbage.","October 16, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","1","2","0"

It's not just bad luck because in my own server no one can join. Even after 12 hours of free roam In that server no drops and none in other servers. Can anyone tell me how to fix this.","November 8, 2015","true","235.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","1","3","0"
