You cannot move more than 1 tile to the sideways without landing first though.\n\nThe goal is to get as much energy as possible by running on the blue tiles while avoiding any collisions or bottomless pits. Once you reach 100% of energy you're free to collide against something or fall to end a stage, otherwise you can keep going and try to reach a higher score.\n\n* Simple graphics, which means it can run on any toaster and wont bother you while going at full speed.\n\n* Good soundtrack! It's kinda electronic-something, I don't know, it sounds good enough in game and it changes dynamically (The more upbeat version plays when you reach over 100% of energy).\n\n* Controls are quite comfortable. You can just plug in your Xbox 360 controller and be ready to play. You can move with the triggers, the shoulder buttons, the directional pad and the analog, they're all supported at the same time.\n\n* Excellent port of what I suppose is an iOS game. No flaws in framerate nor stuttering or anything.\n\n* Achievements aren't something so special here, they're all about you beating a stage. Latter stages are quite hard though! Still, it would've been cool to have some weird achievements or even some score attack ones to push you to try harder.\n\n* Good replayability if you care about score attack and leaderboards.\n\nI'm sure the graphics are WAY too simple for a lot of people but the game is just 3 dollars full price. I don't really mind that. I had lots of fun so far and I expect to 100% the game in a few days.","September 15, 2014","true","2.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/302610/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewBoson X is a rotational infinite runner with a nice premise, addictive gameplay and challenging difficulty. You play as one of three characters of your choosing and run along platforms inside a particle accelerator, in the hopes of discovering a new one! This is one of those games that is simple to grasp, but hard to play! If you thought Super Hexagon was fun and difficult, well, now you have this Decagon to try and master!\n\nThe Pros:Fitting Visuals - The game's focus on fast moving objects and rapid player movements make choosing this minimalist art style very fitting. There are no textures, just solid colors, and it just works! You won't get distracted by textures, instead all your attention is to be averted to your movements. Also, it kind of makes sense, as you are travelling between particles. Things to small to have textures (or geometrical shapes, for that matter, but we'll let this one slide).\n\nLevel Generation - The levels are put together using procedural generation, but not by randomness, There are modules put together in a random order. So, once you'll play enough of a level, you will start to get used to the more difficult steps. This is great, because you can learn without having to go through the same level over and over if you fail.\nWhat's more, each level has it's own theme - different modules, different speeds, different color schemes and even unique pieces!\n\nAddictive in Nature - Even though later levels will make you want to scream because of how hard they are, dying is sometimes enjoyable, and just makes you want to play again, because you are confident you can pull it off! Also, a great game to play when bored.\n\nScoring and Leaderboards - Instead of scoring you on how long you stay alive, or how far you've gone, the game scores you in percentages, and that increases each time you run on blue platforms. Once you reach 100%, you pass the level, and go into a sort of hyperdrive with increased speed, a change of color scheme and significantly increased difficulty. Leaderboards are also wonderfully done, with scores broke down by level, in total, and friend comparison.\n\nReasonable Achievements - The achievements are all based on finishing the levels. There are 18 in total, but don't think this will be an easy feat. You may be surprised how challenging this game can get.\nCons:Surprisingly.. None - It's rare I never find a con in a game. This one is the exception that enforces the rule. The game does what it sets to: Gives an addictive, infinite runner game, with no garbage on the side - just plain, good, challenging fun. For people that would consider the difficulty a con, you are missing the point. For this genre, a more merciful experience will do nothing but dampening the fun.\nConclusion:If you like infinite runners, are up for a challenge and you want a great game for cheap (also featured on sales for next to nothing), this is an easy purchase. Buy with confidence.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

However, that's all it needs; the execution is almost flawless and the game is very fun, challenging, and addicting.\n\nBoson X is based around one main mechanic that involves rotating the world as you jump, allowing you to leap to either side of you or straight ahead. By running on glowing blue platforms, your score (and speed) will increase; victory is achieved by scoring 100%. As mentioned above, while the premise is very simple, each level is distinctly different from one another and some even include special hazards.\n\n$3 gives you 18 levels with huge replay value. The price is exceptional for what the game offers, but if you aren't convinced, there is a free version on the game's website[www.boson-x.com]with 6 levels (and one less character skin).\n\nOverall, Boson X is a great game and I definitely recommend it.","September 28, 2014","true","62.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The first 2 sets of levels (possibly the top 3 on the last set) are difficult enough to be rewarding, provide a good skill curve, and are very interesting both visually and conceptually. However, the rng elements of the game become increasingly infuriating in the last couple of levels, outweighing the reward of improving and passing each pattern section of the levels.\n\nSome of the level design is questionable, for example on the anti Y boson level, the platforms in one pattern section are actually hidden and completely non visible until it is too late to react. On other levels, the visuals, though overall excellent, can cause issues with vision on where to go next.\n\nI definitely don't regret buying this, but I wouldn't recommend this for everyone, especially for people like me who don't play games like this very frequently.","November 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Dude, why are my hands so huge..?"\nWhat would you get from putting three physicists in a room with unlimited supply of drugs? You would probably get three overdosed scientists and no progress made but in the universe of Boson X drug infuced trips seem to be the main method of doing science.\n\nBoson X is an interesting arcade runner game that has interesting soundtracks, trippy visuals and sometimes unforgiving difficulty. Boson X handles close to any other 3D-runner game out there but the main difference being the visual tricks. Boson X plays with your head. A lot. There are situations that may seem impossible to get through but after  thinking for a second you will realize it was just a visual trick to make it look harder than it is. The main problem is that you have less than a second to react. Boson X's gameplay is really interesting since you have to memorize different parts of the levels which, for some poeple, may be the main reason not to buy the game. If you enjoy trial and error type of games this game is just right for you. The levels are short but they require quite some time to memorize each part of the level.\n\nOther than the gameplay, Boson X doesn't have much going. The graphics are simple yet fine looking, the soundtrack is fun to listen to yet not really memorable but don't let that scare you away since the gameplay is fun and depending on your skills Boson X will offer many hours of fun runner type gameplay.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 22","true","3.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's not HORRIBLY unfair - but it can be.\n\nAdmitedly that's in the tougher levels but the game doesn't mess about - the first level is fairly easy and then it gets a LOT harder!\n\nEnd of the day I'm erring towards 'Not Recommended' simply because I think it lacks that "ahhhhh,,, yes!" or "ohhhh - no!!!!!!" factor which I tend to want in my twitch games - I don't like having time to realise I've made a mistake before it actually happens ;0\n\nYMMV however - it's a competent game, just maybe lacking a bit of excitement and having a bit too much "unfair!"","August 31, 2015","false","3.5"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evostorm/recommended/302610/","evostorm","EvoStorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evostorm/","808 products in account","Since times before the personal computer, arcade and arcade-like games have been liked and played by a majority of gamers, even in the futuristic year of 2014. And among these types of games, there are the runners, the one where you have to "simply" dodge and jump on and over hazards and other objects. However, Boson X takes that principle to an entirely different level.\n\nThe goal of Boson X is to run and jump from platform to platform on a 3D field, and filling up your meter by running on the (glowing) blue platforms. When this meter reaches 100%, you'll "discover a new element" and finish the level, but you can keep going to increase this meter even more at a higher speed, which will make you look better on the online score boards.\n\nYour character can jump forward, or jump to either the left path next to them, or the right. You cannot change your path mid-jump, and you can hold down the key to increase your jump height. The controls might sound simple, and they are in theory, but you'll have to use these three commands to their fullest potential if you want a chance at beating all 18 levels.\n\nBoson X is what people may call a "Super Hexagon on foot", most likely because the game has a hexagon field, and you have to dodge empty spaces and walls. Though not exactly true, they both share a similarity: They're both incredibly difficult. Boson X will test your reaction time to new lengths as you progress through the game, adding in different types of platforms, appearing in different ways and speeds. Though each level has a certain pattern, the way these patterns emerge are in parts and randomized, so memorizing them won't do you much good if you don't have the reaction speed to match it.\n\nFor 3$/3€, Boson X is well worth your money, with levels that will make you want to pull your hair out, incredibly smooth gameplay, and if you're dedicated enough, you'll put plenty of hours into it. Just make sure you've got the patience for it, otherwise your monitor will be on the other side of your room by the time you've failed the same level a hundred times.\n\nAnd trust me, you will.","September 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The aim of the game is to run and jump left and right along a brightly coloured and long hexagonal tube, while trying to run along blue flashing tiles until your velocity (or whatever it's called) reaches 100%. After reaching 100% you keep running until you die and then unlock the next level.\n\nThat is basically how the whole game plays out. My description may sound underwhelming, but honestly it is a great game. I paid 19p for it on sale (about 29 cents/0.29 usd) and I honestly would pay the full amount of £2 (3.05 usd) because it honestly worth it.\n\nDo yourself a favour and bless your game library with this endless-running gem.\n\nFinal score: 7~8/10","September 7, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sadly the game suffers from poor pacing, a painfully gaudy color palette , a very steep difficulty curve and somewhat badly designed levels that will frustrate Boson X players more than challenge them. While the game states that you need quick reflexes to succeed, you will find yourself relying blind luck (and a fair bit of patience) to hit that '100% discovered' meter. The only real reason I am positively recommending this game is that it does offer a fair amount of value (in terms of gameplay) for what it costs to buy. Also, there is no 'Average' rating.\n\nP.S.

It is a nice touch that they added the ability to pick your gender, but it doesn't really affect the gameplay beyond the footstep sound.\n\nThe game is what you could call 3D, however the main running is along the x axis, you jump on the y and instead of moving left/right to avoid obstacles or jump gaps, you 'rotate' around a predefined polygon. This was an interesting game mechanic, and I felt the game executed it very well.\n\nThe different levels generate randomly but each one has its own signature features, from platforms that move or drop out beneath you to the various structures that they make up. This is good, because it prevents you from just learning the tricks to the first level and burning right through the others.\n\nThe style is very minimalistic, and it manages to pull it off well. With the exception of one level and its 'wireframe' look [which is completely impossible to play, as far as i'm concerned], the various styles to levels work nicely. Some of the music is good, but overall it was OK. The world you run through doesn't require the music [i.e. it isn't generated according to the music], although it would be a nice addition if they made that so.\n\nIt can be played with either the keyboard or controller, and both work equally well for this game. I didn't have the game crash on me at all, and there were no installation problems.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraeyq/recommended/302610/","kraeyq","Kraeyq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraeyq/","402 products in account","Boson X provides a simple and clean endless runner experience with a mixture of randomization. While the characters that you chose only make a difference visually, the game attempts and succeeds in providing a unique set of levels that you will definitely find challenging without some practice. The controls are simple yet may feel difficult if you try to jump like a traditional platformer would.\n\nThe only reason I picked up Boson X was to complete the achievements and try out something that I usually do not play. I'm one of those observers that looks at the running genre and wants to run with it but ends up saying no because of price, mechanics, or fear that the product will fall short of my expectations. Boson X  not only met my expectations but blew my mind with some of the crazy levels that were thrown at me.\n\nThe objective of the game is very simple: keep on the platforms and try to run on the blue ones. While there are several hazards to look out for, that is the essence of the game. Running on blue platforms will get you closer to completing the level and make you run faster and faster building up tension and excitement when your beat your highscore. Leaderboards are offered and can be fun to push yourself further up the leaderboards after you have completed a level.\n\nThe level variety and difficulty is reasonable and able to be mastered to a certain extent. Randomization helps break up monotony and adds to the mystery of what your going to run through next. Levels that I thought were impossible were beatable in a few days of learning the level (and a lot of failing).\n\nDuring my time of playing Boson X, I have not found any game breaking bugs... or actually any bugs at all.  I can confirm that it works on the Xbox 360 controller as advertised. The game performed exceptionally well and had options to play in window and fullscreen modes. This was especially useful as I was able to practice and play Boson X while watching Youtube or Twitch.\n\nI highly recommend this for anyone who think they might be into runners.","November 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For $3, it's a lot of bang for your buck. The only circumstances in which you shouldn't play it is if you don't like a challenge. This game is child's play at first, but the difficulty ramps up quick and it becomes nearly impossible towards the end stages, but when you do finally beat it, you can't get a better sense of satisfaction. Also, this game gets bonus points for being extra awesome whilst stoned. It's pretty trippy.","October 18, 2014","true","102.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I actually forgot about it but remember it being pretty enjoyable so decided to give it a shot then I saw it on sale here.\n\nBoson X is really fun and addictive running game. It's got some great twists on the usual conventions. The way in which you jump from each platform took some time to adapt to and was quite frustrating at first. Once you push a certain direction, you've committed to that direction, until you land again. Holding the direction makes you jump longer gaps. Once you get the technique down, it's incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe visuals and music are both appealing. The feel of the game is great and it all comes together well. Despite retrying levels endlessly, the music still works and adds to the experience without becoming annoying which is always a possibility in games like this.\n\nOne thing that is slightly annoying is that the levels are in sections which seem to randomly shuffle each time. And the way to complete the level is to run across enough blue tiles. Therefore sometimes you can be running for longer than your previous attempts but have a less percentage of completion than those attempts. Didn't stop me from retrying the level though...","January 1","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But will you want to buy this game ? Boson X doesnt really have a story. You can pick a charecter you want to play as and the goal is to run on particle tiles to power up a particale exelarator. So how is this game ? Boson X is a really fun game and i highly suggest you check it out. Boson X plays a little diffrently than youre regular endless runner. You have to twist the world arround you to get to youre goal. The game gets harder as you go on but it never becomes too dificult that you want to quit the game and stop playing it. The game has a few bugs like falling through the tiles happend twice to me. But that was about it. The game has a bit tricky controls and it takes a while to get used to but once you do its all smooth sailing from there. Overall Boson X is a really fun Endless runner that is cheap and fun. Pros: 18 levels. Fun premise. Replay Value.\nCons: A few minor bugs. Tricky controls. Overall you need to pick up Boson X. For the price its a steal. The game is fun and its one of the more fun difficult games i played in a while. I give Boson X a 8/10","December 19, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm an avid gamer and I like difficult games, and indie games, and this type of design.  But this game is atrocious.  I can't be the only one who thinks so?\n\nThis game is a hipster-hype nightmare.  The gameplay the boring "test your reaction time" type, OK, fine.  I'm already not that enticed but whatever.  I gave it a good few plays, on multiple occasions, and I wanted to love it.  Then I just wanted to LIKE it.  But it's one of those games that has some tricky mechanic which seems unfair - in Boson X's case, you jump platforms - but the thing is, after a level or two platforms start randomly dropping off.  But there isn't any indication of when this happens, at least that I could tell, and it is just too hard to determine your vertical position - there isn't any ground or reference area to be able to tell if the platform is dropping - it starts to drop, you jump, but you're too low to make the next platform, and the game says Ooopsoe!  Try again!  But.... it doesn't feel like my fault, like I could even do anything about those deaths.\n\nSo the end effect is that I start the game, play an easy level, think "ooo, I may like this". Next level, I'll jump to a platform and be too low to land it.... but.... what?  I didn't even know I was dropping.  So I try the tutorial, which is of the modern, very hipster, minimalist school of tutorials where it has to be self-righteous about its hyper simple core gameplay, emphasising how "clean" and "simple" the gameplay is.  But it doesn't even mention these dropping platforms!  How do I deal with them?  They seem unpredictable and random, and every time you die from being too low it seems really cheap to me.\n\nI search online, and of course, you just hear people bragging about how amazing they are and how easy the game is etc..... I dunno.  For my money (and I did pay money for this game!), it's an overhyped game which treats its players with disrespect.  I love a game which punishes - but it has to feel fair.  This game feels like it throws me under a bus, and I didn't even know the bus was coming, and I didn't even see the bus until my face was plated firmly in the bumper.  I wish I could at least find info on how those falling platforms work, but all you can find is over-hype and people bragging about how awesome they are, or how amazing the game is, etc.  Honestly - overhyped, boring gameplay, and the design is too noisy and trendy/indie/bleh.  And this is coming from an indie games NERD.","June 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","4"

The control scheme is very unintuitive and frustrating. Dedicated jumping arcs in a game where your sense of spacial awareness is usually a guess is very annoying. If you were able to switch your platform without requiring jumping, or you were able to do it more than once in the air I could see myself sinking a lot of hours into this game. But as it is I'm not a fan.\n\nGo play Run, it's a free flash game that trumps this in every way.","April 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

I don't know what it means either, but somehow it reminds me of some creepy tracks from American McGee's Alice.) Hiring someone at least with bachelor's degree in music composing would have been nice in my opinion.\n- Luck matters (platforms are randomly positioned and blue platforms can appear earlier and more frequently, sometimes not.)\n- Often hard to determine the distance between and elevation of the platforms (important part of game mechanics but a little flaw in game design at the same time due to player's field/angle of view.) and landing correctly on the platform can be extremely frustrating.\n- Health complications: eye disease (vitreous floaters), heart disease, hyperventilation, epilepsy, seizures, etc.. You name it.\n\nPROS:\n- Another twitch reflex game that can torture yourself with (a lot better if you are masochist.)\n- Super Hexagon in 3D and with a bit more depth.\n- Some levels are creative and cool.\n- Keiro (nice character.)\n\nFinal Remarks:\nEven though I mastered the game, I kind of hated it.\n\n.

Plus the platforms are created randomly only a few second in front of you, and worse, you can't move when you are mid-air. So, basically you just do a gamble jump and hope you won't fall or hit a wall. Die. retry. die again. hundreds of times. repeat. still die again. alot. rage.\n\nIs that sounds fun to you? and you pay for it.\n\nfor me, a game is supposed to be entertaining. rather than frustating. If I want to get stress, I'd better go to work instead.\n\nI think the game would be more enjoyable, if there are check points, or you can move mid-air, or at least there are warnings what's in front of you, like 'no platform', 'dead end', 'high wall', 'hole', or fix the color to make the platforms more visible. And to compensate the nerf, just make the route longer.","September 22, 2015","false","6.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

If you do not have the effort and determination/drive in order to complete a level, you lose. If you do not have excellent reflexes, you lose. You may be thinking as you read this: why should I play this game? Why should I buy a game for £1.99 on Steam when it is this hard? There are many games on this online gaming platform that are expensive (like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, for example) and make you buy map packs/DLC in order to get the most out of the game. This game does not have DLC, or map packs, or even in-game purchases - all of this is built into the game for a fair one-time price of £1.99. This game does not even need DLC, for I can assure you that this game is like an orange: you can squeeze as much out of it as you want. There is no limit to how much fun you can get out of this game (or rather, tears :3) because it takes time to complete the levels of this game, and a lot of it. You can complete the first level and leave the game in your Steam library, unplayed, forever if you like, or you can decide to dedicate time and effort to completing every single level and beating the game, as well as getting a lot out of it. I have already completed this game, and will continue to rise up the leaderboards on this game until I have got the most out of it than I can, and you can too, for a measly price of £1.99.\n\nIn conclusion, buy this game now and never regret it. :D 10/10","November 15, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This platformer's unique  art style is great as the geometry looks simple but is far from it. As the game progresses the levels get faster,more detailed and more complicated. My mind was never at ease YET it was relaxing to constantly die, death after death, and continue playing. (The menu is nice and quick if you are easily frustrated and need to rage quit quick. I did this constantly but i kept re-opening the game because it was to addictive to stop.) The soundtrack complements the game well with it dynamically changing to the levels style.\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes.\nI got incredibly lucky and got it on sale for just 75 cents.... 75 cents for a game you spend hours on, with great replayability, especially because of its competitve leaderboards. Its Normal price is 3 euro but even then, its a bargain. If the game devolpers objective was to create a simple,classic and fun platforming game, it has done its job rather well.\n~4/5\n","April 8, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE AND STUPID AND FRUSTRATING AND TERRIBLE.\n\nOkay, now that's out of the way, I must say this game is amazing. It will make you want to punch someone on occasion, but that's okay. When you realize that there's only 18 levels, you might think that the game will be beaten in 10 minutes, but nooooooooo. Even after 80 tries, I still haven't beaten one of the first levels. This game is so addicting and simple, that you need to buy it NOW. Especially when it's on sale like I did. Best 74 cents I've ever spent. But seriously, as much as I love this game, and as many times that I laugh at Keiro's ingenious design, there are a few flaws. But they're just a few gameplay bugs that (hopefully) can easily be fixed. Every once in a while a jump won't register, or it will register, but for whatever reason you fall. I know I sound like a really crabby person saying that, but in this game, every millisecond counts.\n\nOther than that though, this game is awesome 9/10","April 9, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But seriously, this game is fun.\n\nGame mechanics: this is an endless runner where you press left to jump left, press right to jump right, and press up to jump forward. Hold these keys longer for longer jumps. Don't fall, or hit the platforms/walls.The context that they put this game is interesting: you're a physicist trying to discover new particles. Your objective is to land and run on blue platforms and increase your particle discovery to 100%. Red platforms fall (and try to screw you up). You can go over if you want, but that's just for a high score. When you hit 100%, you can discover new particles. Be careful, you go faster as you approach 100%, with a significant boost in speed after hitting that percentage. Each level has certain repeating units of platforms, which allows for a learning curve.\n\nThis game can get hard quickly, but as I said before, there is some predictibility with platform within the levels, so you can learn the layout and get closer and closer to 100%. The satisfaction and exciting gameplay is the reward that overshadows the sometimes big frustration.\n\nIt is a simple game, so there is not much to criticize. Perhaps, longer music loops for the levels (it can get quite annoying).\n\nBuy it now; it's price, whether full or discounted, is cheap.","April 28, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get to 100% energy you discover a particle (complete the level) and unlock a new particle to discover. The first couple of levels start out kind of slow but you pick up speed with the more energy you collect. The later levels such as X Boson are so fast you feel like road runner. Finishing a level and discovering a particle is very satisfying but it doesn't end there. You can keep going past 100% energy if you're the kind of person that likes high scores. Aside from the gameplay, Boson X has great music. The graphics are nothing special but what do you really need from a runner game?

You have to go through 18 levels (3 worlds, 6 levels in each) with 3 different characters (only for the skin, you do not have different skills). In order to win, you have to discover particles by running and jumping (left, ahead or right) on blue tiles and reach 100%. The more you stay on a blue tile, the faster you increase your %. It does not matter how long it takes you, as long as you stay alive and reach 100% without dying.\n\nAbout dying, it is going to happen a lot : you have to die again and again to get better and finally complete a level. Do not be afraid, this is how this game works. You will get an achievement for each completed level, but the difficulty is increasing after each level, and it becomes quite challenging quickly (I must confess that this is my first endless-runner).\n\nTo conclude, this is a pretty good and fun game, plus a challenging one !

The routes you have to run are varied and new obstacles are added at every point in the game which makes gameplay fun. The controls are simple (arrow keys) and easy to use as well.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. It is upbeat and fits with the art style which is also interesting and intuitive. The way the score is displayed is fantastic and fits well with the particle physics theme.\n\nThe one bad thing I have to say about this game is that there is a lot of flashing lights and the visual style is very hard on the eyes.

The routes you have to run are varied and new obstacles are added at every point in the game which makes gameplay fun. The controls are simple (arrow keys) and easy to use as well.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. It is upbeat and fits with the art style which is also interesting and intuitive. The way the score is displayed is fantastic and fits well with the particle physics theme.\n\nThe one bad thing I have to say about this game is that there is a lot of flashing lights and the visual style is very hard on the eyes. This makes it hard to play for more than an hour or so at a time.\n\nIf you enjoy platform jumpers you'll enjoy this game.","June 13, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a while I saw it in Steam and it is one of the only "small/cheap" games I have ever bought on Steam.\n\nAfter focussing a lot for the first few minutes the game puts me in a "thinking mood". You just press your "AWD" buttons braindead while staring at your screen and just thinking about... Kind of everything in life. The game is kind of hypnotising and I will probably still play it often because of that one unique experience I have never had with any other game or... Well, not only games, kind of everything.\n\nI haven't found any issues though I think the last level of red (-1 I think?) has a bit of unfairness and it is very confusing. I was glad when I made it and it's one of the only levels I probably will not replay.\n\nThere was not a single level I completed from the first go, but the learning curve was good.\n\nAnother very small plus is, though there aren't key bindings, you can kind of use everything. I often used S to jump (which is down in WASD) to jump. Because your fingers have to rest the whole game. Arrow keys and space to jump are also an option, and maybe there are even more options.\n\nI give this game a solid 9/10 and I promise you, you won't regret buying it.","July 17, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipquarx/recommended/302610/","Ipquarx","Ipquarx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ipquarx/","111 products in account","This is a very well-made endless-runner game by a couple of indie developers.\n\nThe basic idea is that your character represents a particle in a series of 3 particle accellerators, and you need to get your particle up to a certain energy level by standing on the blue platorms. If you hit anything head-on or fall down you have to start over again. As you get more and more power you start to move faster and faster. Once you get to 100% you can either collide with something to discover a new particle or you can continue on to get a high score for your power level.\n\nThat said, the game technically does have an official endpoint. The game is named "Boson X," and one of the "particles" you can discover is the X Boson, you could say that's a good spot to end off if you don't want to go for 100% completion.\n\nAll this is made more difficult by the fact that the levels range from easy to begin with to extremely unique and difficult in their own regards. An example of one of the levels: The X Boson level is actually rendered in wireframe, making a lot of it quite challenging.\n\nThere is no real plot to the game, though the characters are quite cool. There's a man, a woman, and a robot. Personally, the robot (Keiro is its name) is my favorite to play as.\n\nThe controls are tight, responsive and easy to get used to. You only need 3 buttons: left, right, and up. Hold the buttons for longer, the longer you jump, and if you press a direction key you'll move a lane over in that direction. Different levels have different numbers of lanes too.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, they're not complex but they're eye-catching and nicely stylized. There are no actual quality or graphics options though you have the option to lower or mute the audio, to play in fullscreen or windowed. The game is not very resource intensive at all, and you can run this at 60fps 1080p on fairly low-end hardware.\n\nI also like to listen to my own music while playing it, which seems to improve my performance a bit, the soundtrack in the game isn't that great.","June 2, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/302610/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","This really is an overlooked simple but well made little game. I noticed and picked up Boson X when it appeared in the weekly offers at -90% on the Steam store, less than a year after release and that was clearly a steal. It's a small rotational platform runner title that clearly went unnoticed and despite being fairly short and lacking much content, it's definitely worth picking up when on sale, if not at full price.\n\nHighlights\nMost of the low priced little indie titles on Steam aren't well realized, or come with too many problems to be worth the hassle, but Boson X is short and comes together really nicely. It's polished more than you'd expect and the sound and especially the music in particular is worth noting for being fast paced, at times thumping, and fun, while also tying into the levels really well.\n\nThe entire game is packaged under a scientific theme of physics, and from the chemistry lab looking title screen which reminded me of Half-Life 2 and Portal, to the physicist and particle references, it's themed subtly but well and compliments the gameplay.\n\nThe random placement of the platforming elements falling into place along with the randomized directions, speeds and distances of certain things all make for a changing difficulty and unpredictable level. Some of the earlier and later levels in particular can be both easy and very challenging in the same playthrough, and it added a small level of that "want to play again" and "just one more try" feeling.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThere are some annoyances with this title, but at the price and length they're mostly forgiveable, but more so they don't actively break the game and don't take away very much overall.\n\nAs mentioned, there's a nice level of unpredictability built in by the random selection of speeds, times and platform locations which probably adds more than it takes away, but at times it's definitely more annoying than if the section had been given fixed timings. Dying at the same sections because there's no way to predict the placement of a block up ahead, or crossing lightning paths which may make it impossible to chose a safe direction are frustrating more than they need to be and should have had more attention spent on at least making them more fluid. In short, the game is often unfair, and that's the last thing you want in a game involving precision, timing and player planning.\n\nThe other complaint is the lack of content or length of gameplay which clocks in at an average of around 5-6 hours, which is great value for money, but because the mechanics are fairly flat, even unexciting at a push, it means there isn't anything to make you go wow or keep you engaged for very long. The developer has mentioned all the open license libraries and given links to the engine and more in the file directory, presumably to encourage modding/development, but Steam Workshop is a common request and honestly would've added a lot to this title, it's a shame it hasn't been added.\n\nRecommendations\nFully priced, Boson X is available on Steam at just £1.99/2.99€/$2.99 and with an average gameplay length of 5-6 hours, it's great value for money. It's also regularly on sale for as much as 90% off, which makes it nearly free. It's probably not going to rock your socks off and keep you playing, and if you have a long backlog it might be worth missing out on, but at the price it's a fine pick up for anyone taking an interest from the store page.\n\n* You can actively edit and/or replace the music and sound via the /data directory. You can even edit the character models and animations.\n* Run, a flash game with similar, albeit flatter mechanics is available on Coolmath[www.coolmath-games.com], Kongregate[www.kongregate.com] and other sites to play for free.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/302610\nUnedited review notes 14/09/2015 for Boson X:\n\n+Great soundtrack\n+Science related title screen/character orientation etc is a nice theme\n+Difficult and unpredictable gameplay\n-Difficult and unpredictable gameplay at later stages, dying because of my mistakes is fine, dying because it's near impossible to progress due to random timing is bad\n-Lacking content, steam workshop would've went a long way and made this something special","September 14, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 18 levels here of varying difficulty; from Normal Geon to Anti-Boson X. I have spent 4 hours collecting achievements (beating the game) and the rest of my time shooting for top 1000 (then 500) scores on each level.\n\nI played the free version before this, but the Dark and Anti versions of each particle were a pleasant new feature. They are NOT retools or reskins of one another.  Each stage usually retains the same core structure (gravitron likes moving/falling platforms, Y boson is a big fan of electric beams, etc.) but otherwise each level is fresh and unique.\n\nPlayers with slow reaction times WILL have trouble with the later levels. This game gets pretty darn rediculous, especially once you take on the Anti particles. Anti Gravitron had me stuck for a good 30 minutes (1/8 of the time I was playing).\n\nThis is a very good game in my opinion. While it may not be a genre-definer like Super Meat Boy or a masterfully crafted experience like Limbo, it's nice for good quick fun, a coffee break or a reflex test.","October 1, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Runs quite smoothly, music is great, and level design remains interesting throughout. Not overly drawn out, and getting the jist of each level as you run through it feels great. Simple but very fluid mechanics make for a very addicting experience. For it's price, it's a lot of fun.\n\nWhen you have an incredibly intense run, you'll feel like an absolute badass. I love that feeling. Recommended, it's a quick, well-executed, arcade-like experience that is quite difficult, but not impossible. It's not cheap difficulty, when you lose, you know you made a mistake, not that you were cheated out by RNG or something.

Much more than that can start giving you a headache. The game looks like a dream you would have if you fell asleep in a high-level physics class. When I first found it I was reminded a lot of Super Hexagon, but I prefer Boson X beacuse while both games are about timing and pattern recognition, in Boson X there are more ways to accomplish the same goal and a bit more oppurtunity for recovery if things don't go exactly as planned. The soundtrack is repetitive so I reccomend muting the sound and turning on your own music.\n\nMy partner is red/green colorblind and has a hard time identifying which platforms are energy, given that each level uses different colors and the colors invert after beating the level. But to all of you spectrally challenged gamers out there the pulsing pattern of the energy platforms versus the "will-collapse" platforms is different, so if you pay attention to that you should be good.\n\nAll in all I would reccomend this game.

It is 5 bucks but it is only kind of entertaining. However it is unnecesarily difficult. Also straightforward in terms of gameplay but the developer/s could have dropped the difficulty down a bit. Granted I have beaten the game and got all of the achievements but it was pure madness getting there. I guess if you need a game to get all of the achievements just to have a completed game it's worth it, but it will be a bumpy ride. The gameplay is just playing as a character running through an obstacle course avoiding falling off stage or running into hazards, and they really got away with that. Like I said the game is straight forward and not cryptic in the slightest so figuring out what to do is not an issue.

Like seriously, you're only going to get yourself more stressed than you already were on first place. Although I had my share of fun, now that I've finished it, I never want to see it again. So please devs, don't you dare to make a sequel such as 'Boson X² - The revenge' because I'll surely buy it and probably write another similar review (if I actually manage to survive until the end).\nOk, now for an overall scope: The graphics are ok, the soundtrack not that much but that's ok, because I've played while listening to my own playlist. The level design is simply insane and somehow reminded of this DOS game called 'Skyroads' (which I always loved). Besides that, it's really cool the fact that you're able to select different characters to play with, because it'd be unfair for a single soul to receive such a large amount of punishment during the research. Last but not least, if you're looking for a good challenge for a fair price, this game is definitely for you.\n\nNow just as a bonus, here's a transcript of my experience with this game:\n\n\nNew Level\n- These textures are seriously broken! Oh wait, it's meant to be like that.\n- Look at THAT. I'll never get through this thing.\n\n\nDeaths\n- So why am I still alive? Ah, of course, I'm not.\n- What does this blinking red platform do? Oh, that...\n- Oh no, not that crazy pattern once more...\n- What the...?! Three of these in a row! Three in a bloody row!!!\n- Dang! I won't make that mistake again!\n- ... I've just made the same mistake again.\n- Come on, I definitely kept the button pressed on that jump.\n- Almost there! I'm gonna make it! I'm gonna make it! No, I'm not...\n- 99,18%!!! Oh, the humanity!!!\n- Well, I suppose that it can't get harder than that...\n- ... It actually can.\n\n\nLevel Cleared\n- 100%!!! Yeah, now let's try to...

There are 18 levels here of varying difficulty; from Normal Geon to Anti-Boson X. I have spent 4 hours collecting achievements (beating the game) and the rest of my time shooting for top 1000 (then 500) scores on each level.\n\nI played the free version before this, but the Dark and Anti versions of each particle were a pleasant new feature. They are NOT retools or reskins of one another.  Each stage usually retains the same core structure (gravitron likes moving/falling platforms, Y boson is a big fan of electric beams, etc.) but otherwise each level is fresh and unique.\n\nPlayers with slow reaction times WILL have trouble with the later levels. This game gets pretty darn rediculous, especially once you take on the Anti particles. Anti Gravitron had me stuck for a good 30 minutes (1/8 of the time I was playing).\n\nThis is a very good game in my opinion. While it may not be a genre-definer like Super Meat Boy or a masterfully crafted experience like Limbo, it's nice for good quick fun, a coffee break or a reflex test.","October 1, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is 5 bucks but it is only kind of entertaining. However it is unnecesarily difficult. Also straightforward in terms of gameplay but the developer/s could have dropped the difficulty down a bit. Granted I have beaten the game and got all of the achievements but it was pure madness getting there. I guess if you need a game to get all of the achievements just to have a completed game it's worth it, but it will be a bumpy ride. The gameplay is just playing as a character running through an obstacle course avoiding falling off stage or running into hazards, and they really got away with that.

Or if you just want some of the most tense gameplay you'll ever experience, then this will also be for you.  As someone who normally doesn't like fast-paced games like these, I was surprised by how much I enjoy Boson X.  It has a very unique concept (though prone to comparisons with Super Hexagon, which came out around the same time) and it continually gets interesting in new ways.\n\nIt only has 18 levels, six of which I had already played in the alpha version before release, but the game does not get stale at any point.  Every level does something unique and forces the player to get used to a new challenge before continuing to the next one.  The pace of the game forces players to think quickly before making a decision, usually ending in instant death, but steady progress makes the deaths feel rewarding regardless of how difficult the levels are.\n\nLike many other hardcore games, the feeling of completing a level is very satisfying, but due to the simplicity of the game's mechanics and the innovation that is done with the game's simplicity, the frustration that usually accompanies that feeling is present to a far smaller degree than usual.  The different aesthetics of each level are an integral factor to the level's challenge, but they also look absolutely beautiful at times and give each stage its own identity. The Dark X Boson level in particular has a creative design that both looks incredible and takes a very long time to get used to.\n\nThere is only one negative aspect I've found with the game, and that is the soundtrack.  The music is repetitive and gets annoying very quickly as a level is attempted many times.  Fortunately, the game gives the option to mute the music so that players can choose their own soundtrack.  It's sometimes easier to simply play in silece as it allows for uninterrupted focus on the game.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the $3 for several hours of exciting gameplay and very well designed levels.  I cannot recommend Boson X enough.","April 2","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
