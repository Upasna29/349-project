I've playerd the IOS Version of the game and really like it, so i had to check it out. When i watched the trailer i was in shock with how much better the Graphics were compared to the IOS Version.  I bought the game thinking that it would have better detail, new planes, and more missions espicially with the price tag of $9.99.  I was wrong, when i played it for the first time i noticed that everything was exactly the same in comparison to the IOS Version. I was deeply disappointed knowing that i wasted $9.99 for a game that i already had for $0.99. Im not saying that Sky Gamblers is a bad game but i dont recommend the PC version when you can get the game for $0.99 on IOS.","January 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","68","88","9","3"

And there is only one reason for it, too hard to learn and play.\n\nSaying this, I was quiet intrigued with this game just because it looks fun. Let me tell you I was spot on. You do not have to remember how to start an engine and all the rest. All you have to do is to push up the throttle and you get to the fight within a minute and shoot planes. “RIGHT NOW AT 3 O’CLOCK!”\n\nAll fighter planes from the era are well represented in this game. Graphically, this game could have been better but you can’t have everything. To be honest they are decent.\n\nFor the controls side of it, I think using the mouse and keyboard is about as weird as it sounds. It will take you a little time to master both setups anyway.\n\nYou can play as a single player and have 3 campaigns at your disposal (Pacific, Africa and Battle of Britain). You also have a survival, capture the flag, dogfight, team deathmatch and defend the base which can be played against the AI. Multiplayer mode is also available.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n-	Challenging and really fun to play\n-	Plenty of modes including multiplayer\n-	Runs smoothly\n-	Stack of achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n-	Controls slightly sluggish\n\nOverall, this game is worth $9.99 and I really enjoyed it!\n\n8/10\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","January 16, 2015","true","5.8"," 43 of 68 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","43","68","3","2"

Nothing against those games, but sometimes I just don't have the time to devote to them.\n\nSky Gamblers turned out to be the game I was looking for.  It's easy to pick up and play, has a good variety of planes and combat scenarios, and it also supports joysticks.  After a short tutorial that teaches you the basics, you're off!\n\nThe graphics aren't going to push a 980ti to it's limits, but the game still looks good.

I started with Air Supremacy, and purchased Storm Raiders as soon as it was made available for android. I love the game, and I am SOOO glad to have it on a 60" HD TV right now instead of my Note 3. The game is actually smoother on the PC than on my phone, and the total lack of IAP's in the Steam version makes it worth the price. some of the planes in the game on IOS,OSX, and Android store versions are purchase only, as well as being charged for the "weapon hanger" which allows you to customize weapons and limited Paint packs which allow you to customize the paint on your plane. The steam version requires some unlocking (the baddest planes in the game require you to beat the last dogfight mission to get them rather than a purchase of $2-3 apiece.) All in all I'm VERY satisfied with the purchase, and overjoyed that this version of the game plays cross platform. it's always been interesting playing against Mac players from my phone, and I'm glad I can finally view it on the big screen myself!","January 10, 2015","true","74.6"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","1"

It reminds me a bit of War Thunder a bit in that the game is very easy to jump into.  Some will undoubtedly complain that the game is cheaper on the iOS, but I admittedly don't have an iOS in which to base a comparison.  I'm not a developer nor do I have experience in publishing a game onto digital distribution services, but I'm assuming the fees may be higher which would account for the difference in price...then again, I could be wrong.  Regardless, $10 is still a good value for what you're getting here, what with the different game modes, campaign, and multiplayer.  It's an easy recommend for those who enjoy "light" flight sims focused more on "pew pew" as opposed to those that require you to commit eight hours in order to figure out how to turn the engine on.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLJYNw7RwaU","January 16, 2015","true","1.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/304910/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Sky Gamblers: Storm Raiders is the third game in the Sky Gambler series, previously released as mobile games. As a result, this is turn-and-burn only, but for a WW2 turn and turn, it's surprisingly fun and decently balanced with some interesting complexities should you wish to delve into such.\n\nFor a mobile port, this game is actually quite good. Terrain and flying area is nice and big, objects are not oddly scaled (things are tiny in a distance). Details are not PC standard, but quite workable. Enemy planes break apart when you kill them, with a wing falling off, then the whole things spins and twists like a falling leaf. And so on. Ground targets can hide among trees but that's why you have rockets and bombs. Or for naval targets, you have torpedoes and bombs.\n\nThe engine can be "boosted" for a short period of high speed, but engine will overheat after X seconds, and may shut down altogether (but it will restart once you cooled off). Guns will also overheat and prone to jamming should you held down the trigger for too long. The temp gauge on either weren't too obvious though.\n\nThere's quite a bit of decent single player content (2-3 campaigns, plus survival mode and dogfight mode) as well as full set of mulitplayer games including Capture the Flag, Free for All, and so on. There's also three difficulty levels so rookies can feel free to dive right in.\n\nDon't expect too much realism, as you have P-40 Warhawks fighting the Luftwaffe, or Hurricane carrying torpedoes, and so on. A fighter here do often carry bombs. And many of the scenarios have you attempting to race to the airfield before your fuel runs out on a timer, not on actual fuel consumption. On the other hand, they can be quite exciting, and these missions do have checkpoints so if you fail, you aren't forced to start from the beginning.\n\nControls are easy enough, though the gamepad support should be better, as there needs to be some custom mapping. For games that supports such, I do "RC controls" (i.e. stick one controls elevator and roll, while stick two controls throttle and rudder) and this game was able to do such, but it wasn't the default.\n\nOn some game types you can customize your plane, both paint job and the primary/secondary weapons, and choices are plenty, some are good for ground work, some are good for air attacks.\n\nWith four classes of planes (fighter, bomber, jet, and legend), there are plenty of choices and lots of customization options. Legend class contains very iconic fighters as well as some prototypes that never made it into service but were very good planes.\n\nThe interface is a little weird as often you have to rely on dragging to show more panels as there are no obvious signs there are more choices below; legacy of coming from a touch interface.\n\nAll in all, SGSR is a pretty good game, for the turn-and-burn crowd. Don't expect "realism", flight model, and so on.","March 26, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I personally play it with a joystick and I have to say for a phone port this game has better joystick response than War Thunder when last i played that game.  I had no trouble mapping buttons or with responsiveness in Storm Raiders compared to the buggy and mouse bias War Thunder which is a flight simulation game.  That aside I really have been enjoying this game.\n\nPros:\n-Very easy to fly, it's just throttle up and you're off, this is an arcade game after all.\n-3 Difficulty settings.\n-Simple 3 modes wingman support: Attack / Defend / Formation\n-Multiple control types supported, works great with a flight stick. (I use the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro)\n-Good graphics, effects, & atmosphere music with the exception of one of the campaign missions.\n-Larger scale air battles with large maps, you'll get into some decent furballs here.\n-Three short campaigns filled with fun as well as several solo game modes that mimic the multiplayer games.\n-Active multiplayer online matches. (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, & Destroy the Base.)\n-Unlimited bullets with a heat mechanic, recharged rockets/bombs/torpedos mechanic. (Also a con for those who want realism.)\n-Toggle Aim Assist, personally I found it easier with this disabled as I could kill enemies from outside the lead que range.\n-New aircraft are earned by completing the campaigns and leveling up, you don't have to purchase them like the phone version.\n\nCons:\n-There's only one internal cockpit model used in every plane, very sad. :(\n-The campaigns are pretty short, about 5-6 missions long each it wont take long to finish them. (Also a pro for casuals.)\n-For those that like realism, there's unlimited ammo & a radar system. (Again, it's an arcade game.)\n-The physics are not the greatest but only really is bothersome when landing, if you cut your engine by boosting too much, or running out of fuel via campaign event. (There is no actual fuel consumption.) My first landing in this game dropped me dead from 2 meters up for a successful three point landing vtol style.  If you want a more realistic landing don't try to coast, go in low at 50% and grind the ground, wheels deploy automatically and then drop the throttle back. When you run out of fuel or kill your engine (temp only) you quite literally will start to drop straight down shortly after, there is no gliding in this game.\n\nReally there isn't a whole lot about this game that bothers me, I really like flight games like the Ace Combat series up to game 5. (Assault Horizon was just a disappointment.)  While this game isn't an Ace Combat with an amazing story I found the gameplay engaging and fun.  At $9.99 I feel the game is well worth it.","April 20, 2015","true","19.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I guess you can use your keyboard, but I have a joy stick, and it seems to work  pretty well. The enemy planes, at times, seem to be too much to handle. The more planes you shoot down.....the more they keep coming to attack you. At times it appears that there is no end. The "bombing missions" airplanes are difficult to adjust too. I havn't yet passed that feature. But, the "dog-fights" many and are good. The "Pearl Harbor" Japenese bombing attack appears to be never-ending. I cannot shoot enough of the Japanese planes down to get to the next level or event. When I think that I destroyed their whole fleet of bombers and fighters, more and more seem to appear. But,  i will keep trying. Perhaps their isn't an ending?  At the beginning of the game, you have a choice of various planes...and "load-outs." The American P-40 is a good plane to fight with  during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 12/07/1942. During the Japenese attack at Pearl Harbor, the most logical plane to use is the American P-40. After all, its a historical fact, that the P-40 was the ONLY U.S. fightrer plane that was defending Pearl in the air. The other P-40's were destroyed on the ground at Hickam AFB and other airfields throughout the island. The Japanese, did their home-work, so to speak...they knew exactly where all of our planes were located...and unfortunately they were all on the airfield wide-open for the Japanese attackers to destroy. Unfortunately, the  American crews and their pilots were destroyed...i.e., even before they had a chance to warm-up their engines and get into the air. Only a few P-40s made it into the air. Those few were up against hundreds of Japanese fighters. The Americans did not have ANY other plane airborne to defend Pearl. The only exception was a flight of old B-17 Bombers, their were airborne and  coming from the east (Hamilton AFB a base near San Francisco, CA) destined for  Hickam AFB at Pearl. I can now see the faces on the B-17 pilots and crews when they appeared over Pearl...i.e., in the middle of watching the Japs attack Pearl  Harbor...i.e., with little or almost no resistance from the Americans. I think these guys were fortunate enough to land at Hickam, and their crews got out of their planes and ran for cover. The Japanese more than likely destroyed some if not all of the B-17s while on the ground at Pearl. The Admerial and General in charge at Pearl...quickly after the attack, were justly and  immediated "fired"....because of their gross incompetency. Anyway, during the attack, there were only a few P-40s in the air, and.they were completely out-matched by the Japanese fighters. But, they did shot down a few Jap fighters and bombers.  At the beginning, of the game it allows you to choose what type of weapons(load-out)  you want on your plane.  Cannons, michine guns, or bombs. The British "Spitfire" is another good plane to fly. The German(Nazi) Jet fighter is also one of my favorite planes to use. The game keeps score, and after each event, if you did well, you are graded, and  just perhaps promoted. Overall I give this game a satisfactory score. The price is reasonable.","April 20, 2015","true","52.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's one of those easy-to-learn-hard-to-master games that seems simple at first, but over time you'll learn there is depth to the combat. With close to 30 planes, all with varying stats and play-styles, you'll find something you like. The single player places you in one of three theatres of war across the globe during WWII. The difficulty ranges from ♥♥♥♥-easy to OMFG-EJECT EJEC-(explosion). You'll fly sorties for the British and the Americans fighting against Germany and Japan, all while utilizing various frames: fighter, bomber, and special role planes. Each with there own unique weapons. Frames are unlocked by perfoming  campaing missions or playing multiplayer. The weapon and plane specifications could use an EXPLINATION, however. I'm not sure what some of these symbols mean, but I'm sure there is a wiki on it somewhere. Multi-player is fun and has several modes: capture the flag, defend the base, deathmatch, team deathmatch, last-man-standing, survival (horde, you and team versus NPCs) and even a free-flight mode for the achievment horses to mingle! In a market thourghly saturated with hyper-violent, grim and sexual content, this game is a breathe of fresh air. I would feel comfortable letting my kids play this game.\n\nFinal verdict: this game is good, not great, but with patching it has the potential for excellence.

Campaign isn't especially challenging, and it doesn't take a lot of time to unlock every plane and varient, but the multiplayer is well done and there are many ranks that seem impossible to reach. Overall, it is a great game, and the fact that it is compatible with the mobile app means that you can play friends that don't have steam. I would certainly recommend this game to any of my compatriots, as you need a couple of friends to play to keep the game interesting.","July 28, 2015","true","60.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For instance, fly upside down while playing, does the aircraft begin descending or does it fly straight as if in space with no resistance or drag? To some this may seem trivial, but to me i use this gravity to my advantage in dogfighting and most importantly, it adds immersion. Give it a try its a good game and i recommend it bc the developers look like they cared for this game and did a pretty good job for an arcade game. I bought this seeing the simulation tag and i believe that should be removed so as not to confuse others who are expecting a more simulating experience.","March 13","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I was in school, one of my favorite games for the PS2 was Secret Weapons over Normandy. This game feels similar with a bit more contol, which is a good thing. There are lots of planes to unlock, ranging from early WWII fighters to jets that came in toward the end of the war. Different campaigns have you flying planes from both Allied and Axis sides. Combat is fast and fun. The music is pretty decent.\n\nIf you're a person who needs every single aspect of flight rendered in perfect scientific detail, this game might not be for you, but if you're like me and you love WWII planes, this game is a great investment for only 10 USD. If you get it when it's on sale, even better!\n\nCons to be aware of:\nNo voice acting. All mission prompts are via text on screen. My vision sucks so I missed some.\nSeveral planes, but it feels like more could have been added. 99 cent DLCs with 5-8 planes would be nice.\nMusic can get a bit repetitive, but you don't notice if you're fighting.\nI can't figure out how to lower landing gear.\n","June 5","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
