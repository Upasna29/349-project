This is a text based sports sim, and the best one out there on college football.  Basically you run a D1 football program.  You are in charge of recruiting, the budget, hiring and firing coordinators and you can call plays during the games if you would like to.  The game even gives you some latitude on scheduling and player training.  If you are looking for an arcade game this is not for you, but if you like deep text based sports sim, this would be a good one for you to check out.","September 4, 2015","true","397.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","37","42","4","1"

While it currently still harbors some techinical problems, it is still a solid game.\n\nPros\n+ In depth stats\n+ Ability to structure custom playbook\n+ Original BCS NC, 4 team, or 16 team playoff options\n+ Academic suspensions\n+ Shifting conferences\n+ Setting of depth chart and CPU in-game strategy\n\nNegatives\n- Basic coaching options\n- Occasional game crashes\n- Over-simplfied recruiting\n\nThe game can be as simple or in depth as you want. You can play an entire season in 20 minutes or several hours. The recruiting is good overall, however it feels a little bland at many times. But offseason activities are far better than any college dynasty game I have seen before. If you enjoyed OOTPB or Football Manager, this will feel a little more shallow as it isn't at that level yet. But it is a solid addition to manager sims and is worth playing if you are a college football fan","September 6, 2015","true","25.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","27","32","2","0"

As you can imagine, this is extremely frustrating.\n\nThe UI isn't always particularly user-friendly either; I spend most of my time during the recruiting section of the game flicking back and forth between my (in-game) emails and the recruiting screen to follow advice which is in said emails, making an otherwise enjoyable aspect of the game tedious and grindy. Simply populating the player info screen with suggested recruit pitches after scouting, rather than slowly growing adding to them week on week, would be a quick fix here. Similarly, full information on player injuries isn't available in your depth chart, so you have to flick back and forth between emails and depth chart to update the position of players who are fit to play but haven't fully recovered. If you could get the medical staff report either in the player info screen or simply by hovering over their name in the depth chart I would save a fair bit of time. There's more on this but I won't drone on.\n\nFinally, calling the plays in a game can be very hollow and frustrating at times, not because this is a text-based sim, but because there is no kind of play-by-play feedback or general analysis to explain why a certain play is/isn't working, making play-calling fairly arbitary as long as you stay within the confines of common sense. A simple pop-up from the relevant co-ordinator explaining in more detail what happened on each play would help give a clearer picture of why a play succeeded/failed and help to make more informed decisions later on.\n\nThere are things I do love about the game, like the subject matter and the fact that it even exists. I've had some really enjoyable moments when playing and there's a real sense of satisfaction from building your team's prestige and attracting better recruits as the seasons wear on. Unfortunately that just isn't enough to keep me coming back for more agonising crashes and motonous offfseason tabbing. While it would be foolish to expect the kind of polish you would expect from a game like Football Manager, given the difference in budget and price, I would have hoped for a slicker overall product. If the issues I mentioned above are fixed then I will come back to this game in a heartbeat, but until then I'll just content myself with watching CFB.","September 15, 2015","false","82.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiegroundhog/recommended/398640/","aussiegroundhog","Groundhog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiegroundhog/","190 products in account","When playing through the franchise modes of a modern sport game like NBA 2K or, to a lesser extent, Madden, it’s hard to believe that there was a time when the only place you could find the multi-season GM-like experience of these titles was the world of text simulations. The trade-off with these text sims was that they there were usually a one-man operation, with 99% of the time and effort spent trying to replicate accurate stats and finances of the sports they were simulating, and the remaining 1% spent quickly hobbling together a GUI to present all the information.\n\nBowl Bound College Football was one of the first among the new breed of text sims. By moving away from the ‘one-man operation’ model to employ others specialising in areas such as 2D graphics and UIs, BBCF attempted  to merge the strengths of text sims – the multi-season experience, and statistical accuracy – with a GUI that also didn’t look like an excel spreadsheet. It succeeded. Despite the fact that the game has been out for some time now, the UI is still clean and modern looking, and little touches like player portraits for the generated players was years ahead of the 3D-based sporting titles. Even the BBCF simulation screen foreshadows the type of display we expect to see today in ‘quicksim’ screens in these 3D titles.\n\nGraphics aside though, BBCF alse does the kind a great job simulating the kind o fcollege football experience – recruiting, strategy, statistical accuracy – that you expect from any text sim worth its salt. In any sports game, be it text sim or graphical, my favourite aspect is rebuilding a team into a winner, and the college world of sports is perfect for this given the continual overhaul needed to replace graduated players. Even after all these years – ignore my Steam stats, I’ve had this title on my PC for close to a decade - I fire it up from time-to-time and embark on yet another career.\n\nWith no other college football game around or even on the horizon, BBCF is a fine option to satisfy your college football hunger. Hopefully one day we see the long-rumoured Pro football version released!","September 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazyorange/recommended/398640/","krazyorange","Starfarts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazyorange/","289 products in account","This is a game that should be great but clearly lacks the TLC of a passionate developer. I'll give the breakdown first for the impatient, then explain in more detail underneath that. Disclaimer: I grabbed this one for ten bucks (50% off) over on Amazon during the first week of December 2015, so that probably affects my judgment somewhat.\n\nPROS---It perfectly captures the feel of my university days spent playing NCAA '09 on my PS2 with two lukewarm 40s of King Cobra on either side and a backup controller for when I smash the one in my hands against my apartment's concrete walls. Except without the trips to Gamestop for new controllers.\n---Playcalling during games is easy. The recommended plays also seem to adapt to those that have been effective against the current team, which can lead to big gains.\n---It's a college football game on PC...or even a college football game at all, which apparently isn't even a thing any longer.\n---The management aspect straddles the line between user-friendly and 6deep9me very well, which allows it to be accessible for everyone while supplying tons of data for those of us who are stats ♥♥♥♥♥s. (I mean, I used to keep a notepad file of my completed seasons in NCAA '09. How obsessive is that? Here you can export things to Excel spreadsheets extremely easily.)\n---The game trusts you to be an adult; there is a player and coach editor built in that allows you to do whatever you want to the stats. Sadly, it doesn't allow changes to appearance. Playing with linemen who look like yetis never felt better. On the flip side, adding your favorite IRL player is easy, as long as you don't mind him looking like an anthropomorphic ♥♥♥♥.\n---Installing the mod for real teams takes about five seconds,\n\nNEUTRAL---Besides the real teams mod, user support for the game is nonexistent. It looks like there might have been mod support five or ten years ago, but certainly not any more.\n---No sound effects, music, or fullscreen. None of that bothered me, as I listen to my own music while playing most games. And the fullscreen wasn't a problem for me; I just kept a chat window open or watched hentai or /wildcrazy or whatever off to the side.\n\nCONS---More drops than Sprint. Seriously, you thought dropped passes were a problem in action football games? This is a whole new level.\n---Extremely cheap match engine cheeses you hardcore in the fourth quarter, no matter what the score or how good your players are (more on this below).\n---Match engine hangs momentarily after plays. It's not a problem if you only play one game per session, but if you play for several hours at a time, it's incredibly frustrating.\n---Award watch list throughout the season is useless. The player who will actually win any given award is never actually on the list, or at least never near the top. Confirmed this through simulating further seasons. What's the point of the list, then?\n---Rankings system throughout the season is useless. I was unranked as Western Kentucky until the bowl season, then shot to #2 in the computer and #10 in the main poll after one week (then #1 in the postseason). True to form, I got a worthless matchup against a 6-6 Cincinnati, so at least that's realistic. But all season and even in the final rankings, .500 and even sub-.500 teams were routinely in the top-25, which is obviously ludicrous. Also, in no reality ever would a C-USA team be ranked in the top five, particularly when any other team in the top-25 refuses to schedule a match against me. (As a sub-remark, Brandon Doughty and/or a C-USA QB would never win the Heisman. Sorry.)\n---The game is clearly out-of-date. For example, there are still five-yard facemask penalties, the extra points are still from the 2.5 yard line, and there is absolutely no evolution of the spread offense. Running a pass-heavy offense is possible (more below), but trying to role-play it isn't very fun because 80% of your plays are going to be from single back or I-set formations. As a sub-remark, it should be noted that the dev did patch in CFB playoffs. Why he left all the other outdated stuff in is another example of no TLC.\n---There are no AI sliders, and exploiting the AI in the first three quarters is easy with a competent quarterback and at least one receiver who graduated to the Verizon School.\n---There is also no record-keeping, so when you BTFO an NCAA record, there are no congratulations. I know the game doesn't come with the NCAA license, duh, but I'm sure there was a way to get something like this in there somehow.\n---There is hardly anything to do during the season besides play the games.\n---The official forums are a laugh. Unless I'm a complete idiot (possible; I did go to a Big Ten school), you can only see threads from the last thirty days. So what if I want to find tips, tricks, or any other information on a ten-year old game? Too bad. And good luck getting any answers from the Steam community, that place is drier than my post-grad sex life.\n---I played one entire season without a single crash--16 hours of gameplay. This was pleasing, as many people in the reviews complained about the instability. Then I spent two hours recruiting in the offseason, advanced to the final week, and the game handed me an APPCRASH. Not only that, but opening any other program in Windows supplied me with a strange "out of RAM" error that I've never seen before, even though Task Manager showed I had over seven gigs free. My PC takes about 10-15 minutes to fully recover from a reset (don't I ♥♥♥♥ing know it), so this was a massive rage moment. Two hours lost + the reset time.\n---Absurd, entry-level typos/grammatical errors in the play-by-play text and in the game. Most people probably won't notice them, but it's a prime example of the lack of TLC that I mentioned above. (EX: "QB's" instead of "QBs")\n\nCONCLUSIONEven after all the hate, I'll still give it a reluctant 4/10. I doubt I'll play for hundreds of hours like other people on Steam have, but I've already gotten 18 hours out of it (though two were completely wasted). It's college football, and it's a sports management game. It's not going to compete with FM, but it will occupy you for a few hours. Definitely get it on sale. It's not worth twenty, it's barely worth ten unless you're a sports management nut or are really looking for some football on the PC. $7.50 or under is the sweet spot.\n\nMOAROnce the clock strikes midnight on the third quarter, the game engages Maximum Cheddar Mode. In fourteen games, my quarterbacks threw fourteen interceptions. All fourteen came in the fourth quarter. My players lost sixteen fumbles. Twelve came in the fourth quarter. In one game I held the opposing QB to 37 yards passing through three. He ended the game with 411. In the entire season, my team allowed 137 points, good for second in the nation. 105 came in the fourth quarter. I've tried manually subbing players, letting the AI sub players, and leaving my tip-top-tier starters in the whole game. It absolutely does not matter: fourth quarter AI will destroy you with its cheese.\n\nIn another game, Brandon Doughty was 45-49 for 441 yards with 5 TDs through three. I really wanted to win the Heisman, so I left him in to run up the stats and the score. He finished 47-71 for 470 with 5 TDs and 2 INTs. Yeah, that's fair. Good job, game. Joke's on them, I guess, since he finished the year 510-750 for 6543 yards with 57 TDs and 11 INTs...along with the Heisman and the Davey O'Brien.\n\nAs I said before: once you figure out how to exploit the AI, it's simple to run up the score [in the first three quarters]. This game desperately needs sliders to adjust the difficulty. Sure, I was playing the C-USA with a good quarterback, but my starting running back shouldn't catch 106 screen passes for 1167 yards out of the shotgun. Maybe if this was online Madden on the Xbox against a 12-year old that would work, but not in a supposedly-realistic simulator.","December 15, 2015","false","18.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","8"

The only thing that currently holds it back is that the game was released right before the huge change over to all of the various spread option formations and philosophies that now exists in college football circa 2006. It is good that the developer is now beginning to provide updates to the game once again and hopefully this will be added in the near future.\n\nThat being said I have heard some in the community for this game say that a new game is needed. The engine for the game is actually quite good and truthfully if they would provide an update that would make this game more comparable to current day college football I think really that would be all that would be needed to bring excitment back to this game. The current price tag for the game at $14.99 is definitely worth the price but just that one update would in my opinion bring about not only more sales but excitment back to the game once again.","September 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

However, they are nowhere near what they used to be.  Key hint here is to make sure to have at least two different saves going for your world so that if one gets corrupted, you have the back up.  All you do is in game options add a 1 to the save file and keep flipping back and forth.

This game doesn't have nearly the bells and whistles of a AAA title like OOTP or FM series but it compares favorably in many ways and in some ways falls quite a bit short.\n\nThe biggest annoyance by far is the frequent crashing and lack of hyperlink based navigation.  The game seems to have a memory leak and will freeze every other season or so.  This would be a huge deal if it had auto save feature and/or didn't require a entire system reboot in order to come back.   Luckily I have learned to frequently save and the game does always load after a reboot -- haven't lost a single save yet (knock on wood).\n\nThe navigation is clunky at best and the game won't scale fullscreen as well.  These are two huge "quality of life" issues and I really hope with the increased scrutiny and money from Steam sales they fix this.  I would love to be able to play this game in 1440p and to have hyperlinks for players, conferences, etc.\n\n\nThose annoyances aside -- I pretty much lost last weekend to this game, it's that compelling.  Following recruiting is as addictive as real life (can I can get that 5 star???) and quite realistic as well.  If you don't spend the $$$, time and have a high enough prestige you'll often have to settle for 3 star prospects or offer few 4 stars at a few understocked positions while enticing them with immediate playing time, which the AI seems to do a good job recognizing from what I can tell;   I offered a 5 star RB with only middling prestige and when I offered him playing time (I had zero good back on the roster after graduating my two seniors) he ended up committing.\n\nBut go after too many very hightly touted recruits as a middling school and you'll just end up with a handful of walk on levels players after everyone leaves you hanging.\n\nThat said, if you recruit 3 stars into your team that excel at areas you want to play them (say  athlete QB on an option team) you can build a program -- more slowly, but you can.\n\nI don't personally get too deep into the game plan besides occasionly stepping in on a big down and guiding the way, but from what I've read you can spend hours just setting up the weekly strategy.  I don't prefer that level of micromanagent but if you do the option is there.\n\nBut as far as gameplay and replay value this game is just as addictive as the FM Series or OOTP.  The simulation is usually solid (hey, these things are hard, you will occssionaly see the absurd like 7 fumbles in one game from one team) and the gameplay is solid all around from the simulation engine itself to the big picture stuff like choosing your coaches and gameplan and recruiting.\n\nI recommend this game but it is with some hesitation as for some on smaller monitors (I have a 27" 1440p on my main gaming rig) the text is unreadable and the constant crashing is a pretty major annoyance as well.\n\nBut given that this game is only, $15, if you have a large monitor and enjoy sports sims, pick it up now you'll consider it money well spent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 14, 2015","true","107.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I will edit this once I have time to play the game. Leaving the initial problem at the bottom in case others run into this.\n\nOk, got in nearly 2 seasons of playing. I think I will eventually figure the game out but it does not have a very friendly interface. Some things are just not available such as auto-depth setting without putting injured players in. So if I have a questionable running back, I can not tell the game to not play him and still do an auto set. Then there are the injuries themselves. One of my RB's pulled his groin and the report said something like "he could play but we advise setting him out 1 week". 2 weeks later he is in no different shape and still injured. When I quit in season 2, I think it was the 5th or 6th conference game, I had 12 players injured. That's a bit high, and I could live with it if the players recovered at a normal rate. I tried to check if the CPU teams had the same injury numbers, but couldn't figure out how to look.\n\nGetting past the minor annoyances, and actually tracking my players, it is nice to see them develop as the season progresses. At least twice a year, maybe three times, they have an update on abilities. I started a freshman QB that was not very good, but had good potential and he has had some great games as well as a few more not so great. We have not won but 2 games so far.\n\nIf you want a challenge, love American Football, and have gotten your fill of the EA Monopoly (which begs the question why haven't they been sued like Microsoft was? lol) then this game should be on your list. I look forward to spending more time on it and hopefully making it to the playoffs. BTW, almost every aspect of the managing *could* be CPU controlled if you elect for that.\n\n* NOTE * I could not get the game to run properly when I first purchased it, and the indications were below. Leaving it here in case others run into it.\n\nSadly this game does not like my 4k monitor, and it forces Internet Explorer to open in two process. I use Firefox and as such IE is not setup on my system. No mention of needing IE in the requirements.\nThe window for the game opens and has white space at the bottom and right side.\n\nIf you are having this problem, check the comments to find the fix from Scott Vibert.","September 9, 2015","true","28.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","5"

I've logged 23 hours according to Steam and so far I've had the game lock up to the point where I had to restart my PC, straight up crash, and have had my save file corrupted after completing my first season.  The stability issues are really unfortunate because I'm having so much fun with the game so far.\n\n--Pros--\n\n+ Easy to learn while also maintaining some serious depth\n+ Game engine produces some good sim results\n+ UI is above average considering how old the game is\n+ With a few exceptions, the menus don't require much back-and-forth to see everything you need\n+ Progression/development, Transfers, Recruiting all feel pretty well done\n+ I love that academic eligibility is a factor in maintaining your roster\n+ 4 team playoff is in the game\n\n--Cons--\n\n- Game breaking instability\n- Offensive schemes are a little out of date, notably missing variations of the Spread\n- Budgeting is really basic and rigid. Would love some more flexibility.\n- Inability to play full screen or maximize the game window\n- Could use some in-game sound (like OOTP or Football Manager)\n\nAll together, I think I've gotten my $20 worth. I would pay $40-$50 for a new version of the game that addressed many of the stability issues and rounded out some of the rough edges.  If you want to tough through the stability issues by frequently saving and backing up your file, it's a fun game to play. However, those crashese are definitely coming.
