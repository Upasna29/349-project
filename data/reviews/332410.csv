I don't know what the publisher of this game did on Steam to make it think it was in a beta before this, but it wasn't. It was sold as a full release, with collector's editions and everything. It is still a terrible game, and everything in this review is still valid.\n\nTL;DR: This sort of game is the reason RPGMaker things on steam have such a negative stigma. It exhibits incompetence at every level.\n\nI am now honestly surprised this game has net positive reviews on steam. I've been designing an RPGMaker game myself, and was looking around to see what sort of things had positive reviews on here. I have no idea what game the other reviewers were playing, but it wasn't this game.\n\n-The writing is atrocious. It reads like a bad fan-fic of someone elses fantasy world. There is no consistency in writing or tone, nor of the world the people were trying to build. In a purely fantasy setting, why is one character talking about her CV(resume)? The opening sequence was so bad that I immediately closed it and tried to get a refund. Too bad I was past my date for it. None of these characters read like real people. The writing was so bad that the best choice the designers made was including a 'talk to party' function, so I could skip past the horrible writing and still be able to figure out where I had to go. You still have to talk to every inane, useless, and pointless NPC in town for fear of missing a quest, so good luck talking to thirty some-odd NPCs with such riveting dialogue that is important to world building such as "I love this carpet!"\n\n-The battle balancing is also atrocious. You can be walking around a dungeon, fighting enemies that look like Hindu gods and Chimeras, and one shotting them easily, but 'deadly snake' can nearly wipe your party with repeated paralysis attacks. No warning or lead up, but I'm so glad that snake was tougher than any boss in the game I fought. You get no indication of what enemies are weak to or what spells work, so whether you choose attack or spells for a new enemy is entirely random, and so many of the clearly 'physical' characters have tons of useless attack spells as well, and quite a few casters don't get any attack spells for several levels that are of any use. You have so many spells to dispel an enemy's buff, but never run into enemies who actually buff themselves.\n\n-There is a fundamental level of incompetence in the coding itself. A spell that casts 4 fireballs, will also tick you for poison damage or regen for each fireball. An item that says 'revives and restores 100 life points' will revive and restore you to 1. You will clip right through cliffs and forests in maps. You will cast spells and wonder if they actually did anything, or if the fancy animation was the intended effect alone.\n\n-Map design is utterly ridiculous. Almost every map consists of 'overly long corridor, leading to dead end or to the next area, good luck picking'. Several -towns- are behind these dungeons, as well as quest items hidden in the inscrutable mazes that take hours to traverse. Thank god encounters aren't truly random, because I would have quit long before I did. Better finish those quests the first time you are in town, otherwise you'll have to treck through the whole dungeon again to get back...oh wait, the quest makes you do that anyway, because part of it is outside town. Several things are hidden in a dungeon, without any warning that you can never go back once you are finished, including quest items and summons.\n\n-The 'deluxe' edition has the official guide, which probably includes maps. I wonder if it also includes the developer laughing at the fact that you bought a 'deluxe' edition of this game.\n\nDo. Not. Buy. There are far, far better RPGMaker games for free, and even better ones available on steam.","September 14, 2015","false","18.9"," 201 of 245 people (82%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","82","201","245","15","18"

You know, the ones that you wouldn't spare much mental RAM for... and I've finally found it! Moonchild is a cute game that hails from Aldorlea Games - a really promising RPGMaker based developer team - that will easily offer you 20 hours of gameplay.\n\nIn a medieval fantasy realm, Queen Calypso's only daughter, Moonchild is abducted! Our honorable knight Gabriel was able to detain one of the heinous criminals, but the man apparently lost his memory. We start our journey to save Calypso's daughter. The word is that Moonchild isn't the only young noble woman who was abducted: daughters and wives of other local monarchs are missing too. During our travels, we'll consult the wisdom of elves, pass frozen wastes to find a Gifted in the ancient arts of mind, infiltrate the domain of our sworn enemy and even find a common cause to work alongside them. What kind of danger a mother wouldn't risk to take to save her child? It seems none...\n\nGraphics won't present you anything extraordinary, yet I found environment design to be fitting and beautiful within the limitations of RPGMaker. The game rewards exploring obscure dead ends, so nowhere you explore is an actual time loss. You always find some interesting item or a power up. Soundtrack is pretty, yet it becomes annoyingly repetitive after a while, so I strongly recommend muting the game and playing your own soundtrack in any of these 16 bit games - with some exceptions like ASM or FF series, of course.\n\nSomeone said gameplay? Oh, it's nothing unfamiliar. We have a 16 bit party of 4 characters at a time - in which we can arrange and alternate with other characters anytime outside of a battle - , turn based battles with basic strategies, enemies with different immunities and weaknesses. We battle, we gain experience and level up, we search for new items to power up and complete a side quest here and then. See, it is your basic RPG. The world isn't that big, neither that diverse, but the main story itself would present you a nearly 20 hour gameplay and its engaging enough. The game also comes with 3 different difficulties for you to pick based on your experience with these kind of games.\n\nI'd consider one minus to be achievements. They are mostly based on one specific character having a certain number of kills. It becomes boring to farm characters just for the sake of achievement, and it's a strategic dead-end. You'd already have a party formation that you like better by the middle of the game anyhow.\n\nAnother thing from the horse's mouth: the ending WAS an unexpected one for me, which is seriously rare in these 16 bit games. I didn't expect that outcome, not at all! You'd like a basic RPGMaker adventure with interesting enough story and cute characters? You've got it.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 29, 2015","true","17.5"," 52 of 81 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","52","81","3","3"

And Calypso isn't going to just stand by and wait for her people to "do something". Instead, she takes a faithful advisor and her weapon and follows the trail. As you can expect from Aldorlea, the story is thrilling and well executed, with a few twists.\n\nI'll say it straight, though. If you don't enjoy exploring dungeons, Moonchild is not game for you. Play Millennium instead. Because the dungeons are huge in this game. With multiple levels, dead ends and secret rooms. And switches, lots of switches - opening locked doors and gates, of course. And tons of treasures. And even more tons of enemies. Battles are frequent in Moonchild.\nFortunately, the battles are fun. You have enough characters to choose from, each of them with different spells and abbilities. So you can combine the party as you wish. The battles are turn-based, and with a good party and a bit of thinking, you can decimate the enemies pretty efficiently. Using support (resistances, healing and so on) and paralyzing spells plays a big role here, because it saves your resources in the long dungeons. The artworks are pretty good and together with the music add to the atmosphere and enjoyment.\nShould all the fighting be too much for you, it can sometimes be avoided, because the enemies are all visible. You have also Teleport spell at your disposal. It gets you from dungeon back to the last visited town instantly.\n\nLike in other Aldorlea games, thorough exploration pays off. Here it is true twice, because better spells and equipment means less consumption of healing items, prolonging time you are able to spend in dungeons without replenishing. It help a lot, especialy in harder modes.\nStill, overall Moonchild feels quite accessible for beginners. If you enjoy exploring vast dungeons and some strategy in turn-based battles, it's well worth playing.","May 14, 2015","true","12.6"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","32","47","4","0"

All characters are pretty interesting to play with and once you have more than four, it's often like, "Dang, who do I NOT take in my party, I want them all!", because they all have different spells and abilities that make them valuable members of the active party. There's even an optional character you can find and make him join you!\nIn addition to the spells they gain with levels there are books to purchase with more spells and you can decide yourself who to give them to.\nIt's also fun to discover the characters' personalities and see how they do or do not get along with each other. Most of all I enjoyed the dialogues with Susanna, one of the female characters. She's hilarious!\nThe character artworks are amazing. I'd say they are among the best of any Aldorlea game.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty modes, Easy, Casual and RPG. I'm usually playing Casual which is like Normal Mode in other games. In this mode I find everything pretty balanced and comfortable, yet not too easy to play. A nice asset in Casual Mode (and Easy Mode most probably) is that all characters gain back some HP after each fight. That way you can save your precious money for other stuff than restoratives. And you'll need it because there's a lot of cool equipment to buy, and until quite late in the game you have to work for your gold and think twice what to spend it on.\nIn the final town, however, there's a way to gain money more easily, which is a really cool thing.\n\nIn addition to the main quest, there are several side quests to solve if you want. Nice thing here is that throughout the game you collect all kinds of items and you never know whether or not they are useful. Some you might need for quests or other things though. But in this game you don't just talk to the right person with a quest item in your inventory and the quest will automatically be solved. Instead you need to actively select the right item and then see what happens. That's cool because you really need to think about how to accomplish things and try to figure out which items to use.\n\nThe only thing that I don't appreciate in this game is the way you acquire some of the items necessary to solve quests. I don't want to spoil anything for people who want to find out those things on their own, so all I'll say is that sometimes you really need to be lucky to get what you need, and there's at least one quest where it's highly unlikely that you do what's required to obtain a certain item. In my first playthrough this thing drove me crazy and I ended up being very frustrated until I eventually looked the solution up on the Aldorlea forum.\n\nAll in all though Moonchild is a very nice game with beautiful artworks, good dialogues, great characters and a nice story. And the finale is amazing - storywise as well as regarding the final battles. It will give you an adrenaline rush, no doubt!\nSo go ahead and try it! It's very much worth it!","May 14, 2015","true","24.4"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","20","26","3","0"

Good news, it seems they work totally fine despite some kind of warning and I even got some achievements unlocked from the very second I resumed my playthrough. They also made beautiful cards for it, always a good thing.\nThe game itself is a very solid RPG and one of the best from Aldorlea, in my humble opinion. It has fabulous character artworks (notably an extremely beautiful lady called Stardust but every character is pretty eye-candy to be honest) and a well-written story with an ending that will have you on the edge of your seat (no spoilers!). For an RPG it's not too big, not too small, about 20 hours if I recall correctly and overall the gameplay and difficult are well-balanced (I choose the easier mode each time, a good idea when playing a game by Aldorlea ).\nRecommended, 9/10","May 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","31","46","3","0"

Although there are a ton of things to do, see, and explore there is always a sense of urgency to find the child.\n\n\nThe key is exploration. Everywhere you go, there is a dungeon/maze type path to travel through to reach the immediate goal. You will need to search everywhere and everything as there are treasures galore, bountiful secrets. and a host of characters to talk to. Some have side quests for you to add to the list of things to do. It may sound a bit involved, but it all holds together perfectly.\n\n\nThe artwork and music are very nice, adding greatly to the enjoyment of the game.\n\n\nBattles are nicely conceived, and, depending on the level of difficulty chosen, can be quite a challenge.\n\n\nThe characters are very likeable, and there is quite a bit of emotion in this game that is not always found in rpgs.\n\n\nIt adds up to a really good rpg for fans of this type of game and should be on the must-play list.

After that, you’re presented with another choice – the difficulty you play on. You have one of three choices – RPG, Casual, or Story. RPG is hard mode, Casual is normal, and Story is easy. I had originally started the game on RPG but wasn’t really having much fun with how badly I was getting attritioned down. I decided to restart on Story so that I would be able to get through and review it.\n\nMoney is a big issue in this game. Luckily, if you’re on Story (Easy), you can often get away with not always buying the newest and best gear. A full dungeon clear would often net me enough to buy maybe a few pieces of equipment. I was generally only gearing a select few, though you’ll want to make sure you have enough gear for everyone at the end of the game! You’ll also want to spend a little time leveling up everyone.\n\nDungeon layouts are large. You’ll often walk down a path, see a way to go to another screen and think, hey, I bet that’s the way to go! Then you’ll find it in two other places. Be prepared to do a lot of backtracking because of this. Luckily (sometimes unluckily if you need to level), not all of the enemies you killed respawn when you re-enter a screen. Some enemies do however spawn when you walk over certain tiles, with it occasionally actually slowing down the game as it loads them in. It’s often not actually obvious this happens, though when they appear right in your face it becomes a bit more obvious then.\n\nMoonchild has a fair bit of default RPGMaker stuff built in though it did at least feel like it fit. There were some songs in it I hadn’t heard before so I’m not sure if they were original or just lesser used, but the general feel I got from the music was that it fit in. The lack of proper victory music was a bit off-putting though as the game transitioned from the battle music right back to the dungeon music.\n\nIf you’re looking for an RPGMaker game that you can make extremely challenging then check out Moonchild. It’s also decent if you’re just looking for a game you can get through the story of in around 10 hours (ignoring side quests). Want to do more? There’s a wide variety of achievements that will have you killing a lot of stuff with all of the characters. Unfortunately, some of the grammar in the game does fall apart, especially closer to the end. If I were to put my negatives on the game, it’s that it would have been nice if enemies actually dropped more money – especially ones that are tougher to respawn – and that there was quite a few grammar mistakes in the text. Other than that, I did enjoy my time playing Moonchild and would suggest it to others.","August 8, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

On the first look, it's the same as countless others RPG out there but once you start playing it, you will find that it's much better than your standard fare. Most of RPGs have the same basic story line of saving the world, so how that story is presented makes the difference and in that regard, Moonchild excels.\n\nStory: The dialogues are a bit weaker compared to Aldorlea's other games and that hurts the story immersion otherwise the general premise is well thought and engaging,\n\nGraphics: I have never really liked VX default style, and unfortunately Moonchild couldn't sway my opinion, Though the games does use lots of custom art and charsets so it should look great to people who don't mind the VX style.\n\nMapping: Again, VX graphics style break it for me. Everything is so blocky. v_v But in general, I think the mapping is decent.\n\nSound: Music used is appropriate and mostly the standard RPG fare.\n\nOther notes:\nAs is usual with Aldorlea games (and something I hopes other RPG games do), the player is rewarded for exploring the world. Items are hidden everywhere in the game and in my opinion, it makes the world seem more alive.\n\nSo to conclude, while this is not the best game from Aldorlea, it's decent and if you don't mind the VX-style graphics, you should go for it.","March 12","true","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Mother then goes and tries to find her missing daughter but along the way discovers that many royal females have gone missing to be used in a cult. This is a simple 16 bit graphic game with lovely settings and a variety of characters to help find Moonchild, but beware the enemies can get very hard to beat. There are a number of side quests that are optional but are worth doing to get rewards. Option also available is how you dress Calypso-the Queen. Enemies are visible using  a turn based fight. There are no secret rooms as found in other Aldorlea games but there are many hidden items on the world map and other areas. All characters ( except 1) can learn spells which are needed so it is advisable to level up as quickly as possible to get the best spells. Some areas have switch puzzles to enable so as to move to different parts of the dungeon and can be frustrating to manoeuvre but not  too difficult. There is not much  background story on any  of the characters nor on the lead-up to the kidnapping- story just centred on the actual rescue. The rescuing team consists of the Queen, her knight, a protector, a scholar, a titan, a gifted one, a caller, a spirit from the past, and a king but one of these is a traitor. The ending is not what is expected leaving one guessing.I liked the idea of the teams being split up for some of the game - it makes it just that little bit more interesting than the same team all the time- not just changing team members around. The artwork is stunning. This is not a shoddy game but a very cleverly thought out one. As usual there is a choice of playing levels so it is suited to story mode players. A very enjoyable game and highly recommmended to all players","March 4","true","35.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Actually it could be a modern jRPG classic, however it has a significient flaw. There is a lot of pointless walking through the dungeons and cities. Instead of talking to one merchant who has a wide range of equpment, you need to visit 4 shops with a couple of useful items each every time you enter a new game chapter. During the main adventures you will face a lot of dead ends and sometimes, when you just don't know where to go, you will see that the game kinda turns into a walking simulator. Not the best feature ever.\n\n\nHOWEVER. The story and characters are the strong part and the main plot twist is surprisingly good - even though the main story line bases on jRPG and anime cliches. A lot of cool items and very good gameplay decisions are just enough to keep you playing for even more than 10 hours (if you want to complete all the sidequests - and there is a lot of them!). You may even select between various difficulty levels which are not related only to te enemy stats, but also to the gameplay itself. I love that.\n\nI will say 7/10, but the game could be easily 9/10 if given some more time to develop and change some not-so-good decisions made during the areas creation.","March 30","true","12.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
