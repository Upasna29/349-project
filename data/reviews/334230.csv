"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/recommended/334230/","murderbits","murderbits","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murderbits/","2796 products in account","Town of Salem is presented somewhat in the style of an animated board game, pitting fifteen people against each other in a clever roleplay battle of wit, perception, strategy, and deception.\n\nA quick recount of a fun session I played.\nIn a recent game, I was the serial killer. That means I can kill at night and can not be killed. All I have to do is keep killing people, keep deceiving them, and not leave any clues for them to suspect me. I won this specific game, because there was a player named Snoop Dogg and every time I killed someone, I would leave a "death note" with a vague dog-related reference on the victim - even some as obtuse as "Bow down before the Lion". This made people increasingly suspicious that this other player was the serial killer, without focusing any suspicion on myself. Yet, I (feigning to be a good guy) kept raising questions about yet *another* player, so that the town never had enough votes in agreement about Snoop Dogg to have him put on trial. Keeping Snoop Dogg alive meant I could keep killing with impunity. Until there were so few townsfolk left that I was able to kill Snoop Dogg, get away with it, and win the game.\n\nSo what is the gameplay?\nWhen you start each game, you can pick new name. Some people choose generic and some are clever. It's the internet, so plenty are offensive. When the game starts, all fifteen players will be told what their role is. Each role comes with certain abilities, traits, alignments, and limitations. The goal is to play your role, while supporting your faction. Each role has different faction alignments. Some are aligned with the mafia and the town. Some are aligned with the town and witches. Some, like the serial killer, are aligned only with the survivors.\n\nThe game is broken up into rounds. Your activities are performed at night. If you're the serial killer, you kill at night. If you're the investigator, you investigate one person's information each night. If you're the mafia, you communicate privately with the other mafia and the godfather at night, about who to kill and then you kill them. If you're the jailor, you put someone in jail overnight. If you're the escort, you distract someone overnight.\n\nThen there are limitations. For example, the serial killer can not kill the mafia's godfather. So if you choose to kill someone overnight, but are not able to, there's a good chance you (as the serial killer) have just identified who the god father is.\n\nWhen the night is over, you get a tally of the dead and how they died. You can read their will (each player can write a will, which for some is just a clever or insulting quip, but for others is an on-going ledger of information they've gathered while playing, so that upon their death, other players are informed as to what that player knew).\n\nStill in the day phase, everyone votes on who to execute, if anyone. If enough votes are tallied for an individual, that person has to plead their defense to the town (in their own words). The town can then determine if they find him guilty or innocent. If he's guilty, he is hung. After his death (as with all deaths), his name goes up on a visible list for all to see, along with their role. (As an aside, there are also mediums - who are the only players who can communicate with the dead players in chat, using their information for themselves or to share with the living to inform future judgments).\n\nIt will often play out something like this: Someone accuses a player of being the godfather. Everyone votes for that person. That person swears they are the sheriff and the town needs them. Nobody buys their lies. They hang him. Then the name and role appears on the grave sites... they were telling the truth! They were the sheriff! Uh oh!\n\nAnd then night comes again and we carry out the rounds like this, until almost everyone is dead and the town, mafia, serial killer, or other faction is left alive and declared the winner.\n\nThere are a few small hurdles that may trip some up. They are worth dealing with.\nFirst, this is a free-to-play browser-based game that is now also on Steam for $5 USD. Those $5 are converted to ingame currency to buy cosmetic items like death animations or houses. There is no pay-to-win aspect to the game; only cosmetic items. You also accrue currency simply by playing, so you could play with no disadvantage whatsoever without ever paying a dime.\n\nSecond, the game requires you to install Adobe AIR, so if this isn't already on your system, it will direct you to install it before the game runs. You'll also need to create a game account. Click "register" from the game's interface to be taken to the web page where you do this. The page it takes you to is a sign-up for a forum account, which may seem confusing. Just do it, as the account is directly tied to your game login. When you're done, login to the game with those credentials.\n\nThird, when you go to play a game, you'll have the options "invite friends" and "solo". This is very misleading, but if you click "solo", you will actually be entering the online multiplayer, which is what you obviously want.\n\nOverview.\nThe game is addictive and allows for a lot of role playing and deception. Even with fourteen other total strangers. Depending on the mode you are playing, there are also somewhere between 15 and 30 different roles to be played. Vigilante, veteran, doctor, mafioso, framer, godfather, spy, jailor, sheriff, escort, serial killer, witch, werewolf, arsonist, executioner, survivor, amnesiac, forger, vampire hunter, vampire, janitor, disguiser, consort, consigliere, blackmailer, bodyguard, investigator, lookout, mayor, medium, retributionist, transporter, jester...\n\nThe game becomes a clever meeting of wits, suspicions, piecing together what you know about roles and how they interact with each other, lying, determining truth, banding together, and backstabbing. It is absolutely unique and so compelling that I played six hours straight the first time I launched the game.\n\nThe game is a no-brainer at the price of zero dollars, if you play the web version. Frankly, it's worth $5 USD for the Steam version, too. If you're unsure, try the web version and decide if you'd like to support the guys behind this game by kicking in the $5 on Steam and getting this version. It also doesn't seem like there are a lack of players. Even past midnight, there were more than 300 ongoing games being played by almost 4,000 players. I never waited to get into a lobby and lobbies are filled and launched into the game within about one minute.\n\nI can't implore you enough to give this game a shot, if any of this sounds even remotely compelling to you.","December 16, 2014","true","84.7"," 425 of 438 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","425","438","21","3"

You can play it in your browser at any time. What I hope is that the devs will take this steam money and 1. improve the interface. 2. fix the bugs. and 3. fix the ♥♥♥♥ing interface bugs.\n\nSo, let me count the problems with this game:\n1. Inteface bugs. Menus will/may get stuck on your screen, preventing you from a proper play.\n2. Mafia is possible OP? maybe? (Update: I have lost once as Godfather out of countless games. I am either ♥♥♥♥ing incredible at that role, or it really is OP)\n3. Mediums ♥♥♥♥ing suck.: Clarification: The medium can actually be really helpfull. The problem lies with the fact that people always leave as soon as they die, rendering the medium useless.\n4. No way to exit a game, back to the lobby, without closing.\n5. As with any MP game, there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n6. quitters.\n7. You should not be able to pick a different name at the beginning of each round. There is no way to keep track of the trolls and the a55holes.\n\nNow let me count the ways I love thee:\n1. This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. I am seriously considering ripping it off and creating the same game under a different title. With a better UI,\n2. So much fun. No matter your role, you will have such a good time just watching the absolute paranoia, the accusations, the threats, and the mediums giving up imediately\n3. I can't stress enough how ♥♥♥♥ing funny this game can be. It is the players that make it so. You never know who is using reverse psychology, or reverse reverse phsycology. This is a thinking man's game, but at the same time, a non-thinkers game. YOU CAN NOT KNOW!\n\nSure, there are more gripes on my list than compliments, but the gravity is not the same. I would absolutely recommend this game to any friend with a head on his or her shoulders. It was given to me as a gift on the same night I spent over $200 on Steam games, and I have put more than double the time into it. As I said before, it is a free browser game, but your $5 helps the devs to improve it. And I hope they do. I will continue to consider completely ripping this game off, and creating my own.I could make a fortune. Absolute genius of a game.\n\nTips for making the game better for everyone playing, including yourself:\n\n1. If you are bored and trolling, play CoD.\n2. Fill out your will. Any info or observations can be very helpful to your fellow townies. especially in roles like escort, jailor and invest.\n3. Leave the racism at gradeschool. No one want to hear it, no one thinks it's funny.\n4. Don't spam the chat. See Tip# 3. It's also against the rules.\n5. Don't be an obvious jester. It's immediately obvious and annoying.\n6. Hate language is childish and ignorant. Grow up.\n7. Please, for the love of god, you do not need to declare your depraved sexual status in your name.\n8. If you are mafia/sk, kill the most obnoxious player first night.","February 3, 2015","true","51.5"," 354 of 418 people (85%) found this review helpful 114 people found this review funny","85","354","418","114","40"

Once past those 40 hours, the scroll update fell upon Town of salem.\n\nI would have recommended the game without a doubt before the update that introduced the scrolls.\n\nTown of Salem is a fun game(similar to the Werewolf game), that requires you to be deceitful and think logically in order to win. You have to think strategically your every move, choose who to trust carefully. You get a role at the start of each game, with its own objectives and skills.\n\nMost roles are fun and require a unique way of playing it. The townies are the most numerous and have to work together, the mafia must also work together, but in secret and most of the neutrals have their own agenda.\n\nThe two main game types allow for some very fun games.\n\nThe classic game type forces you to play with a given set of roles that make for a balanced game.\nThe custom game type let the host decide what the roles are going to be, which adds a lot of replayability and diversity to the game.\n\nIf you like the Werewolf type of game, I think you'd like town of Salem.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend Town of Salem as of right now.\n\nSince the scrolls were introduced, the game is a lot more frustrating.\n\nThe scrolls are in-game items that allow you to boost your chances of getting a specific role.\nFor instance, I can boost my chances of getting the role "Serial killer" from 7%(the default value) to 52%.\n\nThis will logically decrease the odds for all the other players, from 7% to 4% if only a single person has a scroll. Once you get the role you wanted, it will burn one scroll of that specific type.\n\nHow do you get scrolls? You have to buy them for the most part. They each cost 200gold, and although you can get gold by playing the game, it is far easier and faster to just pay for gold with real money.\n\nI don't have that big of a problem with the cosmetic purchases, like the different skins, houses ,etc, even though they can somewhat affect the balance of the game, as, if you're playing with a friend, you can tell more easily who that friend could be by looking at the different skins.\n\nBut the scrolls really messed up Town of Salem.\n\nSince the scroll update, I get a lot more often the boring roles simply because I have a very low percentage of getting them due to other people using those scrolls.\n\nI already bought the game, it is not a free to play on steam, I already for paid, there is no reason why an in-game purchase should affect the balance of the game. I understand that for the browser version they would add it, as it is free-to-play, but there's no reason why it should be there for the steam version. It doesn't make the game pay to win, it makes it pay for fun. Remove the $5 Town Points and let the game be fair again.\n\nWhile it was more tolerable back before the update to get the boring roles simply because everybody would have to get them at one point, but the chances of getting them were fair, unlike now. You could still expect to get a fun role in the next game. Not anymore. It's rare that I find a game where all the odds are 7% for every single role.\n\nFurthermore, leavers utterly destroy the game. When you start a game and half of the townies are gone, it breaks everything, as the town has no chance of winning right off the bat. There isn't any penalties for people who leave the game. Therefore, you can expect at least 2 people per game who will leave during the first round, and more afterwards.\n\nTo make it worse, a role(medium) is all about interacting with the dead townies to get some clues as to who is what, but since most people just leave straight away, it makes it pratically useless in most games.\n\nIn conclusion, Town of Salem is a fun game, even considering the very annoying quitting, but I'll only recommend it once the damn scrolls are gone and the devs add some penalties for quitters.\n\nIn the present circumstances, it is only a matter of time until another "Werewolf" game comes out on steam, without anything similar to the scrolls, at which point, Town of Salem will likely become deserted.","August 30, 2015","false","76.9"," 676 of 856 people (79%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","79","676","856","23","71"

My playtime is inaccurate since I had played for many more hours before it became a steam game. My love for this game has now been ruined because the developers have recently changed from nice people who listen to the community, to people who ignore/ban people because they disagree with the way things are now. I don't know what cause this change, but I greatly assume that it was the power and money got to their head.\n\nThey recently anounced that they would be releasing a card game for town of salem which will be funded on kickstarter. This is a blatent cashgrab since they are using the "Town of Salem" name to just reskin mafia/werewolf. As rewards for backing the card game on kickstarter, they are giving out a recoloured version of a previously released character as well as some items which used to be esclusive to people who paid alot of money funding the original kickstarter. Now the people who supported the game from the begining, no longer have a way to show it since their exclusive item is now being sold.\n\nI probably should have seen this coming earlier since they slowly been implementing moneymaking features into the game. For example they now have a feature where you can watch an ad for ingame currency. They have also got a feature where you can spend the ingame currency (which call be brought for real money), to buy higher percentages of getting certain roles.\n\nI would finall like to thank the youtuber "Tormental" for bringing light to how this company are now just running this game for quick money. After creating a video talking about this topic, Tormental was banned from the game even though he didn't violate any of the rules.\n\nUntil the devolpers apologize and stop the way that their game is heading, this review and my opinion of the game will remain negative.\n\nTL:DR The develpers are just running this game for money now and not for the community.","April 16","false","59.0"," 182 of 212 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","182","212","8","15"

I'll certainly play it some more. There are a lot of interesting aspects to it, more so than your average social deduction game. As for whether or not you should play it, I think it's high quality and a load of fun, but I'm not going to put an enormous amount of effort into convincing you this...\n\nI started playing it because some friends got me into it. You can set up lobbies ingame and invite people - as long as you aren't revealing info in a skype call that wouldn't automatically be known to everyone anyway, it's probably the best experience. Social deduction games always have a bit more flair to them when you know who you're playing with (without knowing if they're for you or against you)\n\nhttp://blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/\n\nI fully recommend playing this game on your web browser, as the free website version and the steam version are nearly identical. With all of that being said, I bought the steam edition several months ago because I was sick of dealing with inevitable web browser performance issues and such - they even offer some coins to spend on skins or a pet or something.\n\nUnfortunately, I regret spending money on the steam version, as I did not get much out of it (there really are like no benefits to this over playing in a web browser...) and the money also clearly didn't go anywhere worthwhile. As of right now, Blank Media Games has made a hella big profit off of their card game Kickstarter:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-the-card-game\n\nI don't imagine this game translating very well to a tabletop setting - a lot of the anonymity and role actions seem hard to emulate outside of a videogame, and I don't see why you wouldn't just gather some friends and play it like you would a LAN party game. That being said, at first it seemed promising, so I almost got the set. But the Kickstarter is starting to make it clear that the devs have a much different idea than I do concerning how us players should spend our money. The initial card game goal was $10,000. Despite having already reached $250,000 - BMG has still set up stretch goals after another whopping $100,000. This new stretch goal, if met, would add two new roles to the card game. These roles do not seem optimized or very originally thought up. In the ~9 months that I have been playing Town of Salem now, the videogame itself has only gotten two roles, the vampire and vampire hunter, which were almost as much of an unbalanced problematic afterthought as the card game rewards are. Speaking of these card game rewards, which ones have already been met? An "nsfw" pack. Yes. A ♥♥♥♥ing nsfw pack of cards for a party game I originally wanted to just open up with friends and play like we would Apples to Apples or maybe the new popular game Secret Hitler.\n\nWhat's worse is that this Kickstarter is seemingly the only legitimate way of purchasing the soundtrack - of course that's a tier wayyyy above the card deck itself, much more expensive than a typical soundtrack would be, which is about the only thing I'd be looking for. You can't even get the soundtrack if you're under 21, thanks to the nsfw cards being bundled with it.\n\nSo I guess my logic is that if I've supported this company multiple times, only to feel utterly frustrated with them and convinced that my money was wasted - just do yourself a favor and play the free web browser version identical in gameplay to what I'm playing anyway. Grab some friends, form a lobby, and have fun with them. Enjoy cosmetics by getting coins ingame for winning games, and choosing your new skin or pet carefully knowing it's not really worth it to buy another one with real money.\n\nI'll end this with what is probably the best argument I have. The card game backers aren't the only people who bought something that wasn't really all that special from BMG. In fact, this isn't even their first Kickstarter:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization/\n\nAround a year and a half ago they started a Kickstarter for some game updates, but mainly focused on putting ToS on steam and mobile. Of course, the steam version of the game is here. But the mobile is still in beta. This Kickstarter was also completely over-funded, and yet the devs are asking for more right now when they haven't completed what they pledged to give the backers of this, back in September of 2014.\n\nLook, I'm all for videogame developers making a living and earning the money they deserve. Really, I am. This philosophy is definitely something I care about, and that just makes it all the more significant that I'm taking what might be a less than forgiving stance this time around. Because usually I don't. But I think at some point, if you consider spending more money on Town of Salem, you might want to stop asking "Is this benefit/version/cosmetic worth $5 to me? and start asking "Is the amount of content that BMG has given us (and the manner in which they have) worth more than the hundreds of thousands of dollars that they already have?"","May 10","false","60.0"," 161 of 187 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","161","187","0","14"

That's not why this is a negative review, because everyone should play Town of Salem right now - in their browsers. The Steam version of this game is strictly inferior to the browser version, the only advantage I can possibly think of being that you'll know when your friends are playing without needing to login, assuming they ALSO have the Steam version, which is a $5 investment more than the browser version. As for what makes it worse?\n\nWindow settings are not saved when you close the game. It will launch in full screen each and every time. If you want to go into windowed mode, you either need to hit escape, or enter a game and press the full screen button. Upon entering windowed mode for the first time on a fresh launch, the window will be unimaginably tiny and must be manually resized to something functional. To go back to full screen, you MUST enter a game and press the fullscreen button. It cannot be done from the menu.\n\nThere is no way to back out of a game, even if you have no chance of winning (e.g. died during the night as a jester, lynched as an executioner). There is also no way to return to the login screen if you timeout.\n\nThere is no log out button. The only way to change clients is to exit the client and log back in.\n\nThe only instance I would recommend grabbing the Steam version of this game is if you were already planning on buying $5 worth of town points. Seeing as its a browser game to begin with, there's no particular convenience of having it on Steam right now, and the Steam version feels like it was rushed to meet a deadline without any actual attention given to justify its presence here.\n\nLuckily, the devs ARE working on fixing these issues, and I'll be editing this review as they come, and once I feel like the Steam version is a worthwhile buy, I'll change the review to be positive.","December 22, 2014","false","85.7"," 487 of 643 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","487","643","19","24"

But one day I decided to kill my cousin because he was really weird and I didn't really like weird people.\n\n\nThe Town began to be crazy since my cousin died with another guy died too by an organization called "mafia". The first day there are some accusations but nothing serious. The second night I decided to kill a dude who made accusations because said "it's him" with no proof seem suspicious. I always thought my dad had something to hide because he didn't really talk a lot but it's my dad though I prefered my mom.

Of course we have made some decisions in the family to stay together because we normally loved ourselves. But they were left 1 maf and 1 crazy killer so I was very shocked because how can be a serial killer here... So the story continued.\n\n\nBut my brother whispered me "kill Mom at night" and I was like "O_O". So I decided to kill my brother because he wanted me to kill mom  who I loved so much.\n\n\nThe sun rose and there were left me,mom and dad. They were left 1 maf and 1 serial killer. My brother wasn't a serial killer and I don't know why but he wanted to kill mom so I did the necessary. Dad must be the maf,I always knew that in my hearth. Mom must be a serial killer but it's mom. I said to mom that I killed my brother because he wanted to kill her.\n\n\nIt's time to vote who is guilty. Dad was saying a lot that he is married with mom and they supposed to support each other. I said "guilty" to dad because I loved mom and he was maf,I knew it ! Mom said "guilty" despite of dad was saying a lot about "marriage" "together" "family" 'couple" but she prefered me because I was his son and I helped her.\n\n\nDad was hanged. He was really a maf.

I simply can't.\n\nThe reason why I cannot give this game a good review is though once this game had some potential.. It screeched to a halt long ago and hasn't moved forward since. The speed of updates to the gameplay have all but stopped, with the devs preferring to make cosmetic skins and maps referencing other media rather than balance the wonky game that lies before us.\nThe Community for the most part is utterly toxic, with most random lobbies being nearly unplayable with the amount of game-throwers, rage-quitters or meta-gamers. The only time that I would have found fun is with playing with friends and trying to deceive each other, though even that's worn thin.\n\nCombine this with the devs saying that the game is doing better than ever even though it's statistically false after research, the ways that the staff operate on the games forums and a mountain of other things that I won't go into..

I've played this game on the browser version since July 2014, and have loved it since. I recently got the Steam version, which is essentially the same thing but gives you $5 worth of Town Points. Basically, you're paying for the average $5 TP purchase, and the same game but on the Steam platform.\n\nI love the game in general, and I recommend buying it or playing it on the browser. It's a very fun game and if you're into strategy, this is a must. Games usually last around 15 to 25 minutes, and are extraordinarly fun. I play a quick game almost everyday. There's a few Game Modes, including the new Ranked mode which is in beta. The basics of the game is that there's 3 sides: Town, Mafia, and Neutral. You don't know what anyone's role or side is, and you go off of assumptions and your abilities if your role has them. Town has to lynch/kill all of the evil roles, Mafia has to kill anyone who isn't a Witch/Mafia, and as for Neutral, that varies. You have to rely on strategy, and a bit of luck to win. All of the roles are balanced, none of them are OP or underpowered, and there's new roles coming out soon.","February 22, 2015","true","637.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","31","34","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/334230/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Town of Salem is a Strategic Elimination game that's set the the town of, well, Salem, back when the witch trials were very much alive.\n\nThis was a browser game in the past for quite some time, but December 15th is when it's mark on Steam came along. I played the browser version pretty extensively, and it's a very fun game to play because the outcome solely depends on player interaction and decisions.\n\nSee, you have these various roles, all with different alliances. Townies try and work together to survive and find out who the bad guys are. The mafia are their own group, trying to eliminate anyone who isn't them. And then the neutrals are people trying to achieve their own goal, neither with townies nor mafia. 15+ roles exist in the game, and they can all have a huge outcome on any game.\n\nWhat's the catch? You have no idea who is what, so you need to use your smarts and think about whether to trust the people you're with or not. Each day, there's a discussion, then there's voting. If one person is voted to be lynched, they have a chance to defend themselves, then the town decides whether that person is guilty or innocent. The game then transitions to night, where the action happens. People can be stabbed, moved, killed, distracted, just about anything can happen at night, as careful as you may be. The game ends when either the Townies or Mafia wins (Neutrals are rare cases.)\n\nThis is why I like this game so much. Like I said, it depends heavily on human interaction, which is what keeps every game fresh and alive. You're always given a random role at the start of a new game. You can pick classic mode where there's a set list of roles, and all 15 players fufill one, or you can do "All Any" where you don't know what roles exist, and that makes it an even bigger mystery.\n\nOverall, Town of Salem is an awesome game to play just for the suspensefulness and the fresh variety with every game, I really recommend this game.","December 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","1"

They do not know how to run a community-driven game.\n\n- There are a number of problems with the mechanics of the game (which they have received many suggestions to fix) but updates to the game balance are almost non-existant\n- They added a ranked mode but the ELO system is broken and it barely works.\n- Rules that can get your account banned if broken are not communicated, just hidden away in the ToS\n- The devs choose to focus their resources on updates nobody wants (physical card games, cosmetics like skins and pets, etc).\n- They do not take constructive criticism well.\n- There is a forum for suggestions and feedback but they almost never even acknowledge the posts, much less implement anything in-game.\n- They take things personally and get insulted. They hold grudges against users they see as nay-sayers and there is a feeling that some of the users are a bit elitist and there is favoritism at play.\n- They have had 2 kickstarters and a 3rd is planned for the physical card game. They still haven't met the goals of earlier kickstarters and it's hard to imagine their profits are being used appropriately.\n- There is a problem with some of the players that they seem unable to deal with (game throwing, leaving while alive, etc)\n\nBottom line: The idea of this game is amazing, but it's basically just an online version of Mafia or Werewolf. If someone were to make and manage it properly, it could be a wonderful, unique multiplayer experience requiring strategy and manipulation. As it stands, don't bother. Just use their free website to play until you get sick of the BS too.","April 17","false","81.4"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kupsy/recommended/334230/","Kupsy","Kupsy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kupsy/","159 products in account","Pros:\n\n\n•It is actually an entertaining game. If the stars align and you have a run of good towns, you can have lots of fun with them all and end up wasting hours wondering how to be the best damn Jester you can be.\n\n•The graphics suit the game and it looks rather pretty, especially if you have a town of people with different skins.\n\n•It runs well, on steam at least. When I used to play it from a web client it had lag issues.\n\nCons:\n\n\n•You can actually play it for free on a web browser, though you end up with more advertisements and possibly more lag.\n\n•For me, there are four big problems with this game right now, one of which is the scrolls. When you buy the game on steam, you've paid money, so you expect to get a fair game and a stab at all the roles, right? Nope. Thanks to people using scrolls, I've been stuck with crap roles all day today, to the point of getting the same one three times in a damn row, and it gets really disheartening but I don't want to be pushed into a microtransactions battle...\n\n•Leavers. See, even when I did get a crap role I'd still stick a game out and play it the best I could, but it's hard to actually get a good game in when people are allowed to just quit when they get a role they don't like. They need to change how this works, make it so that if people leave a game they have to wait a certain time until they can play again or something, because today I had 5 people leave on the first night. Two of whom were Mediums...\n\n•Bad players.. So you got a role you like and people didn't leave? Well then you're just gonna have the perfect game now, right? Maybe... See, most of the time you end up with people who play a role stupidly (earlier a retributionist brought back a bodyguard. Then the jailor executed the bodyguard), people who throw games for a friend or just to be an idiot (earlier I was in the mafia, one of the mafia members quit and outed all of the mafia in his will), sometimes people will just plain want to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (I don't feel like I need an example here, welcome to the internet), and sometimes people will play together sitting next to each-other irl and just plain cheat (earlier there was a sherrif who somehow INSTANTLY knew all the mafia, from day 2. They even admitted to it later, and told people in the mafia "please don't kill my friend")... In a game in which the multiplayer IS THE GAME, you'd hope reports would have more effect against these people, because at the moment there seems to be no deterrent and they get away with ruining games.\n\n•Last, but by no means least, ads popping up. Really? REALLY? I already BOUGHT a game that's FREE, and you're still going to throw adverts at me? Sorry, but that's poor. Please please please disable this for steam players, we've already contributed, we've done enough.\n\n\ntl;dr - I can't recommend this right now due to difficulty getting a good town without a load of leavers, throwers, cheaters, adverts popping up, and being almost constantly stuck with bad roles which I can do nothing about without spending money. I would suggest playing it online from the browser first, and if you feel like buying points for the game, then you might as well buy it here, as you get points in the bundle and it does run smoother in my opinion.\nJust be aware that even though you buy the game, other peoples microtransactions and nonsense can still screw you over.","February 19","false","155.9"," 58 of 80 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","58","80","2","18"

(If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)\n\n2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.\n\n3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.\n\n4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.\n\n5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.\n\nFor a Rocky Road Bar:\n1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan.

Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

It's addicting, I don't even know why.\n\nGameplay revolves around lie and deceit, sometimes on trust, but expect that trust to be shattered on random occasions. As such, game's sometimes filled with hatred, foul language and slanderous remarks, as such it's the nature of the game. Use every caution when playing with teens. Thankfully there's a filter and report function for deterring such toxicity.\n\nTo win, you need to see your role and objectives, then act accordingly. More often than not, this requires plenty of experience on examining people's behavior and try to adapt or manipulate them to get your goal done. While it seems easy, in reality it's not. You will see people's reaction very different than you have hoped, thus failing your objective. There are bunch of roles to learn, ranging from good roles e.g Jailor, Medium to badasses (is that even a word?) e.g Mafia, Serial Killer. The roles contradict each others, heck even good guy can kill good guy in chaos, making it confusing. Logic is necessary before you judge.\n\nIt's recommended to read the roles carefully and check the wiki every now and then if you get lost somehow.\n\nThere are basically two game modes, normal (fun sessions) or ranked (oh-so-damn serious sessions). You need to get certain threshold to unlock the ranked match, which is expected  as thorough knowledge of the game is necessary so you don't ruin others' experience during ranked match.\n\nThis version of Town of Salem on Steam is coded on Adobe AIR of which naturally has different issue than, say, outdated graphic/sound drivers. The most common complaint is the inability to even launch the game due to Adobe AIR issue. I honestly think they should've coded this with different engine/programming language. However, due to low requirements, even toasters can run the game. I've had success launching the game on Intel HD-based machine myself.\n\nSome other annoying issues for me personally are:\n- inability to minimize the game completely, as it runs on borderless window that can't be minimized. Can be forced into background/inactive window, but that's all.\n- You'll also get kicked if you're AFK in normal menu (not in a match with other players) something that I can't understand myself.\n- Also, there are random disconnects that force you to restart the game because you stuck in one menu and unable to open, say, lobby or join match.\n- Soundtracks are repetitive and boring.\n- Microtransactions are shoved on your face. While it's not required to play the game or give any advantage whatsoever, it is annoying to see the pop up every time.\n\nSalem has the data saved on cloud/server-based, so you won't have to worry about your game data unless they shut down the server. You just need to take care of your Steam login and you're set. And to date, the game's still being developed. As of today, I read the news post about new role update about Vampire/Vampire Hunter, which is good knowing it'll add another layer of strategies and... lies.\n\nA bit note of game's replayability - it's very high. Although the mechanic stays the same from session to session, it's not similar experience as you're dealing with different people every time on different sessions (unless you're playing with all friends). Good stuff really.\n\nNow for pricing, for me it seems to be appropriately priced. This Steam version contains in-game coins equal to 5 USD, while the free version (browser version) does not offer such. I got the copy from recent Bundlestars' bundle, though, very cheap around 5 USD for like 9 games.\n\nSo, while generally I can appreciate and recommend this game, there are several negative points that must be addressed above. Overall, it will be fun session should you try to play the game.\n\n7.5/10\n\nNow I'm off to kill some big bad guys... and Townies. Yes I'm that good guy and jerk alike.","October 17, 2015","true","140.0"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

However it is rather poorly executed. The game suffers from a huge lack of balancing especially in Ranked. NK and Mafia have such a hard time in winning in it.\n\nThe other main gripe is how much advertising is in the game for microtransactions. I don't mind paying for a game, but when there is a free version and you going to still flash up with 'pay real money for this bundle' it get's annoying. The points are also a grind to earn to actually get things legitimately with ingame currency.\n\nOther than that it is just simpily a social deduction game which seems that most competitors in ranked now have been dropped on the head a few times. Examples - Mayor decided to kill someone who was confirmed on their side, Mafia chooses to kill at a pointless and risky time has the target swapped and kills his own guy and throws the game.\n\nThe investigator results are a bit unfair for the mafia as one is a rare role, easily confirmed, or the godfather meaning they are always lynched. Another one is a role which is confirmed kill and a mafia.\n\nI would honestly recommend something like Secret Hitler/Palpatine on Table Top Simulator right now as is. I understand that they cannot change the community on a game like this so they don't troll or do stupid things, it is shame but it is a burden bore by all multiplayer games.","May 7","false","140.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherealsage/recommended/334230/","etherealsage","Acanthus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherealsage/","145 products in account","As a preface, I went into this game knowing exactly what I was in for. I knew the mafia game, I knew (some of) the roles, looked up the rest, I knew that my $5 was more to support the steam release and that I didn't get anything more than $5 of in game currency for cosmetics, I knew that an online version of this would lead to certain issues such as cheating, toxic players, and/or (most commonly) just people leaving/afking. Surprisingly, the game design shows that it's well aware of its own learning curve and provides an opportunity to read all the roles from the main page as well as providing you with any and all information you need about your role in game (for the forgetful and the lazy, I guess).  I like the game, its foundation, and its execution. It does have flaws, however, and I'll explain them below along with its merits.\n\nThings I like:Roles\nThere are no roles with no point. Every role on every side has SOME kind of special ability or a special win condition that either adds to the depth or intrigue of the game. The exception is survivor, which is exactly what it sounds like. You're simply not rewarded for interacting as a survivor other than to say you're a survivor. A lot of people (in game) rail on the town roles, but I actually find them the most interesting and varied. And the more I play the game, the more I find a use for "that role" that seemed so bad before. (Except Disguiser. Mechanically, you have to hope someone was bad for that role to work. Or you need an accompanying janitor.)\nThe whisper system\nWhen you first play, the whisper system seems almost out of place and like an obvious way to stand out. People who actually utilize it are among the strongest percentage of players. EVIL players able to get in on those networks are among the best liars in the game. Even if you have the presence of mind to try and nip things in the bud by attacking those who start the network, you actually run a huge risk because a protective role with the same presence of mind as you could make you waste a turn or potentially kill you. Every play you make is an exercise in risk/reward management.\nThis is an intellectual game\nThis game is an exercise in a large number of intellectual skills, but there are 4 big ones. Psychology, politics/social skills, deductive reasoning, and ESPECIALLY inductive reasoning (in the early game, which matters quite a bit, you will almost never have absolute proof). Honorable mention to metagaming though, as that's still a strong skill, but not a core one. Of course there are people who play that are only good at a portion of or none of these (and players who fake that they are this), and these players are something of wild cards to their side and the enemy. Most often they're harmful to their side, other times, well, crazy stuff happens (especially when they're good at metagaming, rofl).\nThere is no luck beyond that which a given player is willing to allow\nEverything that happens can be traced to choice. If a bad outcome happens for your side, you, and your team made more mistakes than your opposition. If someone made a "lucky" choice on faith, yeah, okay, but he still chose to make that choice, not some random number god. This actually cuts down on a lot of frustration for me personally. I almost never play flawlessly and lose. This is also because I almost never play flawlessly. If I lose, I can almost always point to something I could have done differently that could have changed the result. The exception is when people flat out do not listen to you. It happens, but each game is like 12 minutes long. It's easy to move past.\nMixed Bag:Realism (lack thereof)\nFrom a code standpoint, everything that happens make logical sense. They are not realistic, however, and events that happen have to stretch your imagination (to the realm of magic and the fantastical sometimes, such as tricking a player into shooting themselves as a transporter). However, I think it actually adds to the game's overall depth. The only reason this is here is because I'm aware that other players may not agree. Still, this gets a thumbs up from me.\nFlaws:Let's start with the elephant in the room. The graphics suck and will always suck.\nBut let's be honest, graphics don't matter at all. It's just icing. It just so happens that the icing is bland. The main reason you and I would be here is the mental challenge and the immersion. It does both jobs very well.\nSecond elephant: Trolling, leaving, cheating\nIt happens. There are 2 devs and a bare-bones report system. They will forever have a backlog even after they design a leaverbuster and spam detector/preventor. I do not begrudge them this, however. It's not AS big of a problem as people make it out to be (the leaving is, the rest isn't).\nThe UI\nIt's clunky and sometimes unfriendly, but intuitive enough to get the job done after you realize some initial quirks. I have a feeling this will see work someday in the distant future.\nCustom game lobbies\nCustom game mode is actually my favorite mode for numerous reasons. The down side is that you have the same matchmaking as every other queue. This leads to frustration for people who want to experiment or do something random/for funsies because the inital host is ALWAYS random. This actually doesn't affect me personally (because those rare times I'm the host, I still understand game balance enough that people accept whatever deviations from the norm I put forward). This can also lead to a war to /repick to a host who will implement something sane. Also people occasionally try to leave and rejoin at hyper speed so they get put into the same queue over and over, making EVERYONE wait. (No, people tend to not troll this way. Yet. They're just too oblivious to let someone take their slot by waiting 5-10 seconds.)\nRuns on Adobe Air\nI hate Adobe Air. But I like the game. But I hate Ado- aw ♥♥♥♥ it. But seriously, I've never been a big fan of the program, and any limitations in feature implementation in the future can be pointed to it, but the game DOES run as well as it can thus far.","January 26, 2015","true","146.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

I liked the game and bought the game on Steam but I regret doing so. Ranked queue is glitched and gets stuck once timer reaches zero; which means you have to restart the game, sign back in, and join the queue from the beginning.\n\nBuying the game does not disable pop-up ads for in-game cosmetics! What the hell? I should be able to at least turn it off. If you want to put a promotional banner for new content on the front page, fine. But pop-up advertisements are NOT OKAY.\n\nUpdated 05/20/2016: This game has been flooded with...let's say less mentally capable people. Devs paid Youtubers to promote the game and now ranked mode is filled with people who can't reason simple things out. It took me a month to realize that this game is beyond repair. The devs are too busy raising money on kickstarter for a board game and refusing to create a ranked mode that actually requires knowledge and skill to participate in.\n\nShort version: fun game to play with others, but don't bother spending money to buy it on Steam.

But let´s be real You pay 5 Euros, not only for the game, but you get the equal amount of in game money worth of what you pay, which is a good deal from my perspectiv. The reason behind it, is that it can take a long time to get in game money, for buying new skins or caracters, but with buying the steam version, not only do you get some money for new things, you also get a more convinient version of the game, since (atleast in my opinion) steam is easily accesed. But with that out of the way, i think that the game is worth buying, and more so if you have some friends or know some people who might be intrested in playing a game with you over a voice calling program and having a great time together. Just remember the game is not perfect in the 1.0.0 version, since it does not auto-login into the game in the steam version, and there is some few bugs here and there, but it is not something that is gamebreaking in my opinion. So yeah, Buy the game if you feel like supporting the developers and get some in game money in the process.

The major problem with the game is people who leave at the start, because they don't like their role.  In addition there are a lot of people who skype or otherwise share info outside of the game.  It makes it frustrating for the real players.  The addition of Ranked mode cuts both of these down tremendously.

You can easily play this game for free through your web browser, and you'll be connected with paid players too. Which means anyone can easily troll and break rules and ruin the game for serious players. If you pay for this game, you are going to be confronted with a lot of stupid players, trolls, and  newbies. I have tried doing ranked play, but it takes 5 minutes to get into a game, and even if you wait that long, theres no guarantee that youll actually be put into a game, which you then have to wait 5 more minutes for.","December 8, 2015","false","185.4"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

Each player receives a role from a made up list of 15 out of 30 total roles in the game. Actual mechanical options of each role are actually limited compared to blockbuster strategy games, but still they are very distinctive and important. The way you choose to interact the game will actually impact your chance to win and there is a high skill cap despite the limited mechanics. Still taking a casual aproach can be very fun.\n\nThere is a free version of the game which is equal to the steam one, but just because its free doesnt mean its not worth 5 dolars.\n\nEven if you like the concept of a slow paced different game like this, there are as of now 2 turn offs that Id like to point:\n\n- No Ranked Play: According to the developers this is the next thing being implemented shortly. Still this means that as an average player you will face almost every game people less commited than you (including a big amount of quitters) and ocasionally games where everyone is more commited than you and will become upset at your aproach.\n\n- No hard option to browse custom games or to create a custom room: Custom rooms are where the real games happen. This means sometimes you will want to play a balanced, advanced standard game and the host will either try to make something very unusual or unbalanced. Or you will be looking for a unusual game and will have to hop in and out of rooms for minutes (you can only join a new room once the previous is full of 15 people) until you have the luck to be host or find something you like.\n\nStill a fantastic game which already delivers what it promises and can only improve and as far as i know a new, very good concept.\n\n9/10 Would spend 10 minutes trying to host a custom game again to have someone quit on the 1st turn on a balance imprescindible role and ruin it for everyone. Many times.","December 18, 2014","true","39.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

However, I've been unable to join any ranked games. Client disconnects after about 30 seconds of staying on home screen without joining any games (some culling of inactive connections, I presume - just have to restart for it to work again) - not an issue in non-ranked play, but queues for ranked are long enough for disconnection to occur, so it can never join a lobby. Might just be a very specific issue only I have, idk.\n\nThe game itself is quite good and can be a lot of fun, but not with such a playerbase. I hoped it would get better some time after launch, when those who have more interest in trolling and derping around than in the actual game quit, but nope. Still the same, perhaps even worse.\n\nIt's still recommended if you have enough friends with some free time to play only with them. But not otherwise.

This is a game where everyone is on an equal level. There are no overpowereds or underpowereds there is just you, a group of people and your wits. Town of Salem is an inspired system that brings a popular party game beyond it's humble beginnings and creates a truly spectacular and frequently updated system where you and your friends can have the most fun playing off against each other and still come out the end laughing. The aim of the game is simply to fulfill the goials of one of many roles either Saving the town from the menaces of the mafia or becoming the monster within the town and making the peasants bow at your feet. Alternatively you can become a murderous killing machine who wants everyone dead or be a poor innocent caught up in the crossfire who wants nothing more than to survive. Or maybe you just want to find the truth of who you are. The Roles within can consume hours of fun working out strategies using or even being against these roles.\n\nThe game also benefits from caring and considerate Developers who have proven time and again they have the communities best intrests at heart with kickstarter reward fulfilled at every turn and promises that are kept and an undeniable desire to make the game better.\n\nTown of Salem is a truly amazing game that deserves it's recognition by far. Already it has turned the intrest of many big name and small youtubers alike. Everyone should play this game at least once. It's one of the very best indie games out there.\n","December 15, 2014","true","8.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you enjoy Werewolf or Mafia, then this is one of those perfect games to sit back and relax to. Money has become signifigantly easier to obtain recently even though its still pretty hard to make quick cash but to be honest, it's not like cash provides anything non-aethstic. Also the creators are very dedicated and have been continously updating and improving the game since I've first joined it months ago and hold their players in very high regards. Each game should take about 20 minutes, so plan accordingly. Remember that if you leave a game early, you dont get the smaller loss reward which is better than no reward.\n\nNow, what's different about the steam version?\n\nThe main thing that you get with the steam version is simply the $5.00 town points for buying the game and the lack of advertisements for owning the game. One VERY noticeable difference is that the Steam version runs much faster and much more smoother than the browser version and has little to no lag which has been very beneficial to me and has prevented me from returning to the Browser version. Some people are asking how to leave a game early and it's almost the same way as the browser version, click ESC to get out of full screen mode, close the game client, and load it back up. The creators do not have a back to home button in either version and it is something they are working on.

I've heard from a friend that ToS has existed for a long time, but thanks to the recent popularity increase from Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Lordminion777 and plenty of other YouTubers, the game has sadly devolved into a free-for-all cluster[bleep] from hell.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love to play this game with friends on skype, working with (and sometimes against) them to achieve victory, and I really enjoy playing it, but the enjoyment is usually killed off by the community and their... "ways".\n\nI got the Steam Version anyway, even after playing the Free Browser Version, and I do not regret the purchase. But sadly, the community has devolved the game to what looks like a group of 6-15 players in the age range of around 8-18 who will scream at you if you even talk sometimes. The Last Will and Death Note can be abused to add things like "GO F*** YOUR MOM YOU PIECE OF S***" (Bleeped out so Steam won't hate on me). ToS has also become a "random kill" style game too, where if ONE person votes any random person, an entire town will turn against them. 98% of the time without proof.\n\nIf I had anything to say to the devs, it would be this:\nYou have a great game, I love it. But it can do with extras like a Censor Filter (Perhaps a toggle feature) that'll Censor chat/wills/death notes from the BS that the community brings, perhaps try to add punishments for attempting to bypass when the filter is enabled.\n\nAs for the RDM Killing, there's not much that can be done about that, but again, the community ruins it with Randoms. Not the first time I've seen a friend get killed for the *sole* reason that they're a brony.

Why? because if you have never played a live chat MP game where paranoia and investigation (and ultimately survival) is key then you need to try this. So grab a random role and try to hide it away from others - until it's time to step up - or not - depending on your role and situation.\n\nI suppose the biggest brilliance of this game is that it overcomes easily the '12yo XDXD le troles bringing the bantz' because a) they dont want to play this as they are the underdogs quickly. Players appear semi-mature atleast b) The more stupid you act the more likely you get random lynched which gives more time for others to form the real game ending.\n\ni'd say this game is almost immune to trolling as fooling others is the name of the game. Gamethrowing aka people quitting is not much of a trouble either because even if half the people quit it still doesnt matter - epic and surprising endings are aplenty as games are decided in the last turns usually.","October 10, 2015","true","31.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/recommended/334230/","MeltingComet","龍 Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/","329 products in account","Town of Salem brings the crazy role-countering party game “Mafia” onto browsers/digital screens, and despite its drab presentation, proves to be dastardly sinister fun.\n\nNOTE: You can play the game for free on browser at the game’s site.\nPros:Dynamic classes that all counter other classes or play major roles in the game.\nComplex Features; Normally Mafia’s gameplay is simplistic to keep it understandable as a party game, but they went full out in this game, with tons of abilities, new classes + the mix of Werewolf, Neutral Classes, and Last Wills.\nThe Emergent Interaction with other players is fantastic and fun.\nNetcode is done very well; No matter how poor the connection I was able to play the game and interact with everybody just fine.\nNitpicks:No Private Lobbies, which I think is disappointing because having a full group of friends together would really make this establish itself as a party/LAN game.\nGeneric as hell music. I just ended up muting it eventually.\nSteam Version does not save settings; when I boot the game it doesn’t know that I previously switched it to windowed. Really annoying.\nCons:Drab and boring presentation; as a flash game, it can run on a toaster, but it doesn’t excuse it from it’s menus being unintuitive and not-so-good-looking and it’s visual artstyle from looking so cheap.\nMicrotransactions aren’t a big deal since the only purchasable items are really cosmetics, but the class scrolls are a horrible item that is either incredibly useless or unfair, contradicting what makes the game so good.\nFriends System is glitched and broken, usually doesn’t update or send notifications to others, making it frustrating to organize events with friends.\nThe Review\nTown of Salem is very simple to explain to those who often go out on parties. It’s basically Mafia/Werewolf, except as a video game! It takes the advantage of complex mechanics (that can easily be done in games versus as a party game) to elevate Town of Salem as a much more dynamic game. There are a lot more countering between the roles, which means there’s a whole lot more to keep up with. This is what makes Town of Salem a much more fresh experience.\n\nThere’s so many things to keep track of too. You’ve got escorts that can distract players, jailors that can interrogate others and execute them, there’s just so much going on. There’s Last Wills, a Serial Killer role, neutral roles that can get caught in the crossfire, unique Town roles besides just “Citizen”, and so much more. If you plan on playing it’s competitive matchmaking, you have to keep every aspect of the game in mind.\n\nAdd Werewolf in the mix, and you get pure insanity. That doesn’t mean you have to play with the Werewolf roles, however. Town of Salem allows for custom matches where you can pick the roles, which will definitely make for a lot more creativity and unique game modes to pop up.\n\nHow ever, it has to be said that it’s presentation is really, really bad. If it’s loading times, far from serviceable graphics and bad UI makes it a lot less appealing. While the loading times aren’t as bad as the browser version, and the graphics can be more of a nitpick at this point, the horrible UI can not be excused. It takes so many clicks to do actions that could had easily be cut down, the various windows for the game are placed all over, and the UI while in a game completely clutters the screen. It’s a good thing you can do something about the in-game one though, but those with low monitor resolutions are not going to have a good time.\n\nIt’s visuals are honestly subpar, but it can be excused for it being a flash game (Why it is a flash game in the first place will forever confuse me). However, what I found really grating was it’s cheap and horrible music/sound design. It’s music was generic as hell, and the sound effects were cheesy and annoying at best. It’s easier if you just tune into your own music while playing.\n\nThe microtransactions generally consist of mainly cosmetics, so it’s not that big of a deal. However, the BS that is the scrolls are completely obnoxious. Purchasing scrolls allow you to get a higher chance of a certain role, which completely ruins the RNG factor that is picking the roles in Mafia. It stoops the gameplay very low, and it’s really sad that people will have less of a chance to pick roles people have put scrolls towards.\n\nHowever, in practicality, the scrolls end up actually being a total waste of coins, because you’ll probably not get the role anyway. It basically turns what is a game-breaking item into a useless item at the same time.\n\nSo let’s talk about organizing the game as a party game. It can work, but it’s ultimately a huge disappointment. There’s no private lobbies, meaning if you have less than 15 people, you will have to play with randoms. Due to the messy UI and bad friend system getting in the way, sending up lobbies can become a hectic mess. Sometimes, it doesn’t update whatever or not a player is online, meaning sending them an invite is virtually impossible.\n\nThe Steam version (besides loading times and the fact that it isn’t free) is fine. You get some in-game currency and better loading times since you’re running on a client versus a browser, but if you don’t want to pay for an experience like this, you really don’t have to get it on Steam. Also, it does not save any of it’s settings on the Steam version, which means I always have to toggle “No Fullscreen” and “Mute Music” settings when I get the chance.\n\nBut besides that, what can I say? It’s Mafia. Despite the disappointing aspects of the game, I still find it to be a solid time killer and definitely a complex and entertaining game. Tarnation indeed.\n\nTL;DR - Although disappointing some aspects, Town of Salem is still a fun and very playable game.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","March 22","true","15.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Trying to keep your cover as an important townie role becomes more difficult as time goes on, seeing how the town believes the kid who can't spell "Investigator" right. You say you're innocent, but they refuse to listen. Getting voted to be put on trial is basically getting sent to Auschwitz in 1940, death is inevitable.

One of the best and funniest party games I've played in a long while. It's based on the Starcraft 2 mod Mafia, and it is set in an alternative universe of Salem, where a group of 15 players must lynch or kill those who are not on their side, there is the Townies, the Mafia, Serial Killers, Survivors, Arsonists, Witches and Werewolves (Survivors, Arsonists, Witches and WWs are only in the Custom gamemode, and Classic can only have 1 SK.)\n\nThe townies have to gather clues from previous deaths, other players, your class ability and guessing in order to hang or kill all the Mafia and the Serial Killer. The Mafias must kill all the townies and hang the SK, while the SK has to lynch the Mafias and Townies but he can kill on his own.\n\nThe game has a nice artwork and charm to it, and the player characters range from fitting and nice, to advertising like a shameless ♥♥♥♥♥. The houses you can have ranges from classical houses that usually were built during the time of Salem to a ♥♥♥♥ing Balloon house. The pets range from faries to Doge.

The devs are planning to add in a ranked mode which should get rid of most of the annoying people, so that's really great, because being a Medium and having dead players quit is the ♥♥♥♥ing worst.\n\nThat said, play it on the browser then if you like it? Come over here and give over your 5$ for 1300 coins, and support the devs.","January 16, 2015","true","21.2"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","14","23","8","2"

Thing is, I hate logging back in every time, I mean like, your steam account is pretty secure, do we really need to relog in every time? This game sometimes also glitches and it won't let me go back to the homescreen so I have to force close it and restart it and log in again and bleh bleh, so much work. Oooh, they should add a thing where you can see your past matches and see if you won or not because I left my computer after I died because I wanted to see who won, but by the time I got back, the game was back on homescreen.

I mean c'mon, why do we HAVE to close the game via Alt+F4?\n- When you get asked if you want to share an achievement or a won game on facebook this works perfectly fine in the website version. However, in the Steam client version the window doesn't pop up, which denies one 25 gold per share.\n- Only Full Screen mode.\n- Updates have slowed down already since the release of this version.\n\nConclusion:\nThis version has it's problems, but I'm not here to rate the version, I'm here to rate the game.\nThe game itself is pretty darn funny and enjoyable, I can only recommend you to play it, but preferably for free on the website.

Game was originally based on a web version, and still holds to the same UI.  While it's nice that all my friends don't have to pay 5 bucks to play with me, it doesn't feel so much an in-game menu as it does a popped out webpage.  Not a huge problem, just not very aesthetically pleasing.\n\n2.  Game was originally free, and there seems to still be a very big push to convince (paying customers mind you) to buy extra coins.  By that I mean the speed at which you earn in-game currency is abominable.  I've bought 2 customization items in all the time that I've been playing this game.  2.  In 25 hours.  For a game I payed for.  Seems pretty dumb to me, just saying.\n\n3.  Very little moderation.  While I personally don't mind profanity, I'd really have liked to play this with my younger siblings, but I'm not going to expose them to a community that casually calls eachother racist and homophobic slurs.  My mother would kill me if I did that.\n\nThat being said, the game is fantastic.  I don't think I've enjoyed a game this much since I first started playing Dark Souls.  I wouldn't recommend buying it though, go on the web browser version until they fix the emphasis on the cash store for people who have already paid.","August 27, 2015","false","39.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","5"

Why? This game is damn fun is why.\n\n\nOverview:\nTown of Salem is a game about lies, deception, and word based accusations. Carefully analyzing, and thinking about not only your own role, but others as well. The game itself runs like the boardgame "Werewolf" or Starcraft 2 Mafia mod, of which it is losely based.\n\nThat guy just claim sheriff?\nShould I trust him? Should I lynch him? Is he an executioner?\nAll questions racing through your mind as you read through the chat, picking up clues, and word slips.\n\nI personally fell in love with this tiny game from the start, I play on Team Speak with friends often, backstabbing them and growing to hate them more and more (Dammit Squid, why did you shoot me!!?) Best part in playing with friends is lieing about your role to get them to put their guard down, the imediately killling them.\nNote: Dont use TS, Skype, etc. to cheat though, thats strictly against the code of conduct.\n\n\nSteam or Browserversion?\n\nThis seems to be an active topic, and all I can say to this is that you do not need to buy this game on steam.\nBuying it only adds $5 worth of Town Points to your account. By buying this game for $5 your not paying for the game, but some bonus townpoints. (Townpoints are the in-game currency)\n\n25 Townpoints can be ottained every day, for your first win.\nWith additional town points for gaining achivements with your given role.\n\nI would suggest however, if you want to try a few games, take some time to sign up for an account at...\n\nhttp://www.blankmediagames.com/TownOfSalem/\n\nDo a few classic games, get to know the some of the basic roles, then, if you feel like you want that new character skin or maybe even a pet or two, buy the steam version.\n\n\nPros:\n-Runs much smoother with less loading times compared to the browser\n-$5 worth of town points!\n-Steam Achivements!\n-Backstabbing is fun!\n\nCons:\n-Uses adobe air...for some odd reason\n-Requires a brain, for some that may be a bit hard, I know.\n\n\nTl;DR- Buy it for the backstabbing.","December 19, 2014","true","23.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is COMPLETELY free on the browser version, but if you want to support the game (like I did) you get $5 worth of currency (If you have ever played League of Legends, it is basically RP). This game is extremely fun for those who like mystery/mafia games and I reccomend it to people that are into using clues and decieving others.\n\nIf you want to try the game without a steam purchase, play it for free on the website.

Im not as clever as those folks, so here it is. Town of Salem is a wonderful text based game with lies and murder. Half the people are lying to you. The other half is trying to convince you that they are who they say they are. Its a blast. I most often play it alone. But you can play it with your pals.\n\nIts best when playing with friends to tell eachother your names but not your roles. Since they will ususally hear your keyboard and find out what your name is rather quickly. Tradeing information outside of the game, or "Skypeing" is not fun for the people playing including yourself. Along with the fact that any player who has played WAY to much like me will notice in a heartbeat what your doing. The actaul visual interface is not even nessesairy, but its a fun way to add more debth to the game.\n\nI suggest learning the game by playing the game mode "Custom Any" (Custom Game Mode -> All Any.) its named that for good reason. I won't go into it but you will find out.\n\nHonestly I have payed A LOT more for games I havent liked. I paid $5.00 for this game. Since that day I have had SOO much fun playing this. Weather its a binge sesson of 10 games or im at work and I pull it up while im sitting on hold.\n\nI hope you give this game a try.

Having played the similar StarCraft II mod "Mafia", I was intrigued and tried it out on BlankMediaGames' website HERE[blankmediagames.com] for free.\n\nAfter a whole night of playing it, I decided I had to buy it. It was incredibly fun.\n\nBuying Town Of Salem on Steam supports the developers and grants you $5 worth of the in-game currency (gold) with which you can buy cosmetic items. You can also earn more gold by completing certain tasks within the game, which I would say is a fair business model.\n\nAbout the gameTown Of Salem is a multiplayer-only game based on the party game Mafia[en.wikipedia.org]. It features a team of townsfolk who have to work together to find out who the evil people in the town are and have to get rid of them by hanging them or killing them off in various other ways. The tricky part is that the townsfolk don't know their allies, while members of the Mafia know exactly who they are working with. The serial killer is essentially a lone wolf and tries to kill everyone else.\n\nThere are fun alternative modes with more roles, several of them evil or neutral, which can make the game much easier or harder, depending on the size of the teams and the distribution of roles.\n\nThere is so much more to this game that I would love to write about in great detail, but for the sake of getting to the point I'm gonna cut it short a bit here and will move on to other aspects now. Besides, the game's description on the store page has got you covered on more details about the gameplay, so check it out. :)\n\nTechnologyBeing built in Flash Action Script, Town Of Salem's graphics and animations are rather rudimentary.

Bear in mind that it can only be played with other people online and that it almost entirely relies on communication with said people via chat. Personally, this game got me hooked.\n\nThere are a few shortcomings that naturally occur as soon as other people are involved, for example, players leaving the game immediately after finding out they were assigned a role they don't like. This is absolutely not the developers' fault though, but as far as I know, they're working on a solution to encourage people more to keep playing.\n\nI have played Town Of Salem for about 35 hours on Steam thus far (+ at least 5 hours through their website).","May 14, 2015","true","35.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The community is terribly toxic.   If player's behaviors weren't bad enough cheating is currently a issue as well.  It's got so rampent that some groups don't even bother to hide it.  Then there are the trolls that mean to throw the games to ensure your team loses.     15 people per town and almost always you will have one toxic player spamming the chat with your typical racist, sexist, and homophobic nonsense.\n\nDon't buy this game if you really want to play it use the F2P version which lets you play with Steam owners anyways.  This is how the toxic players all play as well so if they get banned they simply come right back.    The  horde of trouble makers is so immense that the developers are making a "trail" system in which the community will police itself by being able to review flagged players in games  and  basically decide if they are guilty or not.    But this just shows how bad the community really is that the developers can't handle it and are passing the responsability to you.    Furthermore once again this won't stop anything as they will come back with new free accounts.      A terribly lazy and flawed plan by the devs.\n\nThis game doesn't deserve your money and I regret giving it mine.","January 28, 2015","false","89.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It was a game to help pass the time between my lectures and actually had some sort of strategic aspect. I mostly played ranked games and they were amazing, After the past few months, however, I have watched ranked play crumble with gamethrowers and spammers. It just isn't fun anymore. The staff do not punish repeat offenders, so the same people continue to spam/throw games on a constant basis (who are also the most active players as of recent)\n\nIt seems as though the staff only care about the money at this point. The lag/DCs are the users fault, because the server "never goes down." Although people have complained about the game lag and DC periods in the middle of games, the staff deny this ever happens and tells the users to "check their connection."\n\nThere is also a lot of back and forth on "rules" of what is and isn't gamethrowing. One minute the staff agrees on a rule, the next they change their minds and say something is no longer gamethrowing. Consistency has ALWAYS been an issue and continues to get worse.\n\nI don't reccomend this game to anyone at this point.","April 3","false","721.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I do like this game but it has some things that need to be notcied.\n\nPROS:\n*Roleplaying, You can pick your own name and you get a different role(or maybe the same sometimes) every game.\n*Skins, You don't have to buy skins to look different, in the option section you can pick from 5-6 defaults.\n*Deception, Tricking players and outsmarting players is somewhat easy.\n*Chat Filter, You can have the option to censor swears others put in the chat.\n*Rage-Childs, You gotta love those kids who rage so hard when they lose.\n*Not Pay-to-play, Note, yes its $5 on steam, but that gives you points ingame for customizations like skins and such. You could just play it on the web browser for free. But those points, don't give you an advantage. They just make you look cooler.\n\nCONS:\n*Slow type lag, Most of the time you'll end up typing, but by the time you finish, you notice the game is still inputing the beginning for the message. Which can cause you to mess up badly. Very rarely you end up with the games where you can type quickly and it inputs it just as quick.\n*Exclusive Chat Filter, It doesn't include racism.\n*Racism, There is a ton of children who rage so much they feel its necessary to call you a Jew, or they feel like its okay to call you a "N" word.\n*Know-It-alls, There are players who think they know it all, and if you try doing your job, you get called a "tryhard." Great example is when you play jester, Your job is clearly marked as "Get the town to lynch you at any means necessary", Key words, "any means necessary." = "Do everything and anything that you can to get it done."\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes I do, it is a fun game.\nPlay with some friends, Trick the town, Murder the town, or Save the town.\nOr perhaps troll the town's medium into thinking there are more mafia in a "all-any" game","July 2, 2015","true","80.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love it. It will feel incredible to have a well laid plan come together and even narrow victories feel amazing.  Heck, even some games that I have lost were pretty fun.\n\nBut I just can't recomend it. why? For several reasons.\n1. Rampant cheating. Idk if the staff is working on this problem or not. But it seems every few games I report at least one person for using skype, or being in the same room as another player and sharring info. Any form of outside communication is against the games rules, but it is happening so much its pathetic.\n\n2. People are stupid. I cant tell you how many times I have been a proven town role and either no one would listen, or the town itself lynch me. the game needs rebalancing, maybe giving more voting power to sheriff or lookout roles?\n\n3. The mediums curse. Medium almost always gets lynched by the town. Something needs done about this. Part of the problem is that unless your role is proven by another character, its so easy to fake being medium.\n\n4. The game has a bad balance in some ways. For instance, When I am mafia, my team almost always wins, unless gamethrowing is involved. It does not matter if there are 2 mafia or 6. And yes on any all almost half the town can be mafia. More if you count amnesiacs.\n\n5. There is a free version online that links to this, but from what I heard free version does not start you with coins, so its alright I recon?\n\nTL:DR version, buy it, or play the free version. The choice is yours, but I only recomend this game if you have a strong stomach for cheating and stupidity. Will it stop me from playing it? No I just wish I could tag this as a conditional review. The only reason I recommend it is that the staff is still working on the game.","September 29, 2015","true","609.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/recommended/334230/","ThatCrazyGuyNT","ThatCrazyGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/","181 products in account","IntroductionTown Of Salem is party game where players are assigned roles that are aligned to the town (innocent), neutral (mixed) or mafia. The aim of the game to use your role's abilities to help aid your team to victory. Each session is just as unpredictable as the last one. Personally I would reccomend playing All Any mode (Under the Chaos section) since the roles are randomized and no one knows what roles are game, it makes the game more interesting.\n\nPro and Cons\nPros\n\n1. The game has variety of modes to choose from.\n2. It's easy to play, but takes a while to master.\n3. The game is addictive, fun and competitive.\n4. The game is regularly updated, so the game is kept fresh with new content such as roles, skins, houses etc.\n5. The microtransaction system is good and doesn't unbalance the game.\n\nCons\n\n1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/recommended/334230/","ThatCrazyGuyNT","ThatCrazyGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCrazyGuyNT/","181 products in account","IntroductionTown Of Salem is party game where players are assigned roles that are aligned to the town (innocent), neutral (mixed) or mafia. The aim of the game to use your role's abilities to help aid your team to victory. Each session is just as unpredictable as the last one. Personally I would reccomend playing All Any mode (Under the Chaos section) since the roles are randomized and no one knows what roles are game, it makes the game more interesting.\n\nPro and Cons\nPros\n\n1. The game has variety of modes to choose from.\n2. It's easy to play, but takes a while to master.\n3. The game is addictive, fun and competitive.\n4. The game is regularly updated, so the game is kept fresh with new content such as roles, skins, houses etc.\n5. The microtransaction system is good and doesn't unbalance the game.\n\nCons\n\n1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/recommended/334230/","JosieKaylin","Josie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/","116 products in account","*Artwork/Animation: 10/10\nThe art work is cute and with the in-game currency there's a lot of cute outfits and animations you can purchase which is great. The animations work for this game and I genuinely enjoy them. I'll go further into the animations in the topic "Game Play".\n\n*Hours to complete: ~~~\nIn all of my other reviews this is a topic, so I decided to include it in this one. Why not. This game you can play for infinite hours with out getting bored! Plus, there are loads of achievements on steam for this game; around 200 I believe.\n\n*Story Line: 10/10\nThere's not really a story line to this game, but basically there are three different game modes. Classic, Chaos, and Custom. (We will go into more detail in "Game Play") once you find out what your role is going to be, i.e.. Investigator, your goal is to strategically survive with out being hung, killed by the mafia, or killed by the serial killer. Once you win you get in-game currency that you can use to purchase customizable content for your avatar.\n\n*Game Play: 10/10\nSo this is going to be the most important part for you to fully understand what you're buying, because when I bought this game I had absolutely no clue what I was purchasing. When you load up the game, you are required to hook up your steam account to the game. Once you get through that process, you get to choose whether you want to play Classic, Chaos, Custom mode.\nClassic mode: Every time you play, all of the "roles" you get to play as are always going to stay the same.\nChaos mode: This mode generates a random list of roles to each game so it's constantly changing.\nCustom mode: This game gives the host a chance to set up the roles how ever he/she wants. You can have 4 serial killers in one game if you wanted to!\nThere's also a ranked mode.\nStill with me? After you choose your game type, you can pick a custom name to go by for that game! You can pick your own name to go by, i.e. Josie, or you can make up a fun name to go by! Once you choose your name and the game loads, this is where all the fun happens. You'll be told your role, what your role means, and what you must do to win the game. For explanation purposes let's say you're given the role Investigator (my favorite role). The investigator's job is to investigate each person every night to get a clue as to who is evil in the town. You don't want to tell the town right from the start what your role is because the mafia or serial killer will most likely kill you because you will be able to figure out who they are. Once you figure out someone is evil, you must convince all the other players that the person is evil and must be hung. If you end up being hung or killed at night, it's not a huge deal because you can still win the game even though you died. Being an investigator means you are a good towns person. So if you guys clear out all the evil with in the town, everyone that is good still wins no matter if they're dead or alive. Are you still following? After the game ends you're brought to a screen that shows everyone's Steam name. This is great because if you make in-game friends you can add them! This game is also multiplayer so a bunch of you and your friends can play together, whether they are playing the game in browser or on steam! (visit "Price" for more information on this) On this screen you're also shown your wins/loses/tied games. You'll also notice your currency. You get currency no matter if you win or lose and there's a first win of the day bonus. Your currency is available for you to buy skins for your avatar, buy pets, buy new houses, or buy new animations for when you get hung.\n\n*Price: 10/10\n~~ (7/9/2015) As of today: $4.99\nSo.. Some of you may or may not know but.. The game is actually free. You can play this game for free in a browser. What you're paying $5 for is the steam achievements and support for the devs. This is basically like a donation to them to help evolve the game. They have goals they're trying to accomplish like bringing the game to mobile and creating new customizable content in game. When you do buy this game you are rewarded in game currency automatically so you can buy a skin or something before you even play your first game. If you played this game in browser you would have to play games to get the currency so you don't start off with the money like you would here. Long story short, buying the game is giving them $5 to their gofundme project and helping support them and recieving updates with the game more often.\n\n*Overall:\nI would totally in a heart beat recommend this game to anyone who:\n>Likes casual, simple games\n>Likes steam achievements\n>Likes strategic, detective, killing games\n>Likes to play with friends, make friends, or rage at people\n>MMOs","July 9, 2015","true","134.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(They don't necessarily have to be on Skype but usally people who do this says they are on skype)\n\nThe Sore "Quitters" - In this game people quit usally after they die not realizing that they could still win if their team (Depending if you are in a Costom game or not) wins.

Basically it's a kind of fun social/party game where each player gets a role as a town member, a mafia member or a serial killer role, and the objective of the game is to get rid of every player not in your faction. This is done mainly by chatting with the other players, sharing clues about their roles and accusing them for being evil. This in turn can lead the accused to be lynched during the day or bum tarnationed at night.\n\nThat's pretty much the main gist of the game and it includes so many variables that make this game pure genius. The only complain I can think of is that this game really feels like it should be F2P since it's a fairly simple browser game and it even has an in-game store where you can buy cosmetics and other kinds of different flummery. Nonetheless that doesn't make the game bad by any means and it's only like 6€ in the store anyways and I'd say it's worth every cent.

Why should i pay for it when i can play for free?"\nWell, first of all the servers are 10x faster than the brower version\n\nEvery single game you play is different, especially when you get roles like Serial Killer or a Mafia Member\nOn the other hand you can play boring and 1 time use roles like Medium or Retributionist (Ret. can bring one person back to life (But most of the time they get killed right after again))\n\nOnce you play 50 games, you can play ranked which i havent gotten to try out yet but im getting there\n\nTo sum all of it up ill do Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\n- Variety\n\n- 3 Different game modes\n\n- 31 roles\n\n- you can play with friends (create a lobby)\n\n- Worth the 4.99 (Would recommend buying on sale ;))\n\n- Coins can buy cosmetics, houses, pets, death animations, and player skins/costumes (You can buy coins or earn them buy playing games over time)\n\n- You sometime get deals that are very cheap\nExamples: Vampire Deal: Vampire Skin, Vampire house, 1300 coins, etc. FOR ONLY 0.99!\nNOTE: The buyable things in TOS is basically hats from TF2 (Money Grabbers ;) )\n\n- STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS :)))))))))))))   (GO GET SOME AND SHOWOFF HOW GOOD YOU ARE)\n\nCons:\n\n- 3 gamemodes, im sure overtime they will add more gamemodes but for now what you get is what you got.\n\n- GAMETHROWERS, although these are rare sometimes you will join a game with a guy who will tell who the entire mafia is and ruin the game for everyone.\n\n- 4.99 coin packs for only 1500 coins, as i said before Coins are equal to TF2 Hats, they suck you in and steal your money. (If you lowered the price or gave more coins for 4.99 i would consider buying coins.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Town of Salem: Steam Version is an amazing game and you should support the developers!\n\n9/10\n\nPS: WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY THERE ARE NO POP-UP ADS!","January 7","true","13.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Then, each player is given their role, which comes with a number of abilities and an allegiance to one of three ‘sides’: The Townies, who’s primary goal is to eliminate all evil roles, The Neutrals, who all have their own unique goals such as ‘Survive till the end of the game’ and ‘Kill everyone who would oppose you” and the Mafia, who’s primary goal is to eliminate the Townies. The game proceeds by to the actual game, which proceeds on a day and night cycle with many stages within.\n\nThe goal of the Town (or Townies) is to kill all the Mafia, and other hostile neutrals, such as the serial killer or arsonist. The Mafia's aim to kill all the Townies, and any hostile neutrals. The Neutrals have a variety of goals relating to their individual roles. Generally, the Neutrals don't have a particular side. Deception is a massive part of controlling and winning the game. There is what we call night and day, during the day you can vote on people to lynch them. At night people get killed by the mafia, serial killer, etc.\n\nPros and cons:\n1-Pros\n-Alot of roles which improve different play style\n-Fun\n-Playable with friends\n-Easy to learn\n-Good music\n2-Cons\n-Diying 1st night can be booring\n-Random lynching\n-Afk/Leavers\n-some lags\n\nConclusion :\nI really liked to play this game it's very addictif and i had lot of fun specially when i play with a friend we have to trick other players into believing us .\n\nTown of Salem is available on all internet browsers and Steam, for free on browsers and for  5$ on Steam.","April 24","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Dont get me wrong random people is also a fun experianse in its own right but usually i find that playing with friends leads to more comical events.\n\nanyways the game is about the townies vs the evil forces trying to kill them be it the mafia, the serial killer, whicked jesters, executioners, werewolves, vampires, etc. But your not alone. evil doesnt always play well against itself either. So deception is the name of the game.\n\nPeople can ask you your roll, and you can be honest, or deceitful. And just because you died doesnt mean thats the end of you. Your death note could point the blame at someone, You could tell who killed you to the medium, who will tell the rest of the townies. OR you can lie, just to mess with people. Your choice. :D\n\nThe Game is free on their website and is great for those times when you just need to kill some time.\n\nall in all I'd definatly recommend.","February 15, 2015","true","47.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun in a "Guess Who" sort of way.\n\nPretty much two teams of people (and some unaffiliated people) in a town trying to collect information or convince the others of this or that.\n\nNo one knows what anyone else is at first. Everyone chooses a name, the game begins, and you're given a random role which no one knows but you.\n\nThere's a buncha roles. With each having their own ability and goal. Some need to lynch or kill the enemy team. Some just need to survive to the end of the game regardless of which team wins. Some even win by getting lynched.\n\nRoles basically boil down to either collecting information, attacking other players, defending other players, blocking other players from performing their actions, or misleading other players.

It's fun in a "Guess Who" sort of way.\n\nPretty much two teams of people (and some unaffiliated people) in a town trying to collect information or convince the others of this or that.\n\nNo one knows what anyone else is at first. Everyone chooses a name, the game begins, and you're given a random role which no one knows but you.\n\nThere's a buncha roles. With each having their own ability and goal. Some need to lynch or kill the enemy team. Some just need to survive to the end of the game regardless of which team wins. Some even win by getting lynched.\n\nRoles basically boil down to either collecting information, attacking other players, defending other players, blocking other players from performing their actions, or misleading other players.

There's no other game really like it and I love the fact that it's the one game out there I actually get to use my detective skills in.  I really hoped L.A. Noire would have had more detective skills involved but really it was a matter of looking at every clue in a certain area and moving on, not like this though.\n\nYou get put into a certain role, with certain conditions to win and certain abilities and you need to find the people who are against you, it sounds simple however there are good, bad and neutral roles and it's tough to find who's who in the game.  It's a very well balanced game with honestly only a couple boring roles to play.\n\nThis is the most amount of fun I've had gaming ever.  Seriously, I got a new mouse and I still play this one, which barely uses it at all, even though I could pop into another mouse heavy game and really try it out I've still been sucked into this game of thought.\n\nFantastic.  Great job devs.\n\nHonestly, it's free if you look it up on google, it's a browser game, I paid for some in game credits and the fact that it's now much more accessible, so try it out if you don't feel like buying it, just make sure if you want to spend money on credits for skins, pets, ect that you buy it on steam first, at least until they're added to the free to play list.","June 21, 2015","true","60.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If writing this review to wean me off Town of Salem so I can go to bed.)\n\nBasically what we have is a 'Werewolf' style game but with none of the tiresome eye-closing/eye-opening and far less opportunities for cheating.\n\nThere are fifteen players in a game and each is assigned a role at random. The roles fall into three categories, Good Townspeople, Mafia and Neutrals.\n\n- Good Townspeoples' goal is to kill all the Mafia and the Serial Killer (a Neutral)\n- Mafia's goal is to kill al the Good Townspeople and the Serial Killer\n- Each Neutral has their own goal, specific to their role\n\nSome roles have the ability to kill other characters during the night, some characters are immune to being killed during the night but any player can be hung by hue and cry during the day if the majority of the town (including Mafia and Neutrals) agrees on it. This is where the real fun comes in. However well you deploy your role abilities, there's always the chance that you might be put on the spot and accused of being a traitor to the town. You often find yourself with little more than a few second to explain your actions (or tell a convincing lie) before the rope is around your neck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/danepanda/recommended/334230/","danepanda","Pandapop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/danepanda/","168 products in account","Town of Salem is massively enjoyable, especially when you consider how it manages to create mystery, suspense and strategic situations with so little. Each role (mostly) has an interesting thing to do, some roles are dull and are based entirely on luck and nothing else, but overall, you can develop your own strategy for each character and use it to the advantage (or disadvantage) of the group. Right, it is a really good game. Really engaged and good fun to play with...however...\n\nWhat ruins the game is the sheer level of cheating and bad form displayed by a lot of players. I've had the good fortune to play with some excellent players and have great games. But on the majority of occasions, I end up stuck with some really rude, bigotted, spamming and sometimes peadophillic people. I report them of course, but the next game or so, there they are again, and aiming to ruin the game for me because I called them on it.\n\nIn some games as well, people actually cheat by telling people IRL who did what. For example, N1 as SK I killed the escort. Escort did not leave a will, ya know, the main way of communicating after you die (less the medium) and I got lynched because another person in the game was sat in the same room as the escort, and the escort told him. After trying to defend myself, as you would if you want to try to win, I was labelled a '♥♥♥' and told to 'go cry yu f***, b***** die in a fire' and so on...as if I chose to be the SK and then was totally in the wrong for trying to escape a lynching!\n\nThis is the only element of the game I find completely offputting, that this is going on, and it ruins games and throws it into complete bias. Everybody should have a fair shot at winning, and not get screwed over so easily by people who use their own mechanics to swing games. Adding in the fact that you get personally attacked by these people for actually trying to play the game. I know that monitoring a chat service is difficult and rely's on the players reporting, but the report function is not sufficient, especially when you can't give a reason for the report. And I am aware that there is no real way that the developers can stop this from happening, same as WoW can't really do much against gold farmers.\n\nI would recommend it, but I do hope the developers are aware that this type of player ruins it for everybody else, and is, as such, the only, albeit quite seriously so, offputting part of the game.","June 22, 2015","true","240.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although I have to say the quality of the game completely depends on the town you play with. I have had some really awesome rounds where everybody plays their roles really well but i have also had some rounds where either everbody leaves because they don't like their role or where the town(or mafia) is a bunch of complete idiots... These rounds are not so fun.\n\nThat being said, the developers are constantly working on the game and are implementing rules that prevent people leaving or gamethrowing as well as bringing in new roles that should make the game a lot more interesting.\n\nIf you are unsure about paying (the very small amount in my opinion) then it is available as a free in browser game as well, though you don't start with any town points and it seems to be a bit slower when trying to join a lobby. I would, however, recommend paying the $5 to support the developers of the great game.\n\n**UPDATE**\nSo a few things have been added since I first wrote this review. Some new roles (forger, vampire, vampire hunter) have been added, and the scrolls system has been introduced.\n\nI decided to add this bit because I have seen a lot of negative reviews based solely on the fact that the scrolls system had been implemented. Here's what you need to know:\n\nThe scrolls system DOES:\n- increase your chance of a getting a particular role\n- Mean that if there are a few people using a particular scroll, you are less likely to get that role\n- require the use of town points to purchase (but you earn town points for each game you play)\n\nThe scrolls system DOESN'T:\n- stop you from getting a particular role if people are using scrolls for that role\n- guarantee that you will get the particular role you have a scroll for the first time you use it\n- apply in ranked games. Scrolls cannot be used in ranked, so you have an equal chance of getting any role.\n- Stop the game from being enjoyable\n\nThere is also now a chat filter you can turn on if you like.","June 8, 2015","true","133.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are reading this review, that means you are viewing the Steam version. By purchasing this game, you receive a few slight advantages to the browser version:\n\n> A bonus supply of coins which is enough for one or two cosmetics.\n> Steam achievements.\n> Easier access to play it with friends.\n> The removal of any issues you may have on your internet browser.\n> Everything else that Steam will provide you.\n\nI purchased this game without ever playing the browser version, and I have never once regretted my purchase. Anyways, onto the main review...\n\nIn this game, you are placed in a small virtual town. After choosing the name you will have for that particular game, you will be given a role. Town of Salem roles are organized into three categories. These are: Town, Mafia, and Neutral.\n\nTown roles focus on protecting the town from evildoers. Most roles in this category are based around locating killers. There are many different ways to do this. For example, the Lookout has a chance of witnessing murder. The Sheriff and Investigator can identify bad guys if they interrogate the right person. The Jailor can hold people hostage during the night and literally get info out of them. There are also town roles that can heal, attack others based on suspicions that they might be evil, bring other townies back from the dead, etc.  All town roles win together.\n\nMafia roles are related to killing all who oppose them. Only Mafia members know who the other Mafia are, and they meet in secret during the night to 'do business'. The Godfather is their leader, and he directs his lieutenant, the Mafioso, to kill targets of his choice whilst the town sleeps. If the Godfather is hanged, the Mafioso secretly becomes the new Godfather. If all Mafia killing roles are eliminated, the next highest-ranking member will become a Mafioso. But not all Mafia members deal with murder. The Framer can hijack investigations, fooling Investigators and Sheriffs into thinking one of their fellow townies are with the Mafia. The Blackmailer can silence a player of their choice during the night, preventing that person from talking, and in some cases, defending themselves the next day. The Janitor can clean up murders after the Mafioso does their work, preventing everyone who is not in the Mafia from ever knowing the role of the Mafia's victim. The roles go on.  All Mafia roles win together .\n\nNeutral roles are perhaps the most diverse. Some are  truly  neutral, while others are pure evil, and some roles are just mischievous. The Serial Killer commits murders during the night, attempting to wither down both the town and the Mafia and win in the end. The Executioner is given a random town target that only they know, and in order to gain a victory, they must fool everyone else into lynching (hanging on trial) their target. The Jester is a crazed lunatic who, mysteriously, needs to get themself hanged in order to win. There are tons of Neutral roles, and so many different play-styles along with them. Don't you hate being transported to another location by the Witch? Don't you fear the dreaded mass-murder the Arsonist can cause after dousing several players? Do you dread the howl of the Werewolf, or the whispers of the Vampires? The list goes on.  Most Neutral roles win on their own terms.\n\nAll in all, Town of Salem is a game of deception. You must be willing to lie, cheat, and kill your way to victory. Trust is a lie. Survival is everything. Can YOU survive the Town of Salem?\n\nI'm just kidding. Of course you can't.","February 27","true","172.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no other game really like it and I love the fact that it's the one game out there I actually get to use my detective skills in.  I really hoped L.A. Noire would have had more detective skills involved but really it was a matter of looking at every clue in a certain area and moving on, not like this though.\n\nYou get put into a certain role, with certain conditions to win and certain abilities and you need to find the people who are against you, it sounds simple however there are good, bad and neutral roles and it's tough to find who's who in the game.  It's a very well balanced game with honestly only a couple boring roles to play.\n\nThis is the most amount of fun I've had gaming ever.  Seriously, I got a new mouse and I still play this one, which barely uses it at all, even though I could pop into another mouse heavy game and really try it out I've still been sucked into this game of thought.\n\nFantastic.  Great job devs.\n\nHonestly, it's free if you look it up on google, it's a browser game, I paid for some in game credits and the fact that it's now much more accessible, so try it out if you don't feel like buying it, just make sure if you want to spend money on credits for skins, pets, ect that you buy it on steam first, at least until they're added to the free to play list.","June 21, 2015","true","60.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If writing this review to wean me off Town of Salem so I can go to bed.)\n\nBasically what we have is a 'Werewolf' style game but with none of the tiresome eye-closing/eye-opening and far less opportunities for cheating.\n\nThere are fifteen players in a game and each is assigned a role at random. The roles fall into three categories, Good Townspeople, Mafia and Neutrals.\n\n- Good Townspeoples' goal is to kill all the Mafia and the Serial Killer (a Neutral)\n- Mafia's goal is to kill al the Good Townspeople and the Serial Killer\n- Each Neutral has their own goal, specific to their role\n\nSome roles have the ability to kill other characters during the night, some characters are immune to being killed during the night but any player can be hung by hue and cry during the day if the majority of the town (including Mafia and Neutrals) agrees on it. This is where the real fun comes in. However well you deploy your role abilities, there's always the chance that you might be put on the spot and accused of being a traitor to the town. You often find yourself with little more than a few second to explain your actions (or tell a convincing lie) before the rope is around your neck. There's nothing more satisfying than talking yourself out of trouble when standing on the gallows. (Especially if you deserve to be there.)\n\nIn summary, buy this. It's not expensive and it's really good fun.","February 28, 2015","true","600.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well all i can say is it was the best money i have spent.\n\ntown of salem as the description states is like the game Mafia, no not the video game the Party Game wher eyou have to use deception or investigation to win the game.\n\nPlay it with friends and you will probably no longer be friends with them\nPlay it with strangers and laugh when you kill them all or lynch them\n\nYou will learn how to lie and lie convincingly. You will also learn to how to spot lies.\n\nSo down to the game:\n\nUp to 15 people in a game it is actually best with 15 and also the most fun, generally 4 evil roles (3 mafia and a serial killer), 1 executioner who is trying to get a town member Lynched, 1 jester who is trying to get lynched and 9 town members.  With less players there will be less roles available for both town and others.\n\nEach role will tell you what you can do but i would adviselooking up the roles and how they work on the main website before you play as there really is no tutorial on how to play. Custom games have more roles to choose from  and can be a lot more intresting.  You do have to have played 40 games before you can play ranked but that i guess id for the real try hards and i just enjoy playing it for fun.\n\nPros\n\n+ game is technically free you can play free version or pay up to 5 bucks on steam and get 5 bucks of in game cash\n+ earn in game cash for every win, first win of day and several achievements\n+ in game cash is used to buy skins, pets and basic eye cany stuff so you cant pay to win as it gets you nowhere\n+ seems like there is a ranked system and also custom game mode where you can set as many roles as you like\n+ you can kill your friends and laugh about it when you have lied to them the whole game\n+ you can get revenge on a friend who killed you in a previous game\n+ community is not so harsh on new players well not that i have seen anyway\n+ you can get killed or lynched and still get a win\n+ easy to pick up and learn on the go\n+ you can use a different name each game\n\ncons\n\n- lots of rage quitters people dc at start of game or when they get killed\n- no tutorial to tell you exactly how to play\n- you will loose friends if you play this game\n- you see the same names being used a lot\n\nwould i recomend this game oh hell yes this is not a game about high end graphics it is all about role playing and deception, have fun murder your friends,  lynch them, haunt them from beyond the grave, tell on them while you are dead, execute them while you have them in jail,  shoot them when they come to visit or just go and shoot them if you get a feeling  about them but heck you may not have any of those options.\n\nGive it a shot and have some fun it is well worth it.","June 21, 2015","true","87.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Townies are requiered to eliminate mafia and evil neutral roles, Mafia needs to kill all of the Townies (and evil roles that are a treat to the family) while each Neutral role has a specific goal, wheter it is to be the last man standing or simply survive until the game ends.\n\nAfter joining the lobby the match starts once 15 people are gathered (unless the hosts decides to start sooner with fewer people but please don't do that). You choose the name you'll have during that match, for each match you can choose a diffrent name, and after that you'll get assigned a role and a game can start. In game phases are divided in to day time and night time when each role, if able, performs its ability. During the day all of the players gather to share informations, talk, lie and acuse each other. At the end of a "discussion phase" players vote who to send to the block, and if more than half players vote someone out that someone is given a chance to defend himself. Players then vote if the acused one is guilty or innocent. If voted guilty he is executed and if not he is released. During the night time Mafia gathers to discuss their plans such as who will they murder next, who will be blackmailed, who will be framed and so on. But Mafia members aren't the only night owls, Serial killers, Werewolfs and other evil people are choosing their targets, Sheriffs are looking for bad guys while Doctors are visiting potential targets.\n\nNotable "mods" the game offers are "Normal" and "Chaos" mod. Normal one offers mostly predetermined roles, leaving only a few of them to be random, so you know what to expect in that match, while Chaos mod generates 15 random roles, making the match a lot less predictable, but in a way a lot more fun. There is also an option of joining a Custom made match where the host of the lobby chooses which role will be played.\n\nThis game puts your ability to lie at test, but also your ability to tell the truth, as sometimes you will have to convince people to trust you when you're actualy not lying. However if you pull too much attention to yourself you just may make yourself the next target of the Mafia. Connecting dots is the most useful skill.\n\ntl;dr: You like to lie without feeling guilt?

Obviously this doesn't happen much in real life (unless you are a lawyer) but Town Of Salem takes it to an art form. Manipulation, deceit, trickery and misdirection all play a huge part in this online-only multiplayer game of psychology and basically being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWith a few different game modes to mix it up (as well as some custom ones you can host for others), the usual set-up is a town... the town of Salem in fact. This town has a slight problem. There are the good, honest, regular townies that live there... and then it seems that the mafia have moved into town and a serial killer is on the loose. The catch? Nobody knows who has what role in the town and they have to convince, lie, backstab and otherwise manipulate their way to living through each night, during which some unlucky sod will die.\n\nDifferent roles for all the factions (teams?) have different abilities which they use to further their side's goals, but who to trust and who to suspect. This leads to some very tense games and shock endings. Great fun alone or with friends :P","July 5, 2015","true","167.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpazmanianDevil/recommended/334230/","SpazmanianDevil","SpazmanianDevil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpazmanianDevil/","556 products in account","Ever since Steam recommended this game to me it's claimed a portion of my daily life.\n\nIt's a game that reminded me of Mitadake High (Pyrce High I think it's called now over on the BYOND webiste) except better mechanics and a helluva lot more orgainzed. There's light role playing to figure out who's who, who should be hung or killed and the ability to take notes, all in the name of trying to win the game. Whether you're Mafia, a Townie, or some non-denominational bad or good guy, The whole goal of the game is achieve your objective and win the game. That could mean tricking people into lynching you, setting people on fire, survive the whole game without dying, or a myriad of other objects as there are tons of roles.\n\nYou don't get to pick your role. It's randomly chosen for you. You're given a box that tells you what it means, what you can do, and how to win the game. The best part of this game, is you don't always have to be alive to win. For instance, if you are aligned to win with Town and you die but Town survives, then you also have won the game.\n\n"But I don't wanna sit around and watch a game I'm not playing." I might hear you say. But what if I told you that sometimes there's a Medium that can talk to the "dead" and you can give them info to help the living people win? But sometimes the Medium's Curse is strong and they get killed first night. So that can suck if you know exactly who killed you but you can't tell anyone.\n\nThis game is definitely a must have in my book. It's less complicated then it sounds and totally addictive. If you like RPG elements, sprinkled with a board game atmosphere and Whodunit mysteries, give this game a shot.\n\nP.S. If you don't want to buy it, it is free to play here: http://blankmediagames.com/  Though if you do buy it on Steam, apparently there are perks such as, there are faster loading times, $5 worth of town coins if you're into stylizing, the ability to unlock acheivements that give you more coins, and better compatibility with operating Systems.","March 25, 2015","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyways, this game is quite difficult to learn, especially if you are just starting out, but even then it' very addicting (Disregard my hours played). I would of course recommend watching youtube videos are tutorials about this game first, as would anyone. Just prepare, if you do buy this game, to be completely screwed over by your fellow town, nobody will listen to your claims, and if they do, they're working against you.

Just an FYI, by buying this on Steam, you're basically buying 1400 town points, as this game is free online. As for the game, I recommend it. However, it is a strategy game of lying and deception, based off of the forum/card game mafia. Getting started can be a little difficult, as you don't know what many of the roles do. I recommend reading the wiki a bit before you get started; it contains a lot of useful information and tips about the game.

Not only are every new game's people different, but the roles are different everytime as well.\n\nThe Neutral:• Art and animation style is very minimalistic.\n• Some people find the music repetitive.\n• The cosmetic options are kind of silly, gives it this 'Facebook game' with no dignity.\n\nThe Bad:• No customization menu while in-game.\n• Lack of any display customization options.\n• Microtransactions are advertised pretty hard.\n\nRemarks:Overall, the game is a lot of fun to play. The minor gripes I have with it don't come close to harming the overall experience to any significant degree. Only thing I'd like to see is an overhaul of the art and animation.\n\n9/10.","May 11","true","80.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sygnus/recommended/334230/","sygnus","sygnus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sygnus/","257 products in account","This game is very fun. A classic deception game with added roles that are balanced and fun to play as, (most of the time and depending on your tastes).\n\nI originally played SC2 Mafia, but as I became a more casual player and more of my friends transitioned, i switched to Town of Salem.\n\nI recommend this game as an introduction to deception games, however as I am also a fan of SC2 Mafia I will give a short comparison for the uninitiated.\n\nDisclaimer: These categories are obviously not balanced and are simply what i would use to decide which "Mafia" game i would want to play.\n\nVariety of Roles: SC2 Mafia ++\nCurrently SC2 Mafia offers a larger variety of roles that make the game more interesting and overall more entertaining. As of right now, Roles that are in SC2 Mafia but are not in Town of Salem include:\nCitizen[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nCoroner (was replaced by the Medium in ToS, i actually like this change because coroner was easily the least fun role in the game)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nTown Crier[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nMason[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nMason Leader (Replaced by Vampire Hunter)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nAgent (Mafia Support)\nBeguiler (Mafia Support)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nKidnapper (Mafia Jailor)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nWitch Doctor; Or a Doctor that has been bitten by a Vampire (Neutral Evil)\nAuditor (Neutral Evil)\nJudge (Neutral Evil)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]As well as a seperate Mafia force called the Triad, which is essentially just a reskinned and renamed Mafia, but allows for Multiple Mafia teams in All Any or Mafia Vs. Triad games in custom.[vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net]\n\nMost of the extra roles revolve around the possibility of Citizens, namely the Masons and the Auditor.\n\n\nLeast time spent in Lobby/Que: Town of Salem ++\nTown of Salem's standalone client (and website) makes finding games very fast and perfect for casual playing. The friends lobby system also makes it easy for friends to que into games together. Both of these are issues you will have playing SC2 Mafia\n\n\nVariety of Cosmetics: Town of Salem +\nSelf explainatory. SC2 Mafia cosmetics are free after a certain amount of games, but ToS wins in variety.\n\n\nVariety and Customizable Game Modes: SC2 Mafia ++\nThis one goes to SC2 Mafia because there are strengths you can give to or take away from roles, a feature not yet in Town of Salem. This makes for even more interesting games, As everyone in SC2 Mafia community has their own preferred game save. Don't think Executioners should be night immune? You can turn that off. Do you think Vigi should only be able to shoot twice? You can turn that off. Overall SC2 Mafia wins in this category hands down.\n\nTo Summarize\nOverall SC2 Mafia is superior for me in terms of enjoyment, but ToS is a great alternative if you want quick games and leaver penalty. ToS has strengths in it's addition of the report system, easy access to games and community (big bonus) however, for me, SC2 is the better game when it comes to time spent to enjoyment levels.\n\nIf Town of Salem adds the other roles and adds a more customizable lobby system, I will not hesitate to remove the comparison or at the very least modify it to review these changes.","March 31","true","89.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The 2 things that are REALLY important to the game is price OR a low price, This game is $5 (I got for $2.50 Steam sale) and I could play this for hundreds of hours\n2. I like to list PROs, CONs and RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nPROS:\n- Large amount of characters and content\n- Great art design\n- Great game idea\n- Cheap price\n- Although there is a lot to learn and you have to decieve people, it's not too hard to get a grasp on for new players\n- Lots of players\n- Many reliable servers\n\nCONS:\n- The login menu is kinda silly (Read recommendations)\n- They use a high price of IRL money for a low amount of ingame money (eg $5 for around 1300 gold)\n- Before logging in, there is no music volume setting, you have to log in to access it\n- When given a day duty (Jailor) it's easy to forget to do said duty\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n- Delete the need to login, make the account name the same as the steam name\n- Right before night, do a pop-up asking Jailor to choose\n- Lower the $ per Gold to around $1 for $2000. Although other games (CS:GO for example) are reliant on like $50 for a gun, this game will NEVER gain much from high prices for skins. It's more like the kinda game where people pay their $5, almost everyone has heard of it and only around 20% of your audience will STAY for more than 200 hours.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION\n- You dont want people swearing on your game, that's all fine and dandy but theres a better way not to expose your younger audience to bad language. Lemme put it into steps\n\n1. When the game is started for the first time ever, ask the player if they want to see curses or not\n2. - If YES, when someone swears the player will see the entire message\n- If NO, then the word will be taken out and replaced with *'s or spaces.\n\nWHY? This means that the adult audience dont feel the need to dumb down the F word to fak, ♥♥♥♥, fech etc. (thus infuriating them) whilst the children arent seeing the curse.","May 23","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/recommended/334230/","KronusX","KronusX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KronusX/","266 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTown of Salem is one of the most amazing adaptations of games such as Werewolf and Mafia combined together. The game consists of rounds where 15 players attempts to perform their roles depending on the team assigned. The game has a lot of good mechanics , however it can take quite a bit of time to learn the role due to the fact that each role is different . Essentially the town is attempting to survive the night while dealing with various threats (werewolf,mafia,executioner,arsonist,jester,serial killer as well as different townies) .\n\nThe game overall can be tricky early since it relies on manipulation of the other players in order to achieve their goal which can lead to people acting like new players (people trying to get killed on purpose) , random accusations in order to shift blame and also people randomly executing other possible suspects (vigilante/jailor). Sometimes it can become frustrating since people dying early usually quit which can remove some clues and make the game harder for some, easier for others.\n\nThe game also has a will used by the individuals which is usually used (recommended) to write the person's name and role and also clues on what he/she did each day in order to either help villagers get rid of the evil individuals or to confuse them.\n\nThe game has a store but everything bought in is simply cosmetics, such as a different house , different layout for the map, a pet (decorate), costumes and even a different way to get executed, so nothing changing the rules . Keep in mind, the game is actually free, the steam version comes with some points that can be used in the shop to buy decorative items.\n\nOverall, this is a great game to play with friends (nothing better to create a feud than backstabbing friends) and it is also a great game to play with randoms. Some games can be bad and have trolls, but overall I had a great experience overall. I would recommend this game to everyone.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over tohttp://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","May 20","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a bundle of laughs and incredibly fun. I don't have the best patience but it really takes a lot of pushing to test mine in here. I strongly recommend playing this game for yourself on the browser first if you don't want to pay, if you enjoy the game, I strongly recommend buying it here. It's worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Unique game aspect\n- Colorful art and fun music\n- Most people are respectful to each other, even in game\n- Simple UI\n- Not terribly grindy to obtain gold\n- Regular sales making certain expensive packages super affordable\n- Several roles to play as\n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs here and there\n- Requires strategy, lot of people in Classic think pointing fingers on the first day is the best idea, it's not.\n- No freedom to swear, not a big deal but it sucks having to watch my own mouth\n- Can be difficult to maintain your role and your will at once, depending on your role.\n- Far too much marketing\n- Not enough gold rewards for playing the game\n\nAgain I strongly recommend this game, and if by some chance, my review led you to Salem, please use my name as the referal. :3 Name is kayanakoe in game. I would love to try playing a game or two with you guys as well.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention something, the game tends to be heavy on marketing so.. any gold income you would try to gain legitimately is low, 5 gold if, IF you win.

Town of Salem is a game where you are given a role, and depending on the role, your either with The Town, who wants to live, or a killing role/Neutral role, where Ou are against town, and want to kill them. As Town, you must work together by using your abilities to determine who the mafia, serial killer(s), arsonist(s)etc are.\nIf you Don't like thinking games or teamwork, than I would not reccomend this game to you.\n\nPros:\nFriendly Community\nFriendly Developers\nGood Soundtrack\nGood and creative roles\nGreat Concept\nAddicting and fun\n\nCons:\n-AFK people can screw over Town and Mafia members\nEx: afk investigator won't be getting any info, while an afk Mafioso or God father prevents disguises, forgers, and Janitors from doing their jobs\n- Trolls and Spammers, not only do they ruin chat, and block information, but people suspect them of Jesters and lunch them, resulting in either jester winning or a waste of a lynch\n- Gamethrowers\nEx: Dead GodFather releases the names of remaining Mafia members on his last will\n-Community is a little small, but still is pretty friendly for the most part\n\n\nI'd say if you want an addicting game of murder and deception, buy Town of Salem, or play the web version for free\n\n7.5/10\n","February 10","true","72.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Townies are requiered to eliminate mafia and evil neutral roles, Mafia needs to kill all of the Townies (and evil roles that are a treat to the family) while each Neutral role has a specific goal, wheter it is to be the last man standing or simply survive until the game ends.\n\nAfter joining the lobby the match starts once 15 people are gathered (unless the hosts decides to start sooner with fewer people but please don't do that). You choose the name you'll have during that match, for each match you can choose a diffrent name, and after that you'll get assigned a role and a game can start. In game phases are divided in to day time and night time when each role, if able, performs its ability. During the day all of the players gather to share informations, talk, lie and acuse each other. At the end of a "discussion phase" players vote who to send to the block, and if more than half players vote someone out that someone is given a chance to defend himself. Players then vote if the acused one is guilty or innocent. If voted guilty he is executed and if not he is released. During the night time Mafia gathers to discuss their plans such as who will they murder next, who will be blackmailed, who will be framed and so on. But Mafia members aren't the only night owls, Serial killers, Werewolfs and other evil people are choosing their targets, Sheriffs are looking for bad guys while Doctors are visiting potential targets.\n\nNotable "mods" the game offers are "Normal" and "Chaos" mod. Normal one offers mostly predetermined roles, leaving only a few of them to be random, so you know what to expect in that match, while Chaos mod generates 15 random roles, making the match a lot less predictable, but in a way a lot more fun. There is also an option of joining a Custom made match where the host of the lobby chooses which role will be played.\n\nThis game puts your ability to lie at test, but also your ability to tell the truth, as sometimes you will have to convince people to trust you when you're actualy not lying. However if you pull too much attention to yourself you just may make yourself the next target of the Mafia. Connecting dots is the most useful skill.\n\ntl;dr: You like to lie without feeling guilt? You like to trick people? You admire getting tricked? This is a game for you!","November 23, 2015","true","339.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sygnus/recommended/334230/","sygnus","sygnus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sygnus/","257 products in account","This game is very fun. A classic deception game with added roles that are balanced and fun to play as, (most of the time and depending on your tastes).\n\nI originally played SC2 Mafia, but as I became a more casual player and more of my friends transitioned, i switched to Town of Salem.\n\nI recommend this game as an introduction to deception games, however as I am also a fan of SC2 Mafia I will give a short comparison for the uninitiated.\n\nDisclaimer: These categories are obviously not balanced and are simply what i would use to decide which "Mafia" game i would want to play.\n\nVariety of Roles: SC2 Mafia ++\nCurrently SC2 Mafia offers a larger variety of roles that make the game more interesting and overall more entertaining. As of right now, Roles that are in SC2 Mafia but are not in Town of Salem include:\nCitizen[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nCoroner (was replaced by the Medium in ToS, i actually like this change because coroner was easily the least fun role in the game)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nTown Crier[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nMason[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nMason Leader (Replaced by Vampire Hunter)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nAgent (Mafia Support)\nBeguiler (Mafia Support)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nKidnapper (Mafia Jailor)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]\nWitch Doctor; Or a Doctor that has been bitten by a Vampire (Neutral Evil)\nAuditor (Neutral Evil)\nJudge (Neutral Evil)[sc2mafia.wikia.com]As well as a seperate Mafia force called the Triad, which is essentially just a reskinned and renamed Mafia, but allows for Multiple Mafia teams in All Any or Mafia Vs. Triad games in custom.[vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net]\n\nMost of the extra roles revolve around the possibility of Citizens, namely the Masons and the Auditor.\n\n\nLeast time spent in Lobby/Que: Town of Salem ++\nTown of Salem's standalone client (and website) makes finding games very fast and perfect for casual playing. The friends lobby system also makes it easy for friends to que into games together. Both of these are issues you will have playing SC2 Mafia\n\n\nVariety of Cosmetics: Town of Salem +\nSelf explainatory. SC2 Mafia cosmetics are free after a certain amount of games, but ToS wins in variety.\n\n\nVariety and Customizable Game Modes: SC2 Mafia ++\nThis one goes to SC2 Mafia because there are strengths you can give to or take away from roles, a feature not yet in Town of Salem. This makes for even more interesting games, As everyone in SC2 Mafia community has their own preferred game save. Don't think Executioners should be night immune? You can turn that off. Do you think Vigi should only be able to shoot twice? You can turn that off. Overall SC2 Mafia wins in this category hands down.\n\nTo Summarize\nOverall SC2 Mafia is superior for me in terms of enjoyment, but ToS is a great alternative if you want quick games and leaver penalty. ToS has strengths in it's addition of the report system, easy access to games and community (big bonus) however, for me, SC2 is the better game when it comes to time spent to enjoyment levels.\n\nIf Town of Salem adds the other roles and adds a more customizable lobby system, I will not hesitate to remove the comparison or at the very least modify it to review these changes.","March 31","true","89.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I would of course recommend watching youtube videos are tutorials about this game first, as would anyone. Just prepare, if you do buy this game, to be completely screwed over by your fellow town, nobody will listen to your claims, and if they do, they're working against you. Amazing game over all and well...if you don't know how to lie you're screwed.","May 22, 2015","true","187.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a bundle of laughs and incredibly fun. I don't have the best patience but it really takes a lot of pushing to test mine in here. I strongly recommend playing this game for yourself on the browser first if you don't want to pay, if you enjoy the game, I strongly recommend buying it here. It's worth it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Unique game aspect\n- Colorful art and fun music\n- Most people are respectful to each other, even in game\n- Simple UI\n- Not terribly grindy to obtain gold\n- Regular sales making certain expensive packages super affordable\n- Several roles to play as\n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs here and there\n- Requires strategy, lot of people in Classic think pointing fingers on the first day is the best idea, it's not.\n- No freedom to swear, not a big deal but it sucks having to watch my own mouth\n- Can be difficult to maintain your role and your will at once, depending on your role.\n- Far too much marketing\n- Not enough gold rewards for playing the game\n\nAgain I strongly recommend this game, and if by some chance, my review led you to Salem, please use my name as the referal. :3 Name is kayanakoe in game. I would love to try playing a game or two with you guys as well.\n\nUpdate: I forgot to mention something, the game tends to be heavy on marketing so.. any gold income you would try to gain legitimately is low, 5 gold if, IF you win. So gl trying to get passed the newly found greed... I still play but the marketing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me way the ♥♥♥♥ off now.","May 17","true","55.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Never had a problem with it, besides a person who gamethrows from time to time. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was free, but eh. This game treats me well. You meet good temporary friends for the time period that the game is going on, and the only problem I see is that there are things you could be improving on but just choose not to, like adding some new roles or making overall animation improvements, but besides that I'd reccomend this game. Just needs a little more balancing, censorship from curse words, and maybe easier ways to get coins without paying for them, like maybe you could get like 35 coins every time you get an achievement. You don't see too many games like this, and if you do they probably went out of development years ago. 9/10, would reccomend.","May 27","true","40.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It inherits its style from TTT, a popular game mode from Garrys Mod, but in my opinion is more polished and eccentric. There are many different roles, instead of three, and each role is from a different category (Town, Mafia or Neutral). The town have to try and find all the Mafia and the evil/killing neutral roles and lynch them to win. This is ultimately a game of trust and deception, where you have to do whatever you can to make everyone believe you, whether you are lying or telling the truth.\n\nYou have to be prepared for extreme anti-climaxes after each night and lynching. Anything can happen in this, and every role makes the game exciting in a different way. I find almost every role fun too, from making mafiosos transport in to their own bullet to disguising as my friends. There are of course some roles that people would prefer not to be, but in the end almost every game is as enjoyable as the last.\n\nIt is true that the game is free online, but I would still find this game worth it at double the price and you get your money's worth of points to spend on death animations, characters, pets etc. You can also compare your achievements to your friends and brag how you burned five people in one night. The rumour that it runs faster on steam actually is TRUE. The engine for steam is different (which is the small download you get when buying Town Of Salem) and allows steam users to run the game twice as fast as on the internet.\n\nSo, if you like to control your friends as a witch and force them to kill themself, or just like to stop them from being able to do anything by role blocking them, then I would DEFINITELY recommend this game. People who enjoy TTT or any crime browser games would also find this enjoyable. Have fun!","July 8, 2015","true","59.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Finding other killers then getting them hung, earning the peoples trust. I used this trust to the point of me literally putting in the note I left after each murder that I had power over the people, enough to kill without suspicion. I was only found out when there were two people left, that was how I won as Hannibal Lecter. The best part about this game is the uniqueness of it all. Other games would probably turn this into a puzzle game. This game is a puzzle in itself. You either kill or be killed, the best part being that you can manipulate the town in the best ways! If I am the godfather. I simply have my mafioso do the killing. Then when I am investigated I show up as a town member. If the mafioso dies I simply walk in then kill them myself. I am immune to attacks at night like the serial killer and have power over an entire group. As a serial killer, I gain the townsfolk's trust, then I kill them all while using my  personall smarts to catch other killers! Never in my life have I had more fun then the rush of finishing off the entire town with my own brain. It brings a whole new meaning to 1v2/1v3.

Even if you're not able to afford this game, go play it for free online! I promise you, if you like Clue and other mysterious games, you'll fall in love with this game in no time. I've been playing ranked lately and it is so fun to see this game come to a competitive level where everyone is playing so well it truly provides a challenge and you'll never get bored.\n\nEven if you're not that great at these types of games you can learn fairly quick, and the community for the most part is fairly nice as I've made a few friends that I now party with and play with a lot. Of course you'll come across a troll eventually that may lynch you for no reason, but for the most part you'll have a great time playing this game.

Purchasing this game on Steam does provide some ingame currency, and the currency can also be gained through playing games, or unlocking achievements.\n\nDeception is truly a massive part to the game, and it can be easily said, that those unfamiliar to the game may initially struggle when lying about their roles or actions, but overtime, it becomes second nature, with tricks such as fake wills, and knowing the town equivilant of a mafia role; consort=escort etc.  Every  single game goes a different route, even if you have the same role as the game before, which really adds to the replayability of this game.\n\nThe "ranked" system with point score was recently implemented into the game, where when a player has got a certain amount of wins, they can play this gamemode, against those who are similar to them- gaining or losing points which was not initial unlike the implement of the original system. A criticism of the system could be that if an amnesiac/witch/werewolf etc dies "night 1" to a killing role, this role loses the player points when they have done as good as nothing wrong. Due to this, getting a decent playable role in "ranked" can be seen to be the luck of the draw, but if a player does not like how the system works, they can always play the unranked gamemodes and see the pride as their win:loss ratio improves massively!\n\nTL;DR: Deception, killing players for their names, visiting Veterans night 1.

Finding other killers then getting them hung, earning the peoples trust.

I was only found out when there were two people left, that was how I won as Hannibal Lecter. The best part about this game is the uniqueness of it all. Other games would probably turn this into a puzzle game. This game is a puzzle in itself. You either kill or be killed, the best part being that you can manipulate the town in the best ways! If I am the godfather. I simply have my mafioso do the killing. Then when I am investigated I show up as a town member. If the mafioso dies I simply walk in then kill them myself. I am immune to attacks at night like the serial killer and have power over an entire group.

There's a bit of a learning curve to understanding all the roles, but after you do, it's a unique multi player deduction game that'll have you biting your nails no matter what role you're in.\n\nTHE FUN PART\n\nIf I'm a villager, my heart is pounding at night not sure if I'll make it to the next day - then I breath a sigh of relief when the dramatic music comes to a climax, and I'm still alive (seriously, you'll start wincing at that music, not knowing if you're about to die.) One person is claiming to be the lookout, and says the guy next to me was at the murder victims house last night. But I'm also the lookout! And this town's rules can't have two! Is he the serial killer or mafia trying to sew distrust? Is he the executioner, who's goal is to get one specific target lynched? Is he the jester, who is trying to look suspicious and get himself lynched? Do I tell everyone IM the lookout and the other guy must be lying, or will that just single me out to the serial killer?\n\nIf I'm a killer, then it's tense to sit in the town square with everyone else. It feels good when the heat is off me and the town is split with accusing themselves! They all put a town member on trial, things seem to be going according to plan, but how should I vote? I don't want to be the first to vote guilty, or, when he dies and they realize he was innocent, the mafia might be singled out as among the half that voted guilty.\n\nOr worse, maybe everyone else will abstain, or vote innocent, and ONLY the mafia will vote guilty. The guy wont die, and suddenly everyone will question why we voted guilty. You need to pay attention to chat to get a feel for how the town is going to vote lest you as the killer get singled out too early.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nTons of profanity in the community. I don't personally care, and there are lots of fun clever people, but expect every game to have a few usernames involving racism and highly vulgar/explicit death notes from the killers involving what they did to your genitalia. Despite the light hearted cartoon theme, the unfiltered community puts this game well into the 'Mature' rating that makes YouTube commenters look like intellectuals. (yes, there's a report button, but the abundance of this behavior makes me skeptical of how useful it is.)\n\nAnd the primary reason I cannot recommend this game: At this time, people are teaming up outside of the game (mostly via skype) and throwing games in favor of whatever side they want to win. Winning most games comes down to whether or not you're on the side that the 'conspiracy' side wants to win. I have had a few very intense games that were fun, but a majority of the games have consisted of people working together to throw the game for their side, so that (presumably) the side with more friends on it, wins.\n\nThis pretty much destroys everything the game was supposed to be about. Google Town of Salem Skype Cheaters to get a sense of how this is.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe game play is very solid and fun if you like to challenge your deductive reasoning and/or ability to deceive deductive reasoners. But until they prevent a way for mobs to gang up outside of the game/prevent people from making multiple free accounts to join a single game (or just be unable to team up within the game itself) to throw games away so that their friends/main account can win, the game is effectively broken.\n","June 16, 2015","false","15.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Purchasing this game on Steam does provide some ingame currency, and the currency can also be gained through playing games, or unlocking achievements.\n\nDeception is truly a massive part to the game, and it can be easily said, that those unfamiliar to the game may initially struggle when lying about their roles or actions, but overtime, it becomes second nature, with tricks such as fake wills, and knowing the town equivilant of a mafia role; consort=escort etc.  Every  single game goes a different route, even if you have the same role as the game before, which really adds to the replayability of this game.\n\nThe "ranked" system with point score was recently implemented into the game, where when a player has got a certain amount of wins, they can play this gamemode, against those who are similar to them- gaining or losing points which was not initial unlike the implement of the original system. A criticism of the system could be that if an amnesiac/witch/werewolf etc dies "night 1" to a killing role, this role loses the player points when they have done as good as nothing wrong. Due to this, getting a decent playable role in "ranked" can be seen to be the luck of the draw, but if a player does not like how the system works, they can always play the unranked gamemodes and see the pride as their win:loss ratio improves massively!\n\nTL;DR: Deception, killing players for their names, visiting Veterans night 1.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunessence/recommended/334230/","Lunessence","Lunessence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunessence/","90 products in account","Yes, only purchase this game through Steam if you would like to help support the devs. Otherwise, go to their website at blankmediagames.com and play it free there. If you use info sheets and the ToS Wiki during the game like I do, press the ESC button to resize the screen when playing through the Steam client. You can then cycle through your needed tabs with ease.\n\nIf you like detective games you may love ToS. I've never played an in-person version of Werewolf or Mafia but I have tried other versions that were or are out there on the web. I keep coming back to ToS. The other ones are too confusing to navigate, have a stiff learning curve or you get in trouble by longtime regulars for having a new account by threatening to report you for just trying to play because you couldn't possibly be a brand new player. And their games typically last only about 5 minutes. While that can be a good thing, I find that it's just too quick for me to be as deceitful as possible in only a couple of minutes.\n\nEach game in ToS takes around 30 minutes to complete and I personally do not believe that there are any boring roles. Each role is unique and while some are more aggressive roles, that means there has to be a balance of more passive roles. But each role plays an important part when played correctly or creatively. The only thing that makes a role boring is if you die on the first or second night. Those deaths are usually just the luck of the draw. But, that's just part of the game. Join another one and try again.\n\nI love getting creative with roles. For example, when I'm Survivor I like to be as vocal as possible. When I'm Jester, I like to be as quiet as possible. It's all in how you want to play around with human psychology within the rules of the game. I've seen games with just two Mafia members win and games where seven Mafia lost (All Any mode).\n\nI've seen my fair share of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry ingame but the dev team cares about their community and are very responsive. There are now profanity filters that you can choose to have on and there has always been a report button for cheaters and the really out-of-hand players. Mostly, people are just playing a personality role while they are alive and if they stick around while dead, you can have some sane and interesting conversations.\n\nIn the end, it's just a game. If someone is being a ♥♥♥♥, /ignore them and move on to the next game when the time comes. Each game is different and that's what is so enjoyable. Just remember to have fun and play your part as best you can.\n\n"All the world’s a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\nThey have their exits and their entrances,\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts..." ~Shakespeare","January 6","true","143.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What is there not to like about this? Addictive and fun.\n\nPros\n\nGameplay interactions with other players\nTricking and decieving people\nEvery game and outcome is different\nScroll/odds rebalancing can stifle chances of certain roles\n\nCons\n\nHighly dependant on other players not ruining the experience\nAnnoying pop up adds whether you paid for it on steam or play it for free\n\nGameplay\nThis originally started off as a browser game, which proved to be such a hit with the people who played it, that they wanted to help support the creators to get onto Steam and Mobile - so it could become more well known. With a successful kickstarter and greenlight, the goal was finally achieved! Perhaps in the future it will make it to other platforms, too.\n\nDon't let my time here fool you. I have just a little over a thousand matches played at this point in time from the browser version. So, where to begin?\n\n\nWell, first off, this is a party game based on the likes of Mafia. It's played with up to fifteen people, though you wouldn't want to have any less in order to have the best kind of game. The current updated version of this game starts you with the ability to choose your name – which can result in some hilarious trolling, depending on your mood. You know something's happening when half of the players decide to call themselves after Game of Thrones characters, or someone has a name that automatically makes others hate them.\n\n\nAfter that, you have the role-wheel, which will select you your role for the game. This can be skewed in favour of those who have brought scrolls from the in-game shop to try and increase their chances of landing the role they want. For example, every role can have a 7% chance of being selected for you. If you use a scroll, it can increase the odds of the role you want to say, 20%, whilst decreasing the odds for everyone else – so they would drop from 7% to 4%. This can be annoying if you prefer to not obtain scrolls – but honestly, there is so many roles to choose from, it shouldn't matter too much. At some point, you will have roles you don't want, and roles you love. That's part of the fun of a randomised selection. The shame about this is that you will get pop up adds to entice you into the shop to buy things.\n\n\nAfter finding out which of the 33 roles you are, you then act as according to it for the game. Each game can be anything between ten to thirty minutes long. The main game is split into several phases. You start off with:\n\n\nDay One: discussion. Then night one. Then day two: Deaths. Then discussion. Then voting. Then discussion – this cycle repeats right up until the ultimate winner(s) are declared. Depending on your role, will depend on when you can preform your actions – if you have actions to achieve. With the voting phrase, if someone is voted up, they have to defend themselves, and the other players will vote guilty or innocent. Guilty votes will kill the defendant, and innocent ones will spare them.\n\n\nYou have three “sides” to speak of. Side one is town, or the “good” side. Town's main job is to oust the bad side before the bad side kills them. The catch is, Town has no clue who is Town and who isn't. So through discussion and usage of roles, they have to work out who is telling the truth and who is lying. You can get Support roles, Protective roles, and killing roles.\n\n\nSide two is Mafia, the “bad” side. Mafia's main job is to kill every town member and persuade them all the while that they're Town. Mafia's average number is three. Their advantage over Town is that the Mafia know who each other is, and can communicate with each other at night. You can get Deception roles, Support, and Killing.\n\n\nSide three is Neutrals, who all have individual goals that can either tie hand in hand with Town or Mafia, or just benefit themselves. You can get Benign neutrals, Killing neutrals, or just plain Evil ones.\n\n\nBecause there are so many roles, I will just mention around two from each “side” as a small example of the kinds you can get.\n\n\nOne role Town can get is an Investigator. During night-time, they can choose to look at another player to determine what role they have. A successful invest will reveal up to three roles the person can be. For example, someone could show up as Vigilante (Town Killing), a Veteran (Town Killing) or a Mafioso (Mafia Killing.) Through guesswork and questions, you can figure out if the person is good or not. Another town role is the Jailer. At daytime, they can choose to jail whoever they think is suspicious, or someone random. At night, they can then question the person in their jail to try and figure their role out. If the Jailer suspects their captive of lying, then they can choose to execute them.\n\n\nFor the Mafia, they can have a Godfather, who is the leader. He can kill someone at night, or make a Mafioso do it for them. Their advantage is that they can't be killed at night, so if someone shot them, they would be immune. The Disguiser for Mafia is someone who can take on the name, position, and face of someone who died. So if a confirmed Town player is chosen to be killed, the Disguiser can choose to “become” that Town, and people would believe they were still the same player.\n\n\nFor Neutrals, you can get an Jester, whose goal is to be hung by everyone else. They can do this by being annoying or throwing false information. If they are hung, they can choose to kill a guilty voter at night, from the graveyard. You can also get a Serial Killer, whose goal is to kill everyone – Town and Mafia. Serial Killers are also immune at night.\n\n\nSo, yes. There's a lot of roles. But really, the main selling point of this game is not the graphics, the music, or the diversity of the roles. It's the interaction with other players. Every single game is different because it depends on each player's ability to successfully do their role, and convince others of the truth, or their lies. It's a game about deception, and the feeling you can get when you pull off a tricky deception is just amazing. Imagine the Town's surprise when you convince them you're just a poor doctor who wants to heal people – and actually turn out to be the Serial Killer. Poor things. Maybe there's not a lot of good to be said about a game that teaches you how to lie convincingly, but trust me. This is fun!\n\n\nA very important things players need to do is write their findings or information down in their last wills. That way, if they die, the information can be read by everyone else, and hopefully benefit whoever needs the information the most. (For example, an investigator may have found the Godfather, but isn't sure, so they write it down. And when they die, people can see they suspected someone of being a Godfather.)\n\n\nYou'll get people who leave if things don't go their way, or people who game throw, so quite a few times, a game will depend on the personalities of those you interact with. I've had some frustrating games where people ruin it for others, and awesome games where everyone is doing what they should be doing – and injecting a little fun into it, too.\n\n\nI honestly think everyone should try this game at some point. It's free as well since it's still browser based. I chose to buy the game here because I loved it, and wanted to support BlankMediaGames. You have absolutely nothing to lose from trying this game out. And if you play with friends, you may end up damaging friendships, but that's okay. They'll forgive you … in time.\n\n\nGo play!\n\n\nWant moar?

Placed in a town of 7-15 people, you must either try to kill everyone on the oposing 'groups' while lieing about your role, or try your hardest to get the rest of the town to belive you while trying to hang the killers of the town.\nWill you feel the joy of making it to the end unharmed? Will you feel satisfaction knowing that, despite your death, you were able to pull enough evidence to get the killer hanged? Or wil you just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the town fails to listen to your clues, and hangs you instead.\nBasically, its a fun game, but it can be a little frustrating when town members fail to work together. Its a simple concept, but it can be difficult to learn.

Quick matchmaking and large community fills up the wait queues very fast. Roles are handed in secret, play your role and help your team wins. The learning curve is very manageable as most of the roles are intuitive enough.\n\nValue is not very clear here as the concept is a rip off from SCII custom map and the dev decided to add a cash shop on top of the game not being free to play. You can earn the rewards through enough grind and the rewards are mostly cosmetic except for an item which lets you pick a role.\n\nAll in all I have a lot of fun in this game, and everything that ruins other communities like immaturity and trolling end up reinforcing this game's concept, making the trials hilarious and all in all people really do want to play their roles and win so the competitive edge can be very present, and when things go wrong then it is comedy gold even when the reasons are a little dubious. If you find this in a bundle I would say you owe it to yourself to try this. However if you own starcraft II already you might find this version of the game is slightly underpar in comparison to the free custom map. Its up to the dev to raise the bar for its steam release.","May 2","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As i've already stated in my previous review, i'm not the "review-everything-i-bought" kinda guy. I only write review on specific games that really caught my attention, it can be either too brilliant or too toxic. So here we go.\n\nFinding out this game on steam was like the best thing i had in quite a while (it was actually my friend V.n who first told me about this hidden gem). It is simply a genius board game inspired by the traditional "Werewolf Game by Miller".\nIf you never heard about that game, it is basically a complicated version of TTT mode on Gmod: "There is a killer amongst you whom you should find out ASAP before he/she kills everyone including yourself."\nIf you love to play with your brain, read people's mind, gain people's trust, twist the way people think toward you or others, and finally make a "life-or-death" decision, this is definitely the game for you.\nHowever, this game is not as simple as a "murderer vs innocent" game. They have 30+ different roles that you must adapt with if you want to survive (check them out here http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Roles).\nThere are countless amount of possibilities in this game (there's never been a similar round which means one round will go differently than the other) to make this game less-boring.\nThe only negative stuff about this game is the UI bug. Sometimes it is hard to invite your online friends into lobby just because they dont show up on the friend list. Despite, i really recommend this game!\n\n*Note: you don't have to buy the game on steam as there is a free version via web, but consider buying it to help supporting the devs and as a form of appreciation toward their work :)","May 21","true","52.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

You have between 7 and 15 players divided up among different factions in the town, such as arsonists, neutrals, mafia members, etc. You don't know who is who, but your role is to track down and take out the other villains before they kill you. You also have Serial Killers who sneak around at night and try to murder you. There are over 30 different roles making the game diverse and unique each time you play.

There is the Town, the Mafia, the Serial Killers, the Arsonists and the Neutrals. Within those are the mentioned 31 different roles.\nYou can start by playing a pretty good ammount of gamemodes when you start up the game. The ones you can play are Normal Classic, Custom Custom (pick from any 31 roles), Custom Rapid (faster times), Chaos All Any (Any role can be given), Chaos Rainbow (roles that make the rainbow), and Chaos Vigilantics (Vigilanties vs Witches). There is one more gamemode you can play call Normal Ranked however you need to play at least 50 games to start playing ranked.\nOnce you're in a game you have the option to make a last will, this is basically where you can store your information during the night and it stays. The will is essentail to the game because it could make the differance between a loss and a win. If/when you die your will, will be shown to the town. During the day time you can talk with the 7 to 15 players  (the dead cannot) and discuss what happened over night. At the end of the "discussion" time you have the option of voting someone, if you have no proof of them being what they are acused of then this is a random lynch and those are annoying af.\n\nControls:It's almost like a point and click game, although there is a chat for you to talk to people in the game as well as message friends. Honestly the chat is pretty important as you will be needing it for every game. There's really not much to the controls I guess.\n\nThe Community:Oh boy where to start with this one.... Hm ok, so some people are very nice and some are salty af. Most of the time you will find a nice lobby with pretty decent people. Other times you have trolls who don't care for the game or gamethrowers who just annoy everyone, there's also this other group called the afkers and they don't do anything all game (this mostly happens to people who dont get a good role). Recently the devs and other people who work on the game are working on something to help crack down on people like this. On a side note if you're new people are going to get mad at you because you didn't do something right. I suggest taking a look at this: Town of Salem Roles.[www.blankmediagames.com] There are also people who just love to random lynch and it honestly makes no sense to me.\n\nMy Personal Opinion:Let's start from the start. I started playing because I played one game on someones computer, and from then I was kinda hooked. Right after that match I went and bought it here on Steam. I was new and if you read my warning about new players you know how the first match went down. As I started playing more and more I learned the roles and what to do. You need to learn which roles are divided into the different groups so you can avoid lynches. I'm not calling myself good or anything of the sort, but I've aquired some skill.\nAbout the roles now. To start off here I shall go into possibably the best role to be; the Mafia. Why the mafia you ask? Well the Mafia acts as a team and if you're working together and play your cards right it's very hard for people to even notice whats happening and by the time they do you the Mafia have won the game. Serial Killer, Vampires, Werewolfs, Arsonists, and Witches are probably the next best thing to be. Werewolf and Vampires are sort of like the Mafia, but they don't have fancy roles, they just do the same thing. And if you're not one of those classes I am so sorry.\n\nOverall Thoughts:So what are my overall thoughts? I honestly love this game and I think it's worth it, one thing worth addressing is that yes this game is on the internet and is free, but if you buy the game on steam you get $5 worth of "Town Points" which is an ingame currancy used to spiffy up your character and such.\nMost of the time when you launch the game you will be given a pop up upon logging in with your steam account of your browser account. This just offers you bundles and things of the sort (If you sign in with Steam you can use Steam Wallet money for purchases).\nDepending on what time of day you play and other factors you can get a decent lobby with some nice people, or it could be the complete oppisite. I've found the community to be very likeable and funny, the people that manage the ToS Twitter account are also very interactive with the players who tweet at them for help and other things so don't be shy!\n\nIn the end I give this game an 8/10.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you pick up a copy of Town of Salem!","February 1","true","17.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

Most people I have introduced the game to have immediately gotten addicted to it. It is a simple clicking game; however, it does involve a lot of thinking. It is a who-did-it type of game. There are a variety of game modes. You can play as many different characters, good, bad and neutral. Also there are coins earned in game that you can use to buy new skins, pets, and other features to customize your game experience.\n\nI recommend playing it for free on the browser first, before you purchase it on steam so you are sure you don’t waste your money if you feel like you don’t like the game. The difference between the browser version and the steam version is that you can earn 220 achievements on steam. It also says that when you first purchase the steam version you get extra coins, although I’m not sure if that is still active or not.\n\nYou should definitely give this game a chance. Playing it with friends makes it even more fun.","June 16, 2015","true","174.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The devs need to do something about the immature and offensive names that players choose.  They keep CLAIMING that they take reports seriously, but I have seen no evidence of them doing anything about it.\n\n2. Something needs to be done about REPEAT quitters!  People who join a lobby and wait until the timer is at 2 seconds and then leave just to troll everyone else.  Not to mention in game quitters who leave before the game even goes to the first night because they don't like the role that they got.\n\n3. Town members who are killed that quit.... something needs to be done about that as well.  It screws over the medium's role.  What point is there in having a medium if everyone who dies leaves the game because they are sore losers?\n\nThis game is meant to be fun for everyone who plays it.  But lately I have had the fun sapped out of it because of the above problems.  The devs keep claiming that they are going to impliment features that punish people who quit and use offensive names... but nothing has been done yet.  I have been playing this game for several months now on both Steam and Facebook.  It's time for the developers to take care of the trash players in this game so that the REAL players can fully enjoy it!\n\nI won't recommend this game to a friend until the above problems are fixed.\n","June 2, 2015","false","8.3"," 35 of 69 people (51%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","51","35","69","6","3"

There was no way I would be paying for this?\nWhat do you get: The ability to play a half ♥♥♥♥♥ port in a window rather then for free in your browser, steam achievements and $5 ingame currency.\n\nWhy I cant recommend it?\n\nI dont know where this $100k went, I would think with this amount of money, they would work on the graphics, improve the animations and music for the steam version but what we get instead is a half ♥♥♥♥♥ port so you can play something in a window rather then in your browser. I would actually prefer to play in the browser than in steam but whatever I get achievements here. You cant logout to leave a game like in the browser (well refresh), you have to login every time even though i'm launching from steam along with other problems like that\n\nI would assume the kickstarter was a show of concept, "Hey were making this game, this is the concept we got in place, help us improve on this idea!", nope, we just get a few more roles (as milestones too). The original point of the kickstarter was to port it to steam/mobile and some locilization but I would assume with the huge amount of money raised, much higher than the original goal, we would get an improvement on the whole game.\n\nSo basically, I like the concept of the game, play it in your browser for free since ingame cosmetics makes you stick out more therefore look more suspicious/more likely to die.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerSchuldige/recommended/334230/","DerSchuldige","DerSchuldige","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerSchuldige/","110 products in account","Town of Salem is based on the games Mafia and Werewolf.\n\nThere are 15 players, 3 Alignments (Town, Mafia, Neutrals) and a sh*tload of roles that are give randomly to the players. The fun about it? Nobody knows anything, except these damn skypers... (no, just joking, never seen one personally ingame). Town players need to find other town while mafia and neutrals kills one by one of them.\n\nHere's a little warning:\nIt took me around 80 hours ingame to understand the WHOLE game (with ALL roles). Since you can only play the Classic mode (or fun modes) at the beginning 'til you've won 50 games. Then you can play ranked and all roles are available. To make it easy, play for yourself at first, don't play with a friend that knows the game and tries to explain it to you while you play. It's just confusing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGameplay?\n\nTown:\nIn short there are 4 parts of the town:\nTown Support: Supports the town by blocking other people or by transporting them. Aswell as revealing and mayor game tf out of you.\nTown Protect: Heals other players or defends them (and kills the attacker)\nTown Invest: Can investigate roles of other players or can see their "alignment"\nTown Killing: Obviously they revive... kill other players.\n\nTown wins when they killed all Neutral Evils / Killings and Mafias. They don't know each other and can only communicate at day time. Things such as Whispers, Last Wills and a democratic voting system make sure that everyone has a fair say in who dies and who is innocent. No one person (excluding the Mayor) has a bigger say than any other person.\n\nMafia:\nMafia Support: Can blackmail other players or block them\nMafia Deception: Can clean roles from other players or fake their wills.\nMafia Killing: ...\n\nNeutrals:\nThe neutrals are interesting, as they don't follow the normal structure.\nNeutral evil:\nThey are evil, in their role description, but the players often will help the town when they help them reach their goal.\nThe executioner, for example, needs to get one town player lynched.\n\nNeutral killing:\nThey fight all alone, except the neutral evil are really evil one time. There are currently 3 killing roles, the serial killer (1 kill every night), the werewolf (1 kill + all player that visit the target every 2nd night) and the arsonist (damn slow, first douse your targets, then 8 nights later, ignite).\n\nNeutral benign:\nEasy roles, just shout "SURVIVOR HERE" at the beginning and you are (maybe) safe and able to go afk without problems.\n\nNote that there are many more roles and i just talked about 1/4.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll in all, Town Of Salem is an extremely fun game based on lying and bluffing, with an awesome community that is crazy af.\nBut why should i buy it on steam when i can play it in my browser FOR FREE?\nThe steam client is (imo) better then the browser. Although the client is lagging a little bit lately. If you want to stream or record your sessions, the client is the better choice. And you get town points worth your 5€.\n\n10/10 would buy again.","October 8, 2015","true","371.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyways on with the actuall review, Town of Salem in steam is just as good as the browser version, but I am sure that the Steam version will be even better. At first I was quite sad and unsatisfied that the Steam actually cost real money, but when I bought it I didn't expect there to a reward for buying the game, which was 1500 Town of Salem funds, which costs the same as the game, so you basicly buy some funds and you get an improved version of Town of Salem.

Get hanged, beaten, stabbed, possessed, murdered, burned alive, maimed, executed, accidently killed, shot, and or commit suicide. Lots of customization options available to make your look unique to all other players from your home, to your character, to your exectution animation from drowning, hanging, or the cutting block and a bunch more.

The smell was so intoxicating that I decided to do it again the next night, and the next.  Then on the fourth night I was playing with a lighter thinking how wonderful it would be to see them all go up in flames... so I lit em up.  I knew the town would probably catch me, but I thought, hey the flames are worth it.  But that night there was an even bigger inferno than I expected.  It turned out half the town was burnt to cinders.  And they all left the same death note... which wasn't mine.  Somehow the townies caught on to the other arsonist and lynched him good, and then they thought 'good, we're safe now, we killed the bad guy'.  So I bided my time and doused some quiet ones until there were just four of us left.  I had doused 2 of them already, but I knew the mafia would know who I was the next day if I didn't kill them.  So I took the chance and lit them all up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xafron/recommended/334230/","Xafron","Xafron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xafron/","682 products in account","Town of Salem is a game of mystery and deception.\n\nYou are placed into a group of people, unsure of who is with you and who against you.  This is decided based on roles randomly given out to every player such as Doctor, Mayor, Serial Killer, Amnesiac, Framer and Mafioso (30 different roles total).  They are spread across 3 "teams" (Town, Mafia, and Neutral).  Neutrals are not really much of a team, but you get the idea.\n\nEvery night, each player goes back to their home.  Everyone does different things in the night (protect others, protect yourself, kill someone, blackmail, etc).  Also the mafia can communicate with each other in the night, and automatically know who the other mafia members are.  Anyways, in the morning, there will be corpses of various players.  It's the job of the players to either figure out who is bad and hang them, cast doubt off of yourself and onto someone else to get them hung, or just stay quiet and hope nobody thinks of you.  There's even one role where you want to try and get people to hang you.  There's a lot of interesting strategy to this game.\n\nThere's also some light customization options.  You can pay to have a cool looking house, character, pet, and so on.  It is purely cosmetic.\n\nReally fun game.  Definitely worth picking up at such a cheap price.  I'd suggest playing Chaos mode, as it's what I prefer.","March 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drafo/recommended/334230/","Drafo","Drafo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drafo/","86 products in account","I HIGHLY recommend buying this game on steam.\nI won't lie and say that the steam version is epically superior to the free browser-based version, because in all honesty, it isn't. Sure, it's ad-free, maybe a little faster, and you can see your friends playing it (assuming they have the steam version).\nBut you can get rid of ads with adblock and open up steam separately to see your friends.\nI also won't say that the 5 dollars worth of town points (the in-game currency) you get included with the steam version is a super-big deal either. You can get free town points just by playing the game.\nBut if anything, this is an even BIGGER reason to get the steam version. Blankmediagames is a very unique company in that they don't try and trick you into paying money for a so-called "freemium" game. Paying for town points does not give you any form of advantage over other players; they are used purely for aesthetics. And if looking cool in-game is that important to you, as I said before, you can get town points just by playing!\nThe real reason you should pay for the steam version is because by giving the creators money, you enable them to continue improving the game faster than they would have without that money. All those epic stretch goals they listed on kickstarter? Your 5 dollars will help make them a reality.\nSo yes, I am literally telling you to give them your money with no significant immediate reward.\n\nIf you're still unsure, I'd suggest playing the game for free a bit to make sure you like it. But don't hold me responsible if you get addicted (says the guy with 100+ hours logged on steam alone). Speaking of which, here are some helpful tips that might make getting into the game a little easier, as it can be rather confusing at first:\n1. The other players use LOTS of abbreviations. Here's a helpful list of what they all mean: http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary_of_Abbreviations\n2(a). There are many different "roles" in Town of Salem which are assigned to all the players randomly. It can be a bit rough at the beginning if you don't know what any of the roles do. Here's another helpful link to help you with that: http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Roles. It might seem overwhelming, but after you've played a bit, you'll start to get a feel for what the roles are.\n2(b). If you don't wanna waste time reading through the roles, play Classic Mode first. This will give you a general feel for the game and how it's played.\n3. Move on to Custom Mode. This can be a real pain, because regardless of the game, there will ALWAYS be trolls in a community. In Custom Mode the game randomly chooses a player to be "host", meaning he/she will choose the role list for the game. They don't actually choose who gets what role, but they still have a huge influence on the kind of game it will be. However, playing Custom Mode is important because it allows you to play roles that would seldom or never be found in Classic. It helps you get a handle on the various roles from first-hand experience, not just from reading their details off the wiki.  For example, from reading the wiki, you'd think that if someone got the role "Survivor", everyone would leave them alone, right? But I've seen many towns lynch survivors, either because they thought they were lying or simply because they were unaligned. I have seen the mafia kill survivors for similar reasons.\n4. Play the game. By now, you've probably gotten pretty used to the roles, rules, and community of Town of Salem. If you've played 50 games without quitting, you will have Ranked Mode unlocked, which as of now is basically just a setup most players consider balanced. In the future Blankmediagames will add rankings and stats as well. Still, most ranked players are more experienced than those in the other modes, and you won't have to worry about afk hosts.\n5. Read the first half of this review.\n\nTL/DR: PLAY THIS EPIC GAME AND BUY IT TO MAKE IT MORE EPICER!","March 19, 2015","true","482.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With alot of customizations and different unique roles bring a life to the game and it has a decent amount of players. I personally don't experience any lag in this game but I do get some bugs (EG : After a match, My friend wouldn't be able to invite me because it would say I was in a game but I wasn't) Some cons about this game is that theres no leave button, you would have to close the game itself to leave the game, and its a waste of time in my opinion.

Your role could be part of the town, like a doctor or a veteran, or part of something much more evil, like a serial killer or a mafia member. The game plays like a metaphorical game of cards. You could be the doctor, and be pressured by everyone else into revealing yourself; if you do, you could become a target for the bad guys, and if you don’t, the town could decide to lynch you.\n\nEach game consists of a day/night cycle. During the day cycle, the players discuss the night’s happening and share their suspicions or evidence an evil character. During the night, everyone’s ability is used. Some abilities kill other players, while others simply block another person’s ability or discover a player’s role.\n\nIf the majority of players agree that a player is evil, then they could vote to put him on trial. When the trail is in progress, the accused can plead a case: then, the town votes if they believe the player is guilty or innocent. If the player is found innocent, the town can vote to put another person on trail. If found guilty, the player will be hanged and the day will immediately end.\n","August 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can pay to have a cool looking house, character, pet, and so on.  It is purely cosmetic.\n\nReally fun game.  Definitely worth picking up at such a cheap price.  I'd suggest playing Chaos mode, as it's what I prefer.","March 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drafo/recommended/334230/","Drafo","Drafo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drafo/","86 products in account","I HIGHLY recommend buying this game on steam.\nI won't lie and say that the steam version is epically superior to the free browser-based version, because in all honesty, it isn't. Sure, it's ad-free, maybe a little faster, and you can see your friends playing it (assuming they have the steam version).\nBut you can get rid of ads with adblock and open up steam separately to see your friends.\nI also won't say that the 5 dollars worth of town points (the in-game currency) you get included with the steam version is a super-big deal either. You can get free town points just by playing the game.\nBut if anything, this is an even BIGGER reason to get the steam version. Blankmediagames is a very unique company in that they don't try and trick you into paying money for a so-called "freemium" game. Paying for town points does not give you any form of advantage over other players; they are used purely for aesthetics. And if looking cool in-game is that important to you, as I said before, you can get town points just by playing!\nThe real reason you should pay for the steam version is because by giving the creators money, you enable them to continue improving the game faster than they would have without that money. All those epic stretch goals they listed on kickstarter? Your 5 dollars will help make them a reality.\nSo yes, I am literally telling you to give them your money with no significant immediate reward.\n\nIf you're still unsure, I'd suggest playing the game for free a bit to make sure you like it. But don't hold me responsible if you get addicted (says the guy with 100+ hours logged on steam alone). Speaking of which, here are some helpful tips that might make getting into the game a little easier, as it can be rather confusing at first:\n1. The other players use LOTS of abbreviations. Here's a helpful list of what they all mean: http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary_of_Abbreviations\n2(a). There are many different "roles" in Town of Salem which are assigned to all the players randomly. It can be a bit rough at the beginning if you don't know what any of the roles do. Here's another helpful link to help you with that: http://town-of-salem.wikia.com/wiki/Roles. It might seem overwhelming, but after you've played a bit, you'll start to get a feel for what the roles are.\n2(b). If you don't wanna waste time reading through the roles, play Classic Mode first. This will give you a general feel for the game and how it's played.\n3. Move on to Custom Mode. This can be a real pain, because regardless of the game, there will ALWAYS be trolls in a community. In Custom Mode the game randomly chooses a player to be "host", meaning he/she will choose the role list for the game. They don't actually choose who gets what role, but they still have a huge influence on the kind of game it will be. However, playing Custom Mode is important because it allows you to play roles that would seldom or never be found in Classic. It helps you get a handle on the various roles from first-hand experience, not just from reading their details off the wiki.  For example, from reading the wiki, you'd think that if someone got the role "Survivor", everyone would leave them alone, right? But I've seen many towns lynch survivors, either because they thought they were lying or simply because they were unaligned. I have seen the mafia kill survivors for similar reasons.\n4. Play the game. By now, you've probably gotten pretty used to the roles, rules, and community of Town of Salem. If you've played 50 games without quitting, you will have Ranked Mode unlocked, which as of now is basically just a setup most players consider balanced. In the future Blankmediagames will add rankings and stats as well. Still, most ranked players are more experienced than those in the other modes, and you won't have to worry about afk hosts.\n5. Read the first half of this review.\n\nTL/DR: PLAY THIS EPIC GAME AND BUY IT TO MAKE IT MORE EPICER!","March 19, 2015","true","482.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Town of Salem is honestly hands down the best game around the genre of Mafia and Werewolf. With alot of customizations and different unique roles bring a life to the game and it has a decent amount of players. I personally don't experience any lag in this game but I do get some bugs (EG : After a match, My friend wouldn't be able to invite me because it would say I was in a game but I wasn't) Some cons about this game is that theres no leave button, you would have to close the game itself to leave the game, and its a waste of time in my opinion. But honestly its a game I would enjoy, and I'm pretty sure I can have alot of people agree with me on this. Overall 9/10.

Your role could be part of the town, like a doctor or a veteran, or part of something much more evil, like a serial killer or a mafia member. The game plays like a metaphorical game of cards. You could be the doctor, and be pressured by everyone else into revealing yourself; if you do, you could become a target for the bad guys, and if you don’t, the town could decide to lynch you.\n\nEach game consists of a day/night cycle. During the day cycle, the players discuss the night’s happening and share their suspicions or evidence an evil character. During the night, everyone’s ability is used. Some abilities kill other players, while others simply block another person’s ability or discover a player’s role.\n\nIf the majority of players agree that a player is evil, then they could vote to put him on trial. When the trail is in progress, the accused can plead a case: then, the town votes if they believe the player is guilty or innocent. If the player is found innocent, the town can vote to put another person on trail. If found guilty, the player will be hanged and the day will immediately end.\n","August 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
