When you can't beat the third mission on easy there's something wrong. I mean sure four guys vs a gazillion tanks and infantry with mounted guns everywhere shouldn't be possible IRL and I guess the game simulates this pretty well, but... it's a game and it's fun to play as it actually has an intersting, realistic campaign that shows the true colors of the Red Army in contrast to Company of Heroes 2.

On one hand it lacks a lot of the polish that the other games have, i lot of things are missing for example the main menu music or credits at the end of the story, the story itself seems even more like a collection of missions extremely loosely tied together. on the other hand the game does bring some new gameplay focused on the navy, you get to control large battleships, submarines, assault boats and small boats, this adds some variety and extra strategy options, also this time you control a smaller amount of soldiers in each mission and you often have to take whole towns all by yourself, and often fighting behind enemy lines adding to the games difficulty, it's definitely harder than the other games but not impossible, the single-player lasted 20 hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/3130/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Men of War: Red Tide is a strategy game developed by Digitalmindsoft and published by 1C Company. This game was released in November 2009 and is a sequel to Men of War. It is set in World War II and features a campaign that recounts history of the Soviet Union and its battles through a 20 mission campaign. I personally really enjoyed its predecessor Men of War, but this game is terrible. Furthermore, I wanted to like this game, but I quit after 90 minutes and on the second mission and uninstalled it after giving up. I want to shed some thoughts on why I think its bad because their are many individuals that enjoy this game. Therefore, this review will discuss the positives and negatives of this game.\n\nI am familiar with the gameplay and overall feel of the game due to playing Men of War, which is very similiar. You command your squad and you order them to attack in order for you to complete your objectives. This game is realistic  because for instance, tanks destroy infantry, infantry can kill in one shot, and infantry must use tactics to get close to the tank to destroy it. Furthermore, it promotes strategy through tactics and I commend this. There is the micromanagement of supplies aspect in this game, which I adore and was seen in Men of War. The idea coincides with realism as your soldiers need to steal medical supplies and ammo from dead soldiers inventories after using ammo or those supplies. These two positives are standard in the Men of War series, as I did play the later released Men of War: Assault Squad.\n\nThere are two negatives in this game that annoyed me and/or made me quit. The lighter negative is the voice acting. As this is set in the viewpoint of Russia, I was confused on why American voice actors were recounting battles in the loading screen prior to the battle and why there was mostly American voice actors having dialogue in battles. If this was not confusing enough, the voice acting was bland as it feels overly scripted and not natural. Moving on, the main negative is the AI, which is absolutely awful and made me quit. I am not the only one that has experienced bad AI as many negative reviews for this have reinforced that notion. For instance, your objective is to neutralise the artillery so you need a responsive squad to get around the artilley and machine gun nests. The AI instead runs in circles after I order them to move, wonder whether to be prone, crouched, or standing, and does not automatically shoot the enemy in front of them. These three issues within the AI absolutely make me cringe because the idea of a non-responsive AI and a realistic game where they can easily die, it makes for a terrible playing experience. I feel this game has gone backwards because Men of War featured solid AI that was responsive and tactical and this being the sequel has ruined the series for me.\n\nI did not want to downright bombard this game with negative comments because I enjoy the overall gameplay mechanics and atmosphere of the game, hence the positive comments that this game expands upon following the first game. But, the negatives of voice acting and mainly the AI have made me uninstall this game within 90 minutes unfortunately. This is a personal review so as mentioned before, not everyone will agree with this but coming from a strategy fan, its unfortunate I experienced this. I recommend avoiding this game.\n\nRatings:\nOverall: 2/10\n\nThanks for reading my review!

There are some subtle improvements over the original.  Large battles in particular are much easier... you are given a relatively small force to command, and the AI forces will advance as you do.  It is strictly a single player campaign, with some challenging maps, even on easy.  I love the game despite its difficulty.  When you are intimately familiar with the controls, and nimble with the view options, every engagement is a treat visially and tactically.  The only thing I would ask for is a replay option that records your battle and then allows you to observe the battle later or share with friends.  Hopefully that option will appear in the Vietnam version due later this year.","May 9, 2011","true","80.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is a bit buggy sometimes on missions and it is not uncommon to restart a mission sometimes when things just go completely wrong and you get yourself into a position where you just cant win the mission anymore.\n\nNo music during gameplay (who needs it) and on average missions are hard and require a more deeper analysis of the field in order to figure out how to advance and sometimes there just isn't any easy way forward - which in turn makes for a good atmosphere as we are playing as russian infantry here so one can expect things to get icky and sticky.  Them bodies just keep piling up it seems. And not just enemies this time.\n\nFirst couple of missions can be really tough even on Easy so be warned. Other than that it is very much like Faces of War and Men of War as far as game mechanics go. Game also likes to bring in new units outside the map and/or expand the game area once a objective has been reached.\n\nIf you are considering MoW series do not start the MoW series with this game. Red Tide is 'advanced class' material so be warned.\n\nedit: completed all missions. This game is indeed the best in the series.

Do I get an award yet?\n\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness. This game is a sort of "sibling" to Men of War, focusing more on the U.S.S.R (The Black Sea Fleet/Seamen respectively.) than the last game. And it's not some sort of quick-cash in that adds maybe 1 or 2 more missions. No no no, it adds many more. And they are (mostly) all hard as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even when I replay them. I still reccomend getting Men of War and Men of War: Red Tide over getting something like Company of Heroes 2. Which is basically reccomending two games that are five dollars each, over getting one game that is 40 dollars.And the reason I say this...?\n\nYou can't have a tiger blown up by rifle fire in this game.\n\nIn all seriousness though. GET THIS GAME AND Men of War. You will not regretti.

"Company of Heroes" borrowed heavily from this title, including some interface design and the "unit direct control" feature. Out of the entire franchise, this is the best one in my opinon. Get it first if you are unsure about which Men of War you want to try. Oh, and don't forget to read the encyclopedia and memoirs of veterans, otherwise you lose out on the atmosphere.\n\nThe game is perfect for an accomplished masochist in terms of difficulty, so use an old keyboard and preferably and old computer too (it's a good thing the engine is over ten years old), unless you want to destroy your main PC in a fit of rage. Save often, use grenades over direct fire and never trust your units unless you control them yourself.","September 12, 2012","true","98.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

Similar in scenery and thatrics to CoH, MoW has more of a serious tactical side akin to the Close Combat or Combat Mission series.

They constantly get stuck and don't go where you want them to go. The enemy has way too many tanks to just throw at you. I got too frustrated to even play by the SECOND LEVEL! The game is telling the user to go to the left and fight the enemy over there but the second you get there an armored truck with three AT guns (I think they are AT guns, please correct me if i'm wrong) plus a ♥♥♥♥-ton of enemys in trenches await to mow you down. This brings me to my next problem with the AI. When you send your troops into the trenchs when you've maraculously cleared them, they want to go to the STAIRS on either side of the trenches. I have tried to go to the right side, but by the time I clear it I don't have enough men to attack the left side... By the time they've gotten to the stairs, the armored truck has either run them over, or has mowed all of the guys down. I don't even want to play anymore at this point. I've spent three hours on this same mission (The second mission I mean. The first one was alright once you get the hang of how the game works.) and I STILL cannot seem to be anywhere close to beating it! If you figure out how to win it, please let me know!

This part wasn't very easy, and I enjoy a challenge. You only get 3 units of infantry to charge into howitzers and tanks and MG's. I lost, maybe 2 times. The next part, Jesus Christ it was impossible. You're supposed to take a village with 2 squads. The village is forified with MG's, tanks, and is being watched by a hill with an armoured car, with a 37mm gun. Taking the hill is hard enough. And the howitzers on the hill that may begin to barrage your men in he village, can't even hit near the village once you use them! Even if you get past this part, the next part brings in a wave of enemy tanks, and that is when I gave up. This game is simply unplayable unless you are an expert strategist.

What do my soldiers do?  They  stand up and run straight at it and try to throw anti-tank grenades at the MG.  Every member of the squad is killed within five seconds.  Your soldeirs also start the game with nearly no ammunition or first aid leaving you to constantly be on a savanger hunt for these things.  Always holding the V or tab key down looking for gear keeps you from being aware of whats happening on the battle field.

However it is single player only which I feel lets it down. The game is fantastic though and is a blast on single player.

Since my native language is russian I play it on russian. Voice acting was excellent. As well as the graphics, the soundtracks and the story. I was very pleased with the game.\n\nAs for MoW - RT:\n\nThe missions are defenitely challenging which is a huge pro. It's also nice to bring attention to the soviet marines. I live in Germany and... well, you generally hear about D-Day or the Pacific Theatre if it comes to amphibious operations or hard-to-get objectives.\n\nThe truth is, I'm also a bit disappointed. Voice acting wasn't that good, even in russian. There's no music in Red Tide. I didn't feel connected to the battle. Seriously, soundtracks add atmosphere, but this time there weren't no soundtracks at all. And due to this fact my final verdict is:\n\n6.5/10\n\nYou shouldn't spend more than 5 Euros on this game, though. This is quite the price it deserves. No doubt this game isn't as good as MoW. But I think Red Tide is overall okay.\n\n\nI have played Assault Squad or Assault Squad 2 for free sometime ago. I don't remember. But it liked it. Soundtrack and battles were nice. I'm intending to buy it.","October 25, 2015","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
