Just a great story about a boy that is Allison's best friend who has to save her in a parallel world and thwart the evil Ashton Thorne. The scenes are bright, beautiful and cover many locations. There is a variety of puzzles that keep oneself busy, none of them to difficult to figure out. There is a globe (map), which comes in handy for traveling between the different worlds. The hint recharges in a fair amount of time. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good all around game.","June 4","true","3.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
