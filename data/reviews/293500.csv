"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/293500/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","When I first saw this game released on Steam, my inner child squeaked of excitement: finally a MMO in which you can play as a teddy bear, how awesome is this!!! Five minutes after I started the game, the enthusiasm was replaced by a huge disappointment because I realized it's a game heavily based on micro transactions despite the fact that it is advertised as free to play on the store page. It is free to play indeed, but only until you reach level 10 (out of 50 currently possible); after that you need a monthly subscription to progress further. I decided to pay for 1 month, because I wanted to explore the whole content and maybe reach the end game.\n\nThe target audience being mostly children, this game was designed to be very accessible and enjoyable for kids. The story is very simplistic: you need to protect the world from Queen Vexa and her minions called Nix. There is no actual combat; “fighting” is done by running over the minions.\n\nThe graphics are cute and very colorful and the fact that there is no violence in this game turns the gameplay into a very optimistic and positive experience for a kid. But if you’re an adult, you’re probably going to feel out of place (don’t read: “pedophile”), both because of the simplistic nature of the game and because of the community.\n\nHalf of the gameplay consists in completing quests for the NPCs, which in turn award you with experience and some silver coins that you can spend in the game shop to buy decorative items for your personal home. Each quest is a mini game of different sorts: either a jigsaw puzzle, or driving a car and collecting items, or some very basic platforming bits and many others. There are some group activities as well, in which you need to collect things or run over the enemies. The quests are very repetitive and become boring very fast. There’s no difference in being level 50 or level 10, except for the fact that some of the items from the shop are locked for lower levels. So in my opinion, there’s no reason or motivation to pay for a subscription and level all way up to 50.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay consists in gathering numerous collectible items. And here’s the catch: you can obtain around 75% of them from the shop or from the group activities, but for the other 25% you need some special in-game currency (gold coins) that is purchased with real money only. Of course, each of these collections is linked to a Steam achievement, so if you want to go for 100% achievements, be prepared to throw big money at them. This was one of the things that set me back a lot, since I consider that a game that offers special items for real money should at least be free of charge (no subscription needed). Or if a subscription is required, then this special currency should also be obtainable through other means in game, without having to pay for it (unless you really want to do so). Even more so, I consider that the achievements for these collections, which can be completed only by spending $10-$20 on each, should be completely banned from Steam. Until recently there was no way to obtain these gold coins by only playing the game without a subscription; however, since they increased some of the prices a lot and added many new special items, they decided to add to the group events some occasional rewards consisting in very small amounts of this currency. For every group event you are now eligible to obtain 20-50 gold coins, which means that you need to participate in hundreds of these events, bordering to 1000 for a couple of achievements, and all this assuming that you get something every time you play. This is practically a sad and lame joke from Ganz’ part.\n\nBottom line: I don’t recommend this game since its sole purpose is to drain your wallet. And don’t show it to your little kids either, since they’ll probably start begging you to buy them silly things that cost a lot of money.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 22, 2015","false","77.2"," 210 of 232 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","210","232","18","10"

You create a character and do the tutorial BEFORE you create an account. That's right, BEFORE. AS IN NOT AFTER.

Kids would be introduced to the world of quest grinding which involves loooots of running around and occasionally play simple platform-type and other various minigames. There are a number of co-op/team play features and it involves..... more running around (yay). I'm not kidding. You will be spending 80% of the time running around to level up. Because violence is a no no ;D. The remaining 20% of the time would be either playing those minigames or customising your garden and home.\n\nI'm not recommending it because firstly, you need to pay a monthly fee to get past level 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HelloDahl/recommended/293500/","HelloDahl","Dahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HelloDahl/","2405 products in account","Just a heads up.\nThis game has a premium currency called e-Store points in trade for your real cash. Available in separate packages shown here: http://www.ganzestore.com/estore/catalog/points , or with a membership purchase you can gain set amounts per month. In 2015 Ganz also added the option to win small random amounts from Team Play (mini games) which will no doubt take a lot of real time but requires no extra cash.\n\nMoving on.\n\nIf you are downloading this for your child it is a cute starter MMO and they will likely enjoy the bright cheerful characters and colorful world with no questions asked. If you are a teen+ who enjoys cute games its a fun way to kill some time with casual games and quests but you might find it all becomes repetitive. And without paying for a membership it can feel pointless as you can't increase your level passed 10 out of 50 levels.\n\nAchievement Hunters Be Warned:\nIt feels like this game could be attached to your Steam Wallet as Ganz has started pushing the in-game collections (which double as steam achievements) to require premium currency. Or just invest a lot of time with the option to win at team play to gradually chip away at the collections that require premium currency to purchase.\n- April 2016 update -\nAt this time Ganz might have seen the light. The last collection to double as an achievement that I noticed was October of 2015 as my Comments below show. Just hope to see this continue so the buying/spending premium currency feels more optional as it should.\n\nI mostly wrote this review because even if it fell on deaf ears I felt gamers need to start speaking up against sucking our purses dry. Also not wanting to see this trend in Amazing World continue with more future collections requiring premium currency. Which I will note in the Comments of this review.\n\nDespite the negative reviews saying it was not free to play as advertised it was cute so I gave it a try. I had a positive review up until the Sushi update in May, 2015 which began a trend of releasing collections requiring e-Store (micro transaction) purchases to complete. Previously items were won in Team Play games, Karma's Wheel, and purchased with common coin purchases. A rare few were also Moneyz which were earned from opening pages on their website[www.ganzworld.com].\n\nAt some point in 2015 I feel greed hit with new staff and I should have realized something was up when extra spins on Karma's Wheel increased from 100 to 500 premium currency. Unfortunately I didn't until the new collection (and also achievement) "All You Can Eat" came up and requires 10,000 premium eStore Points to buy 3 sushi items in the World Shop. It has no place being a steam achievement without a second option in my opinion.\nI guess the option is the introduction of earning a very small amounts if you manage to win at Team Play. But just to put things in perspective. I won 45 eStore Points playing Groggy team play. So give or take if you were lucky enough to win every time and get that amount. I would have to play and win 223 times to finish that one new achievement. - But my next win was only 25...which would make it 400 wins to get the needed amount. - My third win I got zero eStore Points.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side.\n\nTheir Customer Service when using the Ganz web form has been outstanding.\nWhen I first found AW I paid for a year membership and that gives 5,000 eStore monthly. However, I had a glitch that it didn't automatically happen so I would have to contact them to get it, and the reply always pretty fast. - On Oct 15, 2015 CS said this was resolved.","May 14, 2015","false","375.1"," 83 of 97 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","83","97","3","4"

You dig holes and pick up fruit and leve up its genius Blizzard take notes plz.\n\nThe graphics are on point and the 5 second opening cutscene took my breath away. I was spooked by the plot of *removed for spoilers* Trust me Witcher 2's graphics look absolute garbo compared to this work of art.\n\nThe music has been made by artists such as Skrillex, Deadmau5 and some nursery rhymes by 2pac and Biggie Smalls. I did think i heard some DMX in the login screen but i dunno its pretty hype doe not gonna lie. DMX dlc plz\n\nOk now onto the meat of the review, the combat system. This where Blizzard should be taking the most notes. Remember when i chose the yellow bear as my class ? Yh i didnt realise how kush his abilities were he can summon dark masters from within the earth and call the undead to fight for him but i opted into just running into them and getting points in their World events. They much better than that crappy MMO Guild Wars 2 (only when you compare it to this 11/10 game)\n\nThe Ui is also a great aspect of the game not cluttered random skills and chat. Oh the chat is hard my mum didnt get the email so in couldnt use the chat soz guys.\n\nBut this game is the Best MOBA I have ever played 8/8 gr8 b8 m8.\n\nPS did i say you can buy afros in the game because dam.\n\nIf you wanna hear the soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-VW4fMD6Pc","August 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 56 of 80 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","56","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerom090/recommended/293500/","jerom090","jerom090 / Naka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerom090/","54 products in account","I would like to start this review with a little segment of text:\n\nHi there, fellow *CHATFILTERED*\nI've been playing this game for *CHATFILTERED* hours and it's pretty *CHATFILTERED*. But an annoying part was the *CHATFILTERED*.\n\nJokes aside, Amazing World™ is a MMO aimed towards children. You create your own so-called Zing and jump into a little town full of other players. I took a look into the game for a bit and here are my first impressions. Now, I'm going to split this review in some parts, closing off with a summary.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nYour aim is it to... well... This is the part where it gets a little tricky. After roughly one and a half hours of gameplay I couldn't really detect a real goal to achieve in this game.\nSo I set up some goals for myself:\n\n- Maxing out all skills (by completing quests for each "tree")\nSkills don't actually make a lot, they just display a number for your skill level, the more quests completed, the higher the number.\n\n- Meet random people\n\n- Reach a high level\n\n- Make your Zing look awesome\nVia a ingame shop you're able to buy accessoires and clothes for your Zing. Currencies being used are ingame credits earnable through questing, and other credits which are buyable with real money. Of course there are some items only accessible, when you pay for a free-to-play game but hey... Developers need to earn money for a living too, right?\n\n-Make your house look awesome\nJust as for your Zing, you're able to spend your credits for furniture, decoration or just flowers which you can place onto your property. Having a nice house and inviting people over, so they will tell you how nice your house and garden looks, is a great feel.\n\nUnfortunately, the quests were pretty repetitive and got boring quickly. This game needs more depth and motivation to level up, not just having a high number displayed after the textbox labelled with "Level".\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nI was able to move around my Zing pretty smooth with less to no lag. Maybe it would've been nice to switch to an other control mode, where 'A' and 'D' would let my Zing WALK left and right instead of turning around but I know as a former game developer how much effort it can take to implement further controls, so it didn't affect me as a player that much. Note that this is only a preference. Else everything felt good; No overfilling with boxes, everything well arranged and I never lost overall view of my friends/quests/stats/... Good job on this part overall.\n\nVISUALS AND AUDIO:\n\nThe art style was suiting the scenery almost perfectly. The Zings are cute and lovely, the voice acting had no flaws at all! Textures were fine. Could have gotten a bit of a higher resolution. No inaproppriate content, everything colorful and nice.\nThe sound effects for ingame objects and interactions (waterfall, dances, emotes) were nice to hear but I felt like something was missing... Suddenly my phone rang and then I knew it - Music! I could barely hear any music in the game. Maybe in the intro and menu and I think that adding background music would help developing a good atmosphere A LOT. Overall good graphics and good audio. But not more.\n\nINTERACTION AND COMMUNITY:\n\nEvery single person I met was nice to me, so was I. Public chat system is a standard in MMOs. So are private messages but wait... So I just met a nice guy, sent a friend request and I can't private message him, after he went into another area? That was very *CHATFILTERED* to me... And heres the next problem; The chatfilter system is basically trash. 60% of my messages got chatfiltered (=getting replaced by three dots). I know having a safe environment for children is important and swearing should be prevented. There were many harmless words I wanted to say but guess what. They got chatfiltered. The game wouldn't let me say 'kawaii', 'mate', 'awesome', numbers, certain smileys (^-^), numbers and hell, even the word 'chatfilter' itself got chatfiltered. I really hope that the developer team reconsiders the current chat system, because I think that the ability to interact with other people the least restricted way is important for a MMO. Also, I think that this is Amazing World™ strong point: Open yourself up to other people and making your first internet-friends as a kid. I get very nostalgic thinking about the past where I started to chat with people on the internet. So please don't ruin the player experience with such a poor chatfiltering system. Because this was the part I would've enjoyed the most. I've met two very interesting people but could barely communicate with them and could not contact them again later on, because i don't pay a monthly fee and/or messages got chatfiltered, which is pretty sad in my opinion. Please enable private for non-paying players and rework the chatfiltering system. Aside these points, servers were running smooth, no feeling of lag at all and a stable gameplay.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAmazing World™ can be enjoyable if you plan to spend some time in a beautiful designed world filled with cute characters und colorful views. Don't expect too much depth because there isn't any. Rather plan on chatting with a few people and making a few friends. You can also decorate your house and make your Zing look cool, just to stand in the middle of a crowded fountain and brag about your style. Yes, I recommend this game to children as their first 3D MMO. There may be some restrictions here and there but nothing what you wouldn't expect from a free-to-play title. So go create your Zing, enter the little town and hope for the developers to rework the chat system!\n\n-jerom090 / Naka\nInGameName:         Naka TrueRoliFill (should allude to 'true loli filler', if you know what I mean)\n\nThank you for reading my first review!","August 12, 2014","true","1.3"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","29","40","0","0"

It's a bit like Club Penguin, in CP you pay to get upgrades and items to wear and different coloured pets and stuff like that. Personally don't see too much of a problem as long as children aren't stealing credit cards to pay, but in CP, you can play for however long as you like for free with the only limitations being you can't wear certain items/obtain them. Plus both Amazing World and Club Penguin are aimed at children. After Level 10 of Amazing World, you can't earn xp or do much because most of the quests require Level 13 or above. You CANNOT level up without PAYING A SUBSCRIPTION TO BE A MEMBER. That is NOT F2P.\n\nThe missions are just the same things over and over, run to speak to this person, pick up things in that corner of the game, a small platformer type of game then TP back to the quest-giver. It's just that over and over, there's no creativity in the missions.\n\nThe description does not mention that it is capped at level 10. It's a misleading pile of bull. It shouldn't be on Steam and deserves to stay on it's own website. I would not recommend parents get this for their children, I wouldn't recommend a child getting it for their parents, I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE... or $30 for 12 months access to level up, wear clothing and do quests if you really want to repeat gameplay and missions.","August 10, 2014","false","1.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","1"

There are certainly some items that cost real money to unlock but that's understandable for a game that needs to sustain itself.\n\nThen you find out that private chat requires a membership. Okay, that's not TOO bad cause you can just talk in public with your friends right?\n\nThen, you realise some skills are locked, so you cannot do all the quests that paid members can. Still, that's entirely understandable. So, you miss out on certain content but you get to enjoy a majority of it right?\n\nWrong. Once you get to level 10, you are effectively done with the game as a free player. You will not be able to gain any more exp unless you SUBSCRIBE as a member. It's not even a "pay to unlock more levels". It's "keep paying monthly to get more levels". You might think that you can just do quests and ignore the levels but as most items require you to be level 11 or higher, you're stuck with the few items that are below level 10.\n\nThis game had so much promise, and the game actually could attract a very wide audience (even adult youtubers have started to play the game), yet the way the game has been monetized has ruined any chances of it of being popular with anyone other than kids with rich parents.\n\nDon't bother with the game unless you're going to subscribe.

Its created by Ganez the company who produced Tail Town Friends on Facebook and deleted it because it wasn't making enough money...\n\nThe game promises to be an open safe haven game for children to play. It's definitely designed for children as the level of difficulty is simply to walk into most things. The abundant amount of colors in this world is like someone threw a grenade in a paint factory. Everything is awesome. Everyone loves everyone. All characters are so cute you want to take them home. You start to notice simple things like that the birds are singing, the hills are green, the flowers are vibrant and that your in love with all these gerbils. Just when all things are peachy. The dark clouds of 'WE WANT MONEY' start rolling in at level 10. Seriously you have to cough up $30.00 a year at least if you want to continue past that point to play the main game play.\n\nI'm not sure how many of the side quests you can still do without the coughing up of real money, but the announcement sure does serve as an eyesore, like as if someone just grabbed your head and held it over a steaming hot plate and said 'pay up!'.\n\nThe story is that you have to save the world from Queen Nix who rules a bunch of cute grey colored critters that brandish sledgehammers and start smacking away at the world causing zero damage. They are easily defeated by simply walking into them. Some how doing household chores like gardening will eventually train your super powers of walking into things and eventually save the world...???\n\nThe side scrolling platform games look great and really had me interested because of it's unique look. The 3D open world is also huge and interesting to explore, the game does give you your own decoration grid and a massive catalog of decor items. However there is not enough in the game for me to warrant $30.00 a year.\n\nIs it really a safe haven? I found it to be very easy to add people in there and start chatting away and since it is designed for children, you would expect predators in there would you not? It does seem to be monitored though. One person reported that he got banned simply because he jokingly typed 'come touch my meat'. All jokes aside i think the adults sometimes forget there are children here, so the banning side of things is welcoming.\n\nSimply put, there isn't enough of the game and it's not involving enough to inspire me to make any long term investment and there is no once off payment to make either. One would question how popular this really is as a baby sitter since we have so many cute games to entertain children thanks to Nintendo. While this might not be PC, there are such things as\nemulators to incorporate those games to PC.\n\nOne more thing I forgot, many found that at certain points the loading of the various worlds would crash and send you back to Steam. The only way I found around this was to play the browser game direct and get past the load point and then return back to Steam so Steam Cloud could catch up to where you exactly are in the game.\n\n\nMy suggestion is, if your really looking for a game to entertain your children. Try board games, they don't require $30.00 a year...","May 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","1"

It offers a rich and original story, and innovative gameplay.\nWhen you first launch it, it may seem intimidating, but as you delve deeper, it becomes a lot easier to understand. This game does not hold your hand the whole time in that it offers no tutorial, so the learning curve is a bit high for someone who doesn't play many action games such as this, but it's worth it once you learn how to play. The controls are fairly simple, too.\nIt also offers a fully fleshed out combat system. It'll be amazing when the game eventually gets VR capabilities.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game, hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay. It's definitely worth it to pay the monthly fee of $3.99 to get the full experience of the game.","April 11","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","8","9","5","0"

This is not to say you cant do anything after this point you can repeat pretty much the same quests over and over again and your kid probley wont know the difference. i played this game for about 2 hours before i got bored of it. you basicly go around walking over things to complete quests and you can unlock items for your house or special hats and if you get high enough level in a skill you can buy maybe 1-3 special items from that skill shop like a full on space suit. ill recommend it because little kids wont notice these things and just walk around like wooo i am playing a game as a cow or something. i am still waiting on the pvp expansion where i can use my koala space drone to 1v1 some other animals. if they get rid of the level cap on membership and give you full access to the game it would be fun and i would recommend it more. 6/10\npoints lost for level cap and repeatitive quests and music. bonus points for multiplayer world quests and some decent gameplay.","August 6, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I would rather play this game than furiously masturbate, though I often do both at the same time, since this game only really requires one hand.\n\nThe colours will make any man want to choke his chicken and instantly made me go through a second puberty; it was like a heavenly light shone on me and started fist♥♥♥♥ing me, chanting tribal songs as they made a sacrifice to Allah. Delightful.\n\nThe game appeals to my love of beating animals with my fists while butt-♥♥♥ naked. Being able to do so while beating myself is just pure bliss. The PvP is so intense that it makes me as sweaty as a grandma that slept in a sleeping bag, covered in latex in a purely isolated room with five heaters inside with no windows or doors in the middle of August. That's how intense it is.\n\nThat being said, the game can also make you rage due to the player not being so good at the game. I sometimes cannot quickscope fast enough, as I am not an xX3lite_420blzit_360noscope_proXx. This makes me rage with the fury of a thousand suns and the hellish maelstrom of pure mental assrape.\n\nAll in all, though, I feel that the game is terrific, though it needs to be balanced. Being the Cow is OP, as it is much easier to quickscope somebody from across the map with much better killstreaks than the other classes. But seriously, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, it made me into the man I am today, no longer a shriveling ♥♥♥♥♥, too afraid to play such spooky and intense games.\n\nOh, and I couldn't get past the tutorial.\n\n...I came.\n\n11/10","August 19, 2014","true","0.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","8","10","8","3"

I saw it for free on the steam list and decided hey, might as well check it out, it could be a fun learning experience. But I was so wrong. Immediatly my character is attacked while on the magical flying pirate ship by some kind of furrie terrorists. And the ship crashed. It triggered me because I do not like 9/11 because I am a proud american.  My character did a life endangering stunt by jumping off the ship with a hang glider, wish was obviously designed for 1 person with 2 people! Kids could learn to jump off their roofs from that which in my books is not ok not one bit at all, nope. THIS IS NOT EVEN THE WORST PART YET!!!! I have already invested time creating a character, registering my username and surviving this sexist cutscene degrading women by having the female main character appear weak which really offended me. So I am finally at the town and I see another player. I decide this is my chance to make friends and possibly learn the ropes like how to customize my new home. I say , "hello my name is tyrone" in the chat it comes up at "..." I did not understand because the game did not tell me why. I typed it several more times then the game informed me I was saying something offensive. Then I figured it out. THIS GAME IS RACIST. The game would not let me say the name tyrone because the developers are all cis scum who are against feminism and probably are all white suppremist hitler worshipers. I became so triggered I almost had a panic attack. I took several deep breaths just like I learned on Tumblr then decided to inform anyone thinking of playing this not to. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!\noverall 3/10 would not recommend :/\n","July 17, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","69","9","13","10","0"

So we did and after that it gave me a couple hours of fun. But that's all. Think of amazing world as webkinz and runescape had a baby. You have certain skills such as cooking and gardening, woodcrafting, and then the odd ones, icecream, singing and so forth. It is HEAVELY based on pay to win.

The games are educational some are just for fun but all are very enjoyable. The quests help the player gain items for your home base or Items you could wear. How you decorate or dress up is all up to the creative mind of the player. You could invite your friends to come play at your home. There is fishing (I believe the developers did a wonderful job capturing the excitement of actually catching something) loads of in game events happening all the time. Completion of these events award you based on how you did. Those that participated will always walk away with something. I even found a mini dungeon or raid (if you will) where you team up with other players to accomplish a goal very fun!! This game is guaranteed to put smiles on anyone face all the characters are so adorable. If you’re looking for a game for a young one starting to learn their way around a computer even an experienced player I would recommend this game. I would also recommend this game for anyone who is having a bad day like I said before it’s guaranteed to make you smile and if does not, you need to look for your inner child.

First off it is NOT free-to-play, it is a TRIAL game you get to play with heavy limitations (eg max level 10), and full "Members" access is SUBSCRIPTION based which it clearly does not display at all on the store page. There are also big billboards ingame advertising and trying to lure users to be full members, etc.\n\nI will very much make sure to warn all my friends and their familes to avoid this game at all costs. It is a real shame as if it wasn't for those problems this would have been a real nice fun game for younger players. Hopefully the developers will change these "features" and if so then I will totally recommend this game.

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

I myself played Amazing World a little bit, and I can have to say, it doesn't get anymore children's based than this. I want to be clear though this is for "young" children so The Ideal age range in my opinion is 3-6 years old, after all we know kids 7+ would all rather play the latest Call of Duty or something. I honestly doubt there are many children playing, I would guess that most of the players could indeed be older than the intended age range, especially since the game has come to Steam. Even with this fact I still think Amazing World is a decent children's game, and a good try for a children's mmo.\n\nThe game is free (mostly) but you will find a lot of features locked, only available to  subscription, or paying accounts, You can give Amazing World a try yourself, if you are wary about letting your child play an online game as it is free to download and play right here on Steam.","August 19, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you sign-up it doesn't ask for your email, it asks for your parents email. Everything, including the bad guys are super cutesy. Overall the game seems great for kids, graphics are cute, game play seems simple and easy to get used to. One big problem I noticed when I got into a public space is a lot of people are spamming "..." which must be swearing and people saying stuff like "Santa isn't real", but i'm sure this will smooth out a bit after this game has been out a while. Okay another big issue is the pay wall. You can get a few levels but then you get stuck until you sign up for a membership. The prices for that aren't bad but the game is just stopped if you don't start paying. Overall it's worth letting your kids try it, or try it yourself and take some cute screenshots. 7/10","August 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is not ideal seeing as this is a game that is clearly targeted to children.\nNot rated by the ESRB. Although it is not a requirement for games to be rated it is very helpful and useful so that an adult does not need to first sit down and play through the game to know what content is in the game. Not all that important but it is very helpful and convient to have the rating with some type of information to quickly decide if appropriate for a child or if the adult should sit down and play it first.\nFree to play is very limited. Free to play lasts only until level 10. Which took about 1 hour 10 minutes for me to get to but it could be longer for a child.\nTerms of service was not in the client window and is not required to be clicked to continue registration.\n\nPros: When creating a characther name it does have a very good filter one that is a bit on the strong side the filter would not allow the name it randomly generated due to the word Shell.\nThis game is adorably cute. So it is  good for children with mininamal violence. At most atleast until level 10 you just run into the the little Nix.\nIt does have 2 types of access one via the steam client and one via the adventure world website itself. The website version is browser based and requires the Unity plugin.\nFor an MMORPG membership is fairly cheap. A 12 month membership is 30.00 USD as of August 7th 2014.\nIf you do click on the terms of services they do give you a link to COPPA which explains what it is and provides other useful information on it.\n\nUltimately for a young child's game it is a decent to very good game. The limited free to play of the game allows you to let your child test it before you purchase anything in the game with real world cash. I would recommend this product only if you are looking for a game to introduce a child to the world of MMORPGs","August 7, 2014","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/recommended/293500/","melwing","Melwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/","311 products in account","Note: I am writing this review from the viewpoint of a parent who is also well-versed in MMOs and f2p systems. I would like to point out that people on Steam are being complete brats about this game- trolling the reviews. forums, and in-game. I would probably recommend not enabling chat if you are a parent letting their kid play this.\n\nThe good:\n\nAmazing World is an MMO designed for children, but has just enough personality to be entertaining to the parents of those children, too (not in a 'main MMO' way, but that shouldn't be expected).  I could also see this being a wonderful thing for anyone with a mental disability (being serious, not making joke), as it really is very easy to grasp what's going on (and even if you don't, I could see just running around looking at the scenery being enjoyable). There are a variety of activities, like quests, "run around and find all the bunnies", minigames, races, fishing, etc.\n\nIt is vibrant, well designed, colorful, has great music, sound, and voice acting. The controls are responsive and simple (though you can't change the control setup- see 'the bad' below). It seems like a fairly safe environment for kids (naming restrictions, "pick 3 words from these lists to make your name"), though I of course would still want to supervise kids playing any MMO.\n\n______________\n\nThe bad:\n\n* The lack of a menu option to re-assign hotkeys is a shame- I know this leaves lefties (and anyone picky about controls) out    of luck.\n\n* For some reason, the game is extremely picky about resolution- it will only work at 1280x720 or above. Not a huge deal, but still, could be a slight hassle.\n\n* The "free to play" aspect. You cannot progress past level 10 with one "Zing" (character/avatar) as a free account. There are still public activities, games, and a few other things you can do once you hit that wall, but progression is impossible without subscribing. The good news here is, subscribing is extremely cheap- only $4 (USA) per month, when you pay one month at a time (there are 6 and 12 month options available, as well). Also, if this is just a child spending a bit of time playing an MMO, the level 10 restriction may not matter, anyway- the repeatable activities are a lot more content than I had on a Tiger handheld game when I was a kid- and I sure kept playing the heck out of those.","August 10, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumpinho/recommended/293500/","bumpinho","S e k i 1 3 ' わたしは","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumpinho/","353 products in account","When you compare this game to other child games on consoles (mostly on the old Wii but also on the old DS), these games are badly made and mostly unplayable. Amazing World offers you a huge map to discover with different tasks to accomplish and items to unlock, it's amazingly fun to play.\nI'm 23 years old and I am not ashamed to say that I actually enjoyed this game, like most of you though since you're all frustrated you need to pay to play after level 10.\n\nAnyway, the game is new, so with some imperfections.\nFirst of all, the quests between the different NPCs are the same, only the design changes and it can be a hard work after a time. Educational tasks can be nice for kids to learn while having fun.\nAlso, kids need more support, unless they play the game with a parent, they won't know what to do because in the end, you just have to talk to random NPCs to start a task. A Random event of an NPC, like events for the Teamplays, can be useful for them to play by themselves I think. This way, it would be easier for them to unlock the Icebox Blast or the Talia's Tower for example.\nSecondly, many glitches can be found, in the main map and in the Home Zone. In your home you can duplicate your items if you use them a wrong way.\n\nDespite that, the devs have made an excellent work to build this game up.\nAlso, if you have any problem with the game, they have an incredible helpful support that will help you the best they can. Something I've never seen in any other game yet.\nThis game is the start of great ideas for kids to enjoy MMOs, with friends or alone. These kind of games are known to be addictive, this one is nearly it. I hope this game will have improvements and adds to make it even more fun.","August 17, 2014","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a very terrifying game however, as the main enemies are little blue and purple aliens. They also incorporated the elements of games like Spooper Wario bruhs, and with the difficulty curve that reminds me of Dark souls. The games MMO incorporation made it really come alive however, the people running around in realtime, and making the game much more hectic.

After he beat me with his legendary weapons and stole all my loot I could see why.\n\nThis game is massively pay to win and if you don't want to hand over money cash I urge you to stay away from this game especially from pvp arenas. Other than that the graphics are good as is the music however the weapon system could use a little work.\n\n7/10 would play again.\nIf you like my reviews add me on facebook www.facebook.com/jack.christoffels?ref=ts&fref=ts\n","September 9, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has next gen graphics so you will need an ultra gaming computer. i was having fun until i reached level 10 and wabam they told me to pay money so i can level up but i was all like no. me and the game used to be best friends up to that point i made my bear look like an old man.

Neopets? Or any other game that involves cute animals, collecting stuff, and customizing your own things? Then you should give Amazing World a try! It's F2P but the downside is that you can only get 10XP, and you'll need more than that to unlock most of the characters' stories, items, and mini games. Here's a little tip: Just subscribe for one month (which is  only $3.99) and max out your XP in that given time then unsubscribe.

One day I was browsing the steam store and I found Amazing world, at first I thought the game was a waste of time but then I came to find that Amazing world is Amazing. Overtime I came to love this game, I played and played to my hearts content until one day I realized that this game has taken over my life. I played so much that I completely ignored my family, my wife left and took the children with her, I spent on my money on a rainbow afro. I was broke, I had nothimg to live for until I realised Amazing world is life and it is love. It was Gabens wish for me to play such a game as this, it was the prophesy. I am Gabens Jesus and this was what I was born to do, and that being the coolest guy on Amazing world.\nWorth it\n10/10","October 11, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Overall It's pleasing to the eye and fun to get into but like many other games in this genre after you level up to a point it's basically pay to play. You cannot level up after you hit level 10 and to level up you must buy a subscription.\n\nDespite this, for the demographic it's focusing on (the main demographic would most likely be 6-11 years old which is fitting when the gameplay, visuals and layout are considered) it's a nicely rounded off game. The gameplay is okay (the controls are a little wonky and take a bit to get used to), the story is a typical narrative for a younger audience and the audio and visuals are quite nice. It's a perfect time waster with friends.","April 5, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

As soon as I started the game I knew it was going to be worth my while. I was blown away by the sheer amount of choices you were granted when choosing a character, which was an overwhelming total of 3. I chose the brown cow as my character and I was blessed with the family name of "Babyaniltongue" of which I hold great respect for. Upon arrival to Spring Bay, I almost broke into tears. I was completely and utterly flabbergasted by the amazing visuals this game possesses. The greenery looked as if I had stepped into a beautiful meadow, and the water looked so realistically ravishing that it made me feel parched and that the only way to quench my thirst was to drink of the holy waters of the game. I dare say this may be the best-looking game on Steam.\n\nAfter being delighted by the stimulative graphics, I was happy to see that the gameplay was just as gratifying. Not only do you have wasd as a choice of movement but the arrow keys as well, which is very useful for both right-handers and left-handers. There is no need for your mouse when navigating for you move only with the directional keys. The gameplay is very nonlinear and has much freedom. I was satisfied. This is indeed an MMO and you can play with others, as for chatting with them, only the parental-permitted players may do so.\n\nThis is a high-grade, hardcore, horror/romantic/kawaii, video-game that is a must-buy.

In the next 10 minutes I found an old keyboard and defeated the Nix that were attacking the ship by "scaring" them... By that time I was so bored I thought about death.. I attempted to take my own zing's life my jumping off the edge of the ship but there was an invisible barrier preventing me from doing so.. when I finally got to a point where I was able to mingle with random people I found it insulting that all of these 1st graders were telling me that I needed to put some clothes on, One of them even went to the extent of getting his/her parents on the keyboard -_- they proceded to tell me that I was setting a bad example for their child and that I needed to get a life.\n\nI recomend this game to anyone that enjoys raging at video games and enjoys arguing with little kids over chat!\n10/10yoloswagmuffins","August 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

Oh boy, where do I start? The character customization is out of this world, it has a variety of costumes available for your character. My character was a nudist bear who was inspired by the famous leader, Mao Zedong. The graphics out-class all other games I have played, my PC even froze for 28 hours whilst it was trying to render all the shaders. The voice acting and lip syncing is great, with a wide variety of characters including an autistic Koala.\n\nPROS\nNext Gen Graphics.\nGameplay elite to all other MMOs.\nEven my Nan can play it.\nCONS\nGave me severe autism.\nAddicting.\nGraphics are too good.","October 18, 2014","true","0.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

I found myself on an airship when it was attacked by those evil creatures called the "Nix". An also naked pink bear called Bloom told me to stomp every single one of them. Once I killed them, the airship was shot. It started burning and after nearly getting my head smashed in by a mast, Bloom and I managed to escape with a paraglider.\n\nSo we landed near to a house in a forest. After saving a few flowers from the Nix, Bloom told me to follow her because she wanted to show me something. So I followed her into the bushes and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what that naked pink bear wanted to show me.\n\nThere was a huge garden with pink and purple flowers. I thought I was on an acid trip or something. However, there was an invisible wall that would disappear after having completed the quest which didn't work because of a bug.\n\nI couldn't even finish the tutorial but I would totally play it again.","August 10, 2014","true","0.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

As soon as I heard that World of Warcraft was coming into fruition, I knew that I had to check it out. It blew my mind, I was having so much fun and made many new friends in that game. Over time the game got easier and easier and was trying to appeal to the casual audience. Many of my friends left the game and it seemed like we could never find another game to fill the void in our hearts. We tried all of the MMOs we could find, but to no avail.\n\nThen, like magic, Amazing World appeared on steam. All of my friends flocked to this game like the lost sheep that we were. This game was hardcore to the most extreme. It chopped out the endless fluff that held other MMOs back, like a combat system, abilities, and group content. We obsessed over this game. We became the first guild to beat the 20 part simon says raid boss. Now we are the top tier MLG raid guild for amazing world and I could not be happier.\n\nIn short, Amazing World is one of the most hardcore games on the steam store today. I Give the game a resounding 11/10 for exceeding even my most extreme expectations. Play today. It will change your life.","December 19, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The whole opening sequence made me feel as if I could do just about anything. The controls are superb, the action is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing. On the subject of voice acting, the opening sequence between the characters played by Zooey Deschanel (New Girl) and Kate Mulgrew (Voyager) literally blew my mind.\n\nYou start off on a flying air ship, (CRAZY ALREADY I KNOW) everything is cool, and you're getting a tour to familiarize yourself with the controls right? WRONG, you don't have time to familiarize yourself because the ship is invaded by weird creatures trying to tear it apart! (I PANIC) You're literally running around flailing your arms with no idea what to do! Trying to escape with the character played by Zooey Deschanel and she's terrified which means you can be the hero! Dodging dangerous falling timber, the crows nest almost crushes you, escaping just before one of the creatures ends up biting through the only thing keeping the ship afloat in the air!...... You and Zooey end up pushing a glider off of the ship!!! Holding on for dear life as you plummet down while the ship barrels through the air and into the murky black sea below!\n\nIt's like Mass Effect (Excluding 3), Dragons Age, Elder Scrolls Oblivion, and My Little Pony were all caught sleeping together and when the baby finally came it was AMAZING WORLD.\n\nI am at a loss for words to describe exactly how I felt during the opening sequence of the game. Try it, it is less than a GIGABYTE (WHAT!?!?!? I KNOW!). I gaurantee whether you are a hardcore grinder, full on role play dude, just for the loot, or a weird dude who likes to play as a chick and fool other dudes into thinking that they are talking to a chick and then sends said person pictures of some chick they know on facebook only to tell them a year later after they fell in love with you that you're really not a chick but actually a dude and you have been messing with me the whole time and breaking my heart... this is the game you have been waiting for.\n\nIf the opening sequence I described is not enough for you the game really picks up the pace (AS IF THAT WAS EVEN POSSIBLE!!!) once you land your glider, possible only after fighting through a fierce blizzard, while Zooey screams all the way down!","August 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

But either way, you gotta check this ♥♥♥♥, SORRY! No swears. If you say a bad word, they will lock you from the chat, and inform you parents email! So you can't do that. I found out the hard way, after playing for 10 min, I typed the "F" word, and, poof! Muted. You start the game on an airship, where you don't do anything, then out of nowhere THE EVIL PEOPLE APPEARS! You have to fight them by using the family figthing strat, passed down from generations... Walking into them. You walk up to them, and you hear their scream as they burn into ashes. At some point they destroy the ship, so you and your loving companion, fly away. You get a quick tutorial, by walking into flowers and enimies. Then you go to the main world. this is where the "MMO" thing starts. You get so spin a wheel a few times, then you have to pay real money, my Mom says I can do that if I do all my homework.\nYou can be in challenges, like, jump and catch the chickens, catch the fish, and other stuff like that, and you can unlock new hats.

It's cute, and it can be used to entertain kids while babysitting or something, which is always useful. However, if you don't have the extra money to spend on a membership for this game, then I suppose it's not really worth playing. There are also some issues with achievements bugging out and that's annoying, because I'm an achivement hound and I thought this game would be a cute waste of time that I could get achievements for, but I've already had two achievements not unlock for me.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's an okay game, and it's cute, but with it becoming p2p after only about an hour of gameplay and the achievements bugging out, I can't really recommned it.","October 6, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Blizzard does CE versions very well, and this is no exception. Sure it is a few extra bucks, but for that you get a great looking box, a nice art book, a mouse pad, a DVD, a soundtrack CD, and an in game mount and pet.\nThe new Pandaren race and Monk class are both really nice additions to the game. I love the whole panda thing, and have since they were introduced way back in Warcraft as an April fools joke.\nThe Monk class is cool as well since it offers another hybrid class that can tank (my favorite spec). Better yet the tank spec is completely different than any other tank spec, making it a whole lot of fun to play.\nThe overall look and feel of the game, as well as the music, voice, and storytelling aspects. There are so many more cut scenes included that the game feels like I am participating in a movie rather than just playing a game. It also helps that once again Blizzard has nailed the story lines in each zone, and that really pulls me into the game.\nThe new dungeons and raids look stunning and are a whole lot of fun to play. While the dungeons are not as hard as the Cataclysm ones were initially, they do have a lot more going on in them. Blizzard has really started to add more abilities to dungeon bosses since Cataclysm, and that makes them much more interesting to fight against.\nFor once the launch went amazingly well! The game just flowed right into the launch and while there was some congestion at key points in quest chains, there was never a serious holdup. This was probably the best launch yet for a WoW expansion.\n\nCons\nThe leveling in the game is once again way to fast. It is just insane to me that after all this waiting for a game players can power through it in less than a day. Sure there is a lot of end game content, and that is what most players want to get to, but it was still too fast by far.\nThe whole idea of adding Pokemon to the game is more than a little strange to me. While I know the idea is popular with the younger crowd, it seems downright disrespectful to the more serious gamers.\nWhile scenarios looked to be an awesome idea, they fall seriously short. They are way to easy and require way to little cooperation to offer any serious lasting enjoyment.\nThe simplified talent system is just way to simplified. While I do agree that it offers more meaningful choice when compared to the old talent system, it does so at the expense of a feel of accomplishment or customization. Getting 1 talent every 15 levels doesn’t feel like you are accomplishing anything or able to customize your character at all. Worst of all, all specializations for each class all have access to the same talents. I can think of only one word to describe that: lame.","August 19, 2014","true","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Possibly targeted towards Steam players with children. It's a alright game with basic "go here, come back" and "find x amount of y" mechanics to get kids into gaming with basic little quests and whimisical story, music, and art. It even uses something similar to area wide cooperation quests to boost teamwork. It's a very basic low requirement game that I'm sure can run on decent computers. It's nonviolent so if you happened to want to keep your children from fighting and such, then here it is. The game is a free trial up until level 10, then you can purchase a membership, the lowest being 3.99 for a month to about 30 bucks for a year.\n\nPersonally, I don't recommend this game mainly because this isn't what I think of when I think of Steam, but there's a possibility Valve is attempting to widen the playerbase, but still. I'm personally not a fan of children's games so I have to make this recommendation a "No."","August 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

When first entered the game, i was asked to make my name.. you get a selection of 3 characters.. You will then select your name.. after that it sends you over to the next task which makes you select your last name and it Glitched out and did not work, so i could not move on.. took me 5 restarts and tries before it worked, just when i thought maybe i am home free i realized i wasn't, i then has to run around touching some odd little animal kid things.. suddenly some type of boss game that i believe you were supposed to fight..well guess what i never got to fight the boss cause soon as the cut scene ended the game again glitched out and i was literally floating in the sky.. mean while im supposed to be fighting a boss that was clearly not flying in the sky with me.. To make matters worse.. in order to do this again you would have to start from beginning again.. NO THANKS.\n\nTo make matters worse there was no options from what i seen that allow you to make any type of adjustments  resolution and anything else.. only thing i seen is an option at the top of the right hand side of the screen to close the screen, or switch it to full screen or Windowed mode.. and even while in windowed more you cannot scale it..\n\nSo far this game is total crap as it stands right now, i really do not have the patients to keep restarting the game because it keeps glitching out due to software issues.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo i made it past everything, and finally made it into the game, it wanted me to register my parents email? WTF? to make matters worse, once you sign up and all the fun stuff they want your parents to approve the email so you can chat in public chat lol.. why when i am playing this game do i feel as if "CHRIS HANSON" is following me around.\n\nI will continue to watch for updates and maybe try this game again later once they have fixed issues for now i don't recommend this game at all.","August 6, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It would probably be weird if you weren't, since you're most likely at a computer. What, you got some kinda standing desk? You think you're better than me?\n\nYou have never before seen a game like this. While Elder Scrolls Online was busy whoring attention and clogging up all the hype in the MMO market, Amazing World quietly slipped in and is poised to take the market by storm. If you're one of those ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who loves getting in on huge things before they become huge, then jump your sweet, bulbous booty right onto Amazing World right now, because I can tell you that this game is about to blow. The ♥♥♥♥. Up. The control scheme is so god damned tight that you only need four keys and a mouse to do everything-hotkeys are a thing of the past, people! We all know mouse clicks are far faster and more accurate than key presses. With an engaging storyline, riveting, nuanced combat, and abundance of content for both beginners and endgame, Amazing World outclasses any MMO I've played before. Trust me, I've played 'em all: WoW, Perfect World, RIFT, Neverwinter, Ragnarok Online, Ragnarok Online 2, Gaia, MapleShit, and even Elder Scrolls Online. All fall flat on their faces when compared to Amazing World. The graphics are so tight, it's no wonder this is a PC exclusive. With draw distances of almost five feet and incredible 240p textures, it's like you're experiencing this--dare I say--AMAZING world in real life, especially since I can guarantee your "real" life will disappear after you become as addicted to Amazing World as everyone who experiences this incredible phenomenon does.

The designer's consider it a collectible game akin to that of beanie babies. The point is to collect all the rare clothing and critter skins you can whilst levelling up.\n\nThe problem? You have to be a VIP with a valid credit card to level up past ten.\n\nThat does suck, but you are able to level up skills like cookin and such (which serve no purpose other than collecting skins clothes and furniture items).\n\nYou may also use steam cash to pay for gold coins for more skins and special clothes.\n\nI would say anyone complaining about this game for the fact that it forces you to buy VIP after level 10 have missed the fact that VIP isnt even worth it because you can still earn your way to skins and rewards by levelling up your SKILLS. Not your XP level. So technically, you dont have to pay to play its an option and a really stupid one at that because you can earn everything in the game vips get off the bat and the mini games are designed for kids 5 and up. So its pretty damn easy to just spam missions to level skills for clothes and stuff.\n\nOther than that the game is cute and fun. But dont bother if you're looking for an epic mmo. This is quite literally, a kids game.","January 17, 2015","true","51.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LethalJam/recommended/293500/","LethalJam","LethalJam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LethalJam/","253 products in account","(I played in a browser so the time on steam isn't correct) The game is great and provides many challenges, innovating gameplay and lots of loot to collect such as a squid backpack. It does however requires payment after lv 10 but you can go on playing quite a bit after that anyway.\n\nThere are many proffesions in the game to level up so it's quite similar to Runescape. These include stuff like fishing, cooking and archeology. These have very deep mechanics and you can use the resources for many different things.\n\nThe game is heavily inspired by Guild Wars 2 as well with world events appearing randomly everywhere. Together with your zing comrades, you have to complete them and you get rewarded based on how well you did. The game also provides a great PvP component where you have to battle other zings in the events to become the leading helper and get the greatest reward.\n\nOther features that are great include: Player housing. You can customise your garden, yard, house and many other thing with the gear you aquire in quests. Speaking of quests, this is another great aspect of the game.\n\nThere are many questlines, each with unique skill rewards and loot. The quests range from simple "collect x things" to puzzles, racing, platforming and shooting segments. The questlines never get repetetive and thanks to a well made fast travelling mechanic, the game never gets tedious.\n\nSimply put, this is a great mmorpg with lots of variety. The game borrows mechanics from other games to create a truly refined and unique experience. The only downside is the membership requirment after lv 10. (max lv is 50). But the cost is low at 2,99 $ a month and I deeply recommend it for that cost.\n\nThis is a game that deserves attention because of its finely crafted experience.\nAdd me in game, my name is JiggleTitts.\nI give this game 9/10.","January 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

The story is very intriguing and exciting. It shows us the limits of humans and how far one can go until he descends into madness. The bossfights are epic, Shadow of the Colossus style. The game is set on a proper difficulty which is challenging and rewarding at the same time. The community is great too with amazing mods and always ready to help other players.

This... This AMAZING GAME.\n\nAltough on steam i have around 20 minutes, in the browser version, i'm probable at around 1000 hours.\nThe gameplay, the graphics, eveything about this game is great. The story is very intriguing and exciting. It shows us the limits of humans and how far one can go until he descends into madness. The bossfights are epic, Shadow of the Colossus style. The game is set on a proper difficulty which is challenging and rewarding at the same time. The community is great too with amazing mods and always ready to help other players. The developers also encourage the modding community.\nI rate this game 9.5/10, will play this over GTA V anyday.\n\nBut seriously, this game is steaming pile of colorful crap.","May 8, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And you know what? It wasn't, well, it was but more on that later. So anyways, there is a lot of good mmorpg games (if you can even call this game that) and fortunately, this isn't one of them. From what I can tell of the 10 minutes I played this game, it is this rpg type of game kinda like club penguin except way worse, and my main problem was, it wasn't fun, I found my self just walking around this town filled with five year olds who enjoy this game and I just couldn't wrap my head around it, I'd be running around, looking for a quest, and I couldn't find anything, the game had a real big pay2play problem kinda like tf2 but not really because in team fortress you can find items and it's not really pay2play. I spun this large wheel and I got 125 coins, what did I do with them? Absolutely nothing, I couldn't buy anything because I didn't have enough coins or I was a low level. In all honesty, don't waste your time on this game, please. There's much better games that are free to play like teamfortress, quake live,etc. And they are a million times better than this peice of trash, do I recommend this game? no, with the crappy mechanics it has, the crappy pay2play system and on top of that, theres no fighting, I understand it's a kids game, but c'mon there are some kids games that are better and still bad, but have a combat system. This game is trash and I will never recommend it. Don't waste your time and money. All in all, this game didn't give me cancer though, it gave me aids, darn.","October 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It brings a breath of fresh air into the open world survival gameplay genre. The customization is top notch, Ohh did you really enjoy building crap houses in RUST? Well in this game you can add watermelon wallpaper, you have a choice of like 10 different kinds of beds and also you can put a pet outside your house. What other game has that I ask you? There are many, many, many different missions to choose from. Rewards for completing these include in game currency. The currency is used to purchase a variety of goods. I choose to make my character more towards the gay end of the spectrum and I gave him the name Fahgotree. Try it out because it is free. If you enjoy it then pay for the monthly subscription. If you take shrooms or acid I would not think twice about hitting that download button.

I'm 27 years old now, and I've been gaming solidly for 19 years. I have to say, I have never come across a game which lived up to its name quite so well before. Amazing World will leave you speachless with both it's ingenius design and its beautiful graphics. The community of fellow "Zings" is fantastic, and any time you feel threatened by Nixx's they will help you.\nI rate this game a solid, gold plater, grade A 10/10, and I would genuinely recommend this video game experience, or master piece as I like to call it, to anyone who has the audacity to play something this ground breaking and revolutionary. This game will be the eulogy played out at my funeral for I believe that from this point onwards it will define who I am.\nAmazing World is the gift to the human race that God wishes he could give.\nFive Stars, please play. I am in no way affiliated with this game or the Zing people. Just an awe struck fan, turned away from the dark side of triple A filth. Take my ♥♥♥♥ing word for it, it will change your life for the better. Since I began playing Amazing World, I have felt physically and mentally healthier and my sex life has improved. I think it may even have the power to cure cancer.","January 18, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 15, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.","September 20, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It focuses on taking care of your very own garden and help the the town from being took over by the Queen Vexa. Now your more of just running up to the nix and scaring em off but theres a lot more to the game then all that. Theirs cute and fun minigames that seem to be different every time to from a mario like side scroller to riding a cute little car or even fixing puzzles.  The down side of it is once you hit level 10 you hit the end of the road for free to play. Now $4 a month seems reasonable to me for this funny little game but if you don't pay no more game for you! Its would be good for any age as long as they like cute.","August 14, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Torture is a common theme in this psychological game, as the game's known merciless villain, Bloom, frequently feeds off of the tortured animals in her basement. Oh god the horror of this game. The Springs village has blood everywhere, rotten animal organs around every corner, with painful sounding moans, screams and wimpers as the game's soundtrack. One of the most effective part is where there's a scene where the character of "Twinkle" is decapitated slowly and painfully by rusty nail clippers in an incredibly explicit scene where you can see all of the pain in her crying face while it happens.\n\nAmazing World changed my life. It showed me how wonderful my life truly is for not living in this horrid civilisation, and I'm rethinking any negative thought I've ever had in my life. Which is why Amazing World is my favourite video game, heck, favourite THING in the known universe.\n\n\nMasterpiece.","August 16, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
