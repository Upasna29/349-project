"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/27920/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","The game Booster Trooper is a 2D indie shooter game.\nPrice: 4,99 € / Summersale: 0,99 € (till 30th June 2014)\n\nI just recommend this game because it’s still pretty funny to play in single player mode.\nMy personal experience (warning to my friends ♥) about the multiplayer is below!\n\nGraphic: Retro 7/10\nSound: 9/10\nControls: 10/10\n\n+ And I want to add it is pretty funny how the enemies scream when they die +\nAchievements: 260 achievements which spam you lol\nI mean I got 52 achievements just from one hour testing the game automatically.\n\nMy experiences with MULTIPLAYER:\nA friend of me and I wannted to play Booster Trooper together. So we started the game and WANTED to look for a server. But there have been no servers listed. The status “Refreshing server list” never ended. Sadly.\nSo I clicked “Host Match” and created a game with players and bots but my friend couldn’t join me. Good thing we had a Skype-Call and talked together about it during my fight with just bots.\nI left the game and told him to open a game but I also couldn’t join him. We found some discussions about this problem. The Servers are down since years and there is no support anymore. It's so annoying.... WHEN THERE IS SAID IN THE STEAM SHOP THE GAME IS MULTIPLAYER AND COOP THERE SHOULD BE ANY SERVERS! -.- And it’s not the only game with that problem.\n\nAnother criticism from me:\nThe bots seem to be kinda stupid. lol Or at least in my games they are sometimes hanging at a box and aren’t able to jump. Or they are confused running on one place.  X’D Also I played “Capture the flag” and I think the bot enemy wasn’t even able to get the flag or the bot doesn’t wanted to get it… I don’t know… it just ended 24:0 for me. And yeah it’s cool to win but not if you have the feeling the enemy is playing with his ♥♥♥ on the keyboard. o:\nAdd: If you play "Capture the flag" against more bots (e.g. 11) it works. Seems like they are just 1vs 1 stupid. :c\n\nAlso the "Pause" button seems not to work.\n\nAnyways if you want to have a bit fun alone or just to collect achievements – here you have a cheap game. Or maybe you have someone who plays the game with you in local via home network.\n\nLocal Multiplayertip:\n1.The two most popular home network types are wireless and Ethernet networks. My friend and me used a wireless network. So your friend needs: the name of your Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and the WLAN password.\n2. When both of you are connected to the same WLAN you start the game.\n3. You click: „Multiplayer“ and „Host Match“ with the settings you like.\n4. ATTENTION:\nThe number of players seems to be bugged in this game, because if you choose 12 players and 10 bots (what would be logically for playing with one friend) theres shown -6 free slots for your friend and he won’t be able to join ya. So I noticed from trying it’s better to choose 12 players with 4-5 bots when I play with one friend.\n5. When you made your settings you start the match.\n6. Your friend clicks: „Join match“ and now he will be able to see your game with a free slot. He just clicks on your game and will connect.","June 26, 2014","true","54.4"," 43 of 43 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","43","43","0","17"

This game would be hella fun if there was an online community. The sixteen hours I have put into this has purely been single player.\n\nIt may not look much, but the side scrolling action arena that is on offer here is bloody fun. Fast paced, action packed style gameplay with a little bit of platforming involved. There is plenty of different weapons...but you are going to want to go with the mini-gun, my god, this weapon is siiiiiiiiick.  I found myself getting kill streak after kill streak with this thing. The regular rifle is good, but jeez, I was actually shouting and jumping in my seat with enjoyment while playing.\n\nOther reviews seem to slate Booster Trooper, but I reckon if you get a few of your friends playing it, you will have a blast.","April 1, 2015","true","16.5"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","29","39","2","0"

Allow me to take you back to the year 2002, when a little known game called Soldat was released. Soldat utilized a unique 2D platformer game design, and still carries somewhat of a cult following to this day. What Soldat lacked at the time (and still today) is a strong aesthetic background. Don't get me wrong, it's a shareware game and for the price (free) it's a great value. Fast forward to 2010, and the DnS Development team has stepped in with a beautiful solution.\n\nLike other games in the 2D jetpack-platformer-shooter-deathmatch-whateverelse genre, Booster Trooper gives you control of a soldier that has the ability to move in pretty much any direction with the assistance of rocket pack. WASD controls will get you around the map along with a mouse controlled reticle that can be aimed wherever you please. The keyboard inputs seem to be well balanced, but I could never quite get the mouse sensitivity to a level that felt just right. I also lost track of the reticle during some of the more intense fire fights, which may just be a color setting for most, but I definitely needed some sort of contrast adjustment to keep it from disappearing into the carnage.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the biggest thing that DnS Development has done with this title is raise the aesthetics bar of the genre in a big way. The backgrounds and map detail are incredibly gorgeous. The layering effects of everything make it feel like you are playing in a completely 3D environment that will probably leave you yearning to explore every nook and cranny that you can't actually get to. The character models themselves leave something to be desired with their bland and fairly static animations, but luckily this isn't all that noticeable unless you're wandering around by yourself. The multitude of ordinance animations and blood effects are done with a surprisingly high level of quality for each player and weapon, which is especially true when you consider the scale of everything on screen.\n\nAlmost every single piece of audio included with Booster Trooper seems to have been designed to match the games intensity and in most cases it might even kick it up a level or two. The music selection has a great tempo, and if nothing else is probably the developers way of attempting to rock your eardrums while you wait for the firefight to take over. Weapon sounds maintained a slight hint of realism, but mostly sounded like guns from any movie set a century or two from present day (and understandably so, the guys are hovering around in jet-packs like it's a normal mode of transportation). No audible taunts from what I was able to hear, but the handful of screams and deathly grunts when someone is finished off give the characters a little personality and round out the audio set nicely.\n\nEven if you're a pro in this area of gaming, the number of weapons available to you would take at least a few dozen games to get a basic handle on the entire set. The inclusion of a single player (bot practice) mode is something I always appreciate because I don't have to drop into a game and have my butt handed to me for the first 46 matches while I figure out what gun I'm holding. Multiplayer mode doesn't really have a leveling or upgrade system unless you count leader boards, but if that appeals to your domination appetite it's nice to know that you can rule the top spot for as long as you want.\n\nAll things considered, it's difficult to dock points for the little things that need only a tiny bit of polishing when DnS has stepped up in such a big way for almost every aspect of the game. If you've been a long time fan of this game type, or even if you're new to the party and are simply looking to test the waters, Booster Trooper is a solid choice.","February 28","true","18.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

The game modes cover all the basics - Capture the Flag, base defense, team death match, free for all, but there is nothing really innovative here.\n\nThe arenas are graphically fairly diverse, but probably most of them are a bit too similar tactically, while others are a bad idea if you plan on having bots due to the limited routes and the poor AI pathing - if set to low levels you should be able beat up on the AI with its slow reactions and poor aim, if set hard the bots are pretty challenging as long as they don't get stuck on scenery, or failing to find a route to the target when playing CTF or base defense.\n\nGenerally I wouldn't buy this to play against the AI, and decent random online games are rare nowadays, but if a group of friends wanted a fun lightweight action game to play against each other regularly, this would be a decent option.\n","October 30, 2014","true","47.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This game is a decent 2D Multiplayer sidescroller. There isn't much of a community (according to steam charts it peaked at 6 players on 8/4/2015, which was 2 days before this post ( http://steamcharts.com/app/27920 )) So unless you are getting a 4 pack (or 3) you won't be seeing much multiplayer action.\n\nNow I got this game during a sale for $2.24 for a 4 pack ($.74 for 1). At that price, this game is worth it. This game is definitely not worth $5. It is decent, but not $5 decent.\n\nThis game needs a few fixes and improvements for it to be $5 decent, but it is not far off.\n\nPros:\n- Variety (15) of maps very well made maps\n- Good, fast paced combat\n- Multiplayer\n- 4 gamemodes\n- Up to 12 players at once\n\nCons:\n- At first the jumping mechanic can be annoying, but once you figure it out it is pretty easy. If you hit jump (space) right before you hit your jetpack (w) you fly up really quickly.\n\n- The camera can be a bit shaky which can be annoying. This seems to happen when you move the aiming reticle quickly.\n\n- The bots (at least at normal difficulty, haven't tried the others) can be a bit stupid at times. On occasion they will get stuck in places.\n\n- There is no way to have a rotation of maps or gamemodes (the latter I don't really mind, but the former I do, it gets boring playing on the same map and it is a pain to have to restart the server every time you want a map change)\n\n- For whatever reason you can't access the score menu when the match ends. This is minor, but I still find it a pain.\n\n- There aren't many weapons at all. 5 primary weapons + 1 that really powerful weapon that spawns on the map that you only get for 30 seconds. There are also only 2 secondary weapons and only 2 types of grenades.\n\n- There are default servers, but it seems you have to Port Forward if you want to make your own.","August 6, 2015","true","1.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

At the time, there were not many platform shooters, Apparently, I was not the only one thinking it could be a good game, because quite some people bought the game. I can tell since my rare achievements list only contains Booster Trooper achievements and I'm quite sure it will take a long time (forever) to get different achievements from other games.\nWhy, you say? Simply, because apparently most of the players did get a few achievements, but never returned to the game. I used to love the rare achievements on my profile page but obviously, it's not that fun for me anymore.\n\nBooster Trooper is an online platform shooter. Sadly, there's no one playing the game anymore so you've got the option to play vs bots.\nGameplay is all pretty basic but instead of jumping you use a jetpack to get higher up the platforms. There are multiple weapons like; minigun, sniper rifle, pistol.... you get the picture. There are some special weapons and powerups to pick up.\n\nGraphically, the game looks pretty awful, even at launch. It did not bother me much personally but it simply does not look good.\n\nOverall Booster Trooper is an OK game, which can only be recommend buying it together with some buddies, weren't it for the fact the price tag of the game is 5 bucks (4 pack: 15,-) which is way too much. Also, there are better games of the same genre like The Showdown Effect.\n\n","March 24, 2015","false","2.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game does include a single player bot mode that will allow you to practice your skills and the game includes a nice variety of game settings, 24 different maps, and supports both the Steam Overlay and widescreen resolutions.  The music design is standard military fare, nothing particularly notable, but fitting and not too annoying.  Unfortunately, the games shooting sound effects, while somewhat realistic, really get repetitive quickly.  In addition, your player characters are rather weak, often resulting in as many deaths as kills.  For a bargain title though, the game is a competent although not particularly memorable entry, and worthwhile purchase for anyone who is looking for a quick diversion at a budget price.","July 21, 2012","true","46.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However the graphics are good but not great, and the gameplay is smooth but unremarkable. It's not a poorly made game just nothing really stands out about it.

This game is fun to play offline with bots, but I'm afraid that there are no multiplayer servers whatsoever.\n\nI'm afraid I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that there's lack off mulitplayer servers and the bots doesn't always seem to be smart. You'll get tired quickly playing on your own. There is no way (from what I've googled) that you can download custom maps or mods for you to play with.","June 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Gameplay is ****, weapons are ****, everything about this game is ****. I quickly exited the ******-♥♥♥ game in fear. The next day, I deleted the game from my computer, and up to now, I never EVER touched that game EVER again. (nail'd it!)\n\nMoral of the story\n\nBooster Trooper is a horrible game that you should never buy even if it's for free.\nBuying this game for a friend or even giving it away for free is a sin.\n\n1/10!\n","August 22, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
