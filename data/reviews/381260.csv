I felt while playing this game that I wasn't so much actually PLAYING the game as just sharing the Orion Trail experience, because from beginning to end, the game is basically pure luck.  You choose from random sets of crewmen presented to you, to give you certain stats, and that's about all you do to influence how the session goes.  I mean, you can pick your path in which systems to move towards, and whether or not to stop at certain things, I suppose, but it's not much of a choice, because in any given thing, you have no real control over your consequences.\n\nThere are no upgrades to purchase to make you more likely to succeed.  Your crew's stats can go up or down at a whim, as random events between nodes tick these abilities up or down with no input from you.  The time honored tradition of visiting tombstones from previous playthroughs on games like Oregon Trail is doable here, but even doing THIS can cause an utterly random stat raise or decrease.  Even what skills you use during a particular incident is entirely random most of the time;  You can push up and specialize in a particular stat only to be presented with an event that doesn't allow you to use that stat.  Even the -rewards or penalties- can be randomized in many events.\n\nPerhaps in some games, all of this randomness wouldn't be a problem.  Orion Trail tries to allieviate things a bit with its quirky and outlandish dialogue, and it works for a time.  However, said dialogue runs out too quickly, frequently recycled every playthrough.  Given you need to play through the game multiple times to unlock the content... this is a rather serious thing.  Also not present is any sense of fairness.  On any given random event, no matter how good you are in the stat, you have the chance to critically fail, and the critical failure events are so harsh that just one of them can completely break your run, often completely exhausting a vital resource.  Critical successes, on the other hand, while certainly nice, do not give you things on quite the same scale.  Furthermore, it's almost impossible to recover from a critical failure because your rewards are often given randomly as well, and you can't just complete events that'll raise the thing the Critical Failure took from you, because the opportunities are just not given.\n\nAll and all, I'd go as far to say that the game is 100% Pure Luck in whether you succeed or not, and there's not enough dialogue in the game to make playing such a ludicrously random game worth your while.  Stick to FTL for your starship piloting dreams.","October 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 96 of 122 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","96","122","0","6"

Enough time for two run-throughs. Time-wise, that was exactly what I was looking for in a game like this. I loved Organ Trail, even though I've only played it for 7 hours or so. I really enjoyed that game and was looking for something similar. This game was not it.\n\nThe problem with this game is it feels like soul-less RNG. There are no interesting decisions. Even picking your crew, you need to specialize to get the highest number possible in one category or another, meaning choosing a captain with a skill of 3, and a crew member with a skill of 2, with as much overlap in the same skill as possible, is a no-brainer. Combat basically amounts to rolling a die. Nothing you do can manipulate those odds. Planet exploration is the only interesting part of the game, but just barely. It amounts to a simple "press your luck" decision game. You can choose the path your spaceship takes, like sometimes... but the only decision there is to go to which resource you need most. And if the resource on both ends of the branch is the same, is that really much of a decision? You have no idea what sort of RNG event is going to happen or affect it in any way, so yeah... boring. By contrast, Organ Trail had lots of action-RPG events where you get rewarded for skillful gameplay and are constantly making decisions that affect your success.\n\nIn the end, this game plays itself. You're just there to watch and click buttons when necessary. No strategy. No tactics. Nothing. Really wanted to like this game. Didn't.","September 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 65 of 91 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","65","91","3","3"

Had a great run going, 3/4 of the way through then BAM, one bad roll and the enter run was deleted.  I want to like this game so very much, but the amount of punishment on the negative rolls is huge compared to the reward.  Also the inability to anything to change the gameplay besides stack the odds as best you can leaves me feeling very powerless to do much as a player other than click through the menus and hope for the best.  As it currently stands, I can't really recommend the game unless someone is looking to while away a couple of hours doing something else and listening to the nice soundtrack while clicking around the game and enjoying the very good pixel art.\n\nIf the gameplay was as good as the art and soundtrack, I'd easily give this game 10/10.  As it currently stands though, the gameplay is lacking and the dice rolls are too punishing to even let this be an enjoyable distraction.  The game is trying to be difficult like oregon trail, but it doesn't reward the player for doing anything right.  This means the only thing you can do as a player is min/max and hope for the best.  If that appeals to you, click away, but I need some more reward for spending time with the game and learning the system.  Therefore I can't recommend the game in it's current state.","October 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","0"

I was hoping it would be stronger on gameplay. Perhaps more will be added and I can update this.\n\nMy chief complaint is that it feels like an unfinished FTL clone. Choices made in the game don't seem to matter much. There is no playable combat to speak of. You can run out of food entirely but somehow finish the mission with everyone dead on board.

I often found myself speeding through dialog I'd seen before until I branched into a new result.\n\nYou choose your crew who each have a few points toward 5 different attributes.  These attributes give you a better chance at getting a positive result in the RNG.  Focusing on 2 of the 5 attributes seems to work well.\n\nThere is some resource management.

You select your crew at the start of the missions and this sets your strengths and weaknesses. During the game you'll encounter various obstacles and you can overcome them by choosing from three options out of five attributes. The higher the attribute the better the chance that you'll pass the encounter successfully. You have to manage resources and during the missions there are ways to exchange one of the four for another. I think those aspects make the game feel less RNG based and more like you actually have (some) influence on the outcome.\n\nThe presentation is simple, but fits the game very well. The pixel graphics have their own style and the UI does have a Star Trek feel to it. The music is decent and sounds a bit like a 60s sci-fi soundtrack on an 8 bit machine.\n\nThere is some humour in the game, but it's not a comedy/parody game. It does have a lot of references to old sci-fi, but it doesn't rely on them. The story fragments are well written and there seem to be a lot of them.\n\nSurprisingly interesting build-your-own-adventure/RNG game that will make me come back for more. Everybody that likes this kind of games and/or old sci-fi should have a look for 10 bucks, but everybody else should also give this a try once it goes on sale.","November 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

I liked the idea.  It sounded fun.  I can't get past the second level.\n\nThis game is 100% random chance.  It feels like no matter what I do, how I arrange my stats, what decisions I make, every last damn encounter is a coin toss.  There's only so many times I can roll a critical fail when I'm supposed to have a 10-in-12 chance of success.  ESPECIALLY when the penalty of that fail is LOWERING THE STAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME.\n\nI also love it when the game randomly decides to reduce a stat for no reason.\n\nYou're presented with numerous choices in this game, all related to little amusing scenarios that pop up at every stop point on the map.  Each option has a different risk/reward, but since each choice is directly affected by one of your stats, you're really just choosing your odds of success.  Why yes game, I WOULD like some more crew, but my science stat is ONE.  Since I KNOW that you'll just kill my crew instead should I fail, I think I'll use my 6 deplomacy for this food I don't need.\n\nThen I fail the roll anyways.  It just really, REALLY feels like the choices are arbitrary.  Maybe they aren't, but that didn't stop it from not being fun for me.  Hell, I quit reading the little stories and just clicked the number when it popped up.  They have no long-term effects, and there’s no over-arching plot to pay attention to.  There’s no reason to care about what’s doing what; the description of the actions have nothing to do with the outcome, just the stat.\n\nExample: I was having a pretty terrible run, but it LOOKED like I could limp to the finish of level 2, but when I was ONE dot away from the end, the game informed me that someone had left the gas cap off, and the last of my fuel fell out.  I proceeded to sit there, inches from the finish line, as my crew literally starved to death waiting for rescue.\n\nTo my knowledge, there is nothing I could have done to reduce the odds of my crew being a bunch of morons.\n\nThe bottom line is that there is not one, SINGLE action I can take in this game that makes me feel like I have direct control over ANYTHING.  I don’t even feel like there’s a strategy to improve my odds.  They even added the ability to boost your resources at the start of the level, but I have no idea which ones are going to be most drained by the random encounters, so I can’t make any kind of meaningful decision!\n\nMaybe some people find that... exciting, or something.  It just makes me want to pull my hair out.","November 8, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

Nevertheless, I must also point out that I had full faith in this game and Kickstarted it months ago. I'm afraid that faith has taken a hit at this point that I hope the development team will see fit to remedy with future patches.\n\nThe Good:\n- The art design is delightfully nostalgic and colorful, evocative in the whimsical, retro ways I hoped it would be.\n- The writing is ribald tongue-in-cheek, with geek references a-plenty. It manages to be corny fun without being overwrought.\n\nThe Bad:\n- I sporadically get stuck in Options and the UI becomes unresponsive to clicks, forcing me to quit the game entirely and start over.\n- There is no obvious option to select a different batch of captains or officers without restarting the whole process.\n- The post-luck is PUNISHING and pre-luck does not seem well-leveraged unless the player leans heavily in one attribute over another. I realize it's all RNG, but I feel remarkably unlucky.\n- Furthermore, even I do rely heavily on one or two stats (getting 'lucky' with the random batch of captains and officers offered), the random occurrences seem to target them mercilessly. Twice I've had a captain end up all zeroes at one during their 'trek' to the goal. That shouldn't be possible. I realize that part of the fun is the risk and reward, but my preparations often seem to amount to a hill o' beans and that certainly was not fun.\n\nI ended up quitting out of the game.

I was unsure about it at first due to the early negative reviews, but some of the more recent positive ones indicate that the developers are taking public criticism and suggestions to heart and improving the game.  So, I decided to buy it and I'm sure glad I did.\n\nThe game is very Oregon Trail meets Star Trek, minus the educational aspects OT and with lots of humor that (at times) pokes fun at ST.  Basically, you fly through space as the captain of a ship, exploring the galaxy and encountering lots of interesting challenges.  Unlike some space games that are mostly combat, Orion Trail is more of an adventure game and the challenges you face can be anything from problems with your ship and crew to encounters with other ships and space born life to planets that need exploring.  The randomness and variety of encounters and ways you can try to deal with them add to the fun and replay value.  The writing is very clever and funny and is full of hilarious Sci Fi inspired things.  There are a few typos, but nothing too bad.\n\nThe game play itself is pretty simple, though it can be at times frustrating and requires a bit of strategy (and luck.)  Encounters offer a set of solutions that use your crew skills, the success of which relies on a "roll of the dice," so to speak.  Though, if you use skills that your crew has in abundance, your chance of success is greater, though still not guaranteed.  Apart from crew skills, you rely greatly on resources.  Hull plating to make your ship less susceptible to damage, food for your crew to eat, fuel for your ship's engines and red shirts to sacrifice themselves in various ways, ensuring the survival of your officers.  Successful encounters can reward you with resources or boost your officers' skills, though unsuccessful ones can have the opposite effect.\n\nThe graphics, sound and music are all well done and very retro.  Basically, the game looks and feels like an old DOS space game.  Much of the game's style is derived from Star Trek, though it's not an exact copy.  It would be more fair to call it a homage to Star Trek.  It's very resource light and will run on even slow computers.

It has a good vibe to it.\n\nThe graphics are cute, particularly the Warp Weasel. The writing is clever, and the music is fitting.\n\nThere is currently no tutorial but the game play is fairly intuitive. However, if a tutorial level was added, it should be short and touch on the very basic aspects, with minimal interference in gameplay.\n\nI know some people don't see this as a variant on Oregon Trail but the more Schell develops this, the closer the vibe gets to the spirit of Oregon Trail. The variety and options in how you approach each event is great. The outcomes aren't predictable unless you've built your team well.\n\nWhat I like most is I can pick it up, play for a few minutes and go play something else.

The initial release on Steam had its balance too out of whack, and I can see how that would've frustrated a lot of people.\n\nThey've done much to fix this, though, and it's now a genuinely enjoyable coffee break game. I wish we had more of those as inventive, clever, and funny as this.\n\nThis is about the best you're going to get when it comes to a retooling of the Oregon Trail game. I was a fan of that game way back when, and I love this even more. Honestly, it's the best of the crop of the games trying to ape it. And the balance, fun, and replayability is far better than Organ Trail.\n\nPlus! It's a great parody for Sci-Fi fans. Especially Star Trek fans. There's a lot of in-jokes there that only they might get. Something to keep in mind. Definitely a bonus for Trek fans, but perhaps a detriment to those who aren't.\n\nAlso. You can be a bear. Your captain can be a chubby bear, and they're usually pretty great captains, too. Honestly, what more could you ask for?\n\nIf you're an older gamer (like me), you like sci-fi, and you're looking for a short game to pass the time or something like the Oregon Trail, this'll do you.\n\nI admit, this isn't the highest praise.

As the game has now been released, this is what I now think of it:\n\nIt's really good!\n\nAll the extra content added since I last played it (life has been busy, so over a month ago!) really shows. The game is far better balanced, more polished, and it feels complete. The devs are still on top of things, making changes based on feedback, which is an extra point in my book. I am especially loving the added random encounters, which really add flavour to the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a funny, entertaining, space homage to Oregon Trail, this is your game. It is punishing at times, with a heavy RNG component, but your strategy will make a difference, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to play.\n\n\n------------------------\nAt the moment this game is in early access, and it doesn't have as much content as it eventually will, but I still really like it, and I think it has great potential.\n\nI was a Kickstarter backer, as I loved the concept, and so far it has stayed true to it. I really like the art style and the writing. The random encounters are witty and full of sci-fi references, which I love. I normally hold back from early access games, but I am glad to be part of the growth and evolution of this one.\n\nI will update this review as the game progresses. At this point, I'd say: if you want to be active part of the development, and like the style and the concept, this is a perfect time to join in. If having little play content and some balance issues bothers you, perhaps sit back, keep an eye on the forums, and see how things evolve.\n\nUpdate 1: after the first game update, I can already tell that the game feels far more solid. There is more content, everything feels far more balanced, and some of the ideas discussed in the forums have been implemented. Things are looking really good!\n\nUpdate 2: after the last two updates, the game has noticeably more content. It feels much deeper and more replayable, and the addition of longer missions and extra encounters also up the challenge and the need to play more strategically, rather than relying on luck. I'm very happy with all the additions so far!","August 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Sorry, folks, that was a stretch goal that wasn't met.  Some people have complained that there's no skill involved, that it all comes down to a roll of the die.  This is broadly true, but aside from that sadly missing hunting game, Oregon Trail and the more recent "OMG anything is better with zombies" Organ Trail are pretty much the same way.\n\nWill you ford the river or try to float across?  Sneak through the horde of zombies or go through guns blazing?  Rely upon your attack rating and set phasers to "shave" or go with tactics and put on encounter suits to avoid the allergy problems from these furry trading aliens?  In each situation you know something about which will be more likely to succeed, but can ultimately fail based on luck... it's just that Oregon Trail is more open about that fact.\n\nDespite the lack of hunting, I still think this is a good game.  You can't just min/max as another reviewer said because you won't always get the crew you want (you get a random assortment of three candidates for each slot), you may not have your impressive attack rating as an option each encounter, and going full-on diplomacy will leave you hurting when a bravado or science crisis hits.  You instead need to try to balance your various skills, knowing that going high on a couple of things will make those challenges more likely to succeed but that it will leave other stats weak.  And while a roll of the dice may not be an extremely exciting way to play a game, what you do have here is excellent writing.\n\nWhether you're trying to escape being digested in the "Oh the huge manatee" event, finding that your shields can't hold against savings of this magnitude when a Megamart ship flies up or playing 'pop goes the warp weasel' when you chased the little pests into your airlock, there is a lot that's worth reading and a few chuckles involved.  Perhaps it won't be your favorite game to return to forever, but it's certainly worth playing for a few hours in my opinion.  And with more content slated to be added up through and past the official release, there should be plenty to do for $10.","September 28, 2015","true","24.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I had to install Steam specifically for this game. I am, however, a big Star Trek fan.\n\nI played the demo of this game several times and watched a short (incomplete) playthrough and then decided to buy the game myself. To be honest, I don't feel like I gained much from doing so.\n\nHere are my main issues:\n\n- As others have said, the game is too random. You can make it less random by picking a crew that all excel in one area (e.g. diplomacy) but then you end up picking diplomacy options only as you know you will succeed, leaving you more like a trained monkey than a person making choices. I would have preferred the game to have a in-game "guidebook" (e.g. Fabulons like compliments on their outfits) which would also weigh on the choices. Protocol might say to do X, but you are more skilled in Y and you need to decide which will give better odds. Like the game "Papers, Please", the guidebook could also change during the game.\n\n- No over arcing plot. The demo gave you the choice of trying to finish with either the most food or fuel which could easier have been converted into plotlines (e.g. take as much food to the X planet as possible, you need to pass through 3 systems to get there). Your crew also changes from system to system which could have remained the same, leading to more growth, and also have been integrating into the plot.\n\n- The same issues occur over and over. While I don't mind each system throwing up the same set of issues each time you play, some of the issues occur in more than one system (and perhaps more than once within the same system, though I am not completely sure as it all blurs together). I would have preferred in each system had different problems.\n\n- Part of the store needs coins but there does not seem to be anyway to get coins. Perhaps I have missed something in the game, but this is not mentioned in the manual.\n\nIf you've not played the demo or seen it on YouTube, this game is worth a play. If you have done either of those before, there is no need to download to play but only to support the game designers.","December 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The only real decision-making in the game is choosing between a list of a few options at each node. Usually, it is advantageous to choose the option for which you have the highest corresponding stat bonus. Sometimes, it might make more sense to choose a lesser bonus if it gives a resource that you need badly. But after you hit the probabilitty drive button, you can't control the outcome. Rolling a critical failure when you have a +8 bonus, meaning that all other outcomes would be sucessful, is a horrible feeling. There's nothign you can do as a player to mitigate the outcome. It's possible to lose horribly in a given playthough and then make all the same decisions next time and be sucessful. IMO this is bad game design because it removes all agency on the part of the player. Because of the limited opportunity for player interaction, you feel as though you're along for the ride instead of actively participating. Orion trail is an initially fun distraction with a quirky style and sense of humor that  quickly wears thin as the game mechanics are laid bare.","April 25","false","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Solutions involving expertise like "Science." or "Diplomacy".\n\nTo successfully complete the actions required of that solution, player must meet the skill "threshold".\n\nExample.\n\nMy crew has the combined expertise in Science of 4 after initial crew member assembly.\n\nSecond mission of the trail, I am asked to gain access to an alien fuel source, blocked by an alien bio-matching vault panel lock.\n\nChoosing my "science" expertise solution, which is to surgically transplant an alien tentacle to a crew's body to operate alien technology, requires a total roll of 6.\n\nBefore the roll, my expertise in Science GUARANTEE 4 points in the roll.

I backed it on kickstarter and I was very excited about it. When early access came out for 9.99 I was a little surprised because that's half of what I paid on kickstarter but that okay, kickstarter isn't about getting a good deal it's about helping game devs get their games out. Then I played the first mission and at first thought it was kind of quirky but fun and completed the mission. The stat system seemed to balance the options and give me a sense of picking a team that is good a few things to increase my chances of success. Then I played the second mission and decided to try the opposite and stack one stat. I never choose that stat in my dialog options. I killed all of the crew and all but one of the officers but still won the level. At this point I feel like I could pick any four officers and random click my way through and I still would win. I wonder if it is even possible not to win? One reason I bought this game was because I am a fan of the Organ Trail. It is not even close to that game in it's current state. This game needs to be increased in difficulty and at the same time needs a way buy/sell/trade resources to increase the fun and make me want to replay it. There should be some kind of hunt for food mechanic and there needs to be a town mechanic. The music could use some work too. I feel like it just keeps recycling the same song maybe because I beat the game so quickly I was unable to listen to all of the music. Maybe the music could be set to random instead of the same opening song playing every time. The food and fuel aspects really need polish. One play though I lost half of my initial food on the first encounter. I'll try it again after an update but right now not very fun.","August 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

A sensible player would choose never to interact with ANYTHING, because doing anything except choosing the shortest path and refusing to do anything optional saps resources you can't afford to lose.  Trouble is, you don't have enough of those resources in the first place.  Not even close.  So you HAVE to gamble to win.  But this works out about as well as it would in real life: buying lottery tickets to make rent rarely ends well.  So the game is HARD.\n\nOn the other hand, a perfectly sensible take on what makes this a game is that you're watching the comic misadventures of a Star Trek homage/parody.  Viewed that way, watching endless abusive-but-funny terrible things happen to your crew is the whole point.  You want the ♥♥♥♥ to hit the fan just to see exactly how it'll splatter.  Casually sailing through all the levels would be silly and boring.\n\nThis makes for an odd mix.  You die constantly, which is... not ideal.  But if you get into the spirit of that, it's fun again.\n\nIt's hard to say if this is intentional or not, but the sweet spot is easily hit by rampant cheating using a memory editor.  You can usually find two of the resources in just two scans, and the other two aren't much harder, should they ever pose a real threat of running out.  Once you have the power to simply undo the game's savage punishments for exploring, you're free to relax and goof off.  Which, honestly, feels like exactly what the game was designed to be about in the first place.\n\nIt's also important to note that I'm reviewing an early version of this game.  There's already talk of updating it to be easier coming from the developers.  One way I'd personally like to see them do this is by opening up your character stats to casual mods in config files, like how the "Political Machine" games do it.  That way, players could have fun by tailoring difficulty to their own taste.  Want to make it easy to heroically breeze through all the scenarios?  Ramp up those stats!  Want to laugh at pathetic foibles?  Use, uh, well, just use the original settings.\n\nIn short, the game is fun!  And the references are solid!  But you should be prepared to cheat like you have never cheated before if the idea of constant, near-inevitable failure stresses you out.","October 14, 2015","true","23.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

If that is just too much bias for you, you might want to find something else to read!\n\nOrion Trail is Star Trek meets the Oregon Trail game with a slight detour provided by Monty Python.  The premise is simple enough; select a crew from the choices given (each crew member has different skill sets) then set out across space to encounter a rather ecelctic mix and use your skills to adapt, improvise and overcome. Or die trying. The puns are non stop, the encounters are full of BEMs (I might be showing my age here)  and you roll the digital dice (called the improbability drive which might have been stolen from some English writeer) and take your result in true RNG fashion. If things work out well, you gain some fuel or food or crew, if not, well, you might lose out! Your odds of a favorable solution are based on the skills you have and how many points you have in the skill you choose to bet on.  Its fun, silly and at times, a little repetitious but for a small game done on a tight budget, it came out very well.\n\nIs Orion Trail perfect? No. I find it to be too heavy on food and fuel optimization. I can usually keep my shields and crew up to snuff. Some of the fun might be too inside for many; many of the characters are based on Kickstarter backers. However, is Orion Trail good clean entertainment? I think so. I like how I can play a mission in a few minutes and either be lauded as a great captain or be shown the door and a view of my tombstone (space dysentry anyone?)  There are nods to several pop culture genres here. Have some fun, try the game and see if you have what it takes to be a Galaxy Force captain or just another tomb in space! Oh, and if you run into me, I seem to be an easy grader. I gambled on taking the test last time and got a B-.

I recommended it before, but now that it seems it is out of Early Access, I just can't recommend it anymore. It feels way too random. There just doesn't seem to be enough game here. You pick you captain and your officers, and you even get to rename them if you want. But the rest of the game is choosing which path to take and which stat (Attack, Science, Diplomacy, Bravado, etc.) that you are going to use to tackle the random events that crop up. After that it's all dice-rolling where the RNG feels like it, more often that not, works against you. And even now that Achievements have been activated, it doesn't really feel like any sort of actual achievement to get them. It seems like, if you just have enough playthroughs of the game, you'll get all of the achievements and nothing about your choices and skill will change that.\n\nAs for what I like about the game, there is the concept, which is basically "Oregon Trail In Space." I also like the visual style of the game; I am generally tired of all the indie games these days with their retro-pixelated graphics, but in this game I think it adds real charm.\n\nPeople have referred to FTL when talking about this game, but the graphics and the sense of humor bring to my mind the old Space Quest series by the Two Guys from Andromeda. Also, there is so much depth of gameplay in FTL that it makes this game seem like a computerized Choose Your Own Adventure book.\n\nI can honestly say that I have had more fun playing an implementation of the original Oregon Trail on my crappy 5 year old phone than I have had with this game.

I then get a random encounter that some of my crew became cyborgs and need fuel, I'm locked out of the option to try to not give them fuel because I don't have any crew to lose, so I lose all my fuel. So I activate SOS and wait to be rescued, my rescuer demands some of my hull for fuel, I only have 1 hull so my only option is get fuel so I can immediately blow up and lose the game.\n\nI know that's random chance stacking up to make a wierd story, which should be fun, except that I rarely had a choice in any of those situations and when I did have a choice it randomly decided to make things worse wether I won or lost.\n\nIs the game interesting to watch, a bit.

I now recommend this game though only if you enjoy the humour and slot machines)\n\nA lot of love went into creating this game, with it's nice artwork, and humour spread throughout which is why I originally backed this game on Kickstarter. However dispite the funny dialog and nice artwork I did not find the game enjoyable. The game plays out as a series events where you make decisions that all end with what is basically a slot machine, this results in a game where finishing a playthrough is based mostly on random chance.\n\nRight from the outset the game inadvertently teaches players not to make decisions on what would you do, but rather pick the decision that will give the best odds at the next slot machine meaning the decision isn't really a decision at all, the choice is taken away from you. This also means some players stop caring about reading the dialog as they no longer have any real choice as to how the event will play out and the dialog is one of the strongest elements of the game.\n\nWith the latest patches winning a playthrough no longer feels like the grind through a random generator and now I can enjoy the humour and style of the game much more. It is and always will remain a simplified slot machine game in fancy clothing, so if the funny scripts and the winning and losing at slot machines are not something you enjoy then you'll probably want to give this game a miss.","October 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

What's already there is a short, enjoyable bit of strategy. It's somewhat linear at this juncture, but a quick, easy play.

Granted, it is a lot of RNG and you need to get really lucky but I think the game is worth it (besides they are working on getting it a little less random). It is a "roll the dice" kind of game but a really good one at that.\n\nReally funny with great lines!","October 14, 2015","true","10.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

While I have not found the game difficult to "beat" as far as individual missions go, I do admit that I find it difficult to actually keep more than just the captain alive! So if you are looking for something ridiculously hard, this isnt it. If you are looking for a choice based, text descriptive, tongue and cheek, slap stick sense of humor riddled game that sets you up to fail rather than win, this is the way to go.\n\nThe animations give a good sense of the characters (usually silly), the randomness of events helps keeps things fresh every time, and the completely random little additions and deductions on stats based on your gameplay help even more.\n\nI would also like to add, that as a board gamer and ex-D&D splunker, I find the ability to see your ability modifiers affect your chances, and how the rolls go, to be a wonderful mechanic. It's a small thing, but I find it helps the occasionally 'slow' aspects of choice desicion to be rendered kind of fun!\n\nCan't wait for the next update!","August 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
