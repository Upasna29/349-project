However I feel compelled to put something here though it won't come close to doing this game justice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/327880/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Sublevel Zero is first person spaceship shooter, placed in a zero-gravity environment, full of enemies.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to fly in a large space base, kill enemies and grab the loot they drop. From the stuff you collected, you can also craft more things to make you progression easier.\n\nPros:    Controlling the Spaceship | Controlling feels smooth and very intuitive. You can make the ship go in any direction, which includes up, down, and spinning left and right (6DOF, Google it). There is also controller support, which might sound strange for a 6DOF game, but it controls the game just fine.\nMap | When you're flying through the passages and halls, while spinning in every direction possible, you soon lose track of where you even are. This game takes care of this with a very clear 3D map, which helps you travel the way you want.\nProcedural Generation | The world you fly in is procedurally generated, helping towards bigger replayability, so you won't get bored easily! I had quite a few hours of fun with this game and even if you complete it, it will feel just as fun the next time you play it.\nGraphics | I really like the way the world looks, sometimes it has pixel elements, sometimes polygons and sometimes it just looks cool with none of those.\nCrafting | You can also craft new weapons with the resources you collect. As you progress in the game, you unlock more crafting recipes for better and different weapons.\nSounds | Soundtrack is awesome, as well as all the sounds when you shoot, hit, open doors and other things. They sound kind of space-like and are great for keeping your ears busy.\nCons:    Mouse Locking | If you have two screens or more, you will have quite a few problems as you can click outside the game, which will minimize it. Not very pleasant, if you're in a middle of a fight.\nUnderstanding the Game | At the beginning, I literally had no clue what to do in this game. Explaining the goal of the game is not this game greatest side, although it does have a pretty good tutorial regarding controls, inventory and weapons.\nOS Support | I'm sad that I have to include this in so many of my reviews, but developers should really start supporting MacOS and SteamOS. It's made in Unity, so ports for both operating systems shouldn't be more than a click away ...\nThe final verdict:I loved this game, although I was pretty confused about its goals when I started playing it. 6DOF might feel a bit weird it you've never played a game like this before, but you'll get used to it and will find it enjoyable. A big plus is procedural generation of the world you fly in, ensuring big replayability.\nIf you're looking for a relatively cheap game with spaceships, shooting and flying around, this is a game for you.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dysiode/recommended/327880/","Dysiode","[KMod] Dysiode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dysiode/","1192 products in account","There's so much to love about Sublevel Zero.\nTL;DR: It looks amazing, plays amazing, sounds amazing, has an amazing developer team supporting it. There is some polish that's needed, but that's true of most games immediately after release. There's a lot to unpack so lets just dive right in.\n\nAestheticsSublevel Zero looks like what my memory of Descent is. As I've been playing the game I keep thinking to myself "wow, this looks so much like Descent just a little better" and then I went and played some Descent and it's amazing how much older it feels. Everything important has a color. Weapons and their ammo are color coordinated, enemies are colored to match their type, and while to start there sometimes feels like an overwhelming amount of color, you quickly learn to appreciate it.\n\nWhile it is an excellent upgrade to the Descent aesthetic in most ways, one significant downside is the enemies. They're no where near as distinct as Descent, they're little more than colored floating balls. You do get used to it quickly, but it would have been nice to see more character in the enemies.\n\nThere are some minor interface and usability tweaks I feel need to be made, like making it more clear what your cursor is selecting, and polishing the item comparions, but overall the interface stays out of your way.\n\nGameplayThere's so much to say about the gameplay. Much of it is difficult to explain. The map for example, they've managed to nail flying through the map in a way even Descent couldn't manage. It feels very natural and that's important because it's easy to get lost in randomly generated mines.\n\nThe core gameplay is a well polished 6DOF gameplay. The addition of crafting and rogue-like elements are nicely unobtrusive and don't get in the way of flying around DOF'ing everything in sight. The rogue-like bits are pretty standard; if you've played one rogue-like you've played them all. The weapons have a nice variety and most feel pretty punchy. Most weapons have some sort of inaccuracy which actually helps smooth out the combat. Even with a mouse DOF'ing all around isn't an exact science, so the weapon inaccuracy relieves some of the pressure on your flying.\n\nThe game also features one of the best control binding systems around. It recognzes and displays every controller Windows does and lets you select which one to use instantly. Key/axis binding is accurate and correctly filters false-positives by temporarily centering each axis before watching for an input. Each controller also comes with it's own set of bindings so it's easy to experiment with different control set ups (my personal favorite is using a Wiimote and Nunchuck to play. Check the guides for information on setting that up).\n\nThe menus are all fully-controllable via the keyboard which is a plesant niceity in generally, but especially nice for Wiimote controls.\n\nI don't really have anything bad to say gameplay wise.\n\nAudioThere's a pinned topic in the forums with a link to the soundtrack on Bandcamp. The album speaks for itself.\n\nOverall ScoreIt's hard to score because I'm biased towards 6DOF games. It's not perfect, but it's close enough that I think it's really earned a solid\n9/10\nAt this price I can't recommend it enough.","October 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

If you like me loved crawling the tunnels in those games you are going to love Sublevel Zero.\n\nUnlike Descent Sublevel Zero throws in a Rogue like twist to the Descent formula. Where as with Descent we had to download a community map for a change with Sublevel Zero simply firing up a new round includes completely different levels and a totally different experience.\n\nOn top of that the weapons are completely randomized. Two of the exact same weapon will have different stats, so one run you may be a sniper another you may be rocking laser shotguns.\n\nIf that wasnt awesome enough sublevel zero allows you to craft weapons by combining 2 different weapons into a hybridization of their former selves. This gives you a limitless amount of possibilities!\n\nI cant express enough how awesome this game is and it has my highest level of recommendation!\n\nMy full video review can be found here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqNJ_ypX1lo","October 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linker-error/recommended/327880/","linker-error","linkerError","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linker-error/","564 products in account","A love letter to Descent. Exellently done with smooth, tight controls and a bangin' chiptune ambient soundtrack, its a rewarding roguelike that demands cautious exploration, ammo conservation and deft mastery of the controls to dismantle the rogue bots and get to the reactor at the end of each level. Levels are a good length and an intentionally blocky texture theme combined with brain-meltingly awesome lighting system makes playing them enjoyable and nostalgic.\n\nDespite these accolades, Sublevel Zero needs work in a few minor areas. Specifically, there's no thief bot, and there's a major lack of variety with regards to hull upgrades. There are no energy recharge stations (which was the primary benefit of generally weaker energy weapons). An autolevel control would be nice instead of hiding it in the menu and having it be always on or off. Also an irritating omission: complete lack of D-pad controls for the menu/UI system. It would also be nice if there were a way to recycle useless junk for nanites. There are also no secret doors or areas, which is a disappointment (or are there?!?). Finally, I know that this is a single player game. But come ON guys. Let's release a multiplayer DLC for this. It's practically begging for it.\n\nAs an interesting side note, the game also accomplishes the hilarious feat of demonstrating exactly how terribly designed Descent's levels were, as the random generation engine in this game routinely churns out better levels than Descent did.\n\nAll in all, aside from a few minor blemishes and missed opportunities, this game is a perfect translation of Descent into a roguelike format. If you're a fan of these types of games, Sublevel Zero simply shouldn't be missed. I think this might also appeal to you if you enjoy flight sims or first person shooters. Some people just wanna run around with a gun, but if floating around a zero-g envrionment shooting endless hordes of robots with ever-more-powerful weapons sounds fun to you, I encourage you to give Sublevel Zero a try.","October 10, 2015","true","5.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Fight, or die. Sublevel Zero brings back the old feels of DOS days and Descent. This game combines everything you love about 6DOF and Roguelikes in a combo as awesome since peanut butter and jelly. Sublevel Zero gives you procedurally generated levels, random loot drops, and plenty of difficulty. However, all that aside what makes Sublevel Zero enjoyable is the combat. If you didn't like Descent or games of it's nature, there really isn't much more to see here. While I am a huge fan of Descent and 6DOF games, even I will admit that there is times the game can become nauseating. Certain areas are also very bright and can be blinding at times. These are minor gripes though in a fantastic title that is extremely well put together. The controls are rebindable, combat is intense, and crafting can lead to some interesting play sessions. Graphically I enjoyed the game, It looks smooth and the environments don't get dull or repetitive. When you do zoom in or get really close to an enemy though you can tell it has some pixels going on but it's done in a fashion that is visually pleasing. The sound effects are fantastic and music is enjoyable, even if I didn't notice it when I was in intense dogfights. So get in a fighter, strap in, and get ready to save the universe, because its time to kick some space butt!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/AygOtehYxNk\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 14, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Brings back fond memories of the mechanics of the Descent series (before Freespace), but with it's own unique take on the 6DoF (6 degrees of freedom) genre. The feel of the movement and combat is just right, and the game strikes a perfect balance of high speed action and item/resource management of an roguelike rpg. The game rewards skill greatly, and encourages you to conserve your ammo and use each of the many weapon types to their maximum effectiveness. Repair kits are uncommon, and take up vital (and limited) inventory space, so crucial decisions must be made about what to keep and what to leave behind. There is also a surprisingly deep crafting element, allowing you to combine weapons, hulls, and ship components to create new ones. These items, especially weapons and hulls, can dramatically alter your playstyle.\n\nThere are many types of weapons of various rarities, each with their mechanics, playstyles, and ammo types. There are ballistic (shotguns, minguns, railguns, etc), plasma (big 'ol energy "globs", flamethrower) , energy (lasers, bolts), missiles (dumbfire, homing, "grenades", etc), "dart" (wolfpack missiles, cluster rockets, swarms), and "advanced" (gravity missiles, crazy stuff). Each weapon rolls various modifiers when it drops, affecting its properties damage, rate, accuracy, etc). All of the weapons can also be crafted with others to form new ones, though the more powerful "recipes" require that you unlock/find a blueprint first. Crafted weapons are often quite different, especially mechanically, from their "ingredients". This leads to a wide diversisty of emergent playstyles depending on what weapons you are able to craft. Also, crafted weapons are affected by the modifiers of its ingredients, so holding onto early drops with "great stats" is a viable decision if you want to craft something awesome later on.\n\nThere are also several different types of ship hulls and components. Like weapons, these roll various prefixes which affect their stats (speed, boot, ramming damage, etc). Hulls can also significantly affect your armor, primary, and secondary weapon capacity. Completely new additional ships can also be unlocked by completing various tasks over the course of your playthroughs.\n\nThe graphics are excellent for this game. The corridors and tunnels look great, and the action is quite smooth. The lighting effect on weapons fire makes tracking enemy projectiles easy (though evading all of them may be another thing altogether). There are many interesting enemy designs, with different, color-coded variations of them equiped with different weapons. The color coding makes it easy to identify at a glance which variant you are facing, which is crucial when dealing with them.\n\nThe sound effects and music are great. The soundtrack in particular is excellent. The composer is currently offering his album on bandcamp, which I happily purchased recently. It is a combination of pulse pounding electronic, chiptune, and orchestra. Each track is fantastic in its own right, and is dynamically altered depending on the situation (exploring, fighting, etc). I espeically like the track "Chain Reaction" when it shifts to the base/synth heavy 'combat' variation. Do yourself a favor and by his soundtrack!\n\nThis game is a must have for anyone who enjoys a 6DoF shooter, in the likes of Descent or Forsaken. It is not a "Descent/Forsaken Clone" nor does it claim to be. It *IS* an amazing 6DoF game with its own unique style and gameplay mechanics that stands out as an excellent example of this genre in its own right.\n\nFinal verdict:   Buy This Already! / 10","October 12, 2015","true","15.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Sublevel Zero is easily one of the top games in this genre.\n\nHowever, this is not just a 6DoF... it is also a Hardcore and a Roguelike.  There are no savepoints you can reload endlessly from, and the levels are randomly generated every time you play.\n\nThere is progression to the game, and that progression is in the form of unlocks.  Admitedly, the unlocking system is very user-unfriendly, and it is difficult to determine what you have unlocked or what there is left to unlock.  However, the best advice I can give is to play and experiment... craft whatever you can at first, and eventually you will start unlocking things.\n\nOnce you unlock the tier 3 weapons, this game become awesome.  The weapons feel powerrful and meaningful, but the enemies you face are still very dangerous, requiring skill and strategy to overcome.\n\nThere are a wide number of achievements that give this game some artificial replayability, and at first this turned me off.  However, the presence of the development team continuing to add content and variety drew me back, and now I regularly play and speedrun the game, having all but one achievement... the one requiring you to die 100 times. :D  I think I'm happy with NOT having that one. :)\n\nOverall, a great entry into the 6DoF field.

The random level generation basically left you with few alternate paths to follow and most of them went to the same place, making the game feel linear. The enemies were varied with many different styles of attack, but it can be tough to tell them apart at a distance where it matters for combat. And even the crafting system is too vast for the length of the game due to how often you will use it and sometimes the odds of getting the materials to make anything at all.\n\nI could not in all honesty call this game bad. It isn’t. It just suffers from really not being enough on way too many fronts, and as such falling short of greatness on all of them. The result being a game that isn’t terrible but isn’t really good either. Rather it is a game that gets too repetitive before you finish it.\n\nAnd yet, it is also a game that genuinely leaves me hopeful for the developer behind it, as I could clearly see a lot of good ideas while it could keep my attention. In short, I can not recommend this game, but if the developer would make a sequel and refine the ideas here, they may have something truly great on their hands next time.","April 1","false","8.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

This is the closest game I've found aside from Descent itself.  This may wind up being a spirital successor to Descent more than Descent Underground.\n\nGraphics: 10/10 - Not the best out there but runs super smooth and the retro style is done perfectly.  The retro style is done so well it scores high on graphics in my opinion.  Fancy graphics with high polygon count doesn't mean it's the best.  Never ever have had framerate dips.\n\nGameplay:  10/10 - Fair warning this game is HARD, really HARD.  But I love it.  The game makes every enemy kill just so rewarding as you get the little buit of ammo, new weapon, or armor kit to keep going.  The intestity of knowing if you die you start over is thrilling!  The game is like a typical rougelike as it gives you perks that stick after each attmept or playthrough.  The controls are super resposive which indeed a plus for a game of this difficulty and intensity.\n\nMusic - 11/10 - The music is some of the best I have heard in a long time and suits the game very will.  It's a combo of modern music and chip tunes and is done perfectly.  The chip tunes are subtle and the music intensifies during combat.\nThe soundtrack is a must buy if you are a music lover for the pure art of it.  It's available on Bandcamp if you'd like to pick it up for $7.64.\n\nFeatures - 5/10 - This is where the game will lose some points with me.  Some of the best parts about Descent was the multiplayer and this game lacks it all together.  If they add Deathmatch and co-op campaign this game would be perfect.\n\nReplayability - 10/10 - Replayability is is endless.  The levels are randomized through every playthrough.  Only the level boss and their rooms remain the same.  With the gathering of perks as you go along you could play this a very long time.  The difficulty will keep you coming back for more, if you love hard games that is.\n\nFinal score: 9/10 - This is a gem of a little indie game that is worth every penny of the $15 it costs.  If it had multiplayer I'd be giving it a 10/10 hands down!!!","October 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a fun environment to fly around in. I love the glowy art style and the variations in environments and enemies.\n\nMy first impression, after about 3 1/2 hours, is that I should have paid $30 for this, but I paid $12.74.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/327880/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also reviewed this game on YouTube.\n\nThis is a brilliant mash-up of Rogue-like game play mechanics, mixed with the 6 degrees of freedom movement of old school titles like Descent. You progress through randomly generated levels, fighting enemies and collecting loot along the way, with the goal of destroying the core at the end of each level to collect a piece of a special engine you need for your ship. Unlike Descent, you don't have to escape the level after destroying the core. Some Descent fans may think this a big omission but I think it's a smart idea in this game, simply because it's already quite challenging and with permadeath, having to restart a whole level because you didn't get out in time would be a bummer.\n\nThere are various kinds of weapons and ship upgrades available and variants for each (though not as many as I would like) and you can also use a rudimentary crafting system to fuse items you've already picked up together into other items. It's a smart system and it's simplistic enough that it's not overwhelming and doesn't detract from the fast-paced flow of the main game. Each type of weapon has its own ammo and you can run out so you're required to plan your strategies carefully in terms of both combat and inventory management, especially in later levels.\n\nNavigating the levels can sometimes be tricky but Sublevel Zero has one of the best designed 3D maps in the history of video games. Unlike Descent, whose map was often confusing, this one is very straight forward and makes it a snap to find out where you are, where you've been and where you need to go. I never got lost for more than 30 seconds in this game because of the map and it's much better for that.\n\nSublevel Zero has a voxel-like look, though I don't think it is actual voxels. It looks great, with popping colours and nice lighting, accompanied by a simple but fitting soundtrack. Combat sounds are also punchy and intense.  Though it lacks the inertia system that Descent had, the controls feel tight and responsive. It can also scale down to run decently on even low-end machines.\n\nLike any good Rogue-like, it's super tough but also fair. I never felt cheated when I died, even several levels in. I'm not a huge Rogue-like fan but I love this game because it blends it so well with mechanics from Descent, a game I loved back in the day. I HIGHLY recommend it!","October 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyravega/recommended/327880/","lyravega","lyravega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyravega/","474 products in account","Watching a video of this game immediately reminded me of the old Descent series. So I decided to give it a try. And I am glad that I have done so.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth. However you may not get the hang of the controls immediately as you have 6-dof (degrees of freedom)[upload.wikimedia.org]. If you are an old Descent player (or still playing it), trichording is a thing with some engines. If you don't know what it means, the amount of trichording affects your top speed depending on the number of axes you are moving about. There is a maximum turning rate of your ship; it may feel like negative mouse acceleration, but it isn't. When you get used to them, a great game awaits you.\n\nGraphics, music and the sound effects all go well together, and suits the game. Good chiptune accompanies you on your journey. Graphics are kept "minimalistic" on purpose, but I think it serves the game well as this game isn't one of those games where you need graphics to convince you that you are in a -insert theme- environment.\n\nProgression wise, you level up and pick nanocart upgrades between levels (perks, much like Nuclear Throne for example), gather loot, and spend your earnings on crafting. Levels are procedurally generated, meaning that every game will be different. You also unlock different ships (characters) to begin the game with, and also unlock more crafting recipes as you keep playing the game.\n\nYou can equip 2 primary and 2 secondary weapons, and can swap / craft different equipment to tailor the ship you are piloting to your own preference. The quality of the loot you get varies, and the crafted equipment inherits the average quality of the base items. Your inventory is limited however, first few games you may feel that it is very limited, but as you find weapons that you like the most, you'll know what to keep and what to discard immediately. Your ship itself is also a weapon; you can ram enemy ships, however it is a bit risky as the enemies you destroy explode, and often deal much more damage than you'd expect, so you need to ram and run.\n\nEnemies vary in difficulty, and after a few encounters you will know how to deal with them, or where to deal with them. Procedural generation links some chunks with tunnels, and trying to deal with a close-combatant in those tunnels may cost you dearly for example. Bosses in the game are stationary, however don't let that fool you, as they might start shooting lasers everywhere or summon some reinforcements.\n\nSome of the level chunks are a little bit cramped at the first levels, however it opens up on the later levels. One of the developers has already stated that s/he is working on new level chunks to address this problem as well, so I don't think it'll be an issue for long. You may lose your bearings (or it is just me) from time to time, but the map is very functional for a 3D map, and very useful as it helps you find your way easily.\n\nOne thing I hate about this game is, you can only save between levels - if you continue but then quit the game before finishing that level, you won't be able to continue. Aside from that, I have no complaints. Overall, a great game. If you like Rogue-lite games and/or old Descent games, then this might be a great addition in your library.","October 12, 2015","true","16.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

To make up to the increased difficulty, the player can gather weapons and ship subsystems dropped by the enemies and use it on their own ship, as well as ammunition, ship repair units and "nanites", that is the "currency" used to craft a new item starting from two you already own -- for example, a pulsar energy weapon and an autocannon can be crafted into a minigun.\n\nThe idea is very simple, yet highly entertaining. It feels fresh each time you start a new game as each dungeon is procedurally generated and therefore it's something like you have never played before. Again, I cannot stress this enough: this is a hard game. A really hard one like I haven't seen in years... but it has that charm that makes you come back for more again and again.\n\nOne special mention goes to the soundtrack, written by Will Bedford: it is a marvelous blend of chiptune and orchestral music, and really fits the atmosphere of Sublevel Zero!\n\nThe game is currently available for Windows only but should get builds for both Linux and Mac shortly.\n\nWould I change something about it? Yes, there is definitely some room for impovement: crafting should more varied and worthwhile by adding additional features/characteristics to the weapons and ship subsystems, so that we can get more crafting possibilities; moreover, please let us recycle unused items into nanites that could be used for something else!\n\nMy vote: 9 / 10.","October 24, 2015","true","14.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The "Crafting system" (really combining some pairs of weapons)  is a little confusing.\n\nBeyond that, this does 6DOF flight incredibly well. The first time (including descent) where I could actually follow where I was in the level, and move where I wanted to. Part of this is careful level generation, and part of it is subtle righting of orientation and inertia. It works incredibly well.\n","March 18","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

I don't know what's wrong with you. You probably thought Godfather Part 3 wasn't a complete debacle. shudder\n\nSublevel Zero is Descent, without the vertigo. And Guidebot. And the awesome heavy metal soundtrack. But, and this is definitely the most important, without the vetigo. Oh, and the levels are generated on the fly. And much brighter. All the goodies that you find - random. Mechanically, the game is smooth as satin. The graphics are blocky as of this review, and I don't care.  If you played Descent with a mouse and keyboard... well, I suppose you can do the same with this. I play with twin-stick game pad, and it's intuitive. Like, Cordelia Chase intuitive. There is a story that's briefly explained in the beginning sequence. If you're familiar with EVE Online or Warhammer 40k lore, it will sound familiar.\n\nThere's a crafting system. You collect Nanites (denoted by a big "N" in your inventory screen) from destroyed enemies. These Nanites are used in conjunction with components, usually two weapons, to craft a new, possibly more badass weapon. I've only beaten the first level so far. But there is a sort of perk system, where after a level (or the first level, at least), you may select from one of three Nanocarts. Each Nanocart can offer you a different perk, such as augmented damage, or more Nanites per pickup, etc. They are only good for the current playthrough. Speaking of which, if you get 'sploded, there goes your progress. If you choose to restart, you will do so at Sublevel Zero - which is the first level. And beating a level takes you to the next subsequent Sublevel of your journey - your descent[/b], if you will.\n\nReally, though, this game is a serious homage to Descent. And I love it for that. The price tag is another reason to love it. I got it on sale, but I would have payed the whole whopping $14.99 for this. My only complaint is no Guidebot. I loved that little dude.","October 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Infinite replayability and looting system, yeap, Descent and Diablo had a baby and its coming for your soul... and your free time. I played other Descent like games but none got the gameplay so right as this game. If you are skilled you can defeat any odds. The game gets you hooked as you can dodge almost any attack while severely punishing mistakes. The same addictive feeling as Dark souls where you can go against any number of enemies if you have the skills and still win. Enemies drop loot and you can combine various drops to get even more powerfull items. Thus the natural incentive to gather all loot and keep it just in case you can craft something with it. Alas inventory space is limited and every item takes up 2 "medikit" slots so you have to choose between an items or being able to heal twice. Only one complaint though... Descent had tight corridors like this game but also had large open spaces something which is lacking from this game. But I guess they can still improve on it.\nReplayability comes not only from the randomly generated levels but also from the perma death. Once you die you stay dead and have to start over. Replayability is also enhanced as the loot you get is also different every time and you have to adapt your play style to the loot you get. Some playthroughs are charge in and unload your shotgun and others are all about sniping your enemies from far away or saturate a room with missiless.\nNice game all around. Can't wait for a multiplayer for it. Definetly worth the price though.","October 9, 2015","true","18.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The random generation of the levels basically gives you unlimited new experiences since the map is never the same.  It has excellent roguelike elements in it and you do unlock new blueprints and ship variations so you do gain something from your deaths.\n\nGraphics/Sound:\nThe game is full of charm.  The graphics have a retro "pixelated texture" quality to them but they are simultaneously crisp with all the modern particles and lighting effects you could ask for.  They fit the game perfectly.  The 8 bit soundtrack has a very chill quality to it, and I found myself switching to a controller and kicking back with a cup of coffee to go along with it.\n\nGameplay:\nIT takes a couple attempts to get the hang of the menus/weapon types/ammo/crafting system, but the overall learning curve for me was less than 30 minutes.  On my third playthrough I had already reached the final room of sublevel 4.  I had been playing so safely and sniping turrets with my super laser gauss cannon, but I lost focus for a moment and burst into the room.  You see, the game messes with your head.  You want to stay safe and dodge behind doors especially when you are coming into a new room and you don't know what is lurking around the corner, but if you snipe something from the doorway you want to get to its location quickly to pick up the nano bits and powerups because you need all the resources you can get to craft that sweet new weapon.  So I charged in to grab the nano bits from 3 turrets I had killed and got wrecked by the core.  Oh well, time to start again.  I'm really curious to see what happens once I clear sublevel 5, and the game is so much fun to play you don't mind dying and starting over.  Every playthrough you get different weapons with different stats, play different levels etc.  The enemies have the solid AI that you expect from a Descent-like game. Its not quite on Descent 3 level, but honestly we are in 2015 and that game still has some of the best AI ever seen in gaming.\n\nSummary:\nThis is a very fun and seamless marriage of the 6DOF fun of the early descent games and the replayability and progression system of a good roguelike.  Before I bought this game I read reviews that criticized the crafting system but honestly it is a blast and I feel like my new weapons are exciting and powerful.  There is no doubt in my mind that this game was lovingly crafted by individuals who played and understood what made the single player portion of the original descent games fun.  I can already tell that this will become my go to game when I just want to kick back and have some fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 6DOF.  At 15 bucks its a good value - on sale its even better.","October 8, 2015","true","6.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You might need to do something similar if using a joystick.\n\nGameplay: it's solid. Pretty basic and arcady, but it feels good and being a long-time Descent player it wasn't hard to get a hold of with a few setting tweaks. I felt right at home.

There's permadeath so if you die or decide to quit during before the end of each level you have to start over.\n\nThe visual style is solid but being able to identify the glowing bots againts some of the glowing backgrounds can get tricky at times. I felt that incorporating specular and emit components to the pixel art textures brought it all to life in a way I haven't seen before. That with the colorful and well-placed light made for a very unique Tron-like feel.\n\nThe music is absolutely fantastic. Will Bedford specializes in orchestral music and did a great job mixing cinematic with chiptune elements. I'm not a fan of chiptune but he totally made it work here. It's subtle.

Best part of the game.\n\nI'm expecting the game to grow and have more meat on it as time goes on. There's not a whole lot of different room types and the levels, even though they are random, are pretty linear in their layout with the occational branch to it. These levels are not maze-like. The rooms could be bigger and allow for some better dogfighting. The bots are varied and interesting. Some bots will try to ram you, some have scatter shot or a charge-up sniper shot. Some bots try to blind you. The bots here feel more varied than the bots in Descent II. As with pretty much all rouge-likes, I'm going to expect to see updates with more randomly generated content to pull from as the game gets updated\n\nIn short, very faithful Descent-like game, definitely the best one I've played, and I've played quite a few and this is the only Descent clone that didn't dissapoint me. I recommend buying it so you can throw money at these guys so the game can be expanded.

Each level typically features one or two new enemy types, to the point where at the end you're fighting all sorts of enemies at once.\n\nThe enemy variety is one of SLZ's main strengths - each different enemy is instantly recognisable from its shape and colour, and each poses a unique threat, from the green drones with shotgun-like blasts to the little sniper guys that focus on hit and run attacks. With a bit of practice, you'll be entering rooms and making tactical choices for how to win each fight on the fly.\n\nEnemies drop weapons, engines and hulls. Each of these can be crafted together to make new weapons - combine an impact laser with an autocannon and you'll make a railgun, for example. Some of the results are initially underwhelming, but the top tier weapons are really, really powerful. You'll have to learn what weapons work best for you.\n\nA final piece of the gameplay is nanocarts - you'll get to pick an upgrade at the end of each stage, often with a trade off: higher damage in exchange for a reduced fire rate, for example.\n\nSLZ nails the feeling of 6DOF movement - you'll be gliding about the levels effortlessly in no time if you're familiar with the Descent series. With a decent number of unlockables, there's good replay value here.\n\nFlaws? Well, many of the nanocarts are a bit underwhelming so far. There's been a few occasions I didn't want to take any of them at the end of a stage. There's a few too many long dead ends and forced backtracking as a result of locked doors. A bit more variety in the environments would be welcome. And the balance is skewed heavily favouring hitscan weapons in the later stages. But the developer is active on the forums, and updates are promised so I'm sure all of this will be rectified.","October 13, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/recommended/327880/","Cream-of-Plenty","Cream-of-Plenty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/","187 products in account","Sublevel Zero is one of the most enjoyable 6DoF games you've probably never heard of.\n\nIts inspirations are immediately obvious, right down to your ship's appearance--this is Descent by way of roguelite.  The execution is simple:  Alone, you pilot your ship 6-levels deep into a procedurally-generated asteroid base (dungeon), collecting intel and items while fighting robotic opponents.  True to form, if you die, you have to start all over.\n\nThere are a few interesting additions to the recipe, however.  For instance, weapons have a characteristic-naming system that affects their stats.  So you won't just find a "Laser", you'll find a "Chaotic Laser", a "Useless Laser", a "Razor Laser", etc.  Each quality tends to modify weapons and items in certain ways, but there's also enough randomness to the system that small differences can even be found between two identically named weapons.\n\nShip customization comes in the form of hulls (re: "armor" in another roguelike) and engines (...something other than armor).  Hulls can be swapped out on the fly in order to modify how much stuff--both items and ammo--you can carry, as well as your hitpoints; engines can be swapped out to change movement, boost, and ramming stats.  This whole system sits on top of your choice of 8* ships that basically act like classes, so there's a decent amount of variety in the ships you can end up with.  *You only start off with access to 1 ship, however.\n\nBut perhaps the most unexpected gameplay mechanic--something I didn't realize when I started playing--is that Sublevel Zero has a crafting system.  As you play, you unlock crafting options that allow you to combine weapons or items into new things.  The whole system is fairly opaque--it's not always easy to tell HOW or WHY you unlocked a certain recipe--but it's a pretty interesting feature that produces an extensive arsenal including flamethrowers, lasers, miniguns, rocket launchers, pulsars, homing missiles, grenades, and autocannons.  The individual characteristics and stats of each weapon/item seem to influence the final product, too, so you might have greater success sacrificing "Berserker" or "Savage" items instead of "Slow" or "Useless" items.\n\nSo is it challenging?  For a roguelite, I'd say that Sublevel Zero can definitely put up a fight.  Repair kits are relatively uncommon, occupy an item slot (a big deal when the basic ship only has 12 inventory slots) and take time to work.  The first level may be inhabited by slow and ponderous robots that are easy to outmaneuver, but it isn't long before the game is throwing nimble, twirling, machinegunning drones, bumrushing drillbots, and worse at you.  Ammo (or lack thereof) can be an issue too, emphasizing diversifying your arsenal and spending nanites (space gold) wisely on your upgrades.\n\nA few cons:\n\n1.  No vibration support for gamepads\n2.  I haven't unlocked all of the ships yet, but everything so far is aesthetically identical to the default ship.  It'd be nice if they looked different.\n3.  No Descent-style "Guide Bot" to help navigate the increasingly large sprawls of later levels.\n4.  No secret areas.\n\nI can't exactly say that the roguelike/roguelite market is packed with 6DoF games, which makes Sublevel Zero a refreshing installment in an otherwise saturated genre.  If you've been looking for something that scratches that Descent/Forsaken itch, this game might be just what you need.","January 13","true","7.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was instantly placed in my favorites. It combines so many elements in a way that is not completely overwhelming. Whithin 15 minutes, I was able to wrap my head around the game in such a way that I felt more confident with each run. It requires skill but also strategy as you have a limited inventory and must use the items you find to craft more powerful items.\n\nMy only complaint is that ramming (as in driving your ship into an enemy) seems to be required in certain places. With weapons, You get a readout of how much damage you are doing to an enemy in the form of text above their head. This gives you a decent idea of how much damage you are doing. When it comes to ramming, not only is it disorienting, but i've found it hard to determine exactly how much damage and how many instances of damage are being done.\n\nI'm sure that it will come with time, but holy christ, I cannot stop playing this game.","October 10, 2015","true","12.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The 3D controls are extremely slick and responsive and surprisingly intuitive (though descending should be remapped to SHIFT and turbo to something else, as I eventually remapped it this way and it immediately felt a lot better). The minimalist art style is executed very well and is very appealing to the eyes, while the near-excessive use of outer glow effects makes everything feel more graphically detailed and sci-fi, though I couldn't appreciate much of it because I was running the game on a Surface Pro 3 with no GPU, so I had to set the game to the lowest resolution and minimum render distance, and to turn off volumetric lighting (where it ran reasonably well). The soundtrack is also solid; most people seem to really love it, but I just think it's solid, but that's just my (picky) taste and you'll likely enjoy it more than I did. Overall—and most importantly—the game is just downright fun; flying around and blowing up bots is just immensely satisfying and the gameplay is just all around extremely fun.\nCons:\nI beat the game on my third try after only 6 hours of gameplay. For a roguelite, that's pretty much no time flat (after years, I'm still trying—and failing—to beat Teleglitch: Die More Edition). This is partially because the game is just stupidly easy, except for the boss fights when the game abruptly and arbitrarily amps up the difficulty to outrageous levels just to suddenly f--- you over without warning (especially for the final boss, which was just utterly ridiculous). However, the rest of the game is just ridiculously easy, primarily because it's unbalanced in particular ways, primarily because certain playstyles are totally superior to others even when the game seems to be trying to say you can play whichever way you please. In particular, 1) the game likes to give you the choice between using high DPS weapons like miniguns and low Rate of Fire/high Damage & Accuracy weapons like impact rifles, but high Damage & Accuracy weapons are strictly superior and using high DPS weapons will certainly get you killed because they miss very frequently, rapidly burn through your ammo, and do minimal damage, 2) the game gives you limited inventory space and forces you to balance carrying repair kits versus craftable items (weapons and engines and such), but you really just need to use all of your inventory space carrying repair kits, and you can generally get through the game crafting d---- near nothing at all by living off the loot drops, which utterly bypasses the crafting mechanic the game clearly wanted you to use even though it’s actually pointless and costly, 3) the game tries to pressure you with limited ammo but allows you to ram enemies as a way to melee them without spending ammo, but ammo’s never really an issue (if you’re using high Damage/Accuracy weapons) and ramming will certainly get you killed, meaning that, again, the game clearly wanted ramming and ammo management to be a significant gameplay element even though it should be ignored if not totally avoided.\nUnfortunately, the game is also very superficial, initially seeming to have a wide array of different ways to play, ships and weapons to unlock, and items to craft, but very quickly you realize you don’t need any of that: particular playstyles are entirely superior to others that will get you killed, I personally beat the game using the standard ship and only the same 3 basic weapons I picked up on the second level (and I hadn’t even unlocked any new weapons yet), and crafting is utterly negligible when you can pick up almost everything you need off of loot. On top of that, the maps quickly very feel similar (if not identical) and blur into one contiguous texture of the same dozen spaceship interiors, lava caves, and crystal caves over and over again, despite the procedural map generation, making this the first time I’ve ever seen procedural/dynamic level generation fail to add replayability to a game (which was extremely surprising).\nAnd for this shallow game with minimal replayability (at least for a roguelite), you have the privilege of paying $15 (the equivalent of 15 iPhone/iPad apps). While I certainly don’t regret it, I do feel that the price is a tad steep for its meager amount of content, though the absolutely fun and incredibly satisfying gameplay certainly makes up for what the game lacks in content (which can certainly be expanded in future updates and/or DLCs too).\nConclusion:\nAs of right now, with its slim amount of content, minimal replayability, and glaring gameplay unbalances, I can’t recommend it at a price of $15; it simply isn’t worth that when I know I could probably have a similar amount of fun playing a very good flash game for free (though finding that flash game in the first place may cost me $15 in time).\nHowever, I’m not saying that you shouldn’t buy this game or that it’s a bad game; quite the opposite, it’s actually a fantastic little game, it’s just too overpriced for me to be able to recommend it. That said, if you can get it during a flash sale or after it potentially gets expanded with updates/DLCs/expansions, it’s totally worth it, and I guarantee you won’t regret it.\nP.S. The story/plot/backstory/whatever is pretty much negligible; so much so that I nearly forgot to write anything about it in this review.","October 20, 2015","false","6.2"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","30","56","0","0"

It is really well nailed, really tight and fortunately this game follows up on that by giving me a depth of reasons and excuses to keep exploring: later levels having new tougher enemies, new environmental hazards to interact with, unlocks and upgrade choices (that often adversely effect something else), a developing crafting system.  There are also (and least interestingly) findable text logs that allude to the storyline.  All of this feeds into giving you a strong motivation to continue that original gameplay loop that is so satisfying and forms a very tight and efficient experience -considering in 4-5 hours I'm usually not out of the tutorial in a AAA style game.\n\nThe moment to moment enjoyment can also be at whatever speed suits you and takes place through randomised/ procedural levels.  Personally I like to creep through the hulks quite slowly and it's a suitably atmospheric place to do so.  There is a feel of System Shock old school horror I really like, as well as something even older (Driller or Mercenary).\n\nThe length of the levels so far hasn't become so involved that I feel lost and unable to cope, yet remains challenging and interesting.  The mapping tool is fantastically designed and readable which also helps to keep you right should you need to view it.\n\nThe loot system is varied and fun - quickly you find guns that suit you that you try and collect parts for.  That gives a more memorable structure and a narrative to a particular run: often I compromise which weapons I might want to use against realistically which do I need to keep going to have weapons of different ammunition feeds available.  I like how decisive and different the weapons feel too.\n\nEnemies are quite varied, as you get further in prepare to be sniped, shotgun zerg rushed, booby trapped and ambushed by floating ships, tanks and mounted turrets (sometimes around corners you never saw grr).  This part of the game makes me feel like I'm doing CBT drill, clearing out and securing rooms, and the additional physical dimension adds to the challenge.  The tension and release cycle is satisfying and after battles I typically find myself counting bullets and checking my health.\n\nGraphically and sonically it's also wonderfully evocative.\n\nMy game of the year already - I absolutely adore it.","October 14, 2015","true","30.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your chances of survival are directly conected to your skill and reaction to the bullet hell this game can and will become.\n\nSmooth and engaging gameplay within really well put out random generated levels. Though the labyrinthic layout can make you lost and disoriented at times, the 3D, navigable map system is there for you, and will certaintly help you. The soundtrack is great and very atmospheric, though sometimes i personally feel like it outstays its welcome.\n\nAfter each run, new recipes, Nanocards (passive upgrades, obtainable after each level, after a certain amount of nanites are obtained) and starting ship designs can be unlocked, but require certain actions to be done or statistics to be reached.\n\n\nAs of this review its been less than a week it has launched, and i've found my fair share of bugs.\nWhat i've found so far:\n- Once, as i overheated my boost the second i entered a portal to the next stage, as soon as it loaded, i found myself completely unable to move. Hopefully this will be fixed.\n- Whenever i enter and leave the map, the HUD meter for primary and secondary weapons goes as if empty, though the ammo count is correct, and when i switch weapons it fixes itself.\n- This one is probably not a bug, but while in the second boss, whenever it shoots and its projectiles hit a crystal which is in the way in one of the entrances to its section of the chamber its in, it creates a really bright, obnoxious flare, which essentially blocks my field of view, making me almost unable to see its other projectiles.\n\nIf i had a critique, it would be that there could be either a larger variety of weapon modifiers, or even more weapons by themselves. The runs i had so far, for various levels i've used the same weapons. While i've not unlocked every weapon so far, the unlocks are for new recipes, and i havent seem to have gotten them so far as drops from enemies or chests.\n\nIt's a fun, solid game, I definitely recommend it as is, to anyone looking for a fps roguelike experience. 8.5/10","October 14, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After the second, I beat it - and I was HOOKED. I find myself playing it over and over again, trying to unlock each new type of ship and weapon.\n\nNow, it does annoy me that I have to take extensive time to compare my inventory to a crafting guide, and that slows down my game a lot. It further annoys me that I do not know what unlocks I currently have available - so when I spend my hard-earned nanites on weapons/engines/hulls that are needed for a recipe I don't know yet, you can imagine how annoyed I am!\n\nThe music is phenomial. A pleasure to listen to while zipping about and unloading my ammo stores, changing as I play and move in and out of combat.\n\nI have killed myself several times at maximum HP with a single misfiring of a grenade or missile. There are unlocks that let you do less damage to yourself but I felt this aspect was unnessarily harsh to new players.\n\nNow all that's needed is co-op.\n\nI will say this, though: The Ion Cannon and the Welding Beam are AWFUL!!!! Piddling damage and, in the case of the Welding Beam, it's a very, very, VERY short range.

Being Older and wiser i thought that kind of game is nothing for my old bones. But to my surprise 6DOF shooters are like riding a bike, once you learned the controls it all comes back. And with our age comes wisdom and better 3Dimensional skills.\n\nSo its all in all a very enjoyable experience. The adrenaline rush you get by shredding through enemies is quite something. This is that kind of game that is going to stay A LONG TIME on my HDD.\n\nHOWEVER its a Rougelite...and in my opinion the Permadeath hurts the game. Having to start all over once u are dead is just uneccesary. Let me retry the Level and let me keep at least ONE item in my inventory..but no. The whole crafting aspect is neat, but its really pointless since death can come at every corner and then you start again from scratch. The asthetics are GREAT. It is quite the looker without creating too much level design confusion. All in All i guess anybody who had a good time with Descent will most certainly have a good time with this game. If you have never played something like this before. Give it a shot.

Ramming is basically useless because enemies explode when killed.. annoyances, but not game-breakers.\n\nIn later levels it starts to be a bit of a jerk - spawning rooms full of homing mines and the like.. to say nothing of the boss rooms.. the last one in particular is just a case of a giant "♥♥♥♥ you" and shows a brute-force approach to creating a climax.\n\nCrafting isn't bad, but the super-limited inventory means until you work out how it works (and what weapons you hate - i'm looking at you, homing missiles) you waste too much time managing your tiny inventory. In general two items of the same type and tier combine to make the next tier up. If you know what goes with what, it's a non-issue. There's also some limitations due to unlockable blueprints, which seems unnecessary - but the game lacks in unlockables of note.\n\nAlso it has Rift support, which is neat... though i'd keep a bucket handy...","January 28","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've only gone through the tutorial so will update this review sometime in the future once I've got further into the game\n\nJust wanted to pop in to say I purchased the game tonight, gave it a try and was very impressed.  Although I'm not certain the 8bit mincraft look is appreciated as well in VR, I can't deny it works very well and does give the sublevel zero world a charm of it's own.  Kudos on taking the time to give this game a story mode, with a clear purpose on what I need to do and why.  The story doesn't sound complex nor does it need to be,  but very nice to have one.\n\nThe game is fun to play and as this is a cockpit type game, works very well in VR.  I was concerned the 6DOF would cause me some nausea issues but so far I'm doing ok, perhaps I'm finally getting my VR legs under me! ;).  The controls work well, using an xbox 360 controller seemed to do the job properly.  I may end up adjusting the stick sensitivity down a bit, but I'll look into the options later but it works as is.  combat so far is against the "grunts" so very samey but as this is the initial tutorial phase I'm giving it a pass with the understanding there are varied opponents later in the game/other levels.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game as it has surpassed my initial expectations (wasn't in love with the 8bit concept but kept an open mind).  I will end this mini-review as I started it, stating this is an initial mini-review not an indepth one so keep this in mind, but I felt it right to pop in and say the game seems fun and certainly worth it's asking price.

Perhaps it was the lower resolution, or the claustrophobic feeling of the corridors, or the old frame rate of the CRTs, or the FOV in the game, but something just wasn't compatible with my body and Descent.\n\nIt's soo pretty!When I saw this game show up in my Steam queue I was skeptical, but it looked so beautiful (wow those graphics) I figured I'd watch a few videos about it and give it a shot. The videos didn't make me sick to my stomach, so I couldn't resist trying it. I'm glad I bought it, it's a lot of fun. The graphics are really good, and space themed. The particle effects, and the lighting are really pretty. It's like a low-poly glowy minimal design with some pixel stuff (but it's not overkill on the pixel stuff it is subtle and square but it's not jagged or nasty looking).\n\nControls simply and smoothlyI'm playing with an XBox 360 controller (wired USB) and the default control scheme is really good, and simple to understand. The D-Pad lets you rotate and move vertically up and down while the sticks do standard FPS stuff, right stick lets you look around, and the left stick lets you move. Totally fluid control scheme. Triggers fire weapons, left is missiles, right is guns. Simple.\n\nOther crapMeh, crafting. Must every game have crafting? Well, at least there aren't hidden recipes, instead there is a loot system and upgrades (craftables). The simple crafting is a little goofy to get used to and the inventory system is a little bit simple; missing shields (perhaps they are there just haven't found them yet?) but running into the objects and corridors and level structures of the game don't make your ship take damage (perhaps they could add this with a hardcore mode or maybe it's already there?). It's not as easy to figure out if something is better than what you already have, for example.\n\nSTFU alreadyOK, so far I've only played the tutorial, but I'm enjoying this game. The graphics are stunning, the music is excellent and appropriate, and the sound effects are really well done. Over all this is a really fun game and I'm looking forward to spending many hours simplly crusing around random levels killing things.","December 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are blissfully smooth and the ship has just the right feeling of weight to it, making it a joy to slide, spin, and twist my way through the levels. I loved playing Descent and Sublevel Zero is all I could ever ask for in a spiritual sucessor.\n\nThe developers knew their limitations and worked within them to create the best overall game they could. The graphics are simple, but very attractive. Great use of color and lighting mean I can always recognize an enemy's type and also immediately recognize other hazards. The music sets me in a trance, getting louder when I enter combat and then fading again once I've finished the battle. The crafting is simple, but satisfying, letting me create weapons and ship components that meaningfully enhance my chosen playstyle. The map system is well designed so no matter how much I've twisted and turned, I always know where I need to go. The combat is straight-forward, but very satisfying: dodge the enemies' attacks and return fire with one of several weapon types while weightlessly navigating the myriad chambers, tunnels, and caverns. Ambushes abound, but so do opportunities to retreat or duck and cover.\n\nI'm normally not a big fan of permadeath, but it works very well in this game. I haven't once minded dying and restarting because of the randomized levels and the sheer joy of the gameplay. Death is just an excuse to try out a different playstyle. Very rarely have I had this much pure fun with a game.","January 2","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals/graphics are awesome.  The sound is awesome.  Your ship moves so fluidly though it almost feels as if its on rails since you dont have to worry about contact damage and if you just keep accelerating forward your ship kinda self corrects its course(you still have to fly it and choose the direction you're going in).  It feels like the 6DOF is most apparent during combat when your circling, strafing and dodging.  Speaking of combat, so far from what I've played it's intense.  You have to have awareness of what's going on ALL AROUND you because while you're focusing on one enemy you're getting blindsided by another from behind and they'll be off and up to the right which makes understanding how your ship moves that much more important especially in a room full of enemies when you're just dodging and quickly switching targets.\n\nAlso, there's crafting which is neat I guess.  It's pretty simple.  Combine items to create other items that affect your stats(more HP, higher ammo capacity, speed, etc).  I don't know how important it is yet since ive just been creating whateve is available at a whim and equipping it for the better stats.\n\nAlso, the map.  I love having a map to navigate through the tunnels, corridors and caves.  I can't even remember the last time I actually had to pull up a map that wasn't a lame little minimap in the corner of my hud in whatever random game I'd be playing.  My only gripe with pulling up the map is that it doesn't stop the action so if you're busy looking at your map and taking too long you may get attacked by some rando commando enemy and not notice it until your display starts going staticky and distorted because you're taking fire.  That truly is my only gripe so far.\n\nVerict:\n\nI definitely recommend this game so far from what I've played.  It's fun, tense, exciting, the graphics and lighting/particle effects are super eye pleasing and it's a ton of fun.  Seriously.

I won't blame you if you don't; it came out in '94.\n\nDescent was a game years ahead of its time. It hails from an era of gaming history where 3D graphics were beginning to emerge, and the genre-of-choice to take advantage of it was the first-person shooter. It was a different kind of FPS back then; developers aimed to stretch the limits of what their 3D engines could do and deliver the most action-packed experience possible, rather than trying to be gritty and realistic.\n\nOf course, most of those FPS'es featured human-like characters running around on the ground. Descent went further. They strapped you into a gravity-defying ship and gave you total control over your movement in all three dimensions. When Descent said it gave you a 3D experience, it MEANT a 3-frikkin-D experience.\n\nSublevel Zero is Descent meets Roguelike. You're strapped into a gravity-defying ship with 6DOF (Descent) that stays dead when it dies (Roguelike).","October 10, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Occasionally, you'll hit the dead end and it'll break your pace, but that happens pretty rarely.\nThe map in this game is very well made and can help you navigate the labyrinth even if you are bad at navigating.\nThere is ship radar, but in my opinion, it's pretty lacking - it won't show enemies unless they'd hit you.\nFor me this resulted in a few deaths after I moved to much and got confused on where I am (although, that's fully my fault).\n\nSo, to sum all that up - if you are looking for great 6DOF shooter, this game is really good.\nIf you want depth with weapons variety, crafting system and story - look somewhere else.\nThis game's very simple and does only one thing, but it does it so well that I'm finding myself coming back again and again.\n\nMore detailed look and some gameplay in the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/PfxhfAFjyxw","October 16, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ramming is basically useless because enemies explode when killed.. annoyances, but not game-breakers.\n\nIn later levels it starts to be a bit of a jerk - spawning rooms full of homing mines and the like.. to say nothing of the boss rooms.. the last one in particular is just a case of a giant "♥♥♥♥ you" and shows a brute-force approach to creating a climax.\n\nCrafting isn't bad, but the super-limited inventory means until you work out how it works (and what weapons you hate - i'm looking at you, homing missiles) you waste too much time managing your tiny inventory. In general two items of the same type and tier combine to make the next tier up. If you know what goes with what, it's a non-issue. There's also some limitations due to unlockable blueprints, which seems unnecessary - but the game lacks in unlockables of note.\n\nAlso it has Rift support, which is neat... though i'd keep a bucket handy...","January 28","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter how I set it up, it just doesn't seem to feel right on my X52 Pro.\n\nI love the visuals, and picking up power ups I'm sure would result in some pretty cool weapons.

I've only gone through the tutorial so will update this review sometime in the future once I've got further into the game\n\nJust wanted to pop in to say I purchased the game tonight, gave it a try and was very impressed.  Although I'm not certain the 8bit mincraft look is appreciated as well in VR, I can't deny it works very well and does give the sublevel zero world a charm of it's own.  Kudos on taking the time to give this game a story mode, with a clear purpose on what I need to do and why.  The story doesn't sound complex nor does it need to be,  but very nice to have one.\n\nThe game is fun to play and as this is a cockpit type game, works very well in VR.  I was concerned the 6DOF would cause me some nausea issues but so far I'm doing ok, perhaps I'm finally getting my VR legs under me! ;).  The controls work well, using an xbox 360 controller seemed to do the job properly.  I may end up adjusting the stick sensitivity down a bit, but I'll look into the options later but it works as is.  combat so far is against the "grunts" so very samey but as this is the initial tutorial phase I'm giving it a pass with the understanding there are varied opponents later in the game/other levels.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game as it has surpassed my initial expectations (wasn't in love with the 8bit concept but kept an open mind).  I will end this mini-review as I started it, stating this is an initial mini-review not an indepth one so keep this in mind, but I felt it right to pop in and say the game seems fun and certainly worth it's asking price.

Perhaps it was the lower resolution, or the claustrophobic feeling of the corridors, or the old frame rate of the CRTs, or the FOV in the game, but something just wasn't compatible with my body and Descent.\n\nIt's soo pretty!When I saw this game show up in my Steam queue I was skeptical, but it looked so beautiful (wow those graphics) I figured I'd watch a few videos about it and give it a shot. The videos didn't make me sick to my stomach, so I couldn't resist trying it. I'm glad I bought it, it's a lot of fun. The graphics are really good, and space themed. The particle effects, and the lighting are really pretty. It's like a low-poly glowy minimal design with some pixel stuff (but it's not overkill on the pixel stuff it is subtle and square but it's not jagged or nasty looking).\n\nControls simply and smoothlyI'm playing with an XBox 360 controller (wired USB) and the default control scheme is really good, and simple to understand. The D-Pad lets you rotate and move vertically up and down while the sticks do standard FPS stuff, right stick lets you look around, and the left stick lets you move. Totally fluid control scheme. Triggers fire weapons, left is missiles, right is guns. Simple.\n\nOther crapMeh, crafting. Must every game have crafting? Well, at least there aren't hidden recipes, instead there is a loot system and upgrades (craftables). The simple crafting is a little goofy to get used to and the inventory system is a little bit simple; missing shields (perhaps they are there just haven't found them yet?) but running into the objects and corridors and level structures of the game don't make your ship take damage (perhaps they could add this with a hardcore mode or maybe it's already there?). It's not as easy to figure out if something is better than what you already have, for example.\n\nSTFU alreadyOK, so far I've only played the tutorial, but I'm enjoying this game. The graphics are stunning, the music is excellent and appropriate, and the sound effects are really well done. Over all this is a really fun game and I'm looking forward to spending many hours simplly crusing around random levels killing things.","December 30, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music sets me in a trance, getting louder when I enter combat and then fading again once I've finished the battle.

It feels like the 6DOF is most apparent during combat when your circling, strafing and dodging.  Speaking of combat, so far from what I've played it's intense.  You have to have awareness of what's going on ALL AROUND you because while you're focusing on one enemy you're getting blindsided by another from behind and they'll be off and up to the right which makes understanding how your ship moves that much more important especially in a room full of enemies when you're just dodging and quickly switching targets.\n\nAlso, there's crafting which is neat I guess.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthiaVice/recommended/327880/","SynthiaVice","Synthia Vice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SynthiaVice/","271 products in account","A very fun procedurally-generated rogue-lite 6DOF (6 degrees of freedom for all those little kids out there, meaning movement includes pitching, yawing, rolling, heaving, swaying, and surging) game in the same vein as Interplay's 1994 classic Descent, backed by a solid soundtrack. It is similar enough to be a spiritual successor of sorts. My only complaint is that the amount of weapons and enemies seems to be fairly limited, but I hope that more will be added later.\n\nIt shares a great deal of gameplay elements with the aforementioned Descent,  the core gist of the game being that you search for three coloured keys to pass through each level while fighting killer robots of various shapes and sizes, eventually reaching the reactor core, which you have to destroy to advance to the next level. Heck, you can even open doors by shooting them, a gameplay mechanic right out of Descent. Each reactor core has more defenses than the last, resulting in some rather hectic boss fights.\n\nThe plot is fairly nonsensical (something about the universe falling part for no reason, creating warring factions throughout the universe, it's kind of confusing) but not central to the gameplay. What sets it apart from Descent is the addition of an inventory allowing you to carry health, and equip an array of different weapons and modifications to your ship, as well as craft others from the ones you find. You can also unlock more ships and blueprints as you play, which unlock on subsequent playthroughs. Also different from Descent is the fact that you are unable to save progress, like any other rogue-like; when you die, you start from the beginning. The levels are also generated randomly, meaning that each playthrough is different.\n\n9/10","October 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Thinking on your feet and the ability to adapt to each of the zones is of mega importance! From the industrial zones to mining caverns each with their own hazards to over come and to do all of this with Zero lives, Zero places to save, you will find that you really have to keep on top of everything making this game at times brutal!\n\nthe best advice I can offer you for this amazing game is to make every shot and single one of you decisions count throughout the journey it title will take you on.\n\nDon't be surprised if you don't complete the game in your first play through!\n\nThe Graphics\n\nThis game has come a long way from it's preconception the graphics are stunning and helps your to truly become enveloped into this new world you are exploring. They have been time where I have become lost in this world and was happy to just explore and discover.\n\nThe Controls\n\nThe controls differ depending how you decide to play, if like me you opt for the controller the game can be a bit of a challenge to unravel as you are given quite a few commands to remember and to manage, from the flying the vehicle right down to the menu controls. I will say this does not distract from the game as a whole. You may find that a keyboard is easier and even that have a flight stick (or two) easier still so I completely recommend trialling different methods as this game is totally worth immersing yourself into.\n\nWithin the game you have the ability to craft and fix weapons to your vehicle, this is done within a menu that you can access in real time. So managing weapons and by collection technology as you fly through the world is critical to you surviving. Again this is were experimenting is suggested to understand what weapons make what when mixed together, maybe had a pen and paper to hand? ;)\n\nWhether you are flying through a wonderfully designed corridor,  battling ships for their tech or expertly making a few tasty rolls as you fly around.\n\nThis game is for the gamer looking for something new, exciting and fun!","October 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Decision not to have saves is a bit annoyning (I can't spend on game days and weeks of my time so at least keeping state on closing the game should be implemented). Handling is really similar to descent however playing with the keyboard only doesn't seems so accurate. Still looking for the best combination for me.

The control scheme is straight out of Descent also and due to being a far newer game, allows for far more complex level design.

I came across this game as I was lurking around Twitter and was hit with a sense of nostalgia when I saw the screenshots. This game reminds me of the shooters I used to play as a kid but it's made itself so much more than that.\n\nUnlike other rogue-likes I've played, Sublevel Zero gives you a decent amount of time to get used to its controls. First part of the game puts the player in flatter levels and gradually introduces larger and more complicated environments. I'm not great at this game but I certainly wasn't getting frustrated every time I died. It also rewards players with new stuff even if they haven't gotten far into the game, as long as they've spent enough time playing it. This beginner-friendly approach is something I certainly appreciate about this game A LOT.\n\nGameplay-wise, I haven't gotten bored yet. So far, the procedurally-generated maps have still kept me on my feet and there's been a decent variety of enemies to face around the levels. The crafting and various upgrades you pick up also create enough variation between each playthrough to keep things interesting. So I applaud its replayability!\n\nThings I'd like to see:Better hardware optimization - The game crashes every time I fix the GUI antialiasing settings on my desktop (running a GTX 970), and on my gaming laptop (GTX 860M) I experience the kind of lag that hinders the enjoyment of an action game like this.\nLess clunky inventory/crafting menu - Being in the inventory doesn't pause the game but it takes a lot of clicking to equip/drop/craft things. Would be cool if it could be streamlined.\nA mini-map on the HUD - 6DOF also means a higher likelihood of getting lost. Bringing up the map is cool and all but it does take time to bring it up again and again when lost.\nAbility to move while in menus - This would make the action a lot more fluid and exciting.\nMore descriptions in the options screen - Option screen currently contains jargon that not all players will understand\nAnothing thing to note: it's possible that some of the more hardcore players may be disappointed with the level of difficulty of this game. While Sublevel Zero does provide a challenge, I feel like more experienced players may want something harder. But all in all, this is a pretty solid game and I would highly recommend it.","October 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Descent II is probably my all time favorite game...I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of that back in '96 - '97. The controls in Sublevel Zero are absolutely incredible, and the level designs seems great so far...kudos to the devs!\n\nThe only thing so far that I don't really like is the soundtrack. It's not terrible, it's just nowhere as good IMO to the soundtrack of Descent II, for example. Luckily, since the cut scenes are text based, you can simply play your own MP3s in the background (MP3 playback isn't a game feature, you need a third party program like foobar or Windows Media Player).\n\nI'm really looking forward to playing this extensively. If you were ever a fan of any of the Descent games and want something with that six-degrees-of-freedom, look no further than Sublevel Zero.\n","October 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The visuals are really aesthetically pleasing. I do think that although the music has a good feel to it, you might plan on bumping some of your own tunes because that soundtrack can get old pretty quick if you're just cracking out on this game. The game is hard, and the tutorials I don't really think covered quite enough but maybe it was intended for people to learn the more important stuff on their own. Just the UI can be difficult to take in at first. Really smooth controls, for what it is, it's really well polished and I hope to see them do some more with this.

I came across this game as I was lurking around Twitter and was hit with a sense of nostalgia when I saw the screenshots. This game reminds me of the shooters I used to play as a kid but it's made itself so much more than that.\n\nUnlike other rogue-likes I've played, Sublevel Zero gives you a decent amount of time to get used to its controls. First part of the game puts the player in flatter levels and gradually introduces larger and more complicated environments. I'm not great at this game but I certainly wasn't getting frustrated every time I died. It also rewards players with new stuff even if they haven't gotten far into the game, as long as they've spent enough time playing it. This beginner-friendly approach is something I certainly appreciate about this game A LOT.\n\nGameplay-wise, I haven't gotten bored yet. So far, the procedurally-generated maps have still kept me on my feet and there's been a decent variety of enemies to face around the levels. The crafting and various upgrades you pick up also create enough variation between each playthrough to keep things interesting. So I applaud its replayability!\n\nThings I'd like to see:Better hardware optimization - The game crashes every time I fix the GUI antialiasing settings on my desktop (running a GTX 970), and on my gaming laptop (GTX 860M) I experience the kind of lag that hinders the enjoyment of an action game like this.\nLess clunky inventory/crafting menu - Being in the inventory doesn't pause the game but it takes a lot of clicking to equip/drop/craft things. Would be cool if it could be streamlined.\nA mini-map on the HUD - 6DOF also means a higher likelihood of getting lost. Bringing up the map is cool and all but it does take time to bring it up again and again when lost.\nAbility to move while in menus - This would make the action a lot more fluid and exciting.\nMore descriptions in the options screen - Option screen currently contains jargon that not all players will understand\nAnothing thing to note: it's possible that some of the more hardcore players may be disappointed with the level of difficulty of this game. While Sublevel Zero does provide a challenge, I feel like more experienced players may want something harder. But all in all, this is a pretty solid game and I would highly recommend it.","October 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TCA7/recommended/327880/","TCA7","SevenUp / TCA7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TCA7/","40 products in account","This game has real promise... but alas, I found it lacking in several areas: (The list below is strictly from my playing it one time... so forgive me if I made any errors in this list below.)\n\n1. No energy recharge... You can run out of energy and bullets so that the ONLY way to kill enemies is to ram them.\n\nVery disappointed that you don't have at least a slow energy recharge so at least you can use something to fire at the enemy robots that are scattered in the map.\n\n\n2. Turn speed is too slow for my liking... Descent 1 and Descent 2 OPEN SOURCE shows how to do this much better... How that would relate to the game engine used? I haven't looked at Unity at all.\n\nFeels like you have to do a lot of extra effort to get the ship to move anything close to what we had in Descent.\n\n\n3. Lacks standard weapons like could be found in Descent 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAt least level 1 lasers would have been helpful here.\n\n\n4. Hard to configure for a standard old Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2.\n\nTakes a lot of tweaking to get things to map close to what we had in the Descent series. (1, 2, and 3.) Descent had a great automatic configuration for a select set of joysticks as well as a generic joystick configuration that worked pretty well.\n\n\n5. Found it hard to understand how much weapons that you have left at any given time.\n\nWould have been helpful if there was a display on how much of the current weapon was available.\n\n\n6. Picking up the Spewed items after killing robots requires pressing a keystroke, For multiple dropped items you have to press the SAME keystroke multiple times.\n\nCome on fellas, at least let us fly into the spewed items and pick them up automatically. Extra keystrokes seem a bit unnecessary here. This causes one to have to STOP and manually pickup the items. If this were the way it was in Descent, the game would have been a lot more difficult especially with enemies moving and shooting at your ship.\n\n\n7. Missing is the Multi-player.\n\nPerhaps this was intended as ONLY a Single Player game. Won't hold that against the game developers.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about Descent was the ability to play missions in Cooperative Mode through the story line or only as Single Player missions.\n\n\n8. Wish that the actual game play were more like the Demo Video.\n\nThe demo video sold me on the game and I'm sure that you have that much energy in the later levels in this game.\n\n---\n\nThey did give a Descent look and feel to the Map and the Level Map View... Feels exactly like Descent in that regard to me.\n\nOverall this game has promise but it needs some major work in some areas and minor adjustments in other areas.\n\nThis game just doesn't deliver to the standards of Descent which it looks like it was modeled after.\n\nI like the game but at this time unless there are some major tweaks... I won't be able to play it.\n\nIs it worth the low price? Perhaps and maybe with some income for the developers they might be willing to finish this game properly. It was worth it to me to see how well they did to this point in time... Don't want my money back but wish to encourage the developers to give the game a more polished look and feel.\n\nIt is a lot of work to get a game to where they have arrived... it wouldn't take much to make it even better.\n\nThat's the opinion of this Senior Systems Analyst (computer programmer  for nearly 38 years) and long time computer gamer. (Over 35 years)\n\nThanks to you the game developers for at least giving it the effort to get the game to this point.\n\nLook back at the Open Source for the games Descent 1, Descent 2, Freespace 1, and Freespace 2 for some insights on how you could improve this game dramatically. Compare the smoothness of the Joystick configuration and Joystick  usage in those games as well as a better video frame rate would be very helpful too.\n\nThis game could help revive this sector of the gaming industry if only it were finished better.","October 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you’re a connoisseur of both, you should stop reading and download this game. It does everything right, offering a wide assortment of weapons and ships and an impressive variety of customization. The story is engaging enough to remember, and data logs are there for those looking for more, outside of the frantic firefights. The experience is easy to get into but provides a real challenge that only strategy and a little luck can overcome. A great experience all around.\n\nThe story is simple, and yet engaging enough for this type of game. The universe has begun ripping itself apart, and humanity has spread out into factions, fearful of the technology that caused space to descend into chaos. Your clan seeks answers from the technology that supposedly caused these rifts and black holes. Discovering a research base in the middle of nowhere, you enter as the base is pulled into an event horizon. Unsure of where you’re going, you search the infrastructure looking for whatever lies at the heart of it.\n\nMost won’t be coming for the story however; many are simply interested in playing a roguelike 3D space shooter, and they will not be disappointed. The procedural environments keep the action fast-paced and fresh, as you rush up to the next door, ready to take on whatever lies within. Each time you die, you’ll restart the game at the beginning, ready to build up and take on the station in your attempt of getting from Zero to Sublevel Five.\n\nSigtrap Games have released an experience that feels like an interstellar Binding of Isaac. Each room features familiar elements but keeps it fresh with enemy placement and dead ends. Your goal is to reach a reactor at the end of every level and fight the defenses to proceed to the next. Sure, you might find the end early, but surely there’s some weapons and additional ammo that you could go back and get. It’s a great balance of knowing your strengths and realizing when to backtrack in search of additional health packs. If you collect enough materials, your ship will get a selection of a random perma-bonus that could provide invaluable assistance to your cause.\n\nThere’s no doubt about it; the guns are freaking awesome. You start out with basic blasters, but slowly over time you find random weapons that all have unique abilities. Your standard ammo could be used in a common repeater, or you could use it in a shotgun-esque blaster. Your plasma energy could be used in a single-shot railgun for maximum damage, or in a flamethrower that soaks large crowds. The added ability to build even more powerful weapons with varying abilities keeps the game engaged in strategy. You don’t have unlimited resources or space, and upgrading takes Nanites that quickly vanish after killing robots.\n\nThe varying degree of enemies is also impressive. Some hovering enemies hang back and attempt to snipe you while others kamikaze towards you with reckless abandon. There’s also stationary anti-aircraft guns, and even tanks that hug the surface of the walls. Every time you enter a room, you have to assess the most dangerous enemies quickly, and take them out while the others try to pick you off. The amount of enemies does provide a nice diversity, and they increase the deeper you go.\n\nFor those who like cake walks, this game might not be for you. It’s tough- and it will break you. Several well-placed shots can leave you defending what little energy you have left. Ammo can be very scarce, leaving you defenseless. Some runs, you’ll have regenerating health and an awesome energy gun, and you’ll feel very confident. Then, you’ll get turned around in a cave, end up cornering yourself into some wall before being blasted into space dust. These moments of disappointment are only fleeting, as you quickly hop back in for another run.\n\nControls are surprisingly easy for a game where you have the ability to fly in any direction. You point your cursor and the nose of your ship with the mouse, move on the x-axis with WASD, and the Y-Axis with Ctrl and Space. You can even control your yaw with Q & E. Personally, I went with a controller, which made the experience way more enjoyable. Before you know it, you’ll be boosting through caverns, sliding into engine rooms and blasting away at enemies. Getting turned around is inevitable, and the map system is a Godsend, featuring a 3D Metroid-esque system that you can fly around and survey. This especially comes in handy when you end up in a long tunnel filled with dead ends, as the map is quickly pulled and thrown away with no loading times.\n\nThe soundtrack sounds like it’s from a The Glitch Mob album, consisting of floaty techno and heavy bass hits, adding to powerful confrontations. While there aren’t many in the rotation, the ones that are there don’t get repetitive and sound professionally mixed. The sound effects are beautiful, having a bit of audio pulled back to sound as if you’re in a vacuum. The impacts come in loud and clear, with the sound of your hull being hit coming in louder than the blasts themselves.\n\nThere are some problems though, but nothing that can’t be fixed with a patch. For one, when you use a controller, icons that are supposed to represent the button are glitched out. After you learn the controls, you won’t need them though- but it does look bad. I also don’t understand why the developers went with pixelation on their textures. Unless there’s a technical reason, I don’t understand the idea behind them wanting the environments to look like Minecraft. The enemy AI also doesn’t really chase after you as well as they could, but these are small knit picks.\n\nBottom line, there’s no reason not to pick this up if you aren’t intrigued by an intergalactic, rogue space shooter. It sets out to provide an entrancing shooter experience, and it succeeds in almost every regard. It’s 15 dollars, which is a little high for the price of admission, but in its first week it’s going to be on sale. If this interests you, I would say Sublevel Zero is a must buy. I haven’t had that much fun dying in a long time, and I look forward to my continued voyages towards the bottom of this fortress of no gravity action.","October 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There also are too many permanently locked doors as a result of reusing low number of rooms. On top of it - there are no secret doors, no hidden power-ups, no unique places to remember, no traps, ..  just bunch of nice looking rooms connected together with almost none crossroads.\n\nDrops and weapons looks like raw outputs from random generator. At least twice I died because I had energy based weapons (no projectile weapon dropped) and enemies dropped just projectiles during more than one level.  At the end I just had nothing to use against them except very slow energy regeneration.\n\nLast thing that is probably most annoying - save system. Sublevel Zero is rogue-like game so you would expect that if you quit in the middle of level, you loose progress through that level? - wrong: game just deletes your save. The only way how to 'save' game is to quit it between levels.\n\nAfter each death, quit in the middle of level (yes I have family a I have to do it sometimes), after wrongly generated enemy drops, after every bug (there are few) you have to start from the first level with starting ship. Together with poor level generator and very repetitive look of levels I got completely bored after first hour.\n\nMy advice: buy it for €1 if you wish to try this game or avoid it completely.\n","January 26","false","1.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/recommended/327880/","jacmusl","Zip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacmusl/","1424 products in account","Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.\nCheck out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/\n------------------------------------------------\nA rougelike, procedurally generated, voxel based, 8-bit inspired spaceship shooter! Sounds like a dream right? Well thanks to nearly every Tom, ♥♥♥♥ and Harry who can put any semblance of code together, smashing a game out in about 12 hours and then releasing it onto steam using all or most of the above buzzwords, those terms have been pulled through the dirt and then some. Suffice to say when I got my hands on Sublevel Zero my expectations were low. But my was I wrong.\n\nThe first thing I should probably say is that I’m not very good at Sublevel Zero (that and that the game is quite hard). Despite playing it for several hours have yet to manage to beat the second stage. As such, you should take this into account as some of my complaints may well be solved later in the game. I also suffered from some game freezes and long loading times which may just be due to my PC – make sure to check forums for issues before purchasing.\n\nSublevel Zero starts with a fairly forgettable story and then you’re plonked into a world where everything is out to get you. The levels are procedurally generated and as it’s a rougelike you lose everything when you die. The controls are a little difficult at first and I’d defiantly recommend using a controller, but once you get used to them it’s smooth and satisfying flying.\n\nRight from the start there’s a decent amount of variety in the enemies you face. Each one is mechanically and visibly different from the others and each requires a different approach. The end room of each level seems to lack some kind of boss. They generally feature a larger number of enemies than elsewhere but whilst this does certainly make it quite difficult it is somewhat anti- climactic. Your ability to deal with them largely grows from your own experience rather than actual upgrades to your ship, meaning that even the weakest of enemies can still do significant damage and in Sublevel Zero things can go very wrong, very quickly. Whilst you can pick up Med-Packs, they heal slowly over time and provide a relatively small amount of health, and so are in no way going to save you in a panic.\n\nThe meat of the game comes from the weapons you use and there are lots of them. You start with a couple of basic weapons and you gain more either as pick-ups or by crafting them. Weapons are crafted by combining weapons in your inventory together at the cost of ‘Nanites’ (a currency dropped by enemies and chests) There are a huge range of different weapons from Gatling guns to rockets and lasers to cannons and what with the easy switching, crafting and limited ammo you’re constantly swapping weapons and trying out lots of new fun weapons.\n\nThe Facility you find yourself in is fairly repetitive and despite a clear attempt by the developers to make sure that each room is different, it’s fairly easy to get turned about. However the excellent 3D map you can access makes reorientation easy yourself and near impossible to get truly lost. The steel like textures on the first level also make it easy for some of the enemies to blend in causing shots to often seem like they’re coming from out of nowhere.\n\nThe main problem I have with the level design (and the game in general) is that it feels very cramped. The corridors are tight and even the larger rooms that you find don’t feel very large, and about half way through the level the steel plated corridors get exchanged for rock tunnels which feel equally as claustrophobic. What I kept wanting was a large open space to fly around in and pull crafty manoeuvres on my foes, which is maybe what you would expect from a game about spaceships.\n\nIn all I enjoyed playing Sublevel Zero and will probably play it for a bit longer if only to say that I managed to make it to the third level. It also features VR support so is something I’ll come back to when I get my hands on a headset. The ship felt great to fly and the sheer variety of weapons meant that the game never got stale. I can honestly say that I’d recommend giving it a go.","December 5, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like first-person simulation games and think this game is cool looking to play it is.\n\nLong version: I loved Descent growing up and missed the smart robot AI, exploring levels, getting power-ups and getting out of dodge before the self-destruct. Since the Descent games cease to continue after the cancellation of Descent 4 there hasn't really been a game like in a long time. Now there is.\n\nIf you played those games before you'll feel right at home very quickly. The major differences are the levels are procedurely generated so even though there's only 6 levels they feel different and have a different set of enemy configurations each time you play. The other is that there's no hostages or self-destruct to worry about. The game introduces a crafting system which is simplistic and straight forward. Imagine if could craft that super weapon if you just had the parts. Or if you wanted to upgrade your health or speed as you progressed.\n\nIf you never played those games before I think this is a great one to try. It offers just enough challenge to make it interesting without being super frustrating. You only get one life so if you die that's it, but it doesn't feel like the game is being unfair (unless it has a room of 5 Homing Missile drones). That being said the Random generation is equally generous and lenient offering a new challenge and forcing you to adapt.\n\nThe graphics are great and really enjoy the asethetic. Really impressed by the level design. They really put some time and effort into the procedural generation and this is the probably its biggest selling point. You'll see similiar rooms and layouts but hardly ever the exact same layout twice. Even the first level I'm always amazed of how it changes from each run and it's pretty to just fly in caverns and crystals and new environments. Especially the later levels feel like huge environments and can take a fair amount of time to clear completely as you explore one section and there's still doors and hallways you haven't gone down yet.\n\nWhat it did well for me:\n+ Really enjoyed the combat, it's a great first person shooting game and a great addition and entry to the genre\n+ The level design is spectaculuar and the variety of enemies is distinct and have their own challenges\n+ They're updating the game still, I got this a month or 2 ago and they're still adding a more content and looking forward to each update\n+ Graphics and lighting is top notch you feel like you're in the environment\n+ Inventory and crafting system is straight forward and neat to see what you get each time and forcing you to make choices on what to keep or leave behind\n\nThings that could use improvment or would like to see:\n* There are a few bugs, for example I couldn't get my boost to work at all despite configuring the keys to do so both on my joystick and the keyboard. Also from time to time it would use a repair kit on pick-up instead of just adding it to the inventory, or not pick it up at all. It also has a few occassional floating artifacts and some performance slow downs depending on your settings.\n\n* Would like to see visual differences in the different ships you picked at the start both in the hud and the outside, this is minor but would be neat.\n\n* More enemy robots and environments. Really enjoying the addition of the challenge rooms and them being optional. Also be great to have parts of the level that reward you for exploring or having secrets like hidden passages or rooms. Also having more interacting with the environment like being able to destroy or modify certain rooms via switches or destorying parts.\n\n*Have a chance of facing a huge boss robot instead of a reactor on levels, while each reactor is different it be great to face against a tough robot.\n\nReally great game and looking forward to see what they do in the future.","December 6, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is short (6 levels) but has a satisfying difficulty curve due to one death ending the game forcing you to start over. It is fairly beautiful while still remaining very playable on low end machines due to low poly counts coupled with beautiful shaders. Oh and the music is extremely appropriate for the game. You won't notice it at first but will find yourself humming it. In my mind, thats how you know its good.\n\nI spent my teens obsessing over Descent much like kids today do so with Counter Strike or Dota2. When you play a game that much at that young an age you become extremely sensitive to what works or doesn't. I'm very happy to say that the younger me would have loved this game and would only have complained about the lack of online play. That and the "rogue-like" elements are good but could use some fleshing out.\n\nOver all: I highly recommend Sublevel Zero. This isn't a "wait till its on sale" game. Its worth getting right now.","October 16, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My main concerns are that the enemies lack features that make them easily distinguishable from each other*, and the random level layouts rarely double back or twist around beyond making a central hub with 3 or 4 spokes that end in dead ends and an exit. This is a really good start though and has great potential. The flight and movement feel right.\n\n*What I mean here, is that in Descent you could tell the enemies apart at a distance from their silhouettes alone, even in low resolution. Not so much in this game.","October 17, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was ground breaking for the time. Most games of 1994 still used 2D graphics for lots of stuff. Doom was a 3D game with 2D enemies. This game aims to be the next Descent.\n\nDoes it have cutting edge graphics? No. Does it break any new ground in PC gaming? No. Is the gameplay in any way similar to the original Descent? Yes, kind of.  Was it with the $12 I spent on it? Yes, but that's about all it is worth. If it weren't for the replayability thanks to the procedural level design, this game would be little more than a glorified tech demo. The one life is all you get concept is vexing for me. I can't go back and try a differnt strategy. No, it is game over, so sorry you lose.\n\nWould I recommend this game even after bashing it so hard? Yes. The price is good for what it is, the replay value is high, and it brings 6DOF gaming back to the PC. A decent game it may be, but a worthy sucessor to Descent it is not.","October 20, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll like it as well.\n\nTwo things to note, though.\n\nFirst, the interface can get pretty clunky. The inventory menu kind of gets in the way, and it's annoying.\n\nSecond, the procedural generation will never be as good as the huge handcrafted levels of Descent. Don't buy this expecting the level design to be as good. In fact, as far as I can tell, it's linear, but sometimes there will be an alternate path that has a dead end or either branches back into the main road.\n\nIn fact, the procedural generation itself seems to be pretty weak. I've done five runs so far and the rooms don't vary a whole lot... there is a lack of variation in here. While what's in the game as it stands at the time of this writing is solid, a rogue-like game which advertises replayability should really look into fixing this issue.\n\nThat's is in my opinion the biggest flaw of Sublevel Zero. A big lack of variation. A side effect of it is that everything sort of "blends together" and nothing really ends up standing out.\n\nThe soundtrack is very fitting to the atmosphere of the game and has some dynamic elements. It's not super memorable but it definitely enhances the mood. The visuals are very pretty and manage to pull off pixelated-yet-polished 3D very well. The atmospheric lighting and color grading is executed very well and you might end up coming back to the game for the visuals alone.\n\nThere's a story somewhere in there apparently, but it forgot to exist about five minutes into the game. That's kind of a shame. Good lore can really enhance a fictional universe.\n\nAll in all, like I said before, if Descent's your childhood game, get this. Otherwise you'd probably want to wait for some additional content (more rooms and variation) to be patched in.","October 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many bugs subsist to this day, one of them being that challenge rooms refuse to open once you're done battling all the enemies (apparently blowing up multiple enemies at the exact same time confuses the game and it will think there are enemies left in the room). This bug is particularly infuriating when you're having a very good run and suddenly you're stuck and your only option is suicide. The game also crashed a few times on me, and i've had some horrible framerate drops at times (usually runs at a smooth 60fps, but for some reason I have had situation where the game went below 5fps. I'm letting you imagine what fighting the final boss at 1fps felt like). And finally, it can get pretty repetitive if this isn't your kind of game. Levels look very similar in the end, and some of the later levels go on forever.\n\nThat being said, if the devs fix the bugs and you're into this sort of game, you'll certainly have a lot of fun exploring the six levels of this station and battling the cores at the end. Six levels sounds a bit short, but a full run is easily longer than an hour, and only 4 percent of the playerbase managed to finish the game, so you're in for a decent challenge. Sublevel zero has a crafting system that works in a very interesting way, allowing you to create stronger modules (guns, hulls, engines...) by combining weak ones. I suggest getting the Gauss cannon as it is clearly the best weapon in the game and can be obtained as soon as the second level if you're lucky with nanite drops.\n\nTL;DR : 6DOF shooter game, gather intel, destroy enemies, acquire loot, craft modules, have fun.","December 2, 2015","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
