I was rather excited to begin playing it. Then as I progressed through the game I found it, 'boring'. This game has hardly any puzzles, not to mention that none of them are difficult in any way, and the game was in no way imersive or scary. This game doesn't even have an intriguing storyline. Honestly, this game is not worth $7. I do not recommend buying it.","January 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 97 of 104 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","97","104","2","0"

I purchased it with only one review written which was my mistake. The game is nothing more than walking through a maze of doors solving a couple simple puzzles to get keys to the next maze of doors and on and on. No interesting storyline to accompany you through the dread either.  I found it to be a boring chore to play. In fact, I did not even finish it due to lack of interest.  Countless rooms of boredom. What is even more disturbing is that this game is actually on Steam and costs money. I find this to be worse than downloading a virus. Stay away. Stay very far away.","January 11, 2015","false","3.4"," 82 of 93 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","82","93","16","0"

There are many textures that seemed lazy, such as the yellow/black maps to avoid fire rooms. You can also clip inside any object that moves around the room. The game looks like a bad garrysmod map.\n\nAside from those issues, the games atmosphere never really hooked me. It attempts to be "spooky" in most rooms and it just isn't. There is also no clear objective to the game.\n\nDefinitely save your money on this one.","January 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","0"

Seriously. You just walk room to room.\n- Minimal controls - WASD movement, E to interact\n- VERY few things to interact with\n- Not as many puzzles as you'd expect\n\nAudio/Visual\n- Outdated textures and props feel like the game is from 2004 (or earlier), not 2014\n- Short sound clips that loop endlessly (that chair scream, ugh) or cut off abruptly\n\nEnvironment/Ambiance\n- Cheap, pointless quasi-jumpscares (falling containers? a cardboard tube? monster noises in the dark? really?)\n- Puzzle contraptions don't fit the rest of the environment, and would be better suited for a game like Kairo\n- The ONLY challenge is remembering room locations (draw a map) and navigating the fire room tiles (copy or screenshot the wall map)\n- Afaik, the tile room is the only one that can actually kill you (which just puts you back in the starting room)\n- Shreds of the "story" scattered around are not enough to maintain interest\n\nConclusion\nUnless you got this in a bundle, save yourself the aggravation (and money) and just watch this Quick Look video[www.giantbomb.com]. (ViolentMonk posted it in the discussion boards.) If you're at all on the fence, it will make the decision for you.\n\nIf you did get it in a bundle, run it for the cards (~1.25 hours for all 3) and go watch the above video or a LP until they drop. No point in going through the frustration yourself. There are no achievements either, so there isn't even a superficial reason to keep playing.\n\nI've filed this one under "Crap Games" and fully intend on forgetting it exists. And honestly, it's bad enough that even if it did have achievements, I probably wouldn't bother. I'm not that masochistic.","March 8, 2015","false","1.2"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","29","34","9","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/341380/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4509 products in account","I'm giving this a careful recommendation.\n\nCountless Rooms of Death is not a high production value game and I'm not sure it counts as horror either. Instead, it is a decently made randomized puzzle game, which uses strange object placements in its rooms and discomforting music and sound cues to keep you feeling tense.\n\nThere are no cheap deaths or scares, but a lot of frustration as the game doesn't hold your hand in the slightest and relies on you to figure out what to do in each puzzle room.\n\nEssentially it is a maze of interconnected cubes, with each room being either empty or holding some form of puzzle. Occasionally you will come across documents or specific occurences which advance the cryptic story. Most of the time the room is empty though and there are a lot of dead paths requiring you to backtrack -- at least each room has at least something in it so you can keep them apart, and occasionally something weird happens when you first enter.\n\nIf you like SCP games, Countless Rooms of Death is worth a try. Just remember that it is not a particularly good looking or all that well designed game.\n\nAnd do play it with headphones on and crank up the sound to at least setting '2' in the in-game settings room before playing. Playing it in the dark can help as well.\n\n(Updated: upon further replays I'm pretty sure it's not procedurally generated, but randomized. As in a specific room will always be the same but where it's placed and what doors are active will change across games.)","January 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 21 of 53 people (40%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","40","21","53","5","4"

It feels very unfinished.  Other "walking simulators" and 3D puzzle games (Anna, Dear Elise) pull the whole atmospheric/puzzle delivery off perfectly - while such games aren't everyones cup of tea, most certainly a bad example of the genre is more like a cup of tea you don't want with petrol in it.","May 16","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
