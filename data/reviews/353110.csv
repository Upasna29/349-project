The story is a direct sequel, but with shorter dreams of somewhat wavering quality.\n\nLong version:Shaman Games likes to create games that look and feel like hidden object games, but are actually lightweight point ‘n’ clicks. Dreamscapes 2: Nightmare’s Heir is a rare exception: it retains most of the developer’s usual clever puzzle design, but this time there is a larger focus on item gathering, and there are even a few traditional hidden objects scenes.\n\nThe story brings us back to Laura (the damsel in distress of the first game), who, despite her new-found superpowers, is only present as a supporting character; it is up to the new protagonist to save her husband. His dreams are probably more mundane than Laura’s were, but there are many of them, so even the duller ones quickly give way to the better segments.\nStill, it becomes obvious fairly early that despite their number, the new dreams don’t last long. This naturally results in a very short game (about half of an afternoon long), even by casual game standards.","December 8, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

However, she can't use it for herself and the Sandman used that knowledge to attack her dear friend and now husband Tim. You're the only one she can count on, so, you're going to save Tim from his nightmares and put an end to the Sandman's revenge.\n\nDreamscapes: Nightmare's Heir is the sequel of Dreamscapes: The Sandman. While it's not an obligation to play the first game, I suggest you to strongly do it, as you will have a better understand of what's happening. The story is still nicely written and if you played the first game, you knew that there was going to be a sequel at one point. Here it is, with the Sandman ready to take over Tim and taunting you about failing this time (though he was sure of that in the first game too). As usual, a cute creature is helping you, though it's not Benny anymore but another one.\n\nThere was a huge change in the gameplay: now, you have hidden objects scenes included, where the first game was just a point-&-click with puzzles. It doesn't change anything in the end, as it's still pleasant to play puzzles (they're easy) and to clear the scenes, with a well-balances difficulty. The beholders are still there, however, where in the first game, it was easier to find them, here, they're kinda very small apart for some.\n\nAs you're now in Tim's nightmare, you have different fears to face than in Laura's story. They're less into "exotic" locations: everything is way more darker than for Laura - if I think about the depths of the sea and the swamp - else, Tim was twice in a house, in an apartment and on a road. I don't mind a change of scenery but I wish it was more inviting to a journey. However, I found the apartment's dream very interesting as everything is in black and white, like in an old polar story and items themselves in your inventory were in black and white. But the graphics are still good, though I found Laura's hands a little too big in the cutscenes.\n\nThe soundtrack is also fitting to the ambiance. And the voice acting is good too, mainly our adorable creature's sounds.\n\nThe big relief is that Dreamscapes: Nightmare's Heir doesn't suffer of crashes, like for The Sandman where you had to set the CPU affinity to 0 or 1. It means mainly that you can play the game without having to worry about any workaround or crash or corrupt files. I don't know what really changed for that though.\n\nDreamscapes: Nightmare's Heir is the sequel you were waiting for, without crashes, with new worlds to visit, though now, it's Tim who is affected, and with hidden object scenes that are breaking the monotony of using items and going back and forth between locations.","April 26","true","2.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The HO scenes require little effort as there are few items in scene besides the one your looking for. The story element is also easy as you have a limited inventory and so only few logical choices. Only a few logic puzzles which aren't taxing. The graphics and sound are okay. The story is again okay. The best part for me was finding the cute beholders in the areas, though that was also easy. There is an achievement menu inside the game, most of which you will pick up as you go along without trying.\n\nI played in windowed mode and encountered no bugs. I had no issue with clicking on items.\nOverall I would give this an okay. Good for crayon eaters.","August 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It's interesting and long enough that it's worth playing, but you are advised to keep your expectations low.\n\nAs with Dreamscapes 1, the English edition has awful voice acting and script. Also, though it has achievements, they are not linked to Steam.

Most of the game is of acceptable quality for a casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG).  The voice acting, graphics, game play, and story are about par for the genre (in the main game, anyway).  Nothing really stands out either way.  The bonus chapter, though, is of far less quality than the main game (it's only about a half an hour of play, so it's not a big thing).  There, the story really turns dumb and the game play becomes trivial.  Also, the developers seem to have neglected their English translations more.  There's a lot of "something must be applied" flying around there.  Also, at one point, a character lies on the floor with an implication of being dead.  The text reads something about being deafened.  Yet, the character is revived by something trivial (with an odd name).  In the main game, the only real translation difficulties I noticed was the use of the term "balloon" for tank (twice, I believe).  My only real complaint with the whole game is the bugs ("Beholders") that we're supposed to find.  If you finish taking everything out of an object without first getting that bug, the object will close and you're SOL:  can't re-open the container, no saves, no checkpoint.  Ditto if you finish a dreamscape area.\n\nI got a total of 3.8 hours of acceptable play out of the game.  By my dollar an hour metric, at it's current list price of about $7, it's a bit overpriced.  Look for it on sale for less than $4 and that would be better.","October 12, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Has the same layout as the first game only the story isn't as good. This time you're in Tims dreams trying to save him and defeat the sandman. Down part is the dtory isnt as rich, the ending is totally rubbish and tyhe bonus play ending is a cop out. Wondering if there'st to be a third game. The game isnt as long as the previous and I'd recommend you play that one if you haven't done so. The art is good and the creepy feel is there, it has a twist on gameplay which makes it more fun than your bog standard HOG.","August 26, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I know that the HOG industry relies on shovelware and hasty localizations.  I tried to be forgiving. But just too many things are wrong with Dreamscapes: Nightmare's Heir.\n\nFirst, the game is very short.  I completed the whole thing, including the Bonus Chapter, in under two hours.\n\nThe voice acting is subpar, and some of the translations are rather shaky.  The typical supernatural antagonist is particularly sketchy -- his goals and motivations (other than general maliciousness) change every time he monologues.\n\nThe ending, and the second ending, after the Bonus Chapter, are both abrupt and unsatisfying.\n\nThe HO scenes and puzzles are all very easy, with one possible exception, if you've never encountered the Eight Queens problem before.  At least one HO scene in the Bonus Chapter, however, commits the cardinal sin of including multiple objects that satisfy the target description, and demanding that you find the right one.\n\nThe video sequences, in fairness, were up to the standard for the genre, and the music was mostly good, with the exception of one ear-grating synth chorus effect.\n\nA few flaws are always forgiveable in this genre, but here, there are just too many.  I cannot recommend.","September 20, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
