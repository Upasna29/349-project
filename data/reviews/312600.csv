Do I recommend this game? Not at full price.\n\nPeople talk here like it's "Like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem or Disgaea". Well they are not completely wrong, but they are not right from another point of view.\n\nEverything I will say, is according to my playthrough (2 floors cleaned 6,5 hours played on hard difficulty), achievement analysis, and screenshot analysis.\n\nLets talk in numbers.\n4 Floors.\n5 levels each.\n20 levels (game stages total).\n\n3 "starting" professions.\nWarrior upgrade goes like x3 (second) x1 (third) = 7\nArcher goes like x2 x3 = 9\nMagician goes like x2 x2 = 7\nSo it's 23 professions to choose from, not bad huh ?\nYep but this are the all the enemy you will encounter in the game (+3 plot dolls who just useless but have high HP).\nThere are no more enemy types in game.\n\nNo gear. Trere are NO items or potions. No inventory. Just skills.\n\nThere 6 types of magick. Guide staits that Fire->Lightning->Water->Fire and Dark->Light->Star->Dark. But trere is no elements on the characters (exept buffs), so for the most time it is just like "hit the mage with fisical, hit the warrior with magic to win).\n\nDifficulty ?\nTotal maximum of your characters are 20.\nIn batle you can use 5, with no replacement.\nThere are 10-15-20 enemies, you should fight with 5 of your dudes.\nNo item difference, no profession difference, no skill difference ever. Plus you often start in terrible position (like group separated). Of course it's difficult, but it is just "zerg rush" you see.\n\nHere my playtime with it if you need more proof.\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712990\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/drobodur/c/5712997","December 19, 2014","false","7.1"," 200 of 246 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","200","246","5","4"

None of the attributes have any kind of description, you have to open the manual for that. You can't easily hover over (de)buff icons to see their effects, you have to either check the manual again or open the caster's status menu and scroll through the skill list for the description. But how long does the buff last? The game won't tell you.\n\nWhenever a unit dies, it leaves behind a body that occupies the tile. The reason being that there is a resurrection spell in the game, even though you won't actually see it until the last few stages of the game. Since many of the levels contain small cliffs and narrow passageways, it makes moving your troops forward a pain, and in some cases impossible due to their slow movement and jump values. This makes the already weak melee units even weaker.\n\nDifficulty is good for the most part - until the very last level. The final boss fight requires either very high levels, or very specific tactics to counter magic nukes.\n\nThe AI is poor. Often it only ever attacks the unit closest to it, even if there are vulnerable targets available. Occasionally the AI backs away to cast buffs even if it makes little sense given the situation. AOE casters pay no heed to their allies and will mercilessly harm their allies and possibly even themselves if it means scratching the player's full HP tank a tiny bit. The AI seems to ignore the player's reaction skills entirely, a very useful weakness to exploit during the final battle where a single AOE nuke can wipe out the entire party.\n\nYour units' starting positions depend on what party slot they occupy. This is usually not a big deal, but there are some maps where your party is split and placed on the different sides of the map. This can lead to a quick defeat if your fighters and supporters are not evenly distributed.\n\nMost importantly, the game is tedious. The story isn't very interesting, you only get bits of the story during the first and last levels of the current floor. Dead bodies quickly clutter up the battlefield and limit possible moves, forcing you to clean up the remaining enemies by moving your ranged units up while everyone else attacks thin air or buffs a rock just to level up their skill proficiencies, and this takes forever. I would highly recommend setting battle speed to its max value from the options menu.","February 8, 2015","false","26.1"," 113 of 135 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","113","135","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/recommended/312600/","Katzilla","Katzilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katzilla/","142 products in account","Rime Berta is a strategy role-playing game from the small doujin circle Next-Soft Plus, and their first (and at the time of writing this review, only) game. Drawing heavy influence from the likes of Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, Rime Berta debuted in Comiket of 2013, and has become available on Android. Since then, it made its way on Steam.\n\nStory:\nThe game tells the tale of a couragous young girl by the name of Livia. Hailing from a village that has been pleagued with an uncurable illness, she sought to help by climbing a mysterious tower that contains a wish-granting relic at its top: the Hallows.\nHowever, many "Guardians" patrol the tower to prevent intruders, and Livia must recruit "dolls" that live in the tower as she fights her way up.\n\nAs far as stories go, Rime Berta's isn't completely original by any means. Much like the gameplay, it's simple, but has a certain charm to it. The few characters there are have distinct personalities, and their interactions can be pleasant. Unforunately, it is relatively short.\n\nGameplay:\nAs previously mentioned, Rime Berta draws heavily from games like TO and FFT. The dolls you receruit in the tower can belong to one of three main types: a Swordsman, Archer, or Magician. Aside from main characters, whose class cannot be changed, each of these three types can branch out into different classes for up to 24 in total. Once you go into a class path, you can't change to another, but you can backtrack to a class you were using before.\n\nEach class has its own unique active/passive skills, and class upgrades depend on mastering some of these skills up to a certain level. You can't change weapons, armors, accessories or any of that stuff, nor can you use items. In fact, there's no monetary system for buying/selling in this game at all. You only have your skills to serve you in battle.\n\nIn battle, your units have an HP and an AP bar. Your unit dies when its HP reaches 0, and each action, whether physical skills, magical skills, moving, or normal attacks cost AP that regenrate by an amount each turn. All action skills have a countdown number that decreases when used, and cannot be used once it reaches 0.\n\nSkills gain Skill Points with usage and level up, which is essential for class upgrade. This could be problematic when a skill you never use is part of the prequisite, and you're forced to grind that one skill to its needed amount.\n\nThere are also some glitches in some aspects of the gameplay, such as with certain statue effects, that brings the gameplay down a notch. Other than that however, the gameplay is fun and can be quite addicting.\n\nGraphics:\nThe sprites in-battle look surprisingly good for a doujin game. They're crisp, smooth, and most importantly, cute. The battle animation, especially with magic, looks style-ish.\n\nUnforunately, the illustrations outside battle are somewhat plain, as you can see from the screenshots.\n\nSound:\nThis is what I'd call the strong point of Rime Berta. The music is notably good. While there isn't much variation due to the game's short length, each track has a tinge of folk-y feel to it, and is distinctly catchy, which helps quite a bit when grinding. It's a shame because the OST doesn't come with the Steam version.\n\nSummary:\nCutting to the chase, should you get this game?\n\nI'd say, not with its standard price. The game is enjoyable, but is simple, short, and requires grinding for the more advanced classes. If you liked FFT-style games, you'll like this one. But for its length and overall quality, I'd only recommend you get it on sale.","March 13, 2015","true","37.8"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","48","54","2","0"

It's not that great, but it's not that bad either.\n\nIt has a good variety of skills and classes, which makes up for the lack of items and equips, giving room for many different grouping strategies.\n\nThere are some challenging maps, that will require some "grinding/training", making it barely impossible to clear it in one go.\n\nThere are some issues (such as a childish plot and simple graphics), but the greatest let down is the AI, which is very simple/weak (even in hard mode).\nThe enemy's motto is basically: "just marches towards your closest foe and hit it with whatever you got".\nAnd that's bad, especially with mages. Don't be surprised to see enemy mages trying to have physical duels against your strongest warriors. Also, when using area skills, they won't care about friendly fire.\n\nOverall, this is a simple yet playable game. It's nowhere near FF Tactics or Disgaea and the price may seem a little more than it's worth. Buy at your own risk, and maybe you'll like it as much as I did.","December 30, 2014","true","35.5"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

I was hoping on first look that it would be a lighter, but still interesting, PC replacement for one of my all time favourite games Disgaea, or at least on par with something like Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. However the combat system is as basic as I've ever come across in this genre, with very little strategy involved, and poor AI. Perhaps the latter will develop later in the game, but nothing I've seen leads me to believe this will be the case. The storyline also seems very lacking, which wouldn't be so bad if there was anything to the rest of the game.\n\nCharacter and party customization is limited to a fusion system which again is very shallow. The art style is decent, nothing special, and the partial controller support is pretty poor, refuses to map the majority of my controls (on an Xbox 360 pad, so not a case of obscure tech), and is just a headache to use, having to switch between controller and keyboard/mouse in the middle of each characters combat action... really, just don't bother with it using a controller.\n\nThere is a serious lack of this style of game on the PC, which has always disappointed me, and this game does absolutely nothing for me as a fan of this genre. In the same price range you can get Agarest, which is a far superior offering to scratch that tactical RPG itch. Even those looking for something really basic are going to be far better served by something such as the free flash game Ultimate Tactics.","December 18, 2014","false","1.0"," 46 of 68 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","46","68","0","1"

Class system is interesting but fairly crippled by the inability to truly multiclass or have more than 6 skills equipped. Game would be a lot better if you could have more than 5 characters in your active party too, and if there were unique enemies.\n\nPoorly documented in English, and in general too. The game doesn't actually tell you how many skill points you're earning and instead just gives you a percentage.\n\nStill, it's not BAD.

However, this game does bring about its own little tactical twist. If you're a huge fan of melee characters, you might not like this game as much simply because it's much more challenging to use them than ranged characters (or if you like challenges then ignore that point). Mages definitely shine here, as they do the most damage and allow you to burst rather quickly.\n\nI feel like the game is a bit underdeveloped, where the developers were in a rush so they just released it without more thought. It is a gem however in which that you don't really have to grind too much for an RPG, but it's just the right amount for you to be ok with as a casual gamer. Many unique features like fusion are set up. Don't expect gear, or items or such from a simple fresh turn-based tactical game like this.\n\nIn short, this game is definitely worth the buy to try (not full price), it offers a fun, tactical positioning, game where each unit matters (since you only use 5 per stage). For a PC game where it can't process many units at once, this game pulls off its simplicity very well. The music is NICE.","May 15, 2015","true","33.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I'm sure you'll agree.\nAs you can tell from the screenshots, the game is not very visually impressive and could probabaly run on the original Playstation. I would say most any computer can run it flawlessly, which is certainly a plus.\nThis game is 95% battles, so be aware what you are getting into. There is very limited story and gameplay outside of battles.\nWhile it plays similar to other titles such as Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre, it's not as deep or complicated.\nChoosing to attacking your opponents from higher alltitudes and from behind or from the side is the best choice generally, and your characters have a variety of skills they can use at the end of their turn which adds some fun customization options.\nYour characters do not equip anything, there are no stores or towns, and there are no inventory items.\nThere are many classes you start with, and if you level up the right skills and abilities for your characters, they will be able to change classes into something more powerful.\nThe artwork is pretty bad in my opinion, and the world is filled with women. There are no male characters at all in this game. That's a first for me, I've never seen that in a game.\nI found the music in battles to get annoying quickly, and the world map music, while unique to the floor you are on, is almost always forgettable and mediocre.\nThe sound effects however are very good, and some of the spell effects are very nice.\n\nIt took me over 40 hours to beat this game, but there is plenty of levelling I could still do, and the game lets you continue again after the final boss fight so you can keep grinding and earning achievements if you want.\nThis adds a lot of replay and that's certainly a plus.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like this sort of gameplay. In that regards you will not be dissapointed, but don't buy this for any other reason than gameplay, or you will be dissapointed.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's all that matters.\n","January 22","true","49.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","2"

You can pick up to 6 things from a list of actives, passives and overwatch/reaction skills.\n\nYou have limited "casts" of actives per battle, but outside of high tier star spells its hard to run out. There are no items. Passives are basically your items. If your strategy is good you'll progress, if not you wont. Simple as that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/semifinalaeon/recommended/312600/","semifinalaeon","Gulcasa of the Snowfall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/semifinalaeon/","170 products in account","To note: while I do recommend this game, I do so with careful consideration of the game's many MANY issues, which you'll find below. The playtime is not exactly correct (I did leave the game idling a few times), but I did beat it on Hard.\n\nAt its core, Rime Berta is an extremely barebones SRPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics (but without most of the depth). You get to command an army of 'puppets' with different classes, each with mostly unique skills, and occasionally change classes when you hit certain skill milestones and get to hire random units at the end of most battles. There are no items or inventory whatsoever, units can't change class outside of their own class trees and can't choose different branches of the same tree once you commit to one. Combat's fun enough when it works and I don't remember running into any glitches.\n\nNow, for the less than stellar details: this just might have the worst AI ever seen in a full-sized RPG. It makes FFT's Rafa running headlong into enemies look like a decision carefully debated by a room of philosophers. The AI does very little beyond moving forward and attacking and often does completely inscrutable things, like refusing to attack on a full AP bar, moving a wounded unit towards you to heal or, my favorite, using area attacks specifically so they can hit their own units along yours. At least a few times, the AI of the melee enemies simply turned off, presumably because their pathfinding broke and they couldn't find their way to my units. And honestly, said bad AI may actually be a boon, because at least on Hard, you're hopelessly outmatched stat-wise by the other units unless you do some severe grinding.\n\nAnd grind you will, at least once: skill progression is quite slow and the final level is such a huge leap in difficulty that I can't see anyone actually managing it without going back to the drawing board and making their units punch each other in the face for an hour or two. On the topic of wasting time: there are 80 achievements and may the good lord help you if you plan on completing them, because a solid 20 or so hinge on learning every skill from every class, and that's a massive chore. To cap it off, while the pixelated characters look pretty decent (if not very detailed), the art is atrocious and looks somehow worse than Touhou in the early years.\n\nSo why in the blue-skinned thunder♥♥♥♥ am I recommending this? Because, despite all of its flaws, it does quite nicely in scratching that tactical RPG itch; combat is reasonably fun, grinding for skills and class changes is actually rather addictive, the soundtrack is legitimately pretty good and the whole thing, despite being barebones, actually feels like there was some love put into it. I'm not quite sure about buying it for full retail, but if it ever comes on a good sale and you like SRPGs enough, give this badly named game a shot.","March 19","true","62.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

If you like Final Fantasy Tactics or the Fire Emblem series you'll feel right at home with this game. A few very specific things about this game are a bit problematic for veterans of the tactics type of games however. (Keep in mind some of these issues are only on HARD, and if you pick the normal difficulty you'll be fine against a few of these issues.)\n\nYou don't get you place down any of your units at the start, everything is just kind of preset based on where you have your various girls put into slots, so slot 1 always spawns in the same spot on level 1-1, etc.\n\nTheres no items. This isn't a huge problem however except for very early on in your gameplay, just because you start with only 3/5 character slots filled, level 1-1 is you vs 3. at the end of 1-1 you get a new girl in your party, which gives you 4 girls... level 1-2 is your 4 girls vs 8 (or 9 I don't remember), so unless you get really lucky with RNG or you will need to rerun 1-1 just to get your 5th girl slot filled.\n\nTheres no gear of any sort. The way you get powerful is based on leveling skills, which is also how you evolve your units into different classes. (I like this system but it can be confusing at first)\n\nThese issues are only really a problem in the very beginnings of the game, and they become non-issues after about 1-3, but I wanted to touch on them so you know what you're getting into and to tell you to NOT QUIT just because it is hard in the beginning, it gets better.\n\nOne small gripe I wanted to talk about with the game is that the controller support is a bit meh. The pre-game launcher could only detect like, half of the buttons on my wired xbox controller, like I couldn't get it to find my D-pad so I have to use my stick which can be a bit annoying. The other EXTREMELY annoying thing is that for some reason after I have input an action into the game, if I don't want to follow through with that action, pressing the cancel button on my controler doesn't actually cancel the input. I have to right click with my mouse in order to get it to cancel, but every other time I can cancel inputs just fine with my B button on the controller, not sure what that's about.\n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10 from me, just because of the simple controller issues, Gameplay itself is an easy 10/10 for this game genre.\n","December 18, 2014","true","11.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

It is very fun to play.\n\nIf you are looking for a SRPG easy to understand, simple, childish & innocent... the game worth. It gaves you approximatelly 35-40h of fun if you don't try to get all achievements and just "beat the game".\n\nIn the counterpart of this game, there is no optional things. You just fight "stages" until you end the game. No optional quests. Just passing stages as an old plataformer game. As any other good SRPG, you can grind to find out different jobs and skills. Sadly, it has to be replaying stages, since as I said, it doesn't have optional things. Just stages.\n\nSome people mistake this game comparing it with FFT (since it have jobs and stuff like that). I can tell that if you expect this game to be as good as FFT, you are wrong. It is a good game, indeed, but FFT is a masterpiece.\n\nThe art is nice, but as many other Japan games, it had a lot of girls, and in this case, a lot of lolis. This may disagree with some other players, but I actually enjoy seeing fantasy/innocent/beautiful SRPGs. There of plenty of "War themed" SRPGs in the market, so I kindda like this "change".\n\nThe story is simple. It looks more a tale for kids than a story for adults. Well, just looking at the art it gives you an idea that the game is pretty much childish. You won't see knights or archers bleeding until death.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a simple and childish SRPG, I totally suggest it but if you don't, you should really look another SRPGs in steam.","April 15","true","47.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Ap system in this game is in my opinon a dumb mechanic because it hampers what your characters can do within a turn.  You want to heal your ally, well you're not able to move this turn because of it.  Why do that?!  Also there are very little tooltips and no tutorial so without an outside source you'll be lost what some of the stats mean and various other things within the game.  Also, the story isn't the best.  Fire Eblem and Final Fantasy are known for having at least somewhat interesting stories but this one is bland and you can go multiple levels without even progressing the story through the dialouge.

It's a run of the mill tactical RPG whose major draw is the class/skill variety and character progression with it.\n\nCombat is alright with its use of action point mechanic - characters will naturally regain an amount of action points at the beginning of their turn, and each ability costs action points (some are expensive enough to require you to save up the points over the course of an additional turn), and when you have spare action points at the end of a turn, you can save them, or you can select a reaction skill (if your character has it) which is an ability that will trigger on the enemy turn when they do something - Examples include counterattacking, blocking (reducing physical damage), shielding a nearby ally being attacked, etc. Aside from that, the combat is not all that thought-provoking, with character facing being the only feature coming to mind.\n\nNow, the grind. Every single character skill (including standard attack) has a skill level associated with it. You gain that skill level by using the skill. Want to unlock the next unlockable class? Better spam that skill you'd never otherwise use so it levels up by the prerequisite amount. You can work in this into your standard play, by just making suboptimal plays in winning the fight as quickly/effectively as possible, or you can corner the AI, and continue flinging spells and swords at the air until you've leveled the skill to your satisfaction. This is a horrible mechanic, and has effectively ruined the game for me, which is a shame, because the character progression itself feels really good.\n\nThe story/art/sound/music all fit in the passable category, but there are no pleasant surprises buried in here.\n\nThe interface works, but it doesn't work well with me. Too much focus on using a mouse, and too little on keyboard.\n\nSave your money from this moderate disappointment, and throw it into something else - the Final Fantasy Tactics styled tactical RPG scene for PC still remains lacking.","March 8, 2015","false","6.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It lacks features like items, detailed plot, and multiple ways to heal units beyond what support units (clerics in the aforementioned games) can provide.\n\nHowever that does not mean it's a bad game.\n\nAs an indie game, its lack of features and arguably gameplay polish is quite evident.  The camera controls are unintuitve, but the developers allow you to select units from a list if your POV can't spot them.  Sometimes archers can't shoot down cliffs in certain situations, but mages laugh at the concept of terrain.  For many flaws, the developers have offered less frustrating workarounds.\n\nThe class system of this game is rather interesting.  Units much reach a certain skill level in prerequisite skills to 'promote.'  However promotion is not always ideal as units might lose the ability to use previous skills.  This helps force the player to carefully consider when to promote, what to promote to, and whether promotion is even ideal.  For certain job classes it may be best to recruit enemies of that class that surrender.\n\nThat's right!  In this game, your enemies surrender.  This isn't Tactics Ogre where your female unit has to beg a male counterpart for there to be that 10% chance where he joins.  While you can't recruit during a mission, you'll be able to use the new unit next time.\n\nCute girls are a definite plus.  The music is the one factor that helps this game go above and beyond the call of duty.  The title sequence is just catchy enough to not be annoying after it plays for the fourteenth time.\n\nSo is it worth the retail price?  Sadly, no.  Even though the game is good at providing workarounds for its frustrating elements, it lacks essential features common to other games of the genre who used to be sold at a similar price.  But if this game is on sale, it's not a bad idea to check it out.\n\n...  One may notice that my playtime has vastly exceeded 20 hrs.  Frankly, certain levels were so tedious (there's one that resembles a gauntlet with narrow passageways where you kill one enemy at a time and have to move through a passage where enemy bodies make it even more tedious) that I actually passed out at the computer late at night.  Even with the tedium, well, it's overall a decent PC SRPG.","August 20, 2015","true","42.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't bad - I actually enjoyed this part and went through the motions of trying to set up an efficient team and advance them. The levelling and upgrading systems are much to be desired, and they're very VERY slow, but there's an easy visual confirmation of stats increasing so it's rewarding enough to endure.\n\nMy main issue, overall, is the supreme lack of any coherent tutorial or manual. I went through the first six levels without knowing how to move or rotate the camera - I had to click on a ccharacter to move the screen (and for posterity's sake, it's a variation of right-click for these functions). The 'reclass' system is actually pretty nice, albeit with rather tedious/troublesome requirements, but some advanced warning of "You pick this class, you're stuck with it" would have been nice because I turned my best Archer into a Thief only to find out she's no longer wielding a bow AND she's stuck on the Thief job line (I could make her become an Archer again, but it'd be a waste since she cant branch into the other spec anymore and the necessary skills to progress are in the Thief class). The AI are either unforgiving or obviously daft, and a huge culture shock is that allowing your units to die has literally no adverse effects (since there are no items or restores, it's just that they pass out and cant be used for the rest of the map bar revives).\n\nI'd say this is a pretty cute game (and that I'd still be playing it a fair bit), but it's not something that everyone would like despite how likeable it is. The art and atmosphere are an acquired taste enough, but the mechanics are their own issue. Knowing this, if you like it enough to play it, go for it! It's pretty good all else considered.\n\nP.S.

I especially don't mind it since it was just a $5 flyer to see what it was about. I've spent $5 on bad pastries, and a kinda decent game lasts longer and won't give me a stomach ache.\n\nIn any case, one thing I have to agree with that I've seen in other reviews is the bad AI. I've seen it miss some obvious chances to kill my characters and fail to do simple things like change facing so that it's not exposing it's characters' backs. Healers and other units using self buffs seem to be the biggest offenders. Healer will step back, heal self or ally and then stay back turned to my girls. Not good.\n\nThe story has potential but it's never explored - at least so far. Too bad because it seems like it has the makings of something interesting - even with the "one place" setting. Azure Dreams did it fine.\n\nThe music might be one of the best things about the game. Very well done.\n\nI also like that it's not terribly complex, rules-wise but has some nuance around the AP system and the skill level system leading to class changing that's similar to the job level requirements in FFT, though not as freeform in terms of moving around the jobs (it's tree based unlike FFT, which is more freeform with what you pick and trees were mostly for requirements, not what characters can choose from).\n\nSo, overall, I will put a recommend on the game, because it's not terrible, but with the following cavaets:\n\n-Try to pick it up on sale/less than the full price.\n-Expect a simpler/more easygoing type tactical RPG. There's some nuance, but nothing complex or new.\n-Don't expect a major challenge unless you create one for yourself, if that's possible.\n-If you're willing just to spend some time with a more fun-like tactical RPG, this game will suit that purpose.\n-Enjoy the music. It's good. Heck, cheap enough and you'll have a low-priced game soundtrack out of it if you can record it and burn it to a CD or something.\n\nIf there's ever a Rime Berta 2 or the developer wants to make another tactical RPG...please work on your AI systems. It's easily the biggest failing of the game, imo.

Maybe consider picking it up on sale.","January 8","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vianmeor/recommended/312600/","vianmeor","vianmeor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vianmeor/","500 products in account","I really would like to recommend this game, but facing facts, a lot of things about it are clear problems for people who are trying to enjoy the game.\n\nAs a whole, it's a rather slow and simple tile-based JRPG (meaning the usual copious amounts of grinding and cutesy type of art style). This isn't bad - I actually enjoyed this part and went through the motions of trying to set up an efficient team and advance them. The levelling and upgrading systems are much to be desired, and they're very VERY slow, but there's an easy visual confirmation of stats increasing so it's rewarding enough to endure.\n\nMy main issue, overall, is the supreme lack of any coherent tutorial or manual. I went through the first six levels without knowing how to move or rotate the camera - I had to click on a ccharacter to move the screen (and for posterity's sake, it's a variation of right-click for these functions). The 'reclass' system is actually pretty nice, albeit with rather tedious/troublesome requirements, but some advanced warning of "You pick this class, you're stuck with it" would have been nice because I turned my best Archer into a Thief only to find out she's no longer wielding a bow AND she's stuck on the Thief job line (I could make her become an Archer again, but it'd be a waste since she cant branch into the other spec anymore and the necessary skills to progress are in the Thief class). The AI are either unforgiving or obviously daft, and a huge culture shock is that allowing your units to die has literally no adverse effects (since there are no items or restores, it's just that they pass out and cant be used for the rest of the map bar revives).\n\nI'd say this is a pretty cute game (and that I'd still be playing it a fair bit), but it's not something that everyone would like despite how likeable it is. The art and atmosphere are an acquired taste enough, but the mechanics are their own issue. Knowing this, if you like it enough to play it, go for it! It's pretty good all else considered.\n\nP.S. Your story characters are kinda worthless as anything other than meatshields. Get a mage and nuke people, instead.","January 5","false","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/recommended/312600/","Lyonesse","Lyonesse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyonesse/","202 products in account","[Neutral Review]\n\nAn "ok" game which I would recommend to everyone who likes Final Fantasy Tatics or similars, even though the game's plot is very dull and the levelling system has some really weird points.\n\nFor example, you'll level your character and their skills separately. The skills will only get EXP if you use them, which is okay, but the game allows you to spam the attack or buff skills in the total emptyness and win EXP by doing that. You can also gain EXP by attacking characters of your own team, which is also weird.\n\nI must repeat: the levelling system sucks - you'll suffer to evolve each character and levelling some skills will take time and demand LOTS of boring grinding. But even considering the game isn't that great, you can still have fun after all if you like turn-based strategy RPGs.","April 20","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There have a lot of dolls that protect it, some try to help her and some try to stop.\n\nYou control the dolls as your units in a strategy game, as you level them you can change their classes, every unit have tons of branches of classes that you can try, all of them moe cute girls.\nThe only hard part is that the battles is a little repetitive and you have to grind a little, but its fun because you can get new units and more cute doll girls to your party. :3\n\nI'm really sad that people try to compare it to great games and franchises instead of enjoying how simple and fun this is, so dont be afraid of the "mixed" overall reviews and give it a chance, you wont regret it.","April 25","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
