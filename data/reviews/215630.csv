Is the game worth around $10? Well that depends. Many gamers today aren't willing to invest into games that provide a mediocre experience. They only want to play games that are highly recieved. Gone are the days of going to the store and just picking out a game because the cover art looked cool. With reviews everywhere, gamers are more wary of their purchases. So I will say this, the game will not woo you. It will most likely be a forgettable experience. The controls are somewhat clunky and the animations are subpar. But is it worth your time? I say yes. Games like this reach towards the stars and fail poetically due to a lack of budget. IF you are looking for a decent Action RPG with an OK story to pass time, then I reccommend this game. If you only concern yourself with the highest quality of game out there, then I suggest you move along.","June 22, 2015","true","14.9"," 113 of 123 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","113","123","2","1"

It's not the worst game you'll ever play, but it's not terribly well designed, and it's kind of 'obvious' that it worked to a budget, which is a shame because it's got some nice visuals and as an RPG it manages to hit some of the right notes. It's got a lot of obvious bugs and half-finished elements, it's kind of clunky, and the story isn't amazing, and isn't really developed entirely well. I think the game tries to rely too much on the background The Dark Eye lore, which will appeal only to fans of that pen & paper RPG. The first couple of areas as well are a bit cumbersome, and it's not really that enjoyable a game to begin with.\n\nBut eventually, after about 10 hours or so, maybe? Towards the latter half of the second hub, suddenly you get a sense of... moorishness. By this time Cairon should have some better abilities & equipment, and should be levelled up to a point where he's actually slightly ahead of the curve for that area. This makes the fighting easier (but not boring), which stops some of the sluggish battles you may have had before this. Keep on top of things and this advantage can last you the rest of the game, and all in all it makes you feel like a little bit of a badass.\n\nAs an example, in a later hub section, I found myself confronted by three or four demons in armour, wielding some pretty nasty looking weapons. I was preparing myself mentally for long and difficult fight, and I ran at the first one and did that stabby move that's kind of like what Brad Pitt does in the movie Troy. The demon knight fell instantly - recovering from my momentary surprise, I repeated the move on the others, and then the fight was over. I felt like a total BOSS, and that's something that this game is kind of good at, especially in the later half.\n\nSo – all in all, if you find it cheap and are willing to put up with a rather poor start, this is one of those one-shots that can entertain you for a while. I finished the game in 26 hours, so it’s not short by any means, but it’s fairly linear for an ‘RPG’ so the story can only go on for so long.\n\nFor more information, especially about the specific mechanics of the game, check out my full review at Strategy Informer: http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/darkeyedemonicon/reviews.html","November 27, 2013","true","29.1"," 114 of 136 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","114","136","0","2"

But it's a game that's understandable, a game that anyone can play. It's actually fairly good for an action RPG. Until it becomes very repetitive as far as the quests are concerned.\n\nThe character and skill upgrade systems are refreshing. They aren't perfect, but at least they allow for a lot of customization, even if half of these upgrades aren't used all that much. You earn AP by finishing quests, killing enemies, you name it. These points can then be spend on upgrades. Each skill requires 4 blocks of points before it is entirely upgraded and there are about 10 skills in total. You can also spend these points on stats like strength and you also unlock a magic system early on that uses GP which can be earned pretty much the same way, but you have to use magic while doing things.\n\nQuests consist of kill and fetch quests and halfway through the game this becomes rather repetitive. This is also thanks to the not-all-that-exciting combat, which is real-time, by the way.\nThe graphics are sharp and pretty good, but the framerate drops in villages and I have no idea why. The villages aren't overly crowded and there aren't any spectacular visual effects in it either. Weird. Otherwise, the game runs well.\n\nThe voice acting isn't all that bad, even if some of the voices don't match the personalities of the characters. But then again, this is no AAA title so if we take that into account it isn't all that bad.\nDemonicon didn't disappoint me because I didn't really have any expectations so if you feel the same way give it a try. But if you want a quality RPG that isn't too repetitive look further.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","April 11, 2014","true","11.0"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","61","72","0","0"

I like the game quite a bit, not at all disappointed with the purchase. I played it pretty consistently until I finished it. Overall I'd rate it a 80/100\n\nThe story is dark, set in a world plagued by demons and monsters after some sort of cataclysmic magical apocalypse. The decisions you make have very real consequences both for those close to your character and for the city where you spend most of your time.\n\nThe game system works well - clearly heavily influenced by the Witcher 2. The combat is pretty good, but slightly rough around the edges.\n\nSo should you buy this game? Depends on how much you like RPG's with dark stories, and whether or not you are willing to excuse the combat for not being as good as Witcher 2, Skyrim, Dragon Age or KOTOR 1&2.\n\nFinally I'd like to address the "incest" thing. Clearly people were not paying attention as your character is not actually a blood relative of the possible romantic interest.","October 23, 2014","true","31.5"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","48","53","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/215630/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Dark Eye Demonicon is a third person action-RPG set within The Dark Eye series, a German tabletop role-playing game that outsells Dungeons & Dragons in the German market. You play as Cairon, a young man who suddenly acquires demonic powers when his blood is mixed with the blood of his sister. Some people begin to take an interest in you, and events unfold from there. It is a fairly straightforward tale, with plenty of twists and turns that are less than shocking along the way. But it is an interesting story, and it features one of the most often used tropes in role-playing games today: moral choices.At certain points throughout the story, you have to make choices that will affect how others will view you. Standard stuff, but the best part is that you will often have no idea how your choices will impact you in the future.As Cairon explores the world, he has a few methods with which he can dispatch his enemies. Attacking with your weapon and using whatever physical skills you have is the first method, alongside throwing weapons which he can use to attack enemies at a distance. And then there is magic, which is comprised of four spells with multiple unlockable variations for each spell. Both play well, and I used a mixture of the magic and the mundane as I journeyed through the game.Alongside your combat skills are your non-combat skills such as lock-picking and legend lore, which are used to acquire and unlock additional opportunities. If you upgrade your fast talking ability for example, you will be able to obtain greater rewards for quests or avoid fights entirely in some cases. But a key detail to all of this is the way in which you use experience, or in Demonicon, AP and GP. AP is used for physical oriented skills, non combat skills and primary stats, while GP is used to upgrade your magic abilities. This is an interesting feature, as you now have to choose between upgrading your skills and upgrading your stats when you obtain experience.  In theory you could turn Cairon into the least capable warrior in all existence, but in practice you will have increased everything at least moderately by the end of the game. You’ll want to level up everything at least somewhat equally, but the non-traditional character progression forces one to make careful decisions as you progress through the game.If there is one major problem that I can pinpoint in Demonicon, it would be the technical issues that pop up time and again.Textures would pop in and out when I entered conversations, the camera would often move by itself to the worst possible place imaginable during a battle and plenty of other technical glitches and bugs occurred during the 19 hours I spent with the game.With Demonicon being far from flawless, I found myself wondering whether or not I enjoyed it enough to give it a positive recommendation. Honestly, I did. Despite its issues, The Dark Eye: Demonicon remains a fun adventure that, while lacking polish, is an enjoyable journey through The Dark Eye setting.","January 30, 2015","true","56.5"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","48","56","2","3"

Its not very deep and has a few plot holes but manages to pull through. The areas in the game also ain't that big. Standard RPG formula, main plot brings the player to different places where he/she can choose to clear side quests(basically made up of kill this, collect that). Within the main plot there are crossroads where you will have to make choices and side with either faction. Without spoiling much, these choices affect that portion or area of the story but not much towards the ending. I've completed the game on my first playthrough within roughly 20hrs, minus all the afk and crash and completed almost all side quests.\n\nCombat/Skills/Stats/Crafting:\nCombat is action based not very fluid and flashy(it is a bit dull) but still passable and entertaining. Quite a limited Skill/Magic and Stats system, a far cry from other Dark Eye games and other "single character" RPGs. Again, nothing that really impressed me. Technically you can almost max them if you do grind the side quests. Crafting is very simple but kinda pointless, you don't really need the potions/buffs unless on higher difficulty.\n\nGraphics/Soundtrack:\nLooks more like a pre-2010 graphics, it looks somewhat dated therefore do not expect much on the looks of the surroudings, characters and world itself. Soundtrack is decent.\n\nOverall, i'd give it a 7/10. Plot and the backstory premise mainly the reason i play this game for.","October 27, 2013","true","22.4"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","45","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/215630/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","It's a WRPG without manual saving. What more do I gotta say?\n\nWait wait wait. Okay. If I had to put it simply, it's more or less if you made Witcher 2's combat very stiff and awkward, then mixed it with the one track mind of Dragon Age 2. Now that may sound horrible, but it's not for a lack of trying. Whatever miniscuile budget they had, the developers tried their best to tell a (mostly) coherent story that sprinkles around lore like it's going out of season. Beyond that though, there would be a LOT of reasons to hate it... if not for the fact that most of the sins that it commits were first perpetrated by Bioware, specifically Dragon Age 2. Which mind you, was critically acclaimed by hack journalists.\n\nSo let's begin\n\nA dialogue wheel that doesn't actually show you what you're gonna say? Yup.\nConsoley design and controls? Yup.\nLinear as hell and a slave to its main plot? Yup.\nBad character models and downright horrible animation? Yup.\nEnemies that kind of just, pop in out of nowhere? Yup.\nTwo choices rather than a third option you'd want to sensibly make? Yup.\nCharacters that stand around making idle threats rather than actually doing anything? Yup.\nInability to interact with the game world such as killing people, stealing from people, etc unless it's specifically involving the story in some way? Yup.\nReusing old areas? Yup. (Although Demonicon justifies it by writing the plots around the areas, rather than just copying and pasting old areas and telling you they're new.)\n\nIn terms of its own sins, Demonicon lacks a party system. I understand however, that it is a smaller adventure, so to have a second or third character that can level or change would be pointless, but I'd have been happy with a generic hireable that dies easily - at least then I'd have something to do with all the money I had, but more than anything, it just feels so weird to not have anybody allied with you for a segment despite it being clear that if it were any other kind of RPG, they'd be in your party or at least along for the ride.\n\nSpeaking of adventure... there isn't any. As mentioned, it lacks any kind of interactivity with the world, so it feels more or less like a static environment that you're running through, and boy oh boy does this game pack on the giant areas filled with nothing that just eats up your time, specifically, the giant empty monastery that you have to waste time running around in that reeks of not only filler, but running out of money. All you can really do besides following quest markers is go down a corridor that you can see on your map and maybe find a chest filled with junk that you sell at a vendor. It has exploration in terms of maybe finding a chest in the corner, but there are no side quests to find or anything of note besides maybe lore.\n\nSide quests. Another big problem. You find them on dart boards akin to MMORPGs and slap them to your dashboard with the markers to tell you where to get the seven pearls of Uranus or some garbage. Just take them all, there's no penalty either way, as they're all pointless fetch quests with nothing to offer and no choices to make. It's busy work.\n\nSo the main systems to the game - the role playing, the combat - has to at least make up for all that stuff, right? Well... Even on hard my first time, I found the combat rather trivial even despite not knowing how to parry. I seriously beat the game never parrying. I did end up doing a lot of combat rolls as a result, but even so, with just one combat skill and a few magic spells, I was able to trounce most of the game not using anything beyond my sword. In this regard, I can see what they were going for in terms of the replay value as an RPG, as there are a variety of combat skills and levels to the magic spells that you can't necessarily reach in one play through. I just felt I would have never had a use for any of it, especially when you only have 4 slots (4 for magic, 4 for skills, 4 for items) to put every ability. It is fun, don't get me wrong, and it is exactly the kind of action game I was expecting from that dog Dragon Age 2. Mixing and matching everything and doing the right commands in tandem with enemy animations works and it has a meaty feel to when you're slicing and dicing.\n\nIn regards to building the character, it's similar to The Witcher, where you're stuck as a single character with no customization per-se, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're able to build them to how you feel. So once again, the problem of a single person RPG comes into play, because Cairon is essentially a multiclasser. I maxed out the passive skills, so I was a top notch haggler and charismatic. I was a knower of medicines and could open any lock or disarm any trap. So on top of doing all that, I was brute in combat and could freeze you in place with magic. Huh? I don't feel like I role played as anybody, I just feel like I went on Theme Park RPG #361.\n\nSo let's say if they balanced the games stats properly, and you could actually miss out on a few things here and there and would need to replay the game to see them. Well, you could be potentially boned. Like lock picking. It's completely useless and a dump stat. You never find anything actually of worth in chests, even the few that actually require you to use rank 6  or 7. Whereas haggle for example, could be used to get a ton of points to spend by using it at several vendors at once, then upgrading it and doing it all over again. The problem arises in that some of the seventh mastery passives are never actually tested, because I assume the developers ran out of time and couldn't rejigger and balance things like they should have. There should have been several 5-7 rank chests that you couldn't open that had cool stuff in both early and later parts of the game, so you'd WANT TO invest in lockpicking, so I'd be Cairon the Rogue, rather than Cairon "Who Can Do Everything"\n\nDespite all that, and the fact that the game ending requires you going back to an old area THE THIRD TIME, I was  intrigued overall with the story. Characters never truly ring of good or evil, instead, seeming far more gray than I was expecting. It was seldom anyone was ever an outright jerk. The few choices you make actually made me feel confilcted, because they never offered you a clear conscience one way or the other.\n\n"Sure, you did X, but Y happened."\n\nDespite railroading you the whole way, those few snippets felt refreshing, whereas other RPGs would have made it very clear cut one way or the other of what my deed would wrought. I just wish it had more characters to meet, more stories to see and a far more satisfying ending.\n\nStill, I can't recommend it. It's no lost gem or even an unpolished one, it's a game that had a lot of aspirations, but had no feasible way to deliver them. I definitely don't dislike it, but hey, I actually put in the time to beat this game unlike Dragon Age 2, and considering the money EA/Bioware put into that turd - that's worth something.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+Surprisingly decent writing here and there\n\n+Choices that leave the player scratching their head (in a good way)\n\n+Fun junk food combat\n\n+Voice acting that was never embarrassing or truly bad\nThe Con's:\n-No real depth to the role playing\n\n-As linear as lines on a paper\n\n-The base price is asking a little too much\n\n-Certain combat mechanics don't actually seem to work or aren't worth using\n\n-Reused areas\n\n-Poorly designed filler content\n\n-Cairon is no Geralt","December 22, 2014","false","10.3"," 56 of 78 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","56","78","5","3"

However, for some reason this game still called to me, the world of The Dark Eye just seemed so interesting and so when I found it on sale for dirt cheap I had to satisfy my curiosity and i'm glad I did.\n\nDemonicon, without a doubt has it's flaws, but buried beneath these flaws is a game that could've easily been 9/10 had Kalypso taking their time and fleshed things out just a little more. The story, which is slightly cliche, is told wonderfully. The characters feel real and not like some extreme virtue of either good or evil. The decisions that are made throughout the game remind me of that of The Witcher Series in that no one choice represents true right or wrong necesarrily, but instead leaves it open for you to decide what is right and that puts you in some difficult spots. My only complaint with the story is the lack of an epilogue, which leaves the ending feeling lackluster and meak.\n\nProbably one of the best things done in Demonicon is the lore. From a city's history to the different demons of the world, the amount of detail put into the lore is outstanding and truly gives you insight into the happenings of the world. On the other hand some might consider the combat to be the worst. While it's true the combat is clunky and the stop-and-go fighting can be rather annoying, I found the combat to be enjoyable. Again another feature that is reminiscient of The Witcher 2 with and emphasis on parrying and thinking about your moves instead of just hacking away. It isn't as polished as The Witcher 2, but I didn't find it as bad as some say.\n\nFor me the worst aspects of this game are the bugs, the graphics, and the overall "lifeless" world.\nMost of the bugs are minor, such as your father randomly taking a knee throughout your conversation, but for a game that's been out for awhile now you expect most of these bugs to be gone. The graphics, while not terrible, certaintly don't look like the other realeases at the time. Demonicon looks like an early xbox 360 realeased game. The characters convey no emotions on their faces and if it weren't for the voices you'd proabbaly just assume they were tranquil with everything. The world also seems dead, sure there are people who inhabit it, but they all just stand around gazing emptily maybe talking to another citizen and it makes the city feel dead.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game to RPG fans if they can find it on sale. The story and the world will entrance you, just don't expect too much else from the game.","May 6, 2014","true","21.8"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

An action-rpg in the Black  Lands, dealing with the legacy of Borbarad - sounds good, at least in theory.\nLet's see how it holds up:\n\nLiked:\n- the content is mature (little SPOILER: there is a budding incestous relationship between our main protagonists)\n- the gameplay is on average pretty smooth, barring a few hiccups\n- the setting has been almost painstakingly recreated and the details border on continuity porn (if you don't know what that     is, look it up on tvtropes.org)\n- the story manages to pull you in and doesn't let up until the very end, with tough decisions, whose results you only see after a while, but for some there is always a third option depending on your skills\n-superb VA (at least in the german version, haven't tried the english yet; little spoiler: your father has the german voice of Liam Neeson)\n\nDisliked (well not actually disliked, but more puzzled by):\n- a couple of glitches in the graphics, nothing major or gamebreaking; I've seen a lot worse in AAA titles\n- something in the story progression that didn't make a lot of sense (SPOILER: you beat a powerful and annoying Rondrian and loot the armor from his corpse, only to be immediately offered a better demonic version by a demon - what's up with that?)\n\nBottom line: IMO Demonicon felt like a somewhat quality-reduced clone of The Witcher 2, which is a superb game and thus Demonicon managed to be at least a good game. If you liked The Witcher 2 and you need to pass some time until The Witcher 3 arrives, then Demonicon is the game for you. If you're a fan of The Dark Eye, then Demonicon is also for you, since this is the only game besides Drakensang that made me feel like I was actually walking through Aventuria.

You follow the story of a brother and sister, which takes place in the Dark Eye universe, who find out they have special gifts when their blood was mixed. You only play as the brother leveling up through action points and gift points you earn through battles. You can level up main stats like strength and vitality, skills like lockpicking, medicine, and speech or combat skills with the action points you earn. The gift points go towards your gift skills which are like magic powers.\n\nCombat in the game is ok. You have one mainattack besides the combat and gift skills. When attacking you need to time the button pressing right to continue your combo attack. Enemies can become bothersome or annoying sometimes when you go to attack and they keep hitting you and stopping your action. Controls did feel a little sluggish and slow when attacking. You do have a dodge roll which helps a little but your character seems to move slower than everyone else.\n\nGraphics look to be from something 10 years ago which isn't bad just not up to par with some games today. Plus it doesn't matter how a game looks if you enjoy it. Sounds were pretty generic and sometimes annoying. There are some parts in town when you are running around and NPC dialog got load and cluttered when it seemed like 10 people are trying to talk over one another.\n\nCharacters were pretty interesting and funny. You can choose different ways to go in the game and I chose mainly the good side of things. What was weird though was in some conversations it seemed like my character was rude and evil even though I would pick the better dialog route. The story overall wasn't bad and get me interested to see how it all panned out in the end. You could even do another playthrough to see where other actions would take you.\n\nThere were some issue with the game though. Framerate issues were a problem throughout the game. No matter where I put the settings I would drop as low as 15 frames sometimes which made for some rough video. I also would see pop in at times and screen tearing. I even had the game crash on me about 5 times when I was more than halfway though the game.\n\nDespite these flaws the game was still fun and intriguing. I liked some of the characters and even had some laughs here and there. It also has replay value if you'd like to see where the different choices would take you. If you can get the game on sale than pick it up and enjoy your time.","December 21, 2015","true","26.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helixapothecari/recommended/215630/","helixapothecari","HelixApothecari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helixapothecari/","29 products in account","I had totally forgotten I owned this game, but being a huge fan of the "The Dark Eye" universe, I finally had to try it. So please keep in mind during the review that I'm not a genre veteran, but rather a casual player who hoped to find a consistent implementation of one of his favourite universes...\n\n((TL;DR at the end))\n\nThis game doesn't start out as a heroic adventure, but instead shows the harsh and gritty reality of refugees in the demon-cursed Shadowlands. You play as Cairon, a young man with a mysterious gift, who finds himself in the middle of mysteries and intrigues in the recently freed city of Warunk.\n\nIt's definitely one of those games which need some "warm-up time". The graphics aren't up to date, and combat doesn't feel very smooth, especially in the beginning before you get your first maneuvers. Cairon starts out as a slightly annoying loudmouth (at least that's how it felt to me), but gradually turns into a more layered character. The more you learn about his past, the better you understand his opinion of the world around him.\n\nThere haven't been many huge decisions yet, but the ones so far always made me stop and ponder to find the lesser of two evils. You really have to choose between a rock and a hard place here! The fact that there's hardly a choice without a downside fits the general atmosphere well.\n\nDemonicon uses a watered-down version of the TDA skill system, which allows a rather detailed customisation. You can invest in basic attributes (which influence a few other things), skills and combat maneuvers, while your "gift" powers are levelled separately. Depending on which skills you favour, you might gain access to additional items within the game world, helpful information, or different dialogue options. While you might have expected Persuasion to help with the latter (as usual ;)), you might be surprised to find out that Legend Lore can be just as helpful.\n\nThe story itself starts out slow, but gains momentum after a while. The more you find out, the more new questions are raised. It's not the most epic example of storytelling, but it's enough to keep you entertained. As a seasoned roleplayer, it had a very "pen & paper campaign-y" feel to me, actually. I'm not yet sure whether that's a good or bad thing - or maybe it's both.\n\nSpeaking of pen & paper, I would like to finish this review by adding the perspective of a seasoned "The Dark Eye" player. Those who don't know the universe might have a totally different view on the game, so if that applies to you, take the following with a grain of salt (or skip it altogether). As a warning, it also contains spoilers - but it would be hard to discuss the relevant topics otherwise, sorry!\n\nSo, does this game really feel like TDA? The answer is "kind of". Of course, the atmosphere in the Shadowlands hugely differs from the setting a pen & paper TDA player will be used to. People feel forsaken by the Twelvegods and first and foremost care about their survival (and the next meal). The background is in keeping with the p&p setting (a definite plus for me), and one might recognize a lot of "historical" events and big players. This, of course, makes some ingame informations redundant or "old news" to seasoned TDA players, but as the game tries to appeal to a broader market, one should accept it as a "refresher course" in Aventurian lore ;)\n\nThere's a downside to knowing those things already, though. I could easily foresee a lot of plot twists by applying my TDA background knowledge ("oh, it must be a case of X because only Y would be able to...", "the mysterious NPC is probably [official NPC] because...", and so on). Said knowledge also made me VERY reluctant to accept certain quests, use some items, and (perhaps most importantly) make full use of Cairon's "gift", as I knew that in Aventuria, all those things are VERY VERY BAD STUFF(tm). Players not well-versed in TDA lore might enjoy those apects of the game, but I just sat here and thought "no, I don't WANT this, but game mechanics make me do it... this sucks!" I should probably mention that I usually play the "good guys" in the p&p, and the furthest I go is dark grey with a tendency to turn lighter... even my demonologist hates demons and just wants to exorcise them ;)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL;DR: Do I recommend this game? Yes, tentatively. If it happens to be on sale, fans of the genre or setting should definitely take a look at it. Demonicon is a flawed, but still entertaining game. Experienced TDA players might enjoy the grittier take on Aventuria, but will also be able to foresee some plot twists.","May 8, 2015","true","10.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blu52/recommended/215630/","Blu52","marv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blu52/","503 products in account","Noumena Studios is able to pull off a better BioWare game despite coming uncomfortably close to putting Baldur's Gate fanfiction of Imoen to code.\n\nFollowing The Dark Eye Pedigree to the letter, there is nothing about Demonicon that does not involve the likely foreign and confusing lore of Adventuria. Fortunately for the player, the key aspects of this game are immediately and consistently explained to the point that anyone could become an expert on Borbarrad and his teachings, whether or not they care to hunt down all the legends and specific conversation choices.\n\nThe fact that they are able to successfully craft a compelling narrative out of Borbaradianism - that is a demonic mixture of two parts extreme Nietzchean philosophy, three pinches of Social Darwinism inspired ritualistic sacrifice and a whole helping of Objectivism, present your potential adversaries as more than just giggling maniac cultists. There is a real methodology to the evil or demon worshiping characters in this game that is as morally questionable as it is seductive; “Every man – A Mage” and the pursuit of freedom through the power of Blood Magic which often comes at the cost of enslaving and murdering others.\n\nOutside of the inexplicable charm of the story, there is a tight combat that is a comfortable blend of simple Action RPG slashing and spell flinging. Easy to pick up yet difficult to master, Demonicon is as pen and paper as you can get without scripted irritation from a wrathful DM.\n\nAs for cons, however, this game has a strange sense of what should have the effort to be animated and what will be skipped over abruptly - to the point where I am always surprised whether I have high or lower expectations of what the game will do. It has difficulty keeping characters out of making the same arm folds or generic dramatic finger points for the 100th time, yet it has the depth to program taking a single bite out of an apple and then casually tossing it aside in order to anger the parents of starving children, if the player so chooses to be a Rear Admiral Dickbutt for one specific part of the early game.\n\nIt is a lower budget indie RPG and I wouldn't have it any other way after experiencing it in all its flawed glory.","December 7, 2013","true","25.9"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","1"

It's easy to pick on talents and they all make sense at various points of the game. The story turned out great after a very sceptical start, just try to read and listen to all there is - I left no stone unturned and had no difficulties or got stucked. The graphics remind me of something between Gothic and Risen - not the best, but in my opinion RPGs don't need this, since the atmosphere is typically "Black Eye". Side-quests and Missions are easy and most of the time you have to go to "A", kill "B" and deliver "C" to "D" but always fair balanced at your point of state. The main-quest may be played different, at some points of the game you are asked to make final decisions which result in continuation and/or various endings, which I couldn't really prove as the game doesn't allow you to save your success, it saves automatically. First I thought this would be a disadvantage but this rule turned out most realistic to me and you may play the game again, choosing another way, very interesting.\nOverall: A solid RPG with hardly no bugs, an interesting story with many turns and more than 12 hours to play, if you read, play and listen to the whole story.

I'm a huge fan of RPG's but had never heard of this game until i saw it in the sale. The game can seem very linear and a little simplistic at times but you can forgive that with the in depth storyline and fluid combat. The areas can be quite small and although it's techincally free roam in these areas with side quests it doesn't always feel that way. The Game does have some basic customization with armour and weapons but could be better, i found myself with a massive amount in my inventory throughout the game but not a lot to do with it other than make potions, add runes to weapons or armour and equip these new and improved weapons and armour. The Graphics are OK and it's nice to have choices with dialogue throughout the game. I was impressed at the length of the game and the entire game has voice acting which is a bonus. But there is a lot of talking so if you have a short attention span this may not be for you as although the dialogue can be skipped the storyline is very in depth and can get confusing if you miss any. The  game has quite a complex level up system which can be very hard to grasp at first but gives quite a few options to change gameplay such as fast talking to open new dialogue options and different branches of magic to mix up combat. This is a great game to pick up in the sale as although i find it to be a great game it doesn't match up to some of the other great RPG's with a similar full price price tag such as skyrim. The biggest problem with this game is the lack of manual saving and to some people i can see why this would be unforgivable as i have died serveral times on hard difficulty and have been put back to my last save 10 minutes earlier so i have to kill everyone and loot the area all over again.","February 17, 2015","true","20.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

If you can look past the funny voice acting, the hilarous script and the bipolar tendecies of your hero Cairon, then you are in for a very funny ride.\n\nThe graphics of the game were average at most, not bad and also not that good. Just average. There are a few graphical options to choose from in order for you to tweak your experience with it i guess.\nThere will be a few instances where some textures take time to load or will not load at all, but this happened rarely.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is really funny to me. There's the obligatory english/british accent and what really makes it funny is the script. It is like they really wanted Cairon to sound like the most bi-polar hero you'll ever encounter. You can be mad in one moment and immediately be the paragon of kindness in the next.\n\nThe consequences in the game are shown to you in a cutscene whenever you finish the quest chain that had you make the choices. It sums up your choices in a very creative way, i love the presentation. The consequences themselves range from things you can live with, things you can't sleep at night about and things that are cartoonishly evil.\nThe thing i like the most is that while you can be a total ♥♥♥♥ to everyone, your dickishness won't lock you out of doing good things and you have a chance to turn it around should you wish to. There is also a fair amount of flirting since apparently a ton of women find Cairon attractive.\n\nThe story of the game revolves around the two siblings, Cairon and Calandra, and their "destiny"\nI won't really spoil anyone reading this but one of the main bits of the story itself is actually revealed in the steam trading cards you get from the game.\n\nThe combat is annoying at first. Like really. It takes a while to kill something, imagine getting swarmed while you still have the starting equipment. But it does get easier as you progress, though some skill combinations kind of break the game for me as it makes you near invincible. (Feint+Nova, Ice Lance+Mortal Blow. Plowed through hordes of enemies with it.)\n\nThere isn't much variation between the weapons and armor that you get, most of them look similar to each other if not totally the same except for the stats that it has. There isn't really a class since you just tweak your skills to your liking.\nMy Cairon was a fast talking, persuasive, lockpicking, trap disabling, spell throwing, sword slashing, medieval ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI absolutely loved playing Demonicon and i'm seriously considering a few more playthroughs with different choices like\nflirt with Girl A instead of Girl B or be a ♥♥♥♥ to NPC A instead of being a ♥♥♥♥ to NPC B, etc etc etc.\n\nYou don't have to buy it at full price if you don't want to, i got this game in a bundle and i totally recommend getting it that way too if you're on the fence about buying the game.

With every monster I killed I became more powerful by upgrading my skills, abilities and magic.  What powers I upgraded determined how I interacted with the medieval style fantasy world I existed in.  Upgrade my healing abilities and not only did potions work better on me but I was able to heal others on my journey.

As long as the controls work and the premise isn't half-♥♥♥♥♥, I'm happy. This is very much one of those. If you're looking for a game to blow you away with graphics, or let you roam the world endlessly, this is not the game for you. However, if you enjoy good story-telling and some fun gameplay to go with it, this is a good pit stop. The biggest claim to fame for this game is the DnD type feel. You're never much stronger than your enemies. You have ongoing side plots and decisions you make matter for the future. If you like DnD and RPGs, take this one for a spin. You won't regret it.\n\nOnly 1 complaint: no fast travel and your movement speed is kinda slow out of combat. Near the end of the game there's a section where you'll ravel over the same area like, 7 times. Put on an audio book.... you'll be briskly jogging a lot.","June 30, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can't use half your keyboard and only have 4 potions on shortcut at a time... yeah!\n\nThe combat ist super easy and extremely boring. It's basically rolling around, spamming left click to beat someone to death and occasionally cast something. Even though I specialized my character into casting spells neither did I have the essence (mana) to cast a lot, it didn't really deal damage either. In the end I found the talent that made me practically an invincible killing machine... didn't get more exciting from there. On the plus side you can finally invest loads of points into non-combat perks and still beat the game. Generally the perks are way more important than passive stats anyway. New dialogue options, better gear, healing people, finding traps, picking locks etc.\n\nThe story (the reason to play an RPG imho) is... not bad but not really good either. It's a typical "save my love from a demon" thing. The visual presentation is a little dull since the characters show little emotion in dialogues. What annoyed me the most was that the story went straight in a direction that was "choose one of the optionsthat you don't want that screws over your character" and finally you get blamed for taking decisions you didn't even take. Maybe some of those triggers were faulty. Made the end a lot worse, though.","February 7, 2014","false","15.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

There are a fair amount of twists and the story tends to stay fairly interesting throughout. There's a lot of choice and consequence throughout, though the ending is a let down in this aspect.\n\nIt uses The Dark Eye rule system (like Drakensang and Blackguards) which tends to make character progression and building quite fun and rewarding. There's a handful of normal stats and skills and you get rewarded for making potions, opening locks, identifying lore, collecting plants etc.\n\nIt's an ARPG due to the action combat, which I hate, by it's far from the worst implementation I've ever played. I never found combat to be overly clunky or difficult and the story was good enough for me to push through to the end. I did find that spell points to use for improving spells being rewarded based on spell usage during a fight to be a nice feature.\n\nThere are some annoyances worth mentioning though. Demonicon does seem like a budget title (though with very solid writing). It isn't a long game, taking me about 10 hours to complete the entire game plus all the side quests I could find. Levels are fairly railroady and there's limited exploration (think Dragon Age 2). There's also a limited number of game areas and one dungeon gets reused 4 times for different quests. There's also semi limited itemization (this is no Baldur's Gate, but a fry cry from say Of Orcs and Men). It also uses an auto save feature rather than save anywhere which can be quite annoying.\n\nOverall I enjoyed most of the experience and would pick up another RPG by the developer.","April 11, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Today I was thrilled to find it on sale, so I excitedly purchased it and could not wait to play it...\n\nI wasn't far along in the game before  becoming very frustrated. The combat system is terrible, I cannot for the life of me understand why a modern game is so hampered by such awful game mechanics. To compound the problem, the save system is appalling. I found myself dying way too easilly, then I'm stuck having to replay useless game time rather than simply being able to start where the battle begins. Initially I thought perhaps I was supposed to save the game manually - so  I went hunting for a fast save key.  But.\, of course,  the game, has automatic save. Why would a developer choose a game structure that would force you to replay and replay territory you've already been through only to be faced with clunky, frustrating combat?  To me, these two issues add up to a game that, in its present incarnation, is unenjoyable and aggravating. I'd like to say that for $40 a consumer deserves more, but... there's more to talk about.\n\nOn to other issues  you should know about before buying it.  The game does not allow for ANY character customization whatsoever. Not even the choice of a name,  Oh, and if you planned on playing as the female protagonist, as I did, forget it. You start the game as the brother and have no choice about that. As a woman gamer, I prefer to play as a woman.. I will even skip a game that doesn't give me the option. Unless, like the Witcher, the game itself is good enough ot offset that glaring oversight.  It's 2014 - how hard can it be to give us that option? It never fails to shock me when developers don't get why women gamers feel this is important. Yup - it's my bad for assuming. I should never have seen the female character and assumed she was playable.\n\nI could not for the life of me figure out how to use the health potion - or to equip it. Why did this game have to be so complicated? And mana potions? I don't know if there were any. The point at which I gave up I was forced to fight lesser bad guys to obtain their "essence". Why did everything in this game feel like a struggle rather than entertainment?\n\nPerhaps the issue is me. Indeed,  I've been  spoiled by games like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age. Mass Effect. However, I've been similarly spoiled by Indie games like Path to Exile. It's a shame really because this had the elements to be an excellent game.If they improved the combat system and incorporated a worksble save system, I could classify this as playable. The way it is right now, however, I'd call it a headache maker. Amd for goodness sake - it is certainly nowhere near worth $40!\n","August 31, 2014","false","2.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Be sure to invest in special moves (big hit and roundhouse) and gifts (freeze, speed/shield) as those are essential for bosses and the more difficult monsters. The normal hacking is only good for weaker monsters. You should also spend AP points on attributes such as Strength and Courage as well (and some vitality) but don't put too much into talents as they are pretty useless generally (except for medicine which is useful for recovery).

Using magic during fights converts some of the earned points in to "gift points" that can be exclusively spent upgrading magic abilities. The remainder of points can be spent on combat special abilities, skills (up to rank 5 of 7), stats that improve 2 skills, or stats that effect your combat capabilities.  Investing in skills early is a sure way to earn ongoing dividends throughout the game.\nStory was... interesting.  Well crafted universe with plenty of detailed back story, however the game does expect that you the player will memorize it.  Just learned a complex, multi-sentence incantation? Better hope you remember it precisely when it comes time to enter it because the game provides no "your character knows this, so click here for the correct option" which is a bit jarring given the "follow the blinking quest marker to the hidden clues" hand-holding presented at various points.\n\nLargest complaint: No manual saves. I understand that this is intended to actually invest you in the choices you makein the context of the Role Playing aspect by removing the ability to trivially alter your choices, but it can also be somewhat obnoxious when exploring large areas to have to find the next thing that triggers a save point.

Real time hack-n-slash that also gives a moderate amount of actual character customization, with upgrade paths not just for spells and combat moves, but general stats, haggling, crafting, perception checks, lock picking, and more.

If this is a yes or no question then:  Yes.  But honestly it's not a great game, let alone RPG.\n\nThe game is mostly a guilty pleasure, it's not really a fantastic game.  It's a competant 3rd person RPG with some pretty awful combat mechanics and animations.  Enemies can juggle you in combat, they will cheese you and you'll find yourself dying more out of poor mechanics then being outwitted or outplayed.  The story is almost incomprehensible at times and honestly too much - I ended up skipping/skimming dialogue towards the 2nd half of the game.  For an RPG there isnt much character development; you invest XP earned in skills and magic.  It becomes very easy to know which skills to use at the beginning and to only upgrade them.\n\nThroughout the game you're presented with dialogue choices with NPCs as you complete quests, you are given a black or white decision to pick.  The problem is that these decisions never impact the game in anyway, some just open or close quests that may occur.  The gameworld does not change, any meaningful change occurs after the credits roll or when the narrator tells you of your actions consequences for the future.  I would even say that the overal plot was pretty bland, though I do appreciate what they tried to do - just the execution was poor.\n\nOne of the worst things about the game is the lack of saving.  There are no manual saves, instead the game opts for checkpoints only at specific points of the game.  It's agravating entering into a new zone, picking up a few quests and killing a few mobs just to enter a house and have a trap instantly kill you.  Loading the checkpoint brings you back 10-15 minutes prior having you kill those mobs and talk to those NPCs all over again.\n\nAnother poor aspect is the inventory system, and the world economy.  You'll end up getting really good gear quickly and you keep looting what is quite frankly junk.  The worlds merchants simply do not have anything to offer you or the coin to take your stuff.  You end up having to buy junk you may need, such as ingredients for potions, just to sell your junk.  This is compounded by not having a weight limit for your inventory, your inventory ends up having pages and pages of items and its nigh impossible to find anything you need.\n\nAlso crafting is pretty awful, even when maxed there are only 3 "healing potions" you can make - where one is honestly the only one you'll be using.  To make them you'll need to appropriate materials but they are finite in the world.  Gear crafting is similarly poor, you insert upgrades into your gear but you cannot remove the upgrades so you're constantly ditching and rebuying your gear if you want to upgrade.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 3/5, I dont see myself playing it again for awhile.  It has two endings, but both can be obtained at the very end without any previous choices influencing your options.  I did most if not all sidequests, about 19 hours.  If I had listened to every single NPC proddle on about their drama it would be about 20-21 hours.  Beat the game on normal - it's not a hard game, as with all RPGs it gets easier as you play it and level.","February 13, 2015","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/215630/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Demonicon is a third person rpg that mostly takes place in one town and it's surrounding areas. There is a bit of freedom to explore, collect plants and attempt to pick the locks of chests scattered about. The world itself is quite gritty touching on subjects such as incest, cannibalism, a seemingly incurable plague sweeping the already starving refugee camp and more. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are times in which the game can leave you grinning. One of the best aspects of the game is the decisions you will be making, there is no good or evil, you just have to pick whichever seems like the lesser evil and hope what you did was the more justifiable action. Another surprising aspect of the game is that some villains you can really sympathize with and are saddened when you are forced to come to blows.\n\nWhich brings me to the combat. It is like Fable but somehow worse. You can dodge, parry and use magic along with swinging your weapon but it just feels very flimsy. Especially when you use any weapon that is not a sword, the range of it will be insanely low and half the time doesn't connect. There is a combo system that grants you more mana and a higher chance for critical damage the higher it goes and it is the only way to regain mana.  Unfortunately there are only four spells in this game and none are particularly interesting.  The way you upgrade in this games are through combat/missions and will be rewarded points for the skills you've used be it magic or melee. The noncombat skills like fast talking and plant lore use the same points as combat which I found to be a nice way of making you decide which you should upgrade first.\n\nNot much to say about the graphics, they are serviceable. The environments look okay, cities are worn down, refugee camps look absolutely miserable and swamps have a certain air of dread. There are not really any memorable places you go to, they all seem to blend together minus the swamps. Character models are fine but the animation for walking and fighting feel off. The sick people do truly look like they are on the verge of death with some grossly irradiated skin that looks like fire wounds. The enemy variety is good and enemies differ from area to area.\n\nThe story Demonicon is trying to tell is interesting enough to play till the end but it can end up being quite comical at times due to subpar voice acting. I enjoyed the music, it was epic when need be and pretty catchy during strolls through town. The NPCs spout the same dialogue each time you pass by which can be pretty annoying hearing the same guy trying to unsuccessfully seduce a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since the start of the game. One of the games biggest problems is the lack of manual saving, imagine finding all of the hidden loot, assigning some of your points to your skills, bartering with merchants and the game crashing before you reached the checkpoint erasing all of that progress. It makes it feel much more linear than it should be.\n\nOverall Demonicon is an ambitious low budget game that feels rough around the edges. It took me a bit over 15 hours to complete but I didn't do any sidequests. In my opinion this isn't really a must have title but it is enjoyable for those wanting a decent story full of decisions to make. I wouldn't recommend for those seeking fun gameplay, a fun world to explore or good character development. It is a game whose strength is in it's story not the adventure. I give a sideways thumb :p","December 13, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(Drakensang would be the other title I'm aware of)\n\nCombat is not excessively tactical, but I was not bored, and found the levelling up and skills system fairly satisfying.\n\nThe story premise is interesting, and the voice acting was particularly excellent for a title that probably did not have enorous budget: recognize and like both lead actors a lot. Special thumbs up for making my in-game dad so insufferably illogical in his little schemes, and allowing reasonable amount of back-talk to the old geezer!\n\nI think this title is worth a try for RPG fans whom do not mind action -RPG combat but enjoy a back-story.","April 4","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/215630/","Resoula","Resoula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/","263 products in account","This game was amazing. Not perfect, but not the trash a lot of the reviews try to make it out to be. I'll make a Pros and Cons list and try to be as honest as possible with this review.\n\nPROS:\n-Very in-depth and immersive story-line. Very well thought out and it will hold your attention from beginning to end.\n-The dialogue is perfect. From the serious encounters, to how people act during the Dragon Age style questioning for information, to the comedic relief. I find it amazing how in the most serious and despair-filled sections, this game can still make me laugh my ♥♥♥ off while staying completely appropriate to the situation at hand.\n-The voice acting is just wonderful. Really backs up the already awesome story-line and dialogue.\n-The fighting is no spam-clicker. You don't just press one button to win. The combat is about combining fighting abilities with magical powers with dodging with parrying with hack-and-slash combo chaining- while leaving out button mashing by making the chaining work in a rather unique way. (You wait to swing til after your first swing is done, otherwise the chain breaks) I really love the combat in this game. It's very good at making you feel like a badass as you slaughter a horde of 50+ bandits or 20+ thick-skinned lizard wolves that are spitting poison at you. The difficulty in combat doesn't even exactly scale. It's very much skill-based, bosses are always harder of course, but it's not like you go from one area to the next and suddenly the enemies there apparently know how to fight 40x better. Very realistic in that manner.\n-The graphics are pretty darn good even for today. It's no Witcher 3, but it's still good.\n-The sounds in this game really help create the setting. From the very beginning of the game you will easily notice what an astounding job they did creating the sounds for the game.\n-The music helps set the mood always at the right moment. Get in a fight? The badass music kicks in. Running around collecting plants? Nice peaceful music to accompany.\n-Very detailed skill customization system based on AP you can put into fighting skills, attributes, and story-opening abilities like fast-talk (persuasion), Locksmithing, and Legend Lore (Really comes in handy in some convos.)\n-Pretty darn good crafting system for the enchanting/poisoning/upgrading of your items as well as crafting potions and poisons to give you an edge in battle.\n-A magical skill system where you earn GP (Gift Points) that you may spend on upgrading your current spells, or unlocking new ones, from four different categories.\n-Very appealing set of characters. I have not met one character in this game that I considered to be "bland" that I would not remember if i thought back on this game. They're all very memorable and very well thought out.\n-Replay-ability value. The game's story progresses with the choices you make, so you can always give the game a second shot and pick the choices you didn't the first time and experience a very different game.\n-Length of the game. 9 hours into the game I was so amazed I was still on chapter 1 (out of 5 chapters). This game gives you a very in-depth and lengthy experience for the money you pay.\n\nCONS:\n-The engine is not very compatible with AMD-based equipment. I occasionally get some randomly screen flickering, tearing, and sometimes the graphics become hazy/messed up.\n-Not multi-GPU compatible. If you run multi-GPU with this game you receive a lot of stuttering, making it impossible to play. (This may only be with AMD Crossfire however.)\n-You cannot save the game. You need to rely on autosaves. The game does save at all the right moments (almost) and holds on to enough saves in case you'd like to go back however.\n-Lack of free roam. You run into invisible walls all the time, breaking immersion.\n-Lack of free roam x2. You cannot re-visit old areas at whim (say if you want to pick up something you missed or talk to an old character.) You can only move areas when the story allows it. So make sure you know what doors you're going through and make sure you get everything you need before you move onto the next area.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: I give this game a solid 8.5/10. This is a really good game, definitely worth picking up. It's not perfect by any means and there's definitely some RPGs that could out-due this one and many more coming out. But this game is definitely worth the money, full price or on sale, and I'd definitely recommend getting it.","July 23, 2014","true","19.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Having just beaten the game this morning, I feel very comfortable recommending this game to RPG fans, or anyone looking for a unique and enjoyable story.\n\nDemonicon's strengths lie in its commendable use of The Dark Eye universe, it's RPG & skill systems, the creative and thoroughly engaging story line, the focus on narrative and characters, and a well implemented choice system that affects the story and game world.\n\nThe Dark Eye ruleset may not be represented to the degree that you see in Drakensang, but Demonicon's skills, spells and combat abilities are very well implemented. Its a joy to play a game that puts such high focus on character skills, such as Perception, Fast Talk, Lock Picking, etc. I highly recommend focusing on skills and spells (and less so on combat abilities) if you play the game. I also do recommend playing the game on Hard, as it is quite easy.\n\nCairon's tale may not come across as truly unique in the first half of the game, but those who play all the way through to the end will enjoy a well paced and fairly well written tale that delves into Barboradianism. I've played a lot of RPGs, and I will always remember Demonicon's story - it is the game's standout feature. I really don't want to touch on the story line much, as I feel it is best for the player to delve into it with as few preconceived notions as possible. Suffice it to say that the plot synopsises and game descriptions do not give it justice.\n\nDemonicon places a lot of focus on character interaction and player choice. You will spend a siginificant amount of time in conversations with other characters, and in several points throughout the game what you say and decide will affect the game world, the characters and the story. The interplay of the strong, unusual story with the choice system that allows the player to shape how it develops and ends is quite gripping.\n\nCairon may come across as a stale lead with poor attitude, but he develops well across the story, and I ended up being quite fond of him by the end of the game. He also has the distinction (late game) of wearing what is easily one of the coolest sets of armor I have ever seen. I was constantly taking screenshots of Cairon in his end game gear - it is exceedingly creative and morbid.\n\nAnother factor that helps to amplify the impact and appeal of Demonicon's tale is the well realized game world. The graphics may be dated, but the locations throughout the game are distinctively bleak. Demonicon possesses its own imaginative, sepulchral take on The Dark Eye universe that extends from impressive locations, atmosphere, mood and detail to outright kooky and disturbing events and supporting characters. There is a heavy fixation on the undead, necromancy, demons, suffering, plague, prostitution, and damnation - and I believe it was handled in a way that elevated Demonicon into something quite unique among RPGS.\n\nI believe you play Demonicon for the kooky and imaginatively morbid storyline, the immersive game world, and the well designed choice & rpg systems. These are all wrapped up in dated graphics and sloppy combat - but I find most old school rpg players are quite accustomed to that by now;  the graphics and gameplay fit like an old shirt that brings back memories.","March 24, 2014","true","26.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddtrongames/recommended/215630/","oddtrongames","Dmitry Odd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddtrongames/","117 products in account","The Dark Eye Demonicon – the German RPG based on a popular board role-playing game which long time frightens us by the emergence. Developers from Noumena Studios promised much that interesting. I held the breath…\nAs you already likely guessed history, events in game take place in the Universe of The Dark Eye. There isn't a lot of games on the Universe, generally it is the projects focused on old audience of gamers to which give the deep I will give a ride, a heap of dialogues... The Demonicon project the company of developers constantly had difficulties. The project of 10 times was on the verge of life and death. Some years later, at last it appeared. With a sinking heart I started it. Let's look...\n\nThe history narrates about destiny of the brother and sister, their lives appeared in whirlpool of terrible events. Plague presses people, darkness, necromancers zapolonyat the lands which are once belonging to elves, gnomes & people. The young soldier his sister the warrior, try to obtain citizenship in the last big city of people.\n\nThe plot of the game The Dark Eye Demonicon not the most original, but here at least is available an intrigue. (I love such things)\n\nTheir father didn't think up anything better, than to give out the daughter for one grandee who had to provide them accommodation. The sister doesn't want under a wreath. Her brother tries to bring to reason the sister, but she starts having to him absolutely other feelings. The history twists, the sister of the main character is kidnapped by one witch the Elf who speaks about a terrible event.\n\nSpoiler! We learn that they not the brother and the sister, not relatives. They are given rise in the temple, in certain incubators where allocated them with special force and named "Awakened". In total such people seven to make a prophecy they have to meet in fight where only one will survive. And he will also become the only paladin who will become at the head of the church granting to people the world and rest. The main character tries to find answers in attempts to remove this damnation and the beloved. When it finds it, the damnation already finally captured soul of the girl and for her rescue the main character goes to other world. But the prophecy says, there will be one. one of lovers endows himself to seal angrily forever\n\nGameplay\n\nThe Dark Eye Demonicon not absolutely classical RPG, It isn't similar not the last game on this Universe of Drakensang at all: The Dark Eye. In it the hero's choice isn't provided to players, it is impossible to choose neither a hairdress, nor a floor, even there is no accurate specialization on which usually divide players into classes. (Soldier, magician, scout). You are given one character, and here it can already be developed in due form role-playing games. The fighting system is also exotic, you can't get just like that the weapon and beat it anywhere. It is possible to use it only in fight and only on strictly taken away sites and only on certain objects. In addition game in was guided by consoles.\nTo a huge regret of an open and free world in game won't be. Everything in it is presented 5 heads, in each of which the player will be able to investigate on some game locations. And very modest by the size. To return to initial locations, on end of the head most often it is impossible, game at once warns about it the small message. Something like it was in the Lord of the Rings: War in the north.\n\nRole system\n\nAs I already spoke, only one character is presented to The Dark Eye Demonicon. It has own set of initial characteristics which can be improved further. Role system not difficult, it classical. In it the system of distribution of points of experience, as well as in recent Blackguards is used. That is the player receives (Points of adventures) for which the main (basic) and minor skills, and also receptions are pumped over. No levels are present. Further you will receive points on fighting magic. Of course to giants, role-playing games to it not to reach. The same TES, oblivion which left in 2006 has much more flexible system of development of the character. Interesting feature of this system is the general indicator of experience on all skills. the player should learn to observe balance, but not to develop blow force. The hero, of course will be strong, but as a rule for the rest (a potion cooking, charisma and dialogues, ability to find hiding places and traps), he will be full zero and consequently won't see good ammunition and the weapon.\n\nFighting system\n\nThe Dark Eye Demonicon we will be only in certain situations. It is impossible to bare the weapon just like that. After fight you is started, it is possible to tell, you appear on a certain arena (and locked) to leave which it is impossible. No combinations of blows are present. You simply press on the attack button, the character skillfully swings a sword, being automatically arranged under enemies. Blows magic also pass under a car. Fighting skills are applied due to endurance and also caused with the machine gun. The even strengthened blow, game on the opponent. At the beginning, enemies can be killed with simple attack, and here already in the middle fighting skills, blocks and evasion will be necessary for you. System of fight simple, but very interesting. The further you go, the will be more interesting and more intense than battle with the enemy. It can be written down safely in game pluses.\n\nStock, weapon\n\nThe main character has a bottomless bag in which he can put everything found on world open spaces. In total there are five tabs.\n\nThe weapon which - is pricking, cutting and which is splitting up the weapon. And also modifications and improvements to it. Armor – protective ammunition including improvements. Jewelry – all rings and necklaces which the hero can wear. Ingredients and potions – herbs, powders, health potions, and also poisons. The junk and subjects – unnecessary subjects which can only be sold, and also  aren't on sale). The quantity of types of weapon, armor, potions in game isn't enough. Even at detailed studying of game and full passing, is problematic to count even five sets protective an armor or more than 10 types of weapon.\n\nGraphics\n\nthe graphics of The Dark Eye Demonicon at a low level, First of all hurts the eyes terrible animation. All characters and enemies as dolls, everyone has on two-three positions in which they talk. These hands crossed on a breast simply kill! Secondly, specification of textures the very low. Has a cheap appearance. In total on the screen it is so unnatural as game came out at the end of 2013.\n\nFurther, completely there is no physical model. The environment absolutely not online, everything statically and looks horror as it is unpleasant. Corpses right there disappear. I was surprised by scenery, they very saturated. Sometimes simply you stop to look round. All these underground landscapes with the shining mushrooms, halls of churches and locks, beauty … Dynamic lighting perfectly draws in detail accurate shadows, SAO.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe The Dark Eye Demonicon project is technically weak developers promised the best execution. It is possible to tell even it absolutely other game. And despite all shortcomings, I passed it with pleasure. This graphic marriage didn't prevent me to take pleasure in remarkable history. (only the history forces to pass game)\n\nI give - 4\10\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354853189","December 11, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play Cairon, a man who only wants to protect his sister and keep his family safe. However, fate has a different destiny in store for him. The story starts out simple enough. You are out on a quest to rescue your sister, who was kidnapped by a cannibal. You’re immediately thrust into a dark mountain cave fighting demons and unnatural beasts.\n\nDemonicon boasts a robust story filled with tales of heroism, forbidden love, and lust for power. As you travel the desolate lands of Aventuria you’ll meet many people, fight wars, uncover the cause of a plague and make choices that affect the population. All those things are thrust upon your shoulders like all good heroes. Even though the story overall ends up being a bit clique I enjoyed it. The characters that make up the town of Warunk and the surrounding areas are full of personalities uniquely different from each other and do their part to help or hinder your adventure.\n\nChoice also plays a major role in this game. You’re presented with tough decisions fairly frequently, the first within an hour into the story. No matter what you choose there seems to always be those who are unhappy with your decision and others who will praise you for it. But the nice thing about Cairon’s journey is he can be as fickle as he wants. The only constant being his desire to save his sister / lover. And for those who are off put by the prospect of a brother and sister love interest rest assured the game doesn’t go that path for long. So don’t let that deter your curiosity.\n\nThe graphics are excellent. Even though this is a fairly linear game it boasts an array of beautifully rendered environments from dank caves and dark swamps to regal temples and monasteries. Controls are simple enough as you wield both magic and melee attacks. I found myself using magic a lot more than melee. I was kind of marginally aware of the melee powers until after a quarter of the game in. You battle enemies just about anywhere, from wide open temple spaces to cramped basements. It helped that you have full control over the camera. This is definitely a game where I think playing with a controller gives you a bit of an advantage.\n\nI also enjoyed the stat boosting attributes. You could increase your attack, magic and battle parameters but other skills such as lock picking or ‘fast talking’ gave you a leg up in situations outside of battle. They also provided extra knowledge of the situations you found yourself in or unlock additional conversation rewards. So the social aspect is just as important as the fighting.\n\nOverall the graphics and characters create a great atmosphere that draws you into the story. Accompanied by a soundtrack that compliments the areas you explore for an enjoyable experience. Decent game length and plenty to do. It’s no Skyrim but if you’re into fantasy games this will not disappoint.","February 17, 2015","true","27.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You control one character throughout the game.\n\nIMO it's not a classic, but it's just as good or better than Dragon Age 2 in terms of creating a believable fantasy setting. There are a lot of missed opportunities from the developers, but it appears to me that it was due to a limited budget, rather than ill intentions. You can spot a lot of love for the fantasy genre if you read between the lines as you play.\n\nThe combat starts out being rather boring, but it gets a lot better after you acquire some new abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd give it a high 6 out of 10, quite close to a 7. I'm surprised it seems to have a small fanbase, as it's far from being a bad game. If you can get it for anything below $20, I'd say it's worth it.\n\nIt's a shame they didn't put more work into making looting feel better. It just feels anticlimactic to disarm a max level trap to reach a chest that only contains some healing potions. Your gear hardly changes appearance until at the end of the game.\n\nIt took me 21 hours to complete and I generally had a good time.","March 15, 2014","true","21.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It starts off a bit slow, with the player character Cairon's sister Calandra being forced into an arranged marriage to a wealthy noble. But towards the end of the first chapter things get much more interesting as you learn about an ancient demonic ritual where seven children were given dark magic powers.\n\nSadly the story is undermined a little by the dialogue, which is at times poorly written. Sometimes the dialogue choices don't flow like a natural conversation and several attempts at humour just end up being wierd. Voice acting is also low quality. Calandra is okay, but Cairon just sounds bored most of the time, and the supporting characters are poor.\n\nCombat is fast paced and can be entertaining, especially when you unlock a few abilities. Most of the time you are alone, controlling Cairon in 3rd person, against waves of between 6 and 10 enemies at a time. You have melee attacks with either blades or blunt weapons, special melee power attacks, throwing knives for ranged attacks and four magic spells - freeze (mainly used against a single target), fire (radial damage perfect for when surrounded by multiple enemies), speed/damage buff and poison (which I didn't try because I put all my points into upgrading the other three). Its like a lower quality version of the Witcher.\n\nThere is some variety in enemies - Human rogues, mages and warriors, spiders, lizards, fire demons - enough to make me change up my tactics based on their weaknesses and abilities.\n\nThe level up system is based on a German pen and paper ruleset called Dark Eye, which I've also seen in Drakensang. You don't gain levels as such, but every fight, quest and many non-combat actions gives ability points which can increase stats (strength, constitution, etc), melee power attacks, non-combat skills (crafting, lock picking, etc) and magic. You can spend the points at any time as long as you have enough. I like the system because it feels like there is alot of freedom to build Cairon to suit your playing style.\n\nLevel design is mostly linear with some small side paths to find extra loot. There is more freedom during quests, many of which give the player a choice how to resolve. The save system is checkpoint only, but most of the time they are quite frequent. Controls are fully rebindable and work nicely with mouse and keyboard.\n\nThere are some problems on the technical side. I sometimes noticed some stuttering while running around, and some slight framerate dips during combat. I also crashed to desktop twice on the crafting menu.\n\nOverall I think Demonicon would probably only appeal to dedicated RPG fans. If you can be in a forgiving mood and you've played all the better games, there is some enjoyment to find here. I finished the game in 16 hours, so I wouldn't recommend picking up at full price. I bought it for 75% off, which considering its flaws, seems like a fair price.","September 6, 2014","true","30.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Its' strengths are it's story and in particular the dialogue that is very well written and in combination with excellent voice acting really draws you in. The choice system is also done excellently, where the decisions you make give you different cutscenes or dialogue interactions from start to finish. In addition, there is moral ambiguity to most of the decisions you make, meaning there are rarely black and white choices to be made. The music and ambient sound are also done superbly, and compliment the atmosphere quite well. Another well designed system is the character advancement and skills. Instead of experience points and levels, you are granted Adventure Points that can be spent at any time, on any specialization you choose, giving you a nice degree of customizability. Unfortunately, this clever design is marred somewhat by an endgame where most if not all of your skills will be maxed.\n\nThe other drawbacks of the game are it's fairly uninspired combat. While the controls are easy to use, and there is fair variety of player attacks and combos, the enemies are not particularly varied or dynamic. Some acts will have you facing the same 3-4 types of mobs ad nasuem for a couple of hours before you face a new type. Although it improves as the game progresses, and the boss fights are relatively interesting, more variety would have been welcomed. Also in need of improvement are the environments that while stunning in their art design and relative size, are often mostly devoid of npcs. This leaves some areas feeling strangely barren and artificial. The most glaring failure of the game however, is the itemization. While the crafting system is well implemented and useful, the graphic design on weapons is very mundane. This is particularly strange for a high fantasy title featuring magic and demons, to have such low fantasy weapons for the majority of the game. The developers may have wanted to underscore the humble origins of the protagonist, but even then, the art direction was dull. I never felt particularly excited by any of the loot. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that NPC vendors without exception sell the best gear, making loot drops and chest finds vendor trash. Despite these flaws, Demonicon is a triumph in storytelling and one of the best RPG games of 2014. For fans of the genre, this is a must buy.","July 21, 2014","true","37.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

The game's lore draws extensively from the Dark Eye universe and expands it further by delving into its demonology. It is a selling point for Dark Eye fans who have played previous games such as Drakensang and Drakensang 2.\n\nIt is helpful to think of this game as a far better Risen 2. That game has terrible graphics and gameplay, a simple progession system and is buggy but it had a lot of humorous dialogue and a decent story line and lore continuing from Risen 1. Demonicon similarly has some humorous dialogue and a simple progression system but has a more complex and intriguing story line, a richer lore and passable graphics and gameplay. For $10 its worth it but not at full retail.\n\n*PS Watch out for a certain Grand Magus. Best dialogue in the game.

If i wanted to load the game sometimes i would have to start the launcher three seperate times, using task manager to close the unresponsive instances inbetween. MAJOR pain in the rear. To make matters worse, sometimes the game would just decide to crash, just randomly. The only saving grace there is that the saves are frequent................but..................\n\nThe save file is singular, and by that i mean that any progress you make will overwrite your current save. That means if you screw up and pick the wrong choice, go into an area that advances the plot before finishing a side quest etc, you are stuck. The game will have overwritten with the furthest progress and you will have to start the game over to fix it. Not exactly something you like to see in an RPG were supposedly your decisions could effect how the story unfolds................but about that one................\n\nYour choices dont matter. You are given the illusion of control of the characters destiny. The only things that will chance are slightly different cut scenes and your fetch quests will be given by either faction A or faction B. It just felt weak.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there is some fun to be had there. The ice spells and the demon aura were quite good for stunning opponents and speeding your attacks. I found the Fire and Poison spells to be worthless, fire spell is point blank so you will get stabbed 100% of the time before the spell goes off and the poison spell burns through your magic wayyyyyyyy too fast. The attacking was done by simple chaining of your attack button (X for me since i used a 360 controller), the higher your chain the more magic you get back to refreeze your enemies. It got bland after about 15 hours in, which is not bad considering the whole game took me 18 hours and i did almost everything there was to do in a single play through.\n\nThe money in the game quickly becomes absolutely pointless. The only thing you will use it for is to buy potions and enchantments for your armor. The enchantments also get pointless as you get the "Final" set of armor at the end of chapter 3 (There are 5 chapters). I put silver enchantments in the armor because they were the best enchantments i had at that point in the game. Then in the next two chapters you get gold enchantments..............but no armor...........whatsoever. Since enchantments are permanent.............ya i was kinda screwed at that point.\n\nThe story starts out with good potential in the prologue and builds well in chapter 1 and 2 (chapter 2 was very well done). After that............meh...........just meh. Chapter 3 went in a direction i just did not care about and chapter 4 and 5 were just absolute crap. It felt like some other games i played where they started out with plenty of money and good ideas and then got rushed and had to wrap it up quickly and on a budget.\n\nThe bottom line is, i just will not recommend this game to any individual period. Between the software problems, weak story and mediocre gameplay, i just dont see anyone getting very much enjoyment out of this game.","January 27","false","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What I found was a poorly executed diablo clone with a storyline so divorced from Aventuria and the Dark Eye as to be unrecognizable. This is another example of a developer using a familiar name in classic rpgs and using it only for marketing purposes with little or no regard for the IP they are mutilating for profit.\n\nTo be honest even if I had been looking for a diablo style action rpg this game is just pitiful.

If i wanted to load the game sometimes i would have to start the launcher three seperate times, using task manager to close the unresponsive instances inbetween. MAJOR pain in the rear. To make matters worse, sometimes the game would just decide to crash, just randomly. The only saving grace there is that the saves are frequent................but..................\n\nThe save file is singular, and by that i mean that any progress you make will overwrite your current save. That means if you screw up and pick the wrong choice, go into an area that advances the plot before finishing a side quest etc, you are stuck. The game will have overwritten with the furthest progress and you will have to start the game over to fix it. Not exactly something you like to see in an RPG were supposedly your decisions could effect how the story unfolds................but about that one................\n\nYour choices dont matter. You are given the illusion of control of the characters destiny. The only things that will chance are slightly different cut scenes and your fetch quests will be given by either faction A or faction B. It just felt weak.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there is some fun to be had there. The ice spells and the demon aura were quite good for stunning opponents and speeding your attacks. I found the Fire and Poison spells to be worthless, fire spell is point blank so you will get stabbed 100% of the time before the spell goes off and the poison spell burns through your magic wayyyyyyyy too fast. The attacking was done by simple chaining of your attack button (X for me since i used a 360 controller), the higher your chain the more magic you get back to refreeze your enemies. It got bland after about 15 hours in, which is not bad considering the whole game took me 18 hours and i did almost everything there was to do in a single play through.\n\nThe money in the game quickly becomes absolutely pointless. The only thing you will use it for is to buy potions and enchantments for your armor. The enchantments also get pointless as you get the "Final" set of armor at the end of chapter 3 (There are 5 chapters). I put silver enchantments in the armor because they were the best enchantments i had at that point in the game. Then in the next two chapters you get gold enchantments..............but no armor...........whatsoever. Since enchantments are permanent.............ya i was kinda screwed at that point.\n\nThe story starts out with good potential in the prologue and builds well in chapter 1 and 2 (chapter 2 was very well done). After that............meh...........just meh. Chapter 3 went in a direction i just did not care about and chapter 4 and 5 were just absolute crap. It felt like some other games i played where they started out with plenty of money and good ideas and then got rushed and had to wrap it up quickly and on a budget.\n\nThe bottom line is, i just will not recommend this game to any individual period. Between the software problems, weak story and mediocre gameplay, i just dont see anyone getting very much enjoyment out of this game.","January 27","false","18.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/215630/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ Probably the strongest aspect of the game, the graphics are good enough for an RPG. The textures on the environments are high-res and smooth, and the framerate only really dipped a little at times out of combat (where a solid framerate isn’t a big deal). Although the character animations in conversations are repeated often, and the models could do with a little work, the graphics are easily the best part of the game\n+ While the skill trees are nothing exceptional or innovative, you gain plenty of AP throughout the game to level up the aspects of your character that you want to (whether it be skills, magic or stat gain), which is perfectly fine for a linear RPG\n+ Story-wise the premise is interesting enough, with plenty of rich dialogue and notes littered throughout the game to read and absorb. The choice system, while nothing new in gaming nowadays, does have a minor impact on the story overall (similar to The Witcher, where you can decide on which faction to join, though on a much smaller scale here).\n\n\nNegative\n- Now when it comes to the combat, this is probably a deal breaker for most people. The combat is extremely repetitive. While it does have the basics for most RPG combat systems; including blocking, parrying, physical and magical skills etc., every fight you are essentially somewhat mashing (there is a timing and combo aspect to fighting) the attack button, and later on spamming spells and skills when you’re able to. For a linear RPG this is standard, but it’s still undeniable that the gameplay in this game will become tedious very quickly; and considering some spells are incredibly strong later on in the game and easily spammable, the game is rarely challenging at all (unless you bump the difficulty up). Considering the game is around 11 hours long (on Normal difficulty), if you don’t enjoy the combat in the first hour, it’s not getting to get any better as the game progresses\n- Also, to comment on other weak gameplay aspects: there is little need to trade items or even explore the environment for new items, as equipment makes negligible differences to your characters stats. Lastly, but not least, there is no manual-saving at all in the game, which isn’t really a concern to me considering the game is extremely linear, but not having that option may put off some players\n- The sound design in general is quite poor. It seems as if some parts have sound clips missing (or put simply there’s no sound at all, such as when a boss makes a visual scream yet nothing comes out of their mouth), forgettable music, and mediocre voice acting at best leaves much to be desired in the sound department\n- While I positively commented on the graphics, in terms of different locations, there are very few. In fact, you visit the starting dungeon three times throughout the course of the story. Yes you heard me right, three times. You can definitely see where they had to cut corners in this part of the game\n- Lastly, while for the first three chapters of the game the story is solid enough, once you hit the later stages of the fourth chapter and the finale, the game feels completely rushed. The final boss and ending especially are wholly underwhelming and definitely feel like a weak climax to the overall experience.\n\n\nVerdict\n“Feeling like a poor man’s RPG (at £30 no less), The Dark Eye: Demonicon is an average and linear Western-style RPG with some redeeming qualities. If you are a big RPG fan and want something new to play, there are plenty of better games out there. But, if you can get this game extremely cheap, and have exhausted playing the best RPGs on the market, this is a solid middle-of-the-road one to play.”\n\n6.5/10 TJBs","February 2, 2015","true","11.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not the worst game ever made, but it's pretty bad.\n\nWhere should I begin? Story: The story is dense, very dense. The plot is intricate and full of surprises, but was also highly predictable. I should have known that I didn't just start an incest relationship with the character's sister. Because a few hours into the game, you find out you're not even blood related. The story was actually kind of good. But that's the only good thing this game has going for it. Cairon, the character, is gifted with a power after he 'exchanges blood' with his 'sister'. They were in battle together in some cave and both were injured. They also make out and have the urge to bang, but Calandra, the sister, is set to be married to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Well, to stop this, Cairon decides to join either the guard or the cartel in order to expedite citizenship to the city your father fled to with you and your sister. Long story short, there are choices in this game that really have no effect on the game. Without spoiling the story, the only choices that matter turns out to be the very final choice in the game and whether or not you leveled up your fast talk enough. Seriously. Every other choice doesn't matter. After the final choice, the game ends and there's no epilogue conclusion type cut scene. Very disappointing.\n\nOn the technical side of things, this game is just awul. Animation sucks. I mean, I can animate better and I know I'm a terrible animator. Every motion was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ robotic, aside from the fighting and in game running around. The cutscenes and dialog animation was just... it was painful watching it, honestly. People's arms would move up and around for no apparent reason. Shoulders would bounce up and down from breathing. Obviously everything was hand animated with no assistance from mo-cap, but a note to the devs: video tape yourselves for your next game as reference. It'll really improve your animation skills. I mean, the walk cycles were just so bad, I wanted to throw my monitor, buy a plane ticket to Germany, and compalin to the devs in person. But I'm broke dammit. That's why I'm writing this scathing review.\n\nThe dialog is awful. I might just let that one slide, though, as I'm betting they wrote it in German first, did the lipsync in German. Then translated it to English for us Yanks and Brits and maybe tweaked the lipsync as a different file/animation, and left it at that. Let me go back to the walk cylce animation. SPEED IT UP! I MEAN JUST ♥♥♥♥ING SPEED IT UP! I could have ran to the bathroom, took a dump, and ran back before the camera changes scenes. The direction is also just ♥♥♥♥ing awful. The in game cutscenes look like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ film I made in college. Thank god they outsourced the CGI cut scenes to some other studio. They actually looked okay. But what resolution were they!?! 1280x720? Ugh.\n\nPlenty of bugs that will make you want to vomit. Textures are bland as hell. Models look okay, some were decent. Houses looked nice, but the textures were still terrible. Combat consists of pooping out one button and sometimes using your magic power, which involves either (controller used here) holding the right trigger/right button and either a/b/x/y. I died a lot. Leveling system was odd, took me a while to see the extra options on the options. Inventory can get bloated real fast, where can I store my ♥♥♥♥? What kind of RPG doesn't let you manual save! MANUAL SAVE! THERE'S NO BLOODY MANUAL SAVE!?!? WTF?\n\nAt least it was very short.\n\n4.0/10","September 13, 2015","false","10.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The storyline is pretty straight forward and the choices you make, good or bad, mainly influence what hidden achievement you get and does not really affect the final ending other than some dialogue differences.\nFor achievement hunters this game will require multiple playthroughs as the hardest difficulty is unlocked after beating the game. The lack of a manual save might be a deterrant for some people, but the auto-save does appear after each fight ends, and there are some pre-set auto save points to get the other hidden achievements if you wanted to make another dialogue decisions, but it would be better just to start a new playthough on the hardest difficulty if you're aiming to be a completionist.\nThe leveling system is pretty straight forward and there is no real grind as monsters do not respawn in the areas you defeat them unless it's a new story progression. By endgame you will get most of the AP stat point skills to maximum, but the GP will be limited and at most you will max out two skills with GP.\nOverall I give the game a 5.5/10 as the gameplay can be monotonous and the parry system is almost redundant by the end of the game and relies more on dodging. It's a decent linear RPG but going from point to point and backtracking is what made the game longer than it should be when doing side quests and main quests. Some of the puzzles do require you to memorize some obscure sentences that might not be obvious as well if you skip dialogues or lore.","November 9, 2015","false","17.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Its slow and tedious. I actually thought it was lag at first as you click and wait a second for the attack, click again, wait and so on.

Because I wrote the review when the game was fresh in my mind (it isn't anymore), and the issues I had with the game still exist, I'll leave the written review unchanged so people can see my complaints. However, from what I remember of the game, $20 is a much fairer price for what you're getting. So, I think I can now recommend it.\n\nI want to clarify first off that this is not a bad game. I'm not recommending it not because it's a bad game, but merely because it offers nothing over other games in the genre. It is, in almost all respects, perfectly average and mediocre. Were it priced a little more reasonably I might recommend the game in spite of its shortcomings, but $40 for something that I would only describe as "painfully average" is a bit too much.\n\nOne thing I think is worth praising is the story. Apparently this is based on a German tabletop series akin to DnD. I know nothing about it, but the game does seem to have a great deal of backstory and lore that is only barely touched upon within the actual game, and that does breathe a little life into the story. Not everything is explained within the context of the story (you'll probably spend half of the game wondering just what in the hell a Borbaradian actually IS), but the game does provide a fairly robust codex that describes things not expounded on in dialogue. And the story itself is fairly interesting. Many of the characters were also enjoyable. I especially liked Feodor, Argus, and Solus; it is a shame that the last two are only available in the last area of the game.\n\nThat is, however, where my praise basically has to end. You're given several choices during the story, but it doesn't really seem like that has any impact on how the story plays out, at least not to an appreciable degree. Most of the choices are binary, and the only difference is whether you're a ♥♥♥♥ about what you're doing or whether you're not a ♥♥♥♥. "Banish him" or "execute him" result in the exact same ending plotwise; the character is gone and has no impact for the rest of the game. That's basically what every choice boils down to. Which of these characters do you accept as your father? Doesn't matter; either one has absolutely nothing to do after the choice. The worst of anything is the ending; I had hoped for a little more variation, but it's just another generic, binary ending. To be fair, this is not a problem specifically with Demonicon; many RPGs suffer from a similar problem.\n\nCombat is monotonous and dull, made at times even painful because of a lack of lock-on. I can't count the number of times I cast an ice spell and Cairon threw it in a direction I wasn't aiming at towards an enemy I didn't care about. He does it with melee attacks too, which is especially egregious. If you're not going to have the character attack in the directions I'm inputting, at least give me a lock-on so that he doesn't roll across half the screen to hit an enemy I have no reason to go after. There are several points in the game where you'll face summoners constantly bringing in new enemies and all you want is to kill them but Cairon keeps going off trying to hit some damned small fry who's just going to be replaced even if it dies. And that's awful.\n\nAt least, however, that adds some element of difficulty. I played through on Normal and the game is just pathetically easy. I apparently got an achievement for not using any potions throughout the entire game; I wasn't even TRYING to get this achievement, there's literally just no need for the things, at least on Normal. Doubtless the game is harder in one of the other difficulty modes, but it should bear mentioning, shouldn't it, that throughout the entire game I didn't need even a SINGLE healing potion? Perhaps allowing Cairon to heal by attacking was a bit too much. As long as your combat multiplier is high enough (hit enemies without them hitting you, basically), every attack heals Cairon for a fairly substantial amount of health. Since almost every enemy in the game has hitstun from being hit, and Cairon can roll indefinitely and is invulnerable during these rolls, it's child's play to rack up a large combat multiplier and just heal, heal, heal.\n\nThe camera, for the most part, is fine, but there are a few sections where it gets in the way. There was one section in a building in Kreutzer Alley where the camera was so bad I literally could not see what I was doing and nowhere I could move to fixed it. I simply had to mash the attack button until combat ended and then I was able to move to an area where the camera was not so screwed up. I have a feeling this was due to the relatively low ceiling in the building, and this WAS the only place in the game where the camera screwed up to such a degree. As I said, for the MOST part, the camera is entirely serviceable, but when it screws up it's very noticeable.\n\nI honestly can't remember any of the music except for the battle music. That means it didn't stick out, which means it was neither offensively bad nor enjoyable. I actually did like the combat music at the start, but since combat takes so long and there's so much of it I tired of it a few hours in. The sound direction is also fine, although there were a few cutscenes in the game where the sound cut out entirely. It did fix itself once the scene switched, however.\n\nI would have liked some greater ability to customize Cairon's equipment. Early on you have a fair number of choices and you can mix and match them, but later on all you seem to get is equipment sets which cannot be broken up; you either have to wear the entire set or none of it. It's a little disappointing.  There are only two weapon types, bladed and blunt (axes are, for some reason, considered blunt weapons, which is as mystifying here was it was in Oblivion). There are also throwing weapons, but I hardly used those as there was little point using them over your ranged ice spell. There are some interesting weapon and armor designs. You can use weapon/armor enhancements to beef up your equipment, but so far as I can tell there's no way to remove them.\n\nI do have a bit of a problem with how often you're sent running back and forth and how often environments are reused. About a quarter of the way through the game you're given access to the Market and Kreutzer Alley; learn to love them because you'll be running back and forth between them for the next few hours. You start the game in Moloch Mountain, about halfway through the game you're sent there again (and you have to open all of the gates again; who closed them?), and then at the end of the game you're sent there AGAIN. And you have to open the gates AGAIN (although there is a reason for the gates being closed this time). The monastery, the last original area in the game, has two main sections and a courtyard between them; you're sent running back and forth collecting gems and I began to truly despise that courtyard because of how often I had to run between sections. That entire area felt rushed, actually.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention are the bosses. They're major letdowns. Only one boss in the entire game killed me, and that's merely because he heals himself four times throughout the fight. This is largely a symptom of the general easiness in combat I mentioned earlier; you see the boss's attacks (of which they generally only have three or four, all heavily telegraphed), dodge them, and rack up your combo multiplier allowing you to heal directly as you deal damage. If you use Demonic Aura, increasing your attack and movement speed, it becomes even easier.\n\nAt $40, I  just can't recommend the game. I bought it for a heavy discount during the summer sale, and I wasn't ENTIRELY dissatisfied with my purchase, but if I had spent $40 I surely would have been. If you're hard up for an action RPG, this isn't the worst choice...but it's definitely not the best, either.","July 19, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","7"

The entire game took me about 28 hours to complete so not really a long game.

I bought the game on sale for 6 euros, it is worth some more, and a lot more of you collect Das Schwarze Auge games.\nSo far, I did not finish the game so everything I say is based on the first 30 something percent of my progress.\n\nFirst of all, I read earlier that Demonicon resembles the Witcher. It is true but only concerning the graphics and the cartoon cutscenes. Demonicon is much more immersive, though more linear. Whereas I, in both Witcher 1 and 2, had to take huge pauses when playing through - because the story was not too interesting, and I got bored at some parts - here I played through the first 27% of Demonicon at once, if I remember well.\nThe point is that the story is dark fantasy, and is as immersive as in Dragon Age, only with much less sidequests. The side quests are there rather only to show that this game has sidequests, but that is not its strongest side. This game is rather about one great main quest, which fits the DSA universe very well.\nIt is NOT true that without the Dark Eye background the story is senseless, or makes very little sense to an outsider. In the in-game codex there is plenty information to get acquainted with the DSA setting.\nThe German voice acting is also okay, nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe graphics of the better parts resemble to Witcher.\nHowever, there are worse graphical parts, mainly when you meet with non-talking NPCs. At those points this game resembled to another dark fantasy rpg, Hunted. Apart from the main, important characters, the less important characters are not too living. They are very static, which could be theoretically good, but in Demonicon you cannot talk to most of them either, which gives a bit of a dead feeling ("lifeless environment", but on the contrary, the sounds are very living). And also gives you the hint only to concentrate on the main quest.\n\nI have to say as well, that the sizes of the city of Warunk are so proportionate and so realistic, I think it beats everything so far I have encountered. The city, and its districts are neither too big, nor too small. I assume in the medieval time we had the same sized towns. It feels good too go on the Warunkan streets. For comparison, the Dragon Age Denerim is highly disproportionate.\n\nSTORY: Again, the main quest and story is as good as in Dragon Age, with moral choices, which field is the best one ever invented in an rpg, according to me. M&M Dark Messiah also came to my mind as a comparison.\nGRAPHICS: Graphics are similar to Witcher and Hunted.\n\nIMPORTANT: You have to shun this game if do not like linear games and prefer the free roaming style. You can free roam, but only a little bit, within a smaller place usually, and also it is not worth to do it too much - you just rather proceed with the story.\n\nOne additional fact concerning the skills. This game has 8 or so non-martial skills. I felt when I distributed the skill points, that they are not a waste, because I could make use of every skill, including the Legends and Lore, each of them were important. Also this game made me think that even in a pen and paper rpg you do not need more non-martial skills than these 8 (legends, plant caring, persuation, spotting things, disarm traps, open locks and two more). If there is more of them you will use only a small percentage of them, so most points you spend will be a waste. Or, you will not be able to spend sufficient points to each important one of them (to the ones you really need)","August 20, 2014","true","29.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game may be touted as an action game, but under the hood the mechanics are more a traditional RPG related to Drakensage and Blackguards.  The story can be quite absorbing because it very often compels you to assume unfamiliar evil roles in order to achieve good.  However, the mythology and backstory can be quite confusing through the first chunk of chapter one.\n\nThe game allows for pivotal choices that do cycle back later in story.  Some optional sidequests are availible in each chapter, but they really don't match central story.  Voice acting and animations match the other Dark Eye games (professional, but not moving).\n\nThe best argument for this game is  that the story takes you through to the end.  Combat speeds up.  The parry ability seems practically useless (maybe someone can master it).  At normal difficulty, you can defeat most enemies, powergame, and be overwhelmed with cash.  Still, you can die if you don't pay attention to your health.  Most boss fights are riddles can be understood within a short time.

It's honestly tough for us RPG fans. We could be waiting in three year, or five year stretches for a game series or game.\nI don't like JRPGS. So if you are like me? It is even harder to find something to play, once the game of the moment has been completed.\nThe genre is also cursed with being expensive to make, which in turn makes is hard on independent developers budget wise, and that makes publishers nervous.\nAs most RPGs outside of the Elder Scroll series, Dragon Age series, sell above average at best.\n\nI simply bought Demonicon, because I was tired of waiting for Dragon Age 3, Mass Effect 4, Shadows of Mordor, and Witcher 3.\nVery glad that I did. It is a very decent game, with a very decent story, and it fills the void perfectly.\nI'd give it a 7/10.\n\nThis game could have gotten higher marks, even a 9, but it suffers from a fatal flaw for some -- the combat sucks and animations can be clunky.\nI liked the story enough, and the world enough. That I could suffer through the problems with combat, which is usually a deal breaker for some RPG fans.\n\nThe graphics are also on par with the original dragon age origins (whos combat also sucked for some), so they aren't as bad, as some say, no deal breaker.\n\nBut this is a good RPG, that could have been great with better combat.

This is my review for Demonicon: The Dark Eye. The game has an interesting leveling system which I enjoyed quite a bit, lots of collectbles to find in the world that are based on a certain skill, like lockpicking and legend lore and the storyline is fairly intriguing. The game does however have quite a few issues still in-tact and I ended up taking a point off due to these issues. There's still many glitches in conversations, I ran into one after the boss battle with Ghamat that prevented me from leaving the area, textures are really low resolution and it's noticeable throughout the game (not a big issue for me to be honest though, I still play classic games so I'm used to stuff like this haha, it's worth mentioning though). There's also no option to save the game and it relies on an autosave checkpoint system, which is a bit annoying as well. There also isn't a lot of armor and weapon choices among other things I could say lol. The negatives far outweigh the positives but even so I've been enjoying it for the most part and have put 10 hours into it already, I'd recommend picking it up when it's cheaper in price if it interests you though as it's not really worth 40 bucks in my opinion.

That distinction goes to a platformer whose name escapes me, and the less said about it the better.\n\nBut this is certainly the 2nd worst Dark Eye game out there. It's saving grace (if you're going to be generous) is that there is a modicum of Dark Eye plot content, some of which is quite interesting because it involves Borbarad and a geographical area of Aventuria that the other Dark Eye games (Realms of Arkania 1,2, and 3 and the remake of 1, Drakensang and Drakensang River of Time + Phileasson's Secret, Chains of Satinav and Memoria, and Blackguards 1 and 2) don't explore.\nWithout going into details, the other games take place in areas to the northwest, west, and southwest of Gareth, the capital of the Middenrealm. Demonicon takes place to the southeast of Gareth.\n\nAll of the other Dark Eye games (apart from the un-named sidescroller and the two adventure games use variations on the Dark Eye role-playing system. The two adventure games (Chains of Satinav and Memoria) don't use the RPG system because they're (surprise !) adventure games, but are brilliant and poignant additions to the Dark Eye tradition. The whole point of a Dark Eye RPG is that it is supposed to be an exercise in tactics and party management, elements which are conspicuously absent from Demonicon.\n\nDemonicon does not use the Dark Eye roll playing system. It's a first person slasher that reminds me a bit of an Asian console game. I generally avoid this kind of game, but the only one that I ever really played (and almost liked) was Joan of Arc, and Demonicon seems to share a lot of game conventions with it. My approach to the combat has been to set it to easy and hold my nose and just do it, but I must admit I haven't been too successful in overcoming the gag reflex. I'll give it another try at some point out of academic curiosity, but this is most certainly a game that you only buy when it's been deeply discounted.\n\nSo I wouldn't go so far as to say it's crap, but it's not good and an unfortunate experiment to expand the genre made by people who probably didn't understand what the genre was about.\nIt's possible that someone might play Demonicon and enjoy it, especially if their idea of tactics was zipping around a battlefield clicking a lot. That doesn't appeal to me, and it's unlikely to appeal to anyone who is interested in the world of DSA and the Dark Eye.","August 13, 2015","false","8.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat is very clunky, the skill system is un-imaginatve and very VERY limited and the stats are not very well thought out. They opted to have 2 seperate stat trees one for combat and one for immersion/crafting, while I think it's nice there is almost 0 reason to even touch the combat stats(str,agi, etc...). The combat early on makes you want to put points in stats to take more hits, but once you unlock the skill tree of your choice there isn't a point, I had maxed out all of the talents like haggle (merchant prices) and perception (seeing traps and treasure) before I had more than a few points in some early combat stats. However with all that game isn't really all that bad, the story is interesting enough and many of the choices you make force you to think for a moment about what you are doing, which is refreshing.                                                      Truly the biggest issues I had with this game were clucky combat, limited skills, worthless stats and how every area was so isolated, it didn't need to be open world but the overall content of the game was smaller than most, oh and that every weapon upgrade came from vendors, only ever used one weapon I found that wasn't from a vendor, which kinda spoils the immersion factor since this is an RPG. But I'd still say this game is overall not bad, not great, but not bad. Worth it when it's on sale for $10 or so. Personally I'd like to see this developer try their hand at another RPG, but one that is longer and better thought out.\nOverall I'd give it a 6/10.","July 9, 2014","true","19.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomizer/recommended/215630/","phantomizer","Sgt Phantomizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantomizer/","837 products in account","This is a game that I picked up rather randomly, with the only intention being to pass the time with...that turned around into getting "into it" and finishing it over the course of this week. The first thing worth noting is that I wish that the steam review system allowed for Neutral Reviews, because this is one particular game that I feel falls into neither one side or the other, but kind of in-between, depending on the player.\n\nThat said, I won't elaborate much on the story, because I feel that the game's description does an adequate enough job and I prefer to avoid spoilers. However, worth noting is that the story is one of the stronger points that this game has, it's interesting right from the very beginning and hooks you in. It's a shame though, because it kinda falls through near the end, I personally didn't like the ending, but that's just me and I think the game would have benefitted from more choice and consequence dialogue options, beyond the few choices you get to make at critical points in the story. Then again, maybe I'm asking for too much and should go play a Bioware RPG then? Regardless, what choice and consequence options there are, are pretty interesting and thankfully, aren't simply a matter of "good or evil" and instead, as previously stated, choice and consequence options. For example *SPOILER ALER!!!* the first such option has you deciding between letting a cannibal go and saving his captives, with the obvious conseqence of letting him run free and keep eating humans, or killing him, which at the same time, will kill his captives because they are bound to his life by a spell. I actually had to give this decision a few moments of thought before deciding, and when a game makes me stop to think, I believe it's done something right.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, the core of it is typical Action/RPG fare. Standard attacks, skills and magic are your options in combat. Standard hack and slashing consists of stringing together attacks into combo chains, the higher your combo chain, the higher the chance of scoring critical hits and after a certain amount, you start recovering hit points every time you hit an enemy. Also at your disposal is a dodge function and skills that you can learn with Adventure Points (AP) which you earn through combat and completing quests among other methods. Magic is learned using Gift Points (GP) which is strictly earned through combat and tied to how often you use magic. Finally, there are more geenric skills that are helpful throughout the game, such as Blacksmithing, which allows you to disarm traps and upgrade weapons, Lock Picking which allows you to, well...Pick Locks, Fast Talking which opens up optional disalogue choices and Lore which allows you to gain extra insight into people, places, enemies and so on, in the form of more information being unlocked in your journal and it also opens up more optional dialogue choices. Complementing everything, is Alchemy Crafting which allows you to brew Potions, Poisons and make Balms, unfortunately I cannot comment on that feature, as I mostly ignored it, because I went for the achievement for completing the game without using any potions and Blacksmithing, which allows you to upgrade weapons with components that you buy, or find in chests or get as rewards for completing quests. With gameplay in general, I had a few issues, while combat is easy to grasp, it also felt too simplistic and while some of the skills and magic are definitely useful, they didn't really stand out for me in terms of being "fun to play with", also, one of the things that immediately come to mind when I think of an Action/RPG, is loot, lots of (hopefully) varied and fun to tinker with, loot...most of the loot in this game is generic and not really interesting, and I hate...let me say it again, I HATE, that the game only has two different melee weapons: Swords and Clubs...I mean, really? Oh, wait...no shields either. Finally, the end fight disappointed me, it was a push over and probably the easiest boss fight in the entire game.\n\nGraphics and Sound...probably where this game fails at quite miserably, wallows in the mud and then gets stomped on by a passing horse. No, really...it's THAT bad. Graphically, this game looks like it belongs in the early 00s, while the atmosphere is spot on, giving the game a less "Fantasy" and more "Realistic" setting, the graphics are bad at best. Adding insult to injury, a lot of the animations during cutscenes are cringe-worthy or plain don't exist, like an NPC handing the main character an item and the main character supposedly examining it, which is suggested, but isn't animated, unless you use the imagination and imagine it. What animations are there, are mostly cringe-worthy as I mentioned before, like the main character awkwardly drawing his sword and looking as if his about to fall backwards because of it's weight. Another complaint is the design of the game world, while the atmosphere is great and lends itself to the plot quite nicely, at the same time...it doesn't have a whole lot of variety and not much in terms of interesting things to see. Finally, generic music and sound and mostly awful voice acting, some people have praised the voice work on this game and I guess to each their own, but in my opinion, it's horrible.\n\nFinal thoughts: This game had a lot of potential, but instead was ruined. The game is rather short, the first chapter itself spans about half of the time you'll spend playing this game, which gives you false expectactions as it sets the stage to make you believe that each chapter will be similar in length, but their not. More interesting side quests and less linearity may also have helped, but most of all, better graphics, at least for a game that came out in 2013. Oh and is asking to be able to skip cutscenes too much? <_<\n\nUltimately, I recommend the game, why? Because despite it's flaws, it's still an enjoyable game, if you can get it for 75% off, as it's NOT worth the full asking price.","January 8, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself wanting to continue playing to just find out what happens next.. That being said yes I can recommend the game for RPG/FPS players surely but be warned the ending is rather bad... The game flows along nicely but the end just feels rushed like they were on a deaddline and just needed to finish the game. The ending left me asking what happened? What happened to the characters? It just feels like there should be more to it.\n\nGraphics are decent overall but the character faces are not that great.\n\nSound is ok, I turn music down on most all games as I much prefer just the ambient sounds.\n\nThe control scheme could have been better, it just doesn't feel very intuitive to me, but you get accustomed to it eventually.\n\nYou're supposed to be able to make chocies in the game that influence what happens necxt but it doesn't seem to really affect the outcome. Short term they may affect some things but long terms they don't really seem to at all.\n\n:::Spoilers:::\n\n-There is no incest in the game, they're not actuallly related which you find out later in the game but yes in the beginning it does feel 'icky' with the whole brother and sister kissing and professing their love for each other.  But then again maybe there is as later in the game you meet another guy who claims he's your real father and your sisters father so it is actually incest?! Or not? As you never really find out if the guy is really yours and her father. It's confusing.\n\n-The ending is just ridiculous, it leaves you asking WTF just happened? And WTF happened to the characters? It ends like a cliff hanger and for games that's not a good thing I think. If there's going to be a sequel you at least finish the first game, it just very much feels unfinished and rushed. The ending graphics look exactly that same for either choice, at least it did to me. You go through the whole game and the enitre ending sequence is a few seconds and then the credits roll and you're left sitting there like WTF that's it?\n\n-The game does seem to leave some questiosn unanswered, like who is their real father, you never really find out.

People wrote\nmostly bad comments and the gameplay\nlooked kinda crappy. But i tried it anyway.\n\nFirst two hours i was cursing because of the saving system.\nThing that it wasnt saving before hard fight were upseting me\nbecause u had to skip some cutscenes collect some things etc.\nand then u could try different tactic and die again. But when i got\nused to it it went very easily. (I was playing it for first time on Hard\ndifficulty.) Then i saw how sophisticately it was created. All those\nskills perks spells etc. At start it was just too much of everything\n+ dat incest think made me broody about the developers..\nbut everything got explained very well. So im gonna summarize:\n\n-the story plot was pretty interesting and was very well explained\n-all of those rpg elements i like were implemented good (leveling, looting, selling, buying, upgrading etc. )\n-i was very pleased when i saw the looting system saves a lot of time cuz ur gonna  pick it all anyway\n-graphics are nice and very fluent\n-combat is (once u learn to) enjoyable\n-skills are making u stronger and enemies are getting stronger too, so its challenge all  the time\n-the deciding matters on your conscience\n\nWhat i didnt like mostly was the autosave system, it saves only at certain points, so sometimes\nyou have to repeat few more things again and again.\n\n+there could be more location, quest, items (more parts of armor, and diferent weapons)\n\nBut overally this game is solid linear action rpg game with beautifully designed areas and lore.","April 1, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where she decided to hide is in a demonic mountain... It turns out that she wasn't hiding but tracking someone. During which it turns out that the reason your father didn't want you mixing your blood was because it unlocks some kind of power. You quickly find out that your father has lots of secrets about you and your sister. It also turns out your sister is in love with you and doesn't want to be married. So you are off on a quest to make it so she doesn't have to. Eventually she gets taken away as well and you must find her. Strangely none of what I've said gives away any actual plot. The game runs from 15-30 hours depending on your curiousity.\n\nThe Good\nThe game is set up to use dark eye rule sets on stats which gives a lot of extra things to do and dialogue along the way. Should you decide to go into plant lore you can gather plants and use alchemy to make potions. Making potions and gathering herbs give you more AP points which you had to spend to get those skills in the first place. The world is actually pretty interesting if you choose all the differnt dialogue options which gives you more of the games lore. There are traps you can disarm and chances are one will kill you because you didn't notice it. The combat is actually pretty good except for the counter attack which hardly works. The sound overall in the game is on par. New enemies get introduced regularly, but in the begining you will wonder if that's true. The game offers up interesting choices to make that very much are a shade of gray. The only problem is the end of the game never lets you know how these choices had an effect long term.\n\nThe Bad\nThe counter attack combat move doesn't work. The game only offers a few different armor options. There is practically no point in buying anything other then potions from merchants which leaves you with a large amount of gold you will never spend for almost the entire game. The tutorial doesn't actually exist so best of luck figuring out controls and how to upgrade your character using the dark eye rules because they don't tell you. I would date the graphics around the year 2007 and most of the world tend to use a very brown color pallette. The ending portion of the game gives you a ton of choices and none of them except the final one actually does anything. This tends to be a trend in this game because you can also get dialogue options throughout by having certains skills, but it tends to only introduce more dialogue and not change the end result in the least for the most part anyway.\n\nConclusion\nI enjoyed my time with Demonicon even with it's sub par graphics and sometimes cliche story rifts. I feel like the game had enourmous potential for a small studio and they just never got there. I feel if the creators would have had user feedback before release it could have been different. Where it sits I can only suggest this game to true RPG fanboys looking for an action romp in a world that is more interesting to here about in the games notes and dialogue then in actual exploration. If only they would have included updates to the choices you made like The Witcher and Dragon Age Origins did I would give this game a lot more praise.\n\nValue\nI'd value it as an average quick romp RPG at about $7.50 value.","January 8, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is also classless, meaning that you are not in a specific class or limited to certain skills, feats or talents.\nBody, Mind (knowledge) and Power development is central to your progress in the game.\nUpgrading health (vitality), mana (essence) and endurance (encumbrance) improve the Body.\nSkills such as Lore, Blacksmithing and/or haggling strengthen the Mind.\nSpecial attacks (which uses encumbrance) and Gift powers (uses essence) build up your Power.\nThere are two types of points used for upgrading: AP (which is for Skills and Body upgrades, and Special attacks) and GP (which is for Gift powers) which are to be used with CAUTION.\nThe graphic detail and quality are rather poor considering that this game was made in 2013, but they are not utterly terrible either. Sound and music are amazing. Dialogue and storytelling are breath taking, with choices you make along the way, and are fantastically done.\nThe battle system is not that bad. Playing with either an edged weapon (fast but weak) or blunt weapon (slow but strong) are fun, along with magic at your fingertips. Enemies become stronger as the game progresses, which make you need to upgrade your equipment, or buy new equipment at a merchant (which is a must, sell old equipment to earn money).\nWeapons and armour, can be modified to give additional properties such as extra points to attack or armour bonus or poison, critical hits or improved skills. It all depends on you.\nDecisions, decisions, decisions. At times, they are easy, and at times, extremely tough. They can be wrong or right. It all depends on what you want the outcome to be. And this game is full of them. You may decide to be fearless and cruel and tempered, or calm and merciful and noble, it just depends on you, but it also comes to standing your ground according to what is right for you. But remember, actions bear consequences - what you decide in the beginning may come back to bite you in the end, and horribly.\nFinally (WARNING: complicated process), after killing a demon that stole my trolley, I accidently turned myself into a broken couch and was finally kidnapped by peg sellers.\nI award this game with a 8.84 out of 10. If you are into RPGs and third-person, not hassled by graphics or having to make tough decisions, then this game may just pique your interest.\nA final note: a patch for the game for improved graphics, fighting, conversations and everything else improved can be downloaded for free from Steam.","January 31, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe because it's a few years old now, but definitely not because of any flaws in the game.\n\nI feel like the game developers definitely put the effort where it counts - i.e good gameplay, character progression and story. So who cares that the animations are a bit laughable and repetative? Who cares that it's linear? Linear doesn't have to be bad and you quickly forget about all that when you have so much fun in the combat and choosing your skills as this game offers.\n\nI love how this game doesn't muck about like similar games in the genre. Things like stamina and inventory space are thrown out to make a more accessible and less time sink-filled game, thank you! This game tells you what you need to know and gives you fun tools to go about it. The skill system is excellent where they've really done a great job making every profession worth while (even a skill like Legend Lore!). There is just so much to put your points into but you will be getting points in a steady pace allowing you to always feel like you're progressing. And I have never had to make choices as difficult as they are in this game, where I truly feel like either is both good and bad and it comes down to your own personal morals. In the end you will still be thinking "what if I had done it differently?" opening up for a replay.\n\nThis game gives me the lovely "just a little bit more" feeling, and that's really all I require from a game.","August 10, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if the combat system is really awkward and wooden, I still wanted to continue, because I was rewarded for every single action. And the XP was motivating to the end.\n\nAbout the story - don't worry, I won't spoil here - it had many "WTF"-moments at the beginning, where I thought that the characters made absolutely no sense at all. I was about to dump the game, but gave it one more shot and in the end everything will be explained. It's high-fantasy and sometimes very much over-the-top, but that's a characteristic of The Black Eye. And well, if the game is called "Demonicon", you kind of gotta expect that there are indeed tons of demons to fight against.\n\nAnother reason which made me keep playing was the atmosphere: it was dark and gritty, sometimes a bit insincere, but it managed to keep me hooked. If you played Drakensang, another The Black Eye - RPG, you will be surprised how dirty, cruel and hopeless the world seems in a sudden.\nBeside this, you have many choices in the game and they do matter. Not gameplay-wise, but storywise and this is something I miss in many other games (Telltale Games, I'm looking at you!).\n\nSo all in all I can say, this game was good entertainment. Don't expect too much, though.

However it has some serious flaws, particularly for a relatively recent RPG and one based on a rather rich tabletop system.\n\nThe Pros:\n* great story and interesting characters as well as moral quandaries. The game design goes out of its way to make you think about every choice and decision. It doesn't hesitate to go into seriously unconfortable territory right from the start.\n* decent visuals, if not the most moder ones. The monsters are quite elaborate and NPC's look good, if not fantastic.\n* enemy AI (at least for bosses) is hard to beat on normal mode and you will reload. Often.\n* the character stats and development make sense and you need to make careful choices, especially at early stages.\n* As expected for the porting of such a venerable tabletop RPG, the background is rich and you get the feeling of being part of a much wider world, as it should.\n\nThe Cons:\n* the UI is not great. Although you can remap keys, the game system forces you into using key combos which is a big no-no in my book. And of course completely unnecessary.\n* Invisible walls and "fake doors". This is a level design flaw but also a game flaw as the characters may not jump or crouch. Unacceptable for a modern RPG. It is completely immersion breaking and really a shame for a game with such an interesting world.\n* Terrible dialogue system. Like in Fallout4, it doesn't really matter what you say and in any case, you don't know what you'll say before your character blurts it out. Very annoying.\n* The combat system is interesting but suffers greatly from the above mentioned UI issue.\n\nAll in all, it is still a nice little game. Not worth buying full price, but certainly a good sales buy. Also don't buy it if you don't like fixed point saves. Seriously. Not only the game has no other option to save it but some of this saves are extremely far apart so you'll have to replay entire levels or areas forever.","January 21","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it is not a bad a game.  Dont think this is Dragon Age, The Witcher, or TES.  All in all I beat the game in 13 hours and had fun playing it.\n\nThe graphics are dated with dull environments and the cut scenes reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins back when I played it on the PS3.  The biggest gripe of Demonicon for me was the stiff and ugly character models.  The story starts out very awkard and may turn some people away.  If you can stick with it, it does get better but overall is still medicore.  Demonicon has most of your rpg elements, leaving out any crafting system but allows you to brew potions.  You do not have a level but gain AP and GP to spread into your abilities that effects everything from your fighting stats to being able to haggle merchants and fast talk to "influence" the conversation.  You also have a total of 24 skills that you can unlock, 12 being melee based and 12 being magic based.  Combat and bosses were very easy for me, but were still fun feeling like a hack and slash with four melee skills and four magic skills on hand during the fight.\n\nThrough my play I had no bugs, glitches, or problems.  I was able to max the game out at 1080 on a dated system without any optimization issues.\n\nI recommend this game if you are an RPG fan that can overlook the graphics and not expect an AAA title if you can find it on sell, I honestly do not know how they are still selling Demonicon for $19.99","January 19","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However it has some serious flaws, particularly for a relatively recent RPG and one based on a rather rich tabletop system.\n\nThe Pros:\n* great story and interesting characters as well as moral quandaries. The game design goes out of its way to make you think about every choice and decision. It doesn't hesitate to go into seriously unconfortable territory right from the start.\n* decent visuals, if not the most moder ones. The monsters are quite elaborate and NPC's look good, if not fantastic.\n* enemy AI (at least for bosses) is hard to beat on normal mode and you will reload. Often.\n* the character stats and development make sense and you need to make careful choices, especially at early stages.\n* As expected for the porting of such a venerable tabletop RPG, the background is rich and you get the feeling of being part of a much wider world, as it should.\n\nThe Cons:\n* the UI is not great. Although you can remap keys, the game system forces you into using key combos which is a big no-no in my book. And of course completely unnecessary.\n* Invisible walls and "fake doors". This is a level design flaw but also a game flaw as the characters may not jump or crouch. Unacceptable for a modern RPG. It is completely immersion breaking and really a shame for a game with such an interesting world.\n* Terrible dialogue system. Like in Fallout4, it doesn't really matter what you say and in any case, you don't know what you'll say before your character blurts it out. Very annoying.\n* The combat system is interesting but suffers greatly from the above mentioned UI issue.\n\nAll in all, it is still a nice little game. Not worth buying full price, but certainly a good sales buy. Also don't buy it if you don't like fixed point saves. Seriously. Not only the game has no other option to save it but some of this saves are extremely far apart so you'll have to replay entire levels or areas forever.","January 21","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if the combat system is really awkward and wooden, I still wanted to continue, because I was rewarded for every single action. And the XP was motivating to the end.\n\nAbout the story - don't worry, I won't spoil here - it had many "WTF"-moments at the beginning, where I thought that the characters made absolutely no sense at all. I was about to dump the game, but gave it one more shot and in the end everything will be explained. It's high-fantasy and sometimes very much over-the-top, but that's a characteristic of The Black Eye. And well, if the game is called "Demonicon", you kind of gotta expect that there are indeed tons of demons to fight against.\n\nAnother reason which made me keep playing was the atmosphere: it was dark and gritty, sometimes a bit insincere, but it managed to keep me hooked. If you played Drakensang, another The Black Eye - RPG, you will be surprised how dirty, cruel and hopeless the world seems in a sudden.\nBeside this, you have many choices in the game and they do matter. Not gameplay-wise, but storywise and this is something I miss in many other games (Telltale Games, I'm looking at you!).\n\nSo all in all I can say, this game was good entertainment. Don't expect too much, though. I wouldn't reccomend spending more than 10€ for this game, but if it's on sale and you like a diverting, interesting RPG, go for it.","January 5","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This ARPG can deliver some fine playing hours,it has some good moments.\nIt was OK for me.\nGiving it a mediocre thumbs up. :)","May 16","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels as if your stuck in a closed storyline with the illusion of choice always present. However the game turns this into a positive towards the end, and builds you up into making careful yet definitive decisions that influence each summary of the type of person and world you are creating for the future. The mechanics weren't the best, a bit clunky for sure. However the storyline is rich in real life problems saturated with just the right amount of demonic lore to keep you wondering why America is not voting Bernie Sanders.","April 26","true","13.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
