Now although i love this game i will try to not be bias. so to begin, i will start the pros and then go to the cons\nPROS:\n1.this game is massive, as of Thursday October 30, 2014. there is 16 generation story lines . then there is two episodic story lines , saga and iria, with iria on its 4th episode.\n2. you can do almost anything in this game. I always ask people " tell me what you'd like to do in the game." and I normally get stuff like "trading, clothing crafting, black-smithing " and those exist , probably one of the only things you cant do is open pvp. you have to invite the person to a pvp battle and they have to accept it.\n3. the graphic style, now this is both a pro and a con, i will talk about the pro part here, the good thing about the graphics is that they are rather simple. now not to say the game looks boring. the areas you can go are diverse and interesting. a winter mountain range full of giants, or a desert in a constant sandstorm with elves. or do you go to the lands of tera and tailliann, the front of the fight in g9\n4. skill "tree". this game offer a interesting system for skills. it is free flowing. everything if offered to you at the start, there are a few that you have to unlock( like meteor, blizzard, and hydra transformation) or you have to be good in one skill set to unlock hidden skills. the beauty of the system is that you can always be doing stuff. i have one character that is level 2500 total and i have barely mastered any skill sets.\n5. Combat, now combat is interesting because it truly matters on what skill set you choose to adopt. a battle mage or spell sword are going to fight completely differently from an archer or puppeteer. but the most basic combat is like a real time rock paper scissors where some skills trump others but are trumped by others. this makes you require a bit of strategy but also quick moves\n6. events, there are always really fun and entertaining events, just last summer their was a big staged event that ended with an SAO event\nCons.\n1. camera control, now this is the biggest complaint I've gotten from people, the camera is not the easiest to control. you ether have to right click, or move you mouse to the side of the screen. now yes in combat it can be a bit annoying. but it just takes a getting used to, it takes a bit of pre-planning\n2.graphics, like i said this is a pro and a con, now if you like the style and since its low in the graphics you can easily play it on low end pcs, but if you have a better one or don't like the art style, it will definitely be a turn off.\n3. the openness, now i know a lot of people like the openness but most likely as a newbie will get so caught up will all the possible skills he will want to try to use all of them and be weaker than they need to fight enemies of there level. it takes a bit of discipline to focus on just one class.\n4. pay-to-winness, now this may not be noticed by most people but since it is a free to play, there has to be some form of transactions. some of those include cool pets (like dragons) or gachapon that hold special items. these are used to get special items, these items can then be sold for gold to other players to make a profit. yes this does happen, yes there are people who have a whole quick slot full of dragons. but because of those people, everything can be acquired in game for gold. now it might annoy people that this is true but pay to win is not entirely true. it just depends what your term for "winning" i can honestly say I've probably spent 500+ on this game and that might sound crazy but for how many hours I've clocked i think its worth it","October 30, 2014","true","427.0"," 137 of 148 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","137","148","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mega_man_trigger/recommended/212200/","mega_man_trigger","Mega Man Trigger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mega_man_trigger/","435 products in account","My name is Trigger, of the Ruairi server.  I'm well known in the community, even across servers, for effectively codifying the proper use of Mabinogi's Magic skill set with a comprehensive guide that underwent many, many revisions over the years (and which is still referenced and quoted to this day).  I played for over six years and sank countless thousands of dollars into the game.  Mabinogi is my most-played video game of all time by a nigh-incomprehensibly-large margin (just not on the Steam version, which will explain the lack of hours logged here).  I've shrugged off changes that have made similarly-tenured players quit.  And as a relatively respected player whose advice carried significant weight with newbies and old-timers alike, I have one thing to say.\n\nDo not play Mabinogi.\n\nMabinogi's combat was originally, at its core, a rock-paper-scissors system.  Normal melee strikes are deflected by the Defense skill.  Defense can be broken with Smash.  Smash is not as fast as normal melee and will always be trumped by it.  This, combined with many different enemy AI patterns, required players to be able to read the enemy's movements well in advance and react with appropriate timing, because all attacks carry some degree of stun and enough consecutive attacks will knock a player backward.  In the original release and for some time thereafter, tanking was completely non-viable because player health was vastly outclassed by enemy damage potential, requiring every combatant to be adept at reading and reacting to enemy movements and encouraging the then-commonly-espoused battle philosophy of "don't get hit".\n\nIn the early game, this system is still mostly apparent and functions as intended.  But a number of problems have cropped up over the years that make the game's overall combat functionality less strategic and as a result less unique (and if you've not played Mabinogi, yes, its original combat system literally has not been replicated anywhere else, despite its brilliance).  I will attempt to outline what I view as the most egregious of these problems below.\n\nPower creep is part of Mabinogi's story.  There is an in-universe justification for the player's rise to near-godlike power, although I won't spoil it on the off chance you disregard my advice and play this game anyway.  But despite power creep actually having a treasured position in the lore (and despite its being a damn good plot point), it has still negatively impacted the game in more ways than one.  Nearly every subsequent flaw I list is in some way related to power creep.\n\nThe difficulty curve is a joke.  The combat system underwent an overhaul back in the summer of 2012, which you may read my at-the-time opinion of here[www.purifierunit.com].  It was an inherently good update, and I thought it would force Nexon to consider their poor handling of the difficulty curve more seriously.  Sadly, they've done nothing but exacerbate the problem.  More and more skills keep getting added to the game with absolutely no substantial increases in content breadth or depth to match.  Since almost all skills grant permanent stats when upgraded, and since many skill sets rely on the same stats as other sets (allowing indirect upgrading of already-maxed skills), and since there are so many skills now, there will come a point at which a player is no longer challenged by anything the game has to offer.  In a game whose combat was originally defined by strategy and skill, and wherein a properly skilled player could take out a far bigger and stronger monster with ease, "difficulty" is now represented by monsters with bigger health bars and higher damage output, and virtually all of them can be laughed at upon reaching a certain power threshold, completely removing all strategy requirements from combat and reducing it to mindless grinding.\n\nEnemy AI is a hopeless shambles.  It served its purpose well in the original release -- for instance, bears and goblins were both notorious for using deceptive tactics to bait players into reacting incorrectly.  Most enemies can handle melee, magic, and archery attacks with relatively good reaction patterns.  Attacking an enemy more than once with a bolt spell or a normal bow shot, for instance, will almost always cause the enemy to charge at you directly, reducing the effectiveness of spamming, especially in the cases of fast and ultra-fast monsters.  Once alchemy was added to the game, the original AI crumbled and never recovered.  Enemies have never once had their behavior patterns updated to handle new offensive techniques or new skill sets.  They are still operating on their original AI, all of them.  If you start out focusing on melee skills initially, you'll receive a decent portion of the game's original challenge level.  If you choose something like Puppetry or Dual Guns, you will completely outsmart the AI merely by virtue of the weapons and skills you'll be using.  It isn't a total slam dunk, as most skills start out with low damage and the AoEs all start with relatively small areas of effect, but the enemy AI will still have no idea how to handle them.\n\nThe early game has been nerfed to hell and back.  This was unfortunately necessary, as the constant piling on of more and more skill sets left newcomers hopelessly behind the curve of the experienced players (and since this game has no level cap and no class system, there was no way for them to ever catch up).  The changes to leveling speed have aided everyone, though, not just the newbies, and thus the problem remains unsolved, having merely shifted in a certain direction.  Newcomers can attain a decent power level much more easily and with far less fuss than they could originally, but by the same token the old dogs can effortlessly blaze through new skill sets in a week or less, leaving anyone beyond a certain point utterly content-starved.  The endgame has been killed thanks to poor design choices focused on making the early game easier.\n\nIn case you didn't catch this in one of the previous paragraphs, there are far too many skills in the game now.  Most of the new skill sets have been added for very little reason other than bigger, badder, flashier attacks (going hand-in-hand with the attempt to shift the game's demographic from fantasy fans over to lovers of everything vapid, flashy, and hollow), and as already mentioned, enemies simply can't handle the newer stuff.  Anything designed with previous content in mind is always outclassed by the next batch of skills.\n\n\n-----\nThat about wraps up my deconstruction of Mabinogi's many current flaws, all of which contributed to my leaving the game and none of which have thus far been addressed.  I don't expect any of them to ever be addressed, either, because Nexon's Korean development team basically just develops for the Korean users, and the players on the North American servers get whatever Korea gets.  If you play this game, know that you have absolutely no voice in the game's future direction.  You will exist merely as a cash grab for Nexon.\n\nThere are other major gripes I could have laid at Nexon's feet here, including their horrendously overpriced cash shop, their habit of releasing a bundle of new outfits in gachapon and calling it a "content update", their poor community management, their childish and completely amateur banning practices[www.purifierunit.com] (of which the linked blog post is hardly the only example), and much more besides.  I tolerated all of the above for over six years because Mabinogi was once a giant among MMORPGs, schooling the rest with unique mechanics and satisfying gameplay.  It's now a shadow of its former self, and it does not deserve your attention.","February 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 413 of 524 people (79%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","79","413","524","39","90"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Depressedalyx/recommended/212200/","Depressedalyx","Monotone Lyxå","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Depressedalyx/","778 products in account","An Anime-stlyed mmorpg, point and click style.\nBe what you want and do what you want.\n\nWhile I may not have many hours here on steam, I mainly played the game prior to having it on steam.\nI would recommend this game to any of my friends, and if Tarlach server is joined - then I'll be willing to help people out.\n\n\nMabinogi is an MMORPG, with the following unique features:\n\n- Combat\nNow, you may think "Combat, every game has that".\nWhile this is true, Mabinogi incorporates many forms of combat, such as:\n* Martial Arts\n* Ninja Skills\n* Magic\n* Alchemy\n* Puppeteer\n* Melee\n* Range\n* Gunslinger\n* Lancer / Knight\n* and more!!\n\n- Quests\nThe Quests is Mabinogi vary from doing something as simple as gathering items, to something as crafty as making an item. They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.\n\n- Housing\nNow, the "Housing" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.\nThe "Homestead" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.\nWhile you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.\n\n- Races\nThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.\nHuman. Giant. Elf.\nEach Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.\nFor example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.\nElves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.\n\n- Marriage & Family\nYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.\nYou can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!\nAs for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.\nA Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.\nThere is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.\n\n- Pets / Mounts\nYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.\nMost of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).\nSome pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.\n\n- Rebirthing\n"Rebirth" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.\nRebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!\n\n- Levels\nThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.\nYour level, which is basically your "combat" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.\nThere is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.\n\nTo level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.\nThe higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.\n\n- Ranks\nSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)\nNovice\nF\nE\nD\nC\nB\nA\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1 - Max Rank\n\n\nAnd now, to my favourite part...\n\n- Non-Combat Skills\nNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.\nWant to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!\nFeel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!\nWant to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!\n\nThere are many non-combat skills to find and master.\nThe one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;\nMusical Instruments & Composing.\nYou can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.\n\nWant to play Skyrim Theme? Done.\nWant to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.\nPokemon Battle Theme? Done.\n\n\nIf you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.\nServer: Tarlach\nMy in-game name: Alyxa","October 12, 2015","true","168.0"," 122 of 134 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","122","134","12","2"

Like I had some of the happiest times in my life through this game; I started this game with 2 of my real life friends, found an amazingly fun guild, and made an amazing friend (though I'm sadly no longer in contact with them) as well as other great friends. Now, sorry for this giant rant, hopefully you read it. I seriously loved this game.\n\nI went and replayed the game about a year ago, hoping to relive my happy times, and to some extent I did, but to a very small extent. I went and played on the Mari server, the once biggest server in the game. I found ALOT of fun through Martial Arts (it was boxing basically), and it was flashy, and the enemy AI (The AI used to be really smart and worked very well, but it was never upgraded to combat skills like Alchemy and Dual Guns, so it became really stupid when you used these skills) was still functional using it, but besides that, everything that made the game crumbled. There was so many damn skills, each one rendering older skills useless. Magic to a point and archery more or less were replaced with Alchemy. Then puppeting came and replaced Alchemy's biggest selling point; having a golem. Then came Dual Guns to completely replace archery (like so few people used archery, why not go and fix it?). The last thing that was added before I gave up on the game was Ninjistu, and I just gave up. It was so silly and extremely anime (yes the game's korean, but it had taste and a really nice art style; not just full fledge kawaii desu Naruto rip-off crap), and I can only imagine this replaced another skill class.\n\n\nThat wasn't the only thing that made me leave, there's a bit more. I could deal with a load of crap skills as long as I had some fun ones, but each new event was complete crap. Back in the old days events were so much freakin fun! Like there was a skiing event, a cotton candy sheep event, and a water balloon party event! (just to list a few). Aw man these were all great and alot of fun to me! But when I returned, it was just non-stop re-hashing of the dragon boating event (where you go down a river in a raft, fight some mobs, get a reward, rinse and repeat) and the Tara event (a japanese style event with a dart throwing mini game and a test-your-strength hammer game.) The Tara event was fun when it released, but it REALLY overstayed its welcome through it being rehashed every other week.\n\nThe economy also went to complete crap. Current day rare items would cost about 10 million+. You wanted a guitar? Better be rich, because you're gonna have to dish out about 20 million. Not only that, all old rare items went to complete commodity. Like I had a rare Leprechaun outfit that was super rare when it first came out; I was one of the maybe 20-ish people who had it on Mari, but when I rejoind they were barely even worth 100k (this is basically normal spending money in player markets). Due to Nexon just re-hashing old content, extremely rare items became to the point of being only uncommon to just somewhat rare. I used to be so proud of alot of my rare clothing; since alot of the game was about fashion and being distinct and being yourself, I felt proud walking about with some really cool n rare clothes, but now that satisfaction I had was quickly diminished.\n\nLastly what made me give up on the game was how lonesome and empty the servers became and how crap the once thriving and amazing community became. I played in about 2009 to 2010, and when I did, I could basically just walk up to anybody and either join in their conversation or start one, and befriend them. It wouldn't be some weird akward conversation either, people would just talk and be friends with eachother. The game used to be a huge party. You could walk down dunbarton (basically the games main town) on almost any server and find naked people running about PvPing one another, and then just down the road find a group of people participating in Elves vs. Giants war. It was great! But when I went back, the place was completely lonely. Nobody talked, there were barely any live guilds anymore, most guilds being dead, and nobody Pvp'd anymore. For the most part, the game was just deserted.\n\nSorry about this huge dang rant man. I just really love this game. It was really important to me. I made alot of great friends through the game, some that I'm sadly no longer in contact with, but I still have the fond memories. This game was amazing in every aspect in its prime; great combat, great community, and great events; there was something to do for everyone, and the game truly was a fantasy life. You wanna go and do something? Go do it! You can! Everything felt important and was satisfying. Even just fishing and gathering potatoes and such was fun, because you always had a friend while doing it or just someone to talk to, and a reason to doing so. I'm always hoping to find another amazing game like this; a game that'd make me excited to wake up and see what's going on, and just a sheer joy to play. I keep hearing about FF:XIV, and here's hoping that I'll be able to enjoy it like mabinogi.\n\nOnce again, sorry for this giant rant; I'm just super passionate about this game. This game meant alot to me.","July 29, 2015","false","442.0"," 192 of 236 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","192","236","16","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoniteace/recommended/212200/","dragoniteace","Chairo (Broadcasting)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoniteace/","80 products in account","*Edited and revised for further clarity and information*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn interesting mmorpg. Having played many mmorpgs before, mabinogi is a favorite due to its dynamic combat system. There are infinite battle combo possibilities as the gameplay involves fast paced action with a unique do-it-yourself strategy allowing almost limitless freedom to choose how you play. While the game features talents (i.e warrior) like most mmorpg's, it doesn't limit what you can and can't do allowing you to choose what skills from any tab (melee, magic...etc) you want to train giving a really unique gameplay individual to the player rather than restriction, emphasizing complete freedom in how you like to play.\n\nAnother appealing factor for mabinogi is the anime-style graphics rather than the traditional realism based graphics that give the game a relaxed outlook rather than a serious tone.\n\nHaving played this game for several years and watching it change and grow i can point out a few perspectives on its pro's and cons:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPro's:\n\n- Freedom to play however you want, as whoever you want to be with no linear path set out for you to take. There are no penalties for doing what you want or neglecting to do certain things if you don't want to. This allows a player to choose what to do, whether it be fighting and training, crafting and trading, or even just socializing.\n\n- Active and alive community full of players from veterans to newbies; never a dull moment no matter where you go (Alexina is one of the most active servers in-game and Dunbarton is one of the most active towns in-game).\n\n- Immersive and involving storyline that spans out several chapters, events, and in-game years that pit you in the midst of the struggle as one of the "milletians" involved in the conflict between the gods and various factions in Erinn.\n\n- Constant updates and add-ons to the game; whether in the form of a new storyline chapter or the many year-round events, mabinogi always keeps you coming back for something new or even something old that is a favorite.\n\nCon's:\n\n- Cash Shop: Some items you might want to acquire (like pets, high grade items or bags for example) are only obtainable through the cash shop, which is if you don't mind the $5-$10 price, and are otherwise difficult to obtain (trading in-game gold for NX codes to get a pet ***not recommended there are many scammers*** or paying millions of in-game gold for a bag or high stat items).\n\n- Skills: Some advanced level skills require immense effort or dedication to obtain (in the form of grinding certain monsters or dungeons to receive quest items or completion points related to the skill you are trying to obtain. Alternatively these skills can be easily obtained by rebirthing into one of the Aces Hero talents, however that also requires direct NX payment or Pons purchased with NX.\n\n- Outdated graphics (however still quaint): Mabinogi was coded and released in an earlier decade where archblade and warframe level graphics were not available. There have been many updates and upgrades since then but no real way to modernize the graphics without creating an entirely new mabinogi game. However the graphics still hold their charm if you enjoy anime-style art.\n\n- Clash of personalities: unfortunately like many online games, mabinogi suffers from groups or individual players who are destructive rather than constructive in the community. This ranges from simple acts of annoyance or "trolling" of the general player-base to out-right scamming and arrogant im-better-than-you attitudes. Thankfully these groups of players are easily identifiable and are only a small part of the much larger community of helpful, respectful, and kind players.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would say, try it out. If you like it, then enjoy it. If you don't then that's alright too. Don't knock it till you try it. It's one of the very few unique mmo's that are out there that feel different from generic mainstream mmo's.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nfor those who are T.L.D.R -> Great fun game with a few issues here and there like any other game (nothing is perfect), if you give it a chance try it out you might like it.","November 25, 2013","true","831.4"," 114 of 130 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","114","130","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattOfApples/recommended/212200/","MattOfApples","Folkie ♞","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattOfApples/","498 products in account","[Edit 7/4/2014] Review has been slightly revised prior to the "New Beginnings" patch. The most noteworthy bits of information: Rebirths are now free and can be performed every day for newbies, and weekly for experienced players, and beginner benefits now extend till level 1000, thus making the game even better since all players don't have a huge waiting time to continue playing the game.\n\n---Original---\n\nAs someone who spent way more than 3,000 hours on this game, I feel as I have seen everything this game has to offer, and I still enjoy coming back to it. Although Mabinogi is a free-to-play game, don't let that label drive you away from trying this unique game out.\n\nMabinogi is about the story of a random Milletian (You) who was sent to the world of Erinn, one thing leads to another and you end up helping to save the world from one of many dangers. The graphics are cell-shaded and provide an anime-like feeling, the background and world is inspired from Celtic Mythology and fantasy titles, and for what it is, realistic looking graphics wouldn't make it look better. I should mention that the game has minimal optimization settings since it's a title from around 2003, but most computers should be able to run it and handle it smoothly.\n\nThe core gameplay of Mabinogi is the freedom to develop your Milletian to be anything and everything. Most of the skill sets are well balanced and influence other skill sets or play styles, giving players the ability to fight as stylish or brute-like as they please while being efficient and reliant on the player's actual observatory skill and reaction time. Skills aren't trained by just leveling up, you have to actually use them in specific ways to be able to train them, and at the end of that, you can advance them to a higher rank, which rewards more damage output and stat increases that carry over no matter what you decide to do next. Combat is also not just clicking and letting your character do all the work. Player input helps determine how the combat pans out, and goes in deeper than just mashing hotkeys. The game is tailored by "If something is bigger, than it is stronger than it as well." It's also a challenge to fend off more than two enemies at once at first glance. Once a player gets in the swing of things and understands what skills are effective and when, then yes it's easier to play and interpret what an enemy will do next, and what skills they should look into advancing.\n\nIf you are already pretty beefy, there are a plethera of life skills which people can work on that reward the ability to produce products of the sort and permanent stat bonuses. Most people only do this on their downtime or till after the point where they feel they are strong enough for what they run.\n\nThe other core function is the ability to "Rebirth." This resets your current player and exploration level to 1, giving you the chance to level-up as easily as you did back when you were level 1. Which in turn, gives you more AP to spend on skills. This means there are no character level caps, and you can keep going to learn new abilities and skill sets. Rebirths are available for free every day for players under total level 1,000, or every 6 days for players over that 1,000 level mark. Some people dedicate a rebirth and pool all the AP they recieve in that timeframe towards a certain skill to get that mastered.\n\nMabinogi has a social aspect as well. A large chunk of players in Mabinogi are either anime fans or people who just want to hang out, and most of these people actually play the game as well. There are various sub-groups people are "put in" based on what they do (PvPers kill each other, Fashionogi stand around flaunting their looks, Vendors/Sellers sell things or advertise, etc.) and a lot of people connect more based off that "system." The forums on the site are also well active, with many people who communicate amongst one another, including with some of the more well-known Nexon employees or community managers.\n\nThe premium shop has it's fair share of criticism since Mabinogi is a free-to-play game. However, in my personal experience, It's not that often where I will say something isn't worth the money. Ranging in the premium shops are pets and mounts which serve as inventory space or... obviously mounts to ride or fly from place-to-place with, the premium services (which isn't required to play the game in it's entirety), and various other goodies. It boils down to if you believe it's a reasonable price for the item and if you are willing to pay for it. Along with this, I'll get criticism for saying this as well, but Nexon is pretty generous with their premium content. A lot of events and even some in-game quests reward players with premium content, double training / AP events, and more content to fondle with.\n\nMabinogi is a truly unique game overflowing with content that you can choose to aspire to or not. When you sit down to the game and play it for the first short while, you will feel accomplished just starting out and getting the hang of combat and gathering. With that feeling, you'll want to get better at the game and pursue playing it more. At first, it's a steep learning curve, but don't let that concern you. With practice, experience, and time, you will be able to take on anything, and you will fully enjoy this game.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding features or anything else in the game, Feel free to note my in-game character, Aradefaktare of Alexina server.","March 2, 2014","true","651.6"," 67 of 78 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","67","78","0","7"

I've been with Mabinogi for a long time playing on and off since 2008. i wanted to input my views of the game so here we go:\n\nThe Pros~\n+ Unique Rock paper Scissor style of combat *\n+ Infinity customization in coloring anything from the soles of your shoes and outfits to the hilts of your weapons\n+ Newbie Friendly Beginner System ( helps you somewhat catchup to the current players )\n+ Unique Rebirth Leveling up System which has no LvL Cap ( main reason i haven't ever permanently quit )\n+ Events come by frequently and so do content updates every few months\n+ Many Crafting Skills\n+ Abundant amounts of daily minigames/quests that you can do\n+ Nice Story\n+ Playerbase is Mostly Friendly.\n\nThe Cons...\n- Nexon.\n- Has a somewhat steep learning curve.\n- Reforges are from cash shop only but are obtainable from other players via in game gold.\n-* The unique combat system slowly dies off as you gain High Dmg. you will end up using just the efficient clearing methods ( although that can be said for most of any game )\n-~ Inventory can become an Issue if you're a hoarder like i am. Pets are almost a must buy utility BUT you are able to buy pets from other players with gold also so...\n-in my honest opinion, at least half of the NA server is lazy af. so many  people just afk and don't run anything ( missions, dungeons, etc. )\n- 7  channels but everyone clogs up on channel 1 and channel 2 through 7 are almost like ghost towns zzzz....\n- Durability.\n\nNeutral\n**- Despite what many people say, Nothing in Mabinogi is actually Pay2Win. Everything is obtainable through grind or luck. things in the Cash Shop are more of Convenience/ Fashion Items.\n\nConclusion.\nI find the game fun to play every now and then but once you've got your gear and many of the skills done there isn't much left to do. the Dye customizations are great!\nI Recomend any new players to find a nice guild or just a nice veteran player in general to help guide you through. guilds are generally very nice in Mabi overall and will help you often.","November 30, 2015","true","387.9"," 58 of 66 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","58","66","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/recommended/212200/","Brightshine","Silverwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brightshine/","182 products in account","I can only begin to try to describe the countless good and bad things about this game, but the bad far outweigh any of the good. Detailed other reasons are noted after the 3 short lists of key factors. Note: I have clocked in several thousand hours over the 5+ years I have played this; before it was available on steam naturally.) Looking back, it was not worth any of the time or money invested.\n\nThe Good: Unique and interesting way of "leveling up" as your power is based on skill levels rather than actual levels (a unique system known as rebirthing is  the fastest way to gain the points to rank up skills).  Combat system Is complex and strategic, with MANY skills to choose from, you can even mix "skill classes" such as melee with supplemental magic attacks  An interesting story and lore with several hundred of hours of quests (not including non-story questing).  They now offer 2 basic pets (with no inventory), a thoroughbred and an eagle (flying pet)The Bad: Traveling can be a pain, pets can only be used a limited time per day, and are still needed to truly get around in longer dungeons and the map To be effective at solo play you need SEVERAL pets, a mount, several combat pets (like dragons or nine-tailed fox), a cloud to heal your HP and wounds (they are also useful fighters; and with their healing nature can save you alot of inventory)  Inventory is a seroius pain to deal with, even carrying basic things you always want on you will need a pet or two (ex. basic tools for most "life skills"; tradeskills)The Worst:  Has had major hacker issues, (characters being corrupted beyond restoration, deletion, etc.) The game is horribly optimized, even with the highest end of computers you can and will experience issues with the frames per second in some areas.  The community is atrocious, you can find it difficult to even get people to help you with basic dailies (easiest difficulty), yet you will be surrounded with 30+ people just sitting in the area idling around and walking about.  Inventory is such a hassle to deal with in general; you will find yourself using up all your bank space, inventory bags, equipment bags (if/when you can afford them), and many pets to hold the things you need for dungeons and crafting.  Over time your favorite items will be damaged from even the best blacksmith/tailor, and when that happens it loses some of its max durability (naturally they make you fork over $6 USD for each "save" per item).  Everything you do and will want will be heavily directing you to the cash shop  Customer Support is deplorable\nAddition of the new "free" pets: Thanks to some feedback I remembered those existed. However do not think its that great you now get some basic free pets for travel. The choices they picked for these "beginner" pets are among the worst in combat, they do not have access to their pet inventory feature (so they cannot hold anything, not even things to heal/mend you; mending is EXTREMELY important, as when you are alone, since pets can mend you as you sit down for full effectiveness of each bandage.\n\nThe Atrocity of the cash shop: I can only begin to try to explain why the cash shop is just among the worst. To save your item's max durability you must repeatedly spend ~$6 USD each time (each item i believe.) This is just unacceptable because you should not be influenced to spend money for something that is such a basic need of the game.\n\nPets cost between $2.90 and ~$18 ... naturally the more expensive ones are among the only really useful ones, as their cost seems to go hand in hand with how useful they will be in both function, and combat. These are important because of any combination combat, travel, healing, gathering, and inventory functions.\n\nThey just go too far tying the cash shop directly into the game,enchantments are among the worst.  Want a good enchantment?  Well enchantments themselves ... when they fail it destroys the item (at higher enchant ranks) lower ranks cost you max durability, and to even get to using higher level enchantments you not only have to do a series of enchantments (going from low ranking to higher ranking enchantment scrolls; you also need the enchantment skill level high enough to be able to do them and up your % of success ... to save an item from a failed enchantment you must purchase an absurdly expensive $$ thing to stop that from happenning.\n\nCharacter slot availability also suffers, you only have 1 character per account ... luckily they have "assistant" cards given to those humans who choose a race (elves or giants) to ally with (not sure if this still holds true). After that you have to spend $10+ per character for new "character cards."). But this is a problem as it limits the different combat playstyles you can try (as levling up different skills do not always compliment eachother, and they all add to "CP" Combat Power, which makes leveling up skills substantially harder in the long run. There is also the fact that for some end game skills you will have to buy a special "ace" card of ~$6 to !$20 just to keep your progression going. One example being the Merlin talent. Depending how much you spend is how much it gives you to start with.\n\nProblem with "Life skills" (crafting):  You will find that it has lots of chances of failure, as if to pad and drag out the experience, some may argue its part of the joy, but I find no join in having an A rank herbalism and struggling to pick even base herbs (the most basic, literally), or blood herbs (for HP potions). Why it costs mana and having to rank up how much mana you have just to batch make potions is stupid (especially for warriors). tailoring and blacksmithing can also feel like a game of chance. And mining is only done within certain dungeons! (only 1 of which being good), There is also of course the obvious fact that Life skills take INSANE amounts of time, grinding, and effort to rank up (literally many hundreds of hours.) Enchanting (although in the magic tab) is the worst of life skill (because of pading and cash-shop tie ins), as you use it to enchant armors/weapons, and of course when those fail ... it destroys the item ... worse yet those scrolls EXPIRE after just a mere 24~48 hours. Basically in laymans terms enchanting is one of the hardest and most drawn out skills to rank up. And the most costly to items, as depending on the enchantment rank (the scroll imbued with the enchantment), you will lose 0~8 max durability to your item ... most have about 10 to 14. Why is this such a big deal? because you will be needing those good enchantments for good gear, especially for later in the game, you will quickly find that the risks for going up only get higher and higher too.\n\nImbalneces between races:  You will notice that humans are the only race that can effectively use pretty much any combat style or skill sets ... yet they are also the slowest movement speeds (which has both travel and combat implications).\n\nRaces are all different, they rank up skills at different rates and costs, but also have different stats per rank. For example a giant has better melee skills (costs less to rank up too), than humans, and elves are the weakest at melee (to a point where investing into it is a bad idea for a playstyle.) Giving each race a lean is good, but making them drastic as it is, is terrible. Especially since finding gear for any race other than humans is VERY difficult (gear outside of starting and basic gear.)\n\nThe combat and story itself are interesting and wonderful (respectively), but Nexon has just butchered the game into something to milk money from, and the sad part is that its been that way for as long as I remember. So this game is definitely not worth your time, or your money.","December 14, 2014","false","526.1"," 148 of 207 people (71%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","71","148","207","17","30"

Sure, it sounds great and all, but it's a serious time consumer. Personally, as a gamer, I want to play as many games as I can for story, gameplay, etc. Mabinogi offers this, but it never stops and consumes all of your time and money.

Overall, your experience in this very old anime-style game will be like no other.\n\n7 years, 3 accounts and $4,600.00 later, I am sadly an addict to this game. I can't seem to quit. My money just keeps turning into NX Credit.\n\nYes, the game is a "Free To Play" title, but once you start throwing money at the game, you notice they make things so much easier for you, and then you want to just... throw more money at the game.

Very Unique and Very Fun.\nI was recommended this game by a friend and I told him that I wasn't very impressed by its 'looks'. Sure enough, I at least gave it a try...and From that point onwards, I have never stopped playing it. That was about a year or so ago. That's how amazing this game is!\nMabinogi is one of those games that doesn't require you to complete EVERY SINGLE quest and task; it's all completely up to you to make the choices and do what YOU want to do.\n\nOne of the main things that makes this game so unique and fun is its combat and leveling system. The combat in this game requires more stragetic choices and as well as good timing of skills and attacks to do some damage against foes, rather than just pressing the skills button to do some extra damage. Also, the leveling is very different to other games. There's quite a lot to explain but to put it shortly: There's no level cap. You can just keep on leveling.\n\nAnother thing is the gaming community. I promise you, that this game has one of the most friendliest communities I've ever played with and that is what keeps me playing. Simply just asking for a little assistance and someone, who hears it, would usually come by and help you out.\n\nLast main thing is the story and updates.

My stuff in Mari is going to be left there, and I'm probably going back in a year or so to see how things are checking up. But at this point.. just don't.\n\nI've played the game at an odd rate. I've played in the Closed Beta as a kid, in which I never really gotten into the game, then the first time I joined Steam (which was around 2012), then last year, and now, this year. I've had my share of "what did I miss?" moments here and there, and now, the game is starting to grow a bit sour, and based on Nexon's tactics, it's going to go nowhere.\n\nProsVery broad gameplay. While there is a focus in the combat, there is more to it than just, "kill everything and report to me."\nNo real class system. This allows for hybrid builds to be viable in most cases.\nNo level cap, so you can just swim in rebirths and get AP fast.\nFrequent updates and events.\nThe talent system increases the rate of which you begin to level skills for a specific trait, which is quite neat.\nTheir exchange rate is there for countries outside of the US from what I've heard from their news.\nFor an RPG, the combat is solid.\nConsNexon. Known for their pricey cash shops, Pay-to-Win setups, and their non-existant American/European customer support; this game is no exception to this rule. It pretty much makes EA a saint compared to Nexon.\nAny new skills added later into the game will be better than nine out of ten of the old skills. No matter how many revamps there are, it will in many cases, be better.\nYou can go pretty fast in the game. Is it bad? Not really, but it's not good for those looking for a game that will suck you in for a year or two.\nThe game is punishing (and not in a good way) in its newer content. The old content is just fine with all due respect.\nAI is questionable. New updates don't apply to the old enemies, so they're petty against everyone else that follows the trend.\nNew Beginnings just slapped old players across the face. New accounts receive six cards in comparision to the old accounts, where they had just one. Veterans, after a looong while, now receive the same benefits from New Beginnings. It doesn't make much of a difference if a veteran blew off about $10-25 on one character card.\nTwin swords dominate the melee field. Basically, there isn't much trade-off other than a lower defense that can be easily blocked off by a fast attack speed.\nInconsistent textures and modeling. Some models look really dated, and others look pretty neat.\nGraphics are left to be desired, as it is very much lackluster in comparision to many F2P games that are in the market.\nHacking is easy and dominant in some channels.\nLack of support on newer Operating Systems. Point will be taken down if it supports Windows 10.\nNewbies get stomped on hard without money they don't make for themselves.\nCrossovers. They make no sense most of the time, and this game is no exception to this rule.\nVerdict: Above average MMO shrouded in poor customer support and lackluster balancing.I don't know much about this game, but the game is starting to crumble down. No matter what updates happen, whether it be new content or new mechanics, the customer support and the many cons that I've listed above will weigh it down until it can pull itself together again. Will it be fixed? Probably not, but my two BK cards from Bing rewards could've had a better time in another game.\n\nYou can get a stronger (and most definitely a more experienced) review from Trigger, an ex-fan who couldn't stand the game and Nexon anymore after many years. His review can be found either here (link) or as the second most helpful review as of this post. While his may seem very negative by blowing things out of the water more than it needs to be, he makes strong points, especially for being a long-term player.\n\nEDIT #1: Well, Trigger just commented here to correct and add a few details on my review, so I changed it up based on the information he provided. I also changed a bit of text.\n\nEDIT #2: Specified a bit more on a con and updated a bit of text. Also fixed up a claim that was deemed to be false.\n\nEDIT #3: Revoked some cons that related to hardware.\n\nNOTE: I no longer respond to the comments and nor will I read any new ones as of the 23rd of October in 2015.

There is really not much you can't do in this game as far as picking how you want your character to look and feel. Outside of few race locked skills there is no ability you can't learn and master in this game if given enough time. Even for people who like to do nothing more than craft items and gear all day the game is set up not only to let you do that, but you to also level up while doing it. In this game what level you are doesn't really mater as much as the rank of the skills you use and how well you can use them. Even a person who is a total newbie can manage to kill bosses for as long as they got the timing of their skills right, know when you block and/or dodge, know what weapons work best for what you are doing. There is no such things as making a bad roll when creating or playing your character as part of the systems as well as story is "rebirthing". Letting to restart your character from lvl 1 and/or change your looks again. When rebirthing only your level is reset and you keep all your gear and skills. So over many life times you can build up your skills only focusing on what you want.\n\nThis updates often with events that are fun for new and old players alike.

I played Mabinogi directly from Nexon before it was released on Steam. Though it seems I have almost no time on the game, I guarentee I've spent at least 150+ hours on the game.\nNow that that's out of the way...\nThis is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best, MMORPGs that I've ever played.\nThis game is far, FAR ahead of its time withs its massive variety of skills ranging from picking herbs to controlling puppets in combat, its INCREDIBLE organization of stats and abilities, its MASSIVE amount of customization and fashion (Hence the nickname "Fashionogi") and wonderful, active community.\nUnlike other MMORPGs, where you choose a class and typically sit on it, making it stronger, creating your own skill sets, etc. Mabinogi has the unique feature in which you can be ANY CLASS. You can do anything...eventually. The game starts out fast so a new player can master one of the classes (For instance, mastering the Warrior class) and then it slows down quite a bit to increase the challenge of the game, demanding a bit more attention and dedication from the player.\nWant to be a warrior? Sure.\nWant to be a mage? Sure.\nWant to be a ninja? Sure.\nWant to be a magical ninja warrior? Sure. It'll just take more time.\n\nHowever, power isn't everything. Tactics and pure skill can determine life or death as much as skills and raw power do in this game. Unlike most MMORPGs, where dungeons are scaled in a way that only players of a certain level or above can survive, Mabinogi changes the whole scene.\nGoing to try and clear a very difficult dungeon at a lower level? A lower level player can do it, provided he or she has the skill and appropriate knowledge of the game mechanics. But is it going to be easy? Not in the least.\n\nEven skills that aren't combat related aren't useless in this game. As they level up, they provide increases for various stat points. No skill is totally useless, its all useful in some way whether the player uses the skill or not.\nThe music is simply wonderful, and the ever updating content and events are always there to keep things interesting.\n\nMy ONLY complaints in this game (And believe me, they were hard to find) is the occasional bug that comes with all MMOs and the fact that the combat system is a tad slower than I'd like it to be.\nNexon is EXTREMELY lazy when it comes to updating the combat engine, though they are making tiny updates (emphasis on "tiny") that are working on changing this.\nBut these flaws are insignificant and downright redundant in comparison to this game's virtues.\n\nMy rating:\n9.5/10.","April 10, 2015","true","2.5"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","33","40","4","0"

You are called a milletian by the worlds people and as you discover more things about yourself, the story unfolds into this tragic and sad conflict of many different people. This is the main focus of the story and I will say that its decent. It will keep you interested but the story mission lines are short. Though at this point in the games life, there are tons to complete. And speedrunning even at low level will only take a couple of hours to finish.\n\nNow on to the Mechanics. Mabinogis combat is simple yet hard to master. It is a lot like rock paper scissors and every skill has its counter. Smash> Defense Counter>smash. Theres many different skills to choose from and you will always feel unique from other people.\n\nThe skill leveling on the other hand is somewhat similar to UO (Ultima Online). You have to use the skill repeatedly to rank it up. For example Smash would require you to kill 10 enemies using smash, smash a critical on ten enemies to rank from rank B to A. These are just examples, but the number of times you would have to repeat using this skill increases to hundreds or even thousands depending on the skill. Some rank themeselves up and you won't even notice it as you play. Other skills will require you to go out of your way just to train them and could take hours of your time just doing that. Life skills like blacksmithing could take you about a month to do if that was what you had spent your time on for a whole month.\nTo rank skills though, you need Ability points. Ap (for short) is given by leveling. I level up to 80 per rebirth for example. After you hit say 80, you will want to rebirth. Rebirthing removes the stats you gained from levels but you keep your stats that you gained from skills. You can only rebirth once a week but you can rebirth for free every three weeks. If you would like to buy a rebirth once a week its about 10 bucks.\n\nThis is actually one of my problems with mabi is that its very grindy. Its a very unique game with huge amounts of character customization. Just very grindy. The questing is totally fine with not much grind at all. Some of the story quests mix it up with puzzles. Its just the actual building of your character.\n\nIf you are looking for an mmo thats different and you can waste a ton of time on but stay engaged, then this is the game for you. Game has quite a bit of sandbox features such as housing and character customization with tons of outfits and skills to mix in. There is even farming.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that will not waste your time but still give you a great experience then this may not be what you are looking for. Mabinogi has to much grind hidden under those colorful cartoony graphics to justify playing only 1 hour a day. You can very well play the game for free without spending a dime, but you will want to. They offer limited edition pets constantly, Various limited edition clothes, and rebirths to make your life easier.\n\nSo all in its a very unique mmo and its hard to lie and say that it isnt. But playing an mmo like this or wow really worth it to you? After all of the fun is said and done and you have seen everything it will turn into a job. Every mmo that is currently out in america will have you grinding for hours. Even guild wars 2 has grind at the end. So is it worth it to you?","December 1, 2013","true","817.7"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"

I love this game so I'm recommending it, Mabinogi is a fun, casual game to pick up and play at your own leisure. Currently my main problem is the combat. Ever since I first started playing this game some six or seven years ago I've noticed one major thing; Nexon's server stability is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If you play this game with the idea that you're going to mainly be combat oriented, you're gonna have a bad time!\n\nCombat in this game is all about picking your battles wisely. Two key factors in combat is lag and targeting. I've already talked about lag so let's talk about targeting. Unless you're good at pointing your mouse in very specific places, you're gonna wanna hold ctrl to auto-target the nearest enemy to your mouse. Now, this isn't a bad thing... unless you're fighting a large boss monster. I'm in the beginner dungeon trying to target a giant red spider when his little buddies are nowhere near my mouse, yet I target them anyways and aggro unwanted enemies, thus getting myself killed.\n\nThat aside, this game has a number of features that make for a great atmosphere. The soundtrack, for example is one of the best I've ever heard in a free-to-play MMORPG. Not only that but you have the ability to pick up an instrument, write your own music and then play said music. The only other game I've seen that implemented would be in LOTRO so this feature is a huge thumbs up in my books.\n\nMabinogi offers a wide range of skills from combat to magic to simple gathering and crafting. Each skill has a rank and the more you work on the skills the more training it gets to the next rank. Before ranking it up you need to spend AP which is gained when you level up. Back when I first played this game AP was really hard to come by so you had to pick and choose what skills you want to work on, the same can't be said now as I have more AP than I know what to do with! Personally, this is a bad thing hiding underneath a good thing. Having all this AP means that you can work on more skills, but at the same time it means that everyone can pretty much be a jack-of-all-trades. This bothers me slightly because it takes away from the idea of players specializing in specific things, constructively forcing them to work together.\n\nCommunity is...well, as I said in my review of WAKFU, you have to know where to look for them. Sure you'll see a group of people hanging out in the Human starter town in channel 1 of any given server, but aside from that I don't see many people aside from your everyday player running to and from one place to another, too busy to stop and chat. There are guildstones placed all over the place, you can click on them to bring up information about that guild. You can also just pull up the guild interface and search for guilds so I find the guildstones pretty redundant. There are also guilds recruiting on Nexon's official forums as well as community forums, which gives the opportunity to speak to the leader or recruiters before joining.\n\nThere are more features about this game that I'm missing, I'll be editing this review at a later date but I thought I should add some more of the game's core features to the review since it was originally pretty bland. I still recommend this game and even though I talk about negative points it is still a great game that you absolutely must experience at least once.

I love the concept that this game has. I think the fact that you can rebirth and master multiple skills instead of being restricted to one class is really cool. Being a music teacher, I also love how you can compose music on here using actual music theory. The in-game music is pretty awesome as well. One thing I don't like is how buggy the game is. The pathwaying for the game seems pretty sloppy, as I occasionally find myself glitching in the same spot when I try to talk forward (especially through the narrow hallways in the dungeons). I also invited some friends to play the game, and it seems like most of them have problems when they try to launch it (these people also have very capable computers, so I wouldn't call it a systematic problem). Another thing that really bothers me is the pop-up tip windows. I try disabling them, but it doesn't seem to work. It's tediously annoying to have to deal with that appearing in the middle of my screen during a fight.\n\nOverall, I like this game. I think you'll enjoy it too, if you can work around the little annoying bugs and pop-up windows.","October 30, 2014","true","68.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

Wether you acctuly like the anime or not, there is no doubt that Mabinogi closely resembles some of its elements. However, I whole heartedly say this, Mabinogi is not for everryone. Why you may ask? Well, simply but, Mabinogi is very, very, VERY grindy. If you want to have a half decent character, you need to grind. See, there are 2 ways to play Mabinogi. 1. You can play just to dork around and talk to some friends you convinced to play with you. 2. You can feel like a toatol badass when your character is so combatically stacked, that plowing through hoards of enemies with one quick swoop becomes incredibly entertaining. That' right folks, you want some fun out of this game? You gotta learn to fight, and fight like a pro. This is where Mabinoig is the most grindy. See there are multible classes (or talents). And each talent has its own weapons, and stats, and blah blah blah. But here's where the game is intresting, some talents work off the same stat, thus making it that if you did both classses, both would become stronger due to you training that stat. Here's an example for you: If you do Close Combat, which get's its power off of your strength stat, and you alos did Ninja, which also get's its power from the strength stat. Now both of these talents become stronger because they both work off the training of the strength stat. Some people will take this to the extream by taking many different talents that rely on strength, or intelligence, and train them up so that they can be powerful in a whole arsenal of classes. Now how do these classes work? Well remember how I said this game is kinda like Sword Art Online? Well basically each class has X amount of skills, and each skill can be trained and ranked up by using AP. Every skill can go from rank F to rank 9, and then rank 9 to rank 1. This obviously is where the game becomes very grindy. In order for your skillset to be half decent, your going to have to train that skillset a lot and earn lots of AP. However, that makes becomming a respectable warrior all the more rewarding. Mabinogi is honestly very addictive, it plays off its own grindiness, pulling you in and making you beg to bring your skill up just one more rank before bed. Basically if you give Mabinogi time, and take the time to learn the ropes, and find your way around (I would suggest using the Mabinogi wiki page) then you will find that Mabinogi is a really great game.","April 17","true","617.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","1"

Using 'was' because I played it for over 5 years and outgrew it already, but couldn't just leave without reviewing my experience.\n\nLet's start with the good stuff.\n\n-Uniqueness\nThis game is old, and it was way ahead of its time. There were so many features other MMO's never even though about having. So much stuff to do.\nThere's not even a level cap so you could just literally keep on playing this game until it died.\nUpdates are frequent and have actual creative/interesting content.\n\n-Combat\nHow do I even begin to explain how amazing the combat in this game is.\nSure it's point and click, but its deeper than the typical point and click game.\nYou actually need to think about what you're doing instead of just spamming 1-9 skill keys like other similar MMO's do.\n\n-Graphics\nFor a game from 2003(?) the graphics don't harm the experience.\nThe anime style of the game still kept it refreshing.\n\n-Story\nOh man, the story in this game..\nAll I can really say is that its confusing and doesn't flow together but its interesting at the least.\nThe directors kept changing for this game and they never continued each story arc, they made their own instead.\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game?\nNexon.\n\nThe name itself pretty much has a derogatory meaning in the world of MMO's\n\n-Horrible customer service\n-It's just another pay to win-free to play game.\n\nThe community isnt that great either, it was good at first but then corrupted once cash items started becoming necessary to be good at this game; Such as reforges.\nDon't get me wrong.. I've spent hundreds of dollars on this game. Looking back at that.. it wasn't really worth it.\n\nBut if you can get past Nexon, for some odd reason. Then go ahead and try out Mabinogi.\nThere weren't many MMO's to play back when I played this. The ones that did come out, never stood up to Mabinogi's features. Not to mention that I had a crappy computer, so this game was perfect for it.\nI grew up with this game and it'll hold always be special for me. But yeah, if you want a more modern version of Mabinogi, just wait until Peria Chronicles goes west.

I've met some people i plan to keep around for the rest of my life on it. but remember, it's called a "fantasy life" for a reason (sometimes drama and all). it can consume ALOT of time.\n\nOne other thing to remember, this game doesn't hold your hand. everything i know about the game i had to find out for myself.\n\n*edit* at the bottem of this review i will do a hard break down of a single combat encounter.\n-----------------------------\nPros?\n\nLitterally no level cap,\n\nInteresting combat (can be complicated), it's skill combo based, you need to act and react according to what you, AND your enemy is doing. spamming one skill will get you killed. unless your a playing range.\n\nMany classes, each with completely different play styles, and any skill can be used while under any "talent" as the game calls it, your talent only means your gain double xp for the skills under that talent, there is only race restrictions for some skills.\nSome of the combat talents are; close combat, mage, puppeteer, Alchemist (construct, and battle), Lance, bard  (mostly buffs only one offensive move), fighter, ninja, gunslinger etc.. theres alot to pick and choose from for combat\n\nThere is many many things to do outside combat, there is alot of life skills, cooking, smithing, magic craft, etc.. the list goes on and alot of these the high end goods from these crafts can fetch a handsome price. and outside skills? there is treasure hunting on Iria, and different types of collection books to fill, such as types of food you've eaten, types fish caught, monsters you've hunted. Commerce is another thing, in which you take goods from one town and take them to another and hopefully sell for a higher price, which nets gold and ducats, ducats used to buy limited supply goods and more powerful versions of standard weapons.\n\n\nMANY MANY skills, (want to be a master of milking? how about hoeing? you can do that.)\n\nalmost always 1 or more events happening,\n\nnew stuff all the time,\n\nfriendly crowd (depending on server, but over all amazing and you can usually find someone willing to help you at any time, the game is better when your friendly and make friends, just a tip.)\n\nmore clothes and styles then you can shake a stick at, (all of which can be gotten with out spending a dime, though.. sometimes the dime would be "cheaper")\n\ngreat customization options (sometimes at the cost of money),\n\ninteresting lore and story (if you can read)\n\nregular updates\n\n------------------------\n\nCons?\n\nYou can find yourself spending quite a bit of money for anything from pets, pon (for character features and homesteads), limited time clothes, character cards, and such\n\nthe nice clothes, aren't cheap with ingame money. get use to it.\n\ncombat can be complicated if your coming from the typical mindless button mashing mmo.\n\nwith out spending money, there is only 2 free pets you get on start, a horse (without inventory), and a eagle mount (with out inventory). later you can get a Pegaus mount (with inventory) per character, but you have to go through a story line that can kick your butt with out the skill lvl for it. There is a biannual event where you can (after alot of work) get free pets with an sizable inventory, other then that, events where you get pets.. are rare.\n\nWith out spending money, your basic character will look pretty bland and dull. (with one or two dollars though, it can be vastly improved.)\n\nGachapons, can turn in to an addiction if u don't watch out.\n\nLag, glitches and such happen, but are completely bareable.\n\n_____________________\n\nOverall, it's an mmo i don't plan on leaving for a while, and i've hopped from most other mmo's out there, this one, is different and i love it. For me, the best part of the game, might not be the game, alot of it is the comunity.\n\n_____________________\n\nCOMBAT BREAK DOWN:\nok i'ma try and be as simple as i can with this.. this games combat is.. for the most part very unqie\n\nmelee encounter:\n\nas your enter combat you open with SMASH (an opening hard hitting move used to 'smash' through defence)\n> the enemy after being smashed and taking 100-500% damage and being knocked back (human scale) will then use either defence, counter, or windmill, smash or simple basic attack back (each require different answers)\n- for DEFENCE use smash again and knock enemy back again\n- for COUNTER use use windmill and knock enemy back again\n- for WINDMILL load defence and walk up and take reduced damage (like a 1) and then attack enemy with basic attack, or a skill of your liking, has to be instant load and knock enemy back.\n- for a BASIC ATTACK you would want to use counter, which will negate damage, and deal damage to the enemy knocking them back again or you would use defence, which will greatly reduce damage and likely deal only 1 to you, but as a trade off, will alow you to freely attack the enemy how ever you like.\n-for SMASH you want to use counter, smash negates defence, so counter is the best option, you can as well basic attack out of being smashed, counter will knock enemy back again.\n\n>when a enemy is knocked back there is a fallow up move, ASSAULT SLASH, which you will charge the enemy, and deal more damage ontop, but leave you close to the enemy with less reaction time, the move will do a small knock back.\n\n>Now if you attack the wrong way.\n-if you smash the counter, you will take your damage added to the enemy damage\n-if you basic attack the counter, you will take your damage added to the enemy damage\n-if your basic attack defence, you will be stunned and the emeny is free to attack you\n-if you windmill defence you will be stunned and the enemy will be free to attack you\n-if you counter defence nothing will happen till one of you changes your attack.\n-if you get close to the windmill, the enemy will deal damage to you, and knock you back\n-if you use counter with windmill, the enemy will attack you will windmill and negate counter\n-if you load defence for the smash you will take smash being knocked back\n-if you if you do nothing to any of these the enemy will attack you. derp.\n\n>now another thing, every skill have different amounts of cool down, so you WILL NOT be able to answer the same way to everything every time. you will be forced to answer in different ways.\n\n>there is "ultimiate" type of skills "final hit" is the big warroir one.\n>there is many, many modifiers ontop of all of this, armour, weapons, enemy armour, enemy stat modifiers.\n>there is multi-aggro enemies, which complicates this even farther.\n>there is far far more warroir skills that are avaible then what i've given examples of.","December 23, 2014","true","980.7"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","30","39","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CodedSkyline/recommended/212200/","CodedSkyline","Hernggg Durr Engir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CodedSkyline/","45 products in account","As a veteran who has played this game for 6-years, I would recommend this; however, this game has really reached its end-point and it has lost its luster. Why? There are various reasons and it's the reasons why I have left this game permanently, with some very few exceptions of coming back for the story content.\n\nNOTE: I have played more than 2000+ hours of this game; however, I have never kept it attached to my current Nexon Account, because the one attached to this is my banned account.\n\nGameplay / Game Compatibility - The game engine runs on a pretty old engine from 2003 and it has hardly been tweaked for newer contents. While that might not be the problem, the reason why this game has issues here is because of the "security programs" and constant "bug fixes" that Nexon does. This game literally burnt out my previous computer, because it couldn't handle Nexon's new "security programs" and "fixes" between year 4 and 5, and had to buy an Alienware M14xR2 to keep playing at 30+ FPS a second. I can play Tera Online and Archeage and sustain better FPS at high graphics (which has a newer engine and better graphics) than what Mabinogi can do.\n\nGame Management - Horrible. DO NOT HAVE HIGH STANDARDS FOR THIS COMPANY AT ALL OR YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This company has went back on many of its promises to the player base in the past few years and literally doesn't investigate problems appropriately. There are hackers still playing who has been in major incidents for several years, while there has been countless innocent players banned because Nexon found them for "illegal third-party clients." Even I was one of these victims in year 4 of my gameplay, but I just remade my character after months of trying to dispute the claim with their e-mail and ticket system.\n\nGame Community - You can say this has the equalivency to Gaia Online. Dramatic, horrible, and down-right vile. While there might be a small group of players who actually are nice and look out for each other, the grand majority of the community is compiled of either: elitists, drama wh*res, fashion addicts, merchants, Nexon / Sabina whiteknights (people who solely defend Nexon with complete disregard of what wrong they've done), PvP addicts, pr*stitutes/womanizers, and/or trolls. I've played on three of the four servers and I can safely assume this is on all the servers.\n\nGame Events - Hallowed out and barely worth it. Out of the all events in two years, there is about 5~10% of the events that we actually get rewarded with decent stuff. Otherwise, all the events that get transferred from the Korean/Chinese/Japanese Servers get their rewards hallowed out and replaced into the gachapon / boxes. This is the only way how they can actually sustain their game services, because they literally advertise the hell out of gachapons and any event that requires you to spend money. (Basically, Pay2Win) So, you're basically feeding the company money for decent-quality events in the game. While they might've removed rebirth cards and such, they still ♥♥♥♥♥ out the gachapons and other services like crazy. And before I jump to the next part, Nexon loves putting those AFK events into the game.\n\nTeamwork vs. Solo - In the beginning, the game was heavily relied on Teamwork in the dungeons. You had to be a high level with some good gear to even sustain Solo capabilities (which also involed Pay2Win back then) in all dungeons. After several years, a level 100 with heavily overpowered gear can do about the same as some overpowered 2k+ player did back in the first 2 years of the game. I can understand if you're making a new character to restart, but the game has went overboard on how broken a newbie can be now.\n\nOverall - The game is actually good and such, but the company and community has ruined it to the core. I enjoyed the game over the past six years, but I had to finally put this game down in June and call it quits. The game wasn't really fun anymore, the community has been getting progressively worse overall, the game was starting to eat up more resources on my Alienware labtop, and the company kept forcing Pay2Win-events down everyone's throats. Why play a game that gear is heavily backed by Pay2Win options, a company that hardly takes care of the game and players and breaks it consistently, events that hardly has any value to them, and requires you to buy a new computer every year to keep up with the stability of the client? I wouldn't.","September 28, 2014","false","0.2"," 51 of 82 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","51","82","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/10068366/recommended/212200/","10068366","Praise Lastation","http://steamcommunity.com/id/10068366/","49 products in account","An Affectionate Retropective...\nI haven't touched this game in a while, thus I can't represent what the game is now, however I can give my thoughts on what it was like a few years ago. The only reference used here is my own memory; this will mostly likely have bias, as a person who did enjoy the game. I bolded the important bits for tl;dr.\n\nThe story is actualy good for once, or at least the first three generations were. I can't remember what the rest of them were about, though I do remember that they continued the story line in one of the later generations (17~18 I believe). I don't think I've ever seen characterization of this extent in any MMORPG; to this day I still occasionally wonder what ever happened to Triona and Ruari. The NPCs are recurring, meaning that they still are relevant through out the game relative to the story. There's even a relationship system with the NPCs, though I do think it could be fleshed out some more. Perhaps they've already fleshed it out by now, who knows? I remember giving lots of bread to the nun that's always outside the Church in Tir, I'd finally got her to warm up to me after ~50 loaves of bread and occasionally she'd give me a boiled egg. It was ... heart warming, and it's probably the only thing remotely similar to human affection I'm ever going to get from a girl.\n\nThe music is god tier. Each NPC has their own special song. The nun outside the Church had a particularly wonderful tune. Here it's better to show you, listen for a bit: https://youtu.be/rG2Z9dnovKA\nIt almost seems like each song was composed to maximize nostalgic value, even more so once I heard the lyrics to the theme song sung by Tanaka Rie; it was as if it was speaking directly to former players. Not to say that new players can't enjoy the music as well, it's just that listening to these pieces right now, it has more impact than one would think.\n\nIt's an ever lasting game. There is no level cap, how it works is that every so often you'd reset yourself to level 1 again keeping your skill progression. You can literally play for as long as you want with out it getting too slow to level. And when I speak about leveling it doesn't nessesarily mean grinding.\n\nEven with the unconventional combat system (for it's time), you're not required to grind or even kill anything at all. The game doesn't follow the point, click, and wait system that was common during that time, it was a little more dynamic than that; in fact back in the day getting hit twice usually meant death. Goblins, being one of the lower forms of enemies, would still deal out high amounts of damage both in raw damage and in numbers (multi-aggro). The good thing is that you don't have to kill monsters if you don't want to, with the release of non-combat leveling, you can be a farmer that levels up by touching chickens, milking cows, etc, or you could just blacksmith things all day. I found it particularly fun to simply search for gems to feed to the loli living in my knife.\n\nCustomization is a core aspect of the game. If I had one good thing to say about Nexon's cash grabbing, it's the customization options. They do a pretty good job of offering a bunch of choices. That's all on top of the innate customization in the game, I can't even count the amount of clothing articles this game has. Even in the case that you see someone wearing the same thing you are, there's dye. mathmatically there are millions of possibilities, for God's sake you can dye your weapons. You write your own music, you design your own plot of land, etc. Combat wise some of the key choices the game shoves at you is Paladin vs. Dark Knight, Elf vs. Giant, I think you have to choose the Demi-god thing too; I can't say for sure, I never got that far in the game (those quests were too dificult for me).\n\nNot to say there's nothing negative to say about Mabinogi...\n\nThe graphics may be a bit blocky for this generation, especially with these fancier games coming out. My defence to this is that the magnitude of customization offered here would not be realistically possible with "next gen" graphics, though keep in mind this game is aged, for if we look at Elder Scrolls, Black Desert, etc we can obviously see model level character customization. Even those games however lose to Mabi in the amount of apparel there is.\n\nFrom what I understand with recent updates the player character gets incredibly stronger, putting less emphasis on the need for tactics. (Who needs tactics when enemies that used to 2-hit you now only deal 1 damage). Perhaps this is to accomodate for this new age, refer to Pokemon ORAS and it's justification for not having a Battle Frontier.\n\nI remember the movement system being a little quirky, though they did mention they were working on improving it, adding features like auto-pathing and anti-clipping.\n\nThere's actually so much more wrong with the game, but to me it's just part of what makes it special. In fact, given this age, I predict that you probably won't like the game; the AI was all over the place, it was really laggy sometimes, and there were many glitches. In the end, they all just grew on me after so long.\n\nWell this is the best I could do at hopefully getting someone to play the game, or not play it, having nothing but a past experience. Trust me, I have well over the ~200 odd hours that is documented on Steam, as Mabinogi only got put on Steam well into it's life. The only reason I stopped playing was because I could not play due to starting college a few years back, and believe me I consider myself somewhat tech savvy, I tried everything in my power to get around the port-blocking set in place by the school.\n\nI think this game is largely player driven, and without those players, you'd find the game to be quite stale. I have no idea how the player base is with this game of this moment, I don't know if this game is dead, but I have played of lot of these newer MMOs (Dragomon, Tree of Savior, Blade & Soul, etc) if the player base resembles that of the newer games, where everyone is about their own business not even bothering to stop and talk, the game might as well be dead. To spare myself from that I'll just leave it at that. I'll probably never play this game again as it's been far too long for me to get back into it, but I gotta say those few years that I did play were some damned good years. I'll always compare any new MMO I play to this game and will probably always be dissapointed.\n\nNow for those of us that did used play the game, instead of a closing statement, take a moment to watch this video:\nhttps://youtu.be/gr3WH6KMFQk","April 12","true","182.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

I played it when it first came out #hipster.\n\nMabi is a game that basically plays like a more awesome, anime version of Runescape. If I have to be honest. You can train talents and skills related to combat, tailoring, cooking, carpentry, fishing, etc. It's basically a virtual life simulator that happens to have weapons and monsters involved. There are marriages, familiies, and of course the classic guild.\n\nThe combat system is strategy based, with a heavy emphasis on stacking and planning out the use of your skills (Combo. If you will). Simply left clicking on an enemy is enough sometimes, but when you start diving into deeper dungeons, or the dark, deep wilderness - you're going to want to know how to run your dang combat skills.\n\nRecent updates have made the game MUCH more accessible as far as talents and skills go. And with frequent. FREE updates coming constantly, there's no shortage of content available to keep even the "old school" players entertained.\n\nThe music is amazing, and the art style is a pleasant, cell shaded anime style that appeals to a great deal of players.\n\nIt's F2P, so the only thing you honestly have to lose is time. I would recommend Mabinogi to anyone into MMORPGs.","March 31, 2014","true","104.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

You can also play the game however you like: want to be a sword-weilding elf wearing beach shorts and sandals in the middle of a frozen tundra?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virusboy286/recommended/212200/","virusboy286","Virusboy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virusboy286/","52 products in account","A once great game now nothing more than a black hole for your wallets bordom.  Maginogi, coming on 9 years live, has seen better days with more activity.  What can be said?  Nexon, the publishing company for the devcat studio based in Souel, South Korea, has watch its hit game run into the ground.\n\nNexon is no better, letting employees abuse the job by ban hammering anyone they please or creating chaos without due consequence or respect.  Before Danel Kim showed up with KNoxxr, the infamious CFO, VP to PR; Mabinogi held on to the top 5 list in IGNs best free to play, letting player customize thier "Fantasy Life" and giving them room to follow a path of their own choosing without talent trees to follow.  Mabi once held a hybrid subscription, where you could play as much a you want but things like mainstream storylines and talking with your egos, was not premitted unless you paid the 15$ a month.  Rebirths weren't free either.\n\nSo whats changed and does it get my seal?\n\nFirst off lets look at events.\nEvents have always had something to remember them by in terms of unquieness.  Now every three months there is a fishing event.  Events now do not reward the player justly as it did 2-3 years ago.  Events are also tuned a step above in terms of difficulty.  So no matter what your doing some event that you just can't solo, and if you do; the reward never fits, ever.\n\nRNG.\nRNG, or random number generator, is heavly used in Mabinogi, mainly with life skills.  If you ever enchanted something, you know what I mean, if not this is how it works, mabi never has a 100% garuntee unless it involves quest items.  Now normally 100% meant 100%.  From experence, 100% isnt 100%.  At times the RNG feels more broken then working within the bounds it was meant for.  Even Will Saves don't always roll and check.  That being said it doesn't seem like the game likes playing fair.\n\nContent.\nLately Content seems exhusted from being crapped out every 6 months for huge lore updates.  The latest Saga season feels rushed and doesn't even explain anything past the re washed Ruairi hates everyone and no one live a hapy life.  Old content has now been nerfed.  Honestly, I hate how g1-12 have been reduced, even noobs can take Glas on alone and win.  Although I do get bragging rights for about 90% of my toons passing g3 before nerfdom, the nerf given is a bit extreme.  Without a level cap, or an end game result, nerfing kinda felt pointless.\n\nLeveling.\nLeveling no longer require grinding.  Before g17, players were capped at 100, requiring more exp to be gained between times.  Level 30 for most was the start of grindy.  Now players can level to 100 with no problem.  With Mobs that carry the Ancient title, exp is increased greatly for those not label weak against you.\n\nCombat, Loot and game Mechanics.\nOk, here I'll start with combat.\nStarting off in G2, you could use the skills you obtained from vairous parts of Ulhaid, and make combos or useful ideas to down a somewhat OP mob.  Now the combat engine features a no load, post-use cooldown.  Effectivly making me feel weaker and using my skill with way more cumbersome use.  Before you could use stradegy or have a unquie fighting style, where now is more number crunching to one hit everything.\nLoot is for the most part off and on when it comes to getting that one thing.  For one, Ancients used to drop items that normally you would find in Advance dungeons, Theater Missions, Shadow Missions, or quest items like Fireball shockwave thunder or Ice Spear.  They now drop nothing.  Mabinogi also has annoying times where the loot given for very hard mobs dont fit what so ever.  Where trash drops better than average stuff where the boss drops trash.(Yes some do).  And if your looking to farm gold from Mobs, do not bother.  Your better off playing the market.\nGame Mechaincs are the only thing that do make sense.  If someone has a shield and is defending, no matter the skill the cannot be knocked back unless being charged.  SOme mobs have certain restrictions when it comes to fighting them.  However limited, mechanics still exist.\n\nCommunity is dead.\n\nCustomer Support is really a bad joke now.  Submit a ticket and get a response in a week, if your graced with good fortune.  Everyone who answer a ticket is cryptic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag, or plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy.  They treat you like ♥♥♥♥ and still expect you to be ok with it.  GMs are now not allowed to make them selves public due to a bad day in Dunbarton.  PR is not something Nexon is fond of assocating themselves with.  Modders have even moved on, not to the 5 anti cheating systems now in place, but merely because Nexon will ban anyone for any reason no questions or refunds.\n\nCash shop.\nIt has its sales, it has good things.  Mainly more for people who have nothing else to blow money on.\n\nGraphics.\nThe same when it launched.  Mabi uses an anime style of CGI.  But no improvements have been made since.  Same with Sound.\n\n\n\nThis is a game for those who once played it, I will never recommend a Nexon game, ever.  Mabinogi is more for those who want nostagla.  Otherwise, your in for a night of swearing.","November 12, 2014","false","26.3"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","23","37","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/recommended/212200/","Sylek","Sylek Isana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/","5 products in account","I've found that I can be really picky about MMO's to the point that I'll only play one or two. Character customization and freedom are key things for me and Mabinogi has those. It is not perfect, but I don't think any MMO will ever be. I'll list some of the good and the bad (and other key notes) and let you decide if it's for you.\n\n--Cons--\nNexon/Cash Shop: The cash shop does support the game, but with people spending hundreds, if not more, each time a Gachapon comes out it gets a bit excessive. There are some useful consumables, and some pets and outfits that change frequently.\nGrinding: Grinding is very real in this game. Finding materials or items for quests or crafting can take hours. Training some skills can also be a pain in the ♥♥♥.\nAP: Skills are more important than levels and all skills have their own rank and use AP to get those ranks. I listed this in the Cons because it shouldn't be spent wildly, even though it is technically unlimited, because it can take a while to get.\nQuests: A number of the quests are the generic, lackluster fetch or hunting quests.\n\n--Pros--\nEvents: Nexon always has some sort of event running and 9/10 are at least decent (there is one where I had to fight two dragons (with other players) and all I got was a crappy MP potion. That event was cut short and replaced). Some events will give cash shop consumables, unique outfits, pets, exp, or just other unique items.\nCustomization: There are several free options for physical appearance and your armor and weapons can be dyed. Finding a player with the exact appearance and outfit and colors would be difficult unless you coordinate it.\nClassless: Something I like in games. Rather than choosing a class, you choose a talent that helps with training associated skills. You can change your talent and it doesn't restrict any equipment or skills. You could be a Mage with heavy armor bashing things in the face with an umbrella.\nStory: There is an extensive story, but all of it is optional. There are some exceptional rewards for parts of the story (transformations, a free pet) but with the open world you never have to touch it. It's also possible to start later parts of the story. Best of all, the quests are generally unique.\n\n--Neutral--\nDungeons: Dungeons are randomly generated and are have some unique rewards. Searching for a specific reward, however, goes back to the grinding note. It's especially annoying to have a multiple floor dungeon and not get the drop you need.\nRaces: There are three playable races in game, each with their own pros and cons. This and your name are the only things locked about your character, but I listed it in Neutral because I'm not especially for or against it.\n\nOverall, I'd rank Mabinogi a 8/10. There's an extensive wiki available online, and you can find some helpful cash shop items in player shops (can be a little expensive though). There's also a few minor glitches, but all games have that.","March 2","true","096.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There is a variety ways of optaining gold but mercy will you still have trouble affording repairs.\n\nThe game was, and still is, designed to be played with others: You can't really do it alone for the beginning, in fact in the beginning NPCs encourage the player to meet others.\n\nThat doesn't mean somehow the game becomes easy with more players: Throwing impossible odds at you in the later chapters is pretty much mabs at this point.\n\nNow if you're interested thus far you're probably wondering if this is P2W: It's not.

In fact for 400 hours wasted I didn't pay a cent and I still managed. A lot of the paid stuff isn't even that good, it just looks fancy.\n\nYou will struggle; you will suffer.

It has so many skills, many different classes to choose from, and a rebirth system that allows you to keep on playing without worrying about the level cap. My character just hit lvl 4200...Yes 4200 xD Thats almost 8 years of playing. Another great thing about this game is the social aspect to it. I can sit in the main town (Dunbarton) play my instrument, train some skills, and simply talk for hours to nearest ppl and make friends. Their is probably always a great event going on for players of any experience. They constantly update the game. Ah and one of my favorite features of the game is customization. In this game we like to call it fashionogi haha. Dressing your character in whatever you want, and dying your clothes whatever you want  without any level restrictions. I've even had my character cosplay Kirito from sword art online. I'm always shopping for new clothing! Before Mabinogi I played Runescape for many years. They are somewhat similar in the way the skills work instead of ranking skills from 1-99 its Rank F-1 which costs Ability points that you get from leveling up and rebirthing. I reccomend this game 100% I've stuck with it for 8 years already on the same character!","May 22, 2014","true","820.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I searched for a free alternative that had appealing visuals and since I am a fan of the anime aesthetic I figured what the heck it's free and cute so I'll check it out! First impressions of the game don't really excite me as much as the trailer had. The art in the trailer seemed more crisp and vivid to me but that could just be my graphic settings not correctly configured yet. The text can have some grammatical issues but it doesn't detract from the gameplay too much. The art style is a bit underwhelming, in comparison to what I had witnessed in the trailer, but still very cute. I am assuming that later on as I progress there will be more attractive armor sets. Anyways, some things I do like about it, and I'm even impressed with, so far is the fact that this game actually has more going for it than I expected! One of the cute things I really love about this game is that you can even have a culinary talent as well as some obscure things like going up to a chicken and taking its egg. I like this because it reminded me of one of my favorite games of all time, Harvest Moon. :P Another thing I really found cute and enjoyable about Mabinogi was the adorable pets!!! I don't own any yet but that definitely is something I would love! These are some of the cutest pets I've ever seen! I even saw a baby seal in a shark costume... >.< OMG MY HEART! :P lol So as you can see Mabinogi definitely has some strengths and weaknesses but overall I definitely recommend it if you are short on cash and want something free to play and pass the time by yourself or with friends.

Also, it is NOT PAY-TO-WIN.\n\nHi. I urge you to strongly consider giving this game a try; you may just find it worth your time, and if not I won't stop you from turning away. If you don't care for some sections I made in this review, scroll past them. But - trust me that CHARACTER, COMBAT, and CONTENT are worth the read. Subsequently, I will try to the best of my ability to summarize different aspects of the game I have categorized this review into, in an effort to pique your interest in trying out MY FAVORITE GAME IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.\n\n1. INTRO: Mabinogi is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥me different from any you've ever played. If you plan to read on, throw out all you know old-school tab-targeting hotkey-mashing MMOs. If that's what you like, you DEFINITELY should try this game, because it'll be a very interesting experience for you. Mabinogi has no stupid beginner collecting/grinding quests, no slow leveling and skill-acquiring, no long exhausting distances to travel. In fact, suppress what you know about every MMO you have ever tried, because this game is just that different.\n\n2. FLAWS: I'll get the bad and ugly out of the way first so they scare you away before and not after you spend all this time reading my review.\n\n- This game is run by Nexon America, the same publishers of Combat Arms and Maplestory. Nexon users have reported bad experiences with customer support but it will be different for everyone.\n- The game will go down for maintenance subjectedly, sometimes up to thrice a month, but Nexon will give a 10-minute warning for the scheduled ones which usually only last hours.\n- Crashes are rare but not unheard of. Only people with personal shops lost items before in a crash, and Mabinogi's servers have only crashed once or twice in the past 6 years.\n- Bugs are rampant in this engine like an infestation of Bethesda Games' code's bugs with a mutation of gun-powered butts that just spray ♥♥♥♥ everywhere and spit in your face to top it off. None are game-breaking, but some annoying bugs are seen in aspects like user interface.\n- Players can experience NA server lag because they are not timezone-based. From the East Coast, my latency in Tarlach is generally smooth.\n\nStill reading? I hope you are finding tolerance in these errors and will consider giving this game a chance. Read on.\n\n3. CHARACTER: Your characters are classless, cloneless, and 100% customizable. You will never find another person exactly like you. You will choose from different eyes and hairstyles, colors for both, as well as age and gender. You can shape your character however you like - your first one even has access to ANY premium facial feature (disregard what the game says about giving premium features to your first character).\n\nThere is ZERO class selection. ZERO. Even after you select a talent, you are completely free to assign Ability Points to WHATEVER you wish along the way. Your skills train by actively using them and meeting requirements rather than by level. Spend AP (earned by leveling) to upgrade skills to the next rank. HOWEVER - you never run out of AP because of the rebirth system which I explain later in this review. Skills have 15 ranks each, and reward you with master titles when you complete the highest.\n\nDifferent schools of combat can be focused or, if you choose, not focused: Bows, 3 kinds of Alchemy (quite similar to Fullmetal Alchemist itself, even), Magic, or even Bard, Puppetry, Gunner, and martial-arts-like Fighter. Three elemental types in the game add to the dynamic fighting system - Fire, Ice, and Lightning. There are also life skills, like tailoring, blacksmithing, and fishing.\n\nA rebirth system allows you to reset to a current Level of 1 every few weeks (recently changed to every week), giving free regular access to more Ability Points to rank skills while keeping EVERYTHING about your character, while resetting only your age, current level (you maintain a total level), and if you choose, looks.\n\n4. COMBAT: similar to a kind of Rock, Paper, Scissors. I would define it as strategy combat. It requires a degree of timing and reaction-based approach. Skills are loaded and executed.\n\n5. COMMUNITY: There are guilds. Social interaction is a HUGE part of the experience of Mabinogi. Differences between any two can mean nothing at all. A friend window allows an email-like system. Gestures allow people to animate characters to fit their mood. Nothing at all can be transferred across the 4 servers, save friends and IM messages.\n\n6. CONTENT: You can fashion yourself with a HUGE selection of clothing items and dyes, or work on Life skills. Lack of classes allows for free switching and hybrid builds fit to your own playstyle. You don't have to find a single monster to bash the entire game - hone a life skill instead and be a merchant. You even own your own free Homestead.\n\n7. EVENTS: Nexon will add friendly (though oftentimes, very cheesy) events almost weekly where players participate in certain objectives to win rewards. None ever require pay-to-win or elite levels to take advantage above others.\n\n8, PETS: though most are bought with real money, the game grants you two free permanent mounts as you complete the beginner quests. All pets fight for you, are shared among ALL characters, and have inventories. Many have unique abilities.\n\n9. PvE: Enemies are found all across.\n\nGrinding is nonexistent in Mabinogi; it is never a requirement. In fact, the game penalizes your experience-gain for fighting in overworld fields for extended periods.\n\nRaids are in the form of field bosses which appear at certain times throughout a real-life week. Some will require upwards of 40 skilled Mabinogians to defeat, others may only require a few and have much less threat.\n\n10. PvP: Fighting other players is another very open-ended aspect of Mabinogi. One method is dueling a friend 1v1 anywhere. The other is arenas. PvP rewards are not a huge part of this MMO.\n\n11. STORY: The story is in installments called Generations. The interactive anime-based storyline is a sufficient length and is regularly updated. The mainstream story quests are completely optional, but they do delve your character deep into an enticing and dramatic plot.\n\nThere is just so much content in Mabinogi that I will never be able to sum it up in a review. Use wiki.mabinogiworld.com, the most complete community wiki you will find for the game - it will answer mostly ALL of your questions as you learn to play.\n\nIf you guys start to play, I'm on Tarlach server and my main character is Aznborne. Others are Leo172 and Leonnes. I'd love to play Mabinogi with anyone. I found this game 5 years ago, and I've always had an unforgettable time playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noobiesnack/recommended/212200/","noobiesnack","Semple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noobiesnack/","129 products in account","Mabinogi... is a thing. It has soo much content that you simply cannot do everything unless you dedicate all your time to playing. You can easily get lost in the game so much that you are planning and checking the Wiki constantly for how to do something.\n\nGraphics - While not the best graphics, the graphics themselves are fairly good. They fit in very well with the game's style. However, the Physical (collision, movement) portion of the graphics are complete crap. This is likely to do with the engine or bad net coding as a result of the poor engine. But the displacement lag among other things make this game something to yearn for.\n\nContent - You are not prepared. I do not know of any game that has the level of content that Mabinogi that is actually useful at all times. Unlike games like WoW, Mabinogi quests stay useful and do not go obsolete. The 'Generations' keep moving forward and new players start right from the begining. None of that "Oh hey, you can do quests... but you will really only get to experience the current xpac and everything else is a faceroll" kind of deal. There is also a very interesting and very long story to be told if you are interested in the RP aspect.\n\nCombat - Combat, as stated in the Graphics, is kind of meh. I think it could Vastly be improved if DevCat/Nexon took the time to upgrade the engine and fix the problems plauging the game. But, that will take time. I just hope it is in the pipeline soon. I actually think the combat style itself is very tactical and interesting, but suffers harshly because of the engine issues and terrible net coding.\n\nThe game can be a bit hard on new players and players seeking to do the generations may find themselves struggling. Vetrans think the generations are too easy while new players think they are too hard. The game does have scaling built in, where it gives harder monsters based upon your combat power, but it has not been properly updated in some time.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game if you like anime MMO's. Mabinogi has something not seen in other games so it is worth trying out (it is free after all). I think Mabinogi could have a very bright future if DevCat/Nexon start focusing on the ever-present problems with the game. But, you do learn to live with them and find quite a bit of joy playing the game. Whether you like to fight with magic, range, or close combat, you like to craft, make stuff, or trade, mabinogi has it.\n\n","August 24, 2014","true","404.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Despite, what my steam account says I have more than it suggests, due to me playing it before it was even released on steam.\n\nAt the time of this review, I would say I have around 3000+ hours logged into this game. I have been playing this game for a very long time. I cannot really say that there is any other mmorpg that can match the experience that this game has given me. I can remember when I was noob struggling to slay the low level mobs and how I thought that they were impossible to beat by any means. Now a days I look back and remember those moments and just smile. All the friends and people I have met have become good friends that I am now glad to say are STILL my friends to this day.\n\nI can remember every single experience I've had in this game. That's the great part about this game, that I can remember all of these experiences, even if they were from years ago in a video game. I am still having great experiences with this game to this day. I don't really know how to put it, but this game has a had a huge impact on my life, whether it be for the good or bad... lol.\n\nI will give you a quick rundown on the game, just a gist.\n\nMabinogi is an Anime fantasy life MMORPG game created by Devcat, and published by Nexon. The game is based off of Celtic mythology and takes place in the World of Erinn. You play as a Milletian A.K.A the character you created. There are currently three different types of races, Humans, Elves and Giants. So what do you do after you've created your character? You do whatever you want. That is what this game is about, you can do literally ALMOST anything you want in Mabinogi. Meet people, make friends! Have experiences. Be a Warrior? Be a Mage? Archer? How about a Ninja? Martial Artist? Yup, you can even control puppets too. Oh, and don't forget about those pesky life skills that are in other MMORPG games, don't worry though, if you have alot of patience then this game is for you. I warn you though, this game can quickly become addicting, if it's your style of game ofcourse. Okay, so that was a LITTLE more than a gist, but you get the point. (I hope)\n\nPros:\n\n+ Artstyle looks nice and clean (if you enjoy that type of art anyway)\n+ Wide class diversity\n+ Wide Race diversity\n+ Decent playerbase\n+ Not new to MMORPGS of the genre by any means, but lively communites, parties, and guilds to help you with anything needed.\n+ Limitless things to do\n+ A lot of unique skills to master, and occupy your time.\n+ You can see the actual progression of your character overtime.\n+ Unique events\n+ Interesting, and engaging storyline/questline.\n\n+ Rebirth/AP system\n\nThe most unique leveling system I have seen by far. How does it work? The Rebirth system works like this. Every week you get a free rebirth, in which you can reset your character(s) levels, and looks. You rebirth to level 1, do not fret though... all those levels you gained go towards your cumulative level and in turn help your stats and provide you with AP which is given after each level up. What this system implies, is that there truly is no "Max" level.\n\nCONS:\n- Like any other Nexon game... the Cash shop and NX.\n- Toxic elitist players, like any other game.\n- Poor customer support on the Nexon.net website sometimes.\n- Very grindy (Definitely a game you have to be patient with)\n- Some skills are insanely hard to train (Hardly a con, but if you arent a fan of grinding then...)\n- The in-game economy (It's overpriced)\n- Servers can suck AT TIMES (not too often though)\n- Some classes have not received sufficient buffs like others. (Looking at you, Archery)\n- Handouts to new players\n- It's pretty hard as a new player, it takes a while to get some traction in the game.\n\nFinal verdict. I give it a 8/10.\n\nThe game has its problems, as any would with Nexon and their cash shop. It's pretty grindy, but if you have the patience then it should NOT be a problem at all. The in-game economy needs to change for sure. But most of the skills are unique, and feels unique when playing as each. The Rebirth system is just by far an AMAZING idea, and there is limitless things to do in this game. The storyline/questline really engages each individual player, and if you have the time this game is DEFINITELY worth a shot.","July 20, 2015","true","115.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

If you like skills that range from, well Range, to Cooking, to Magic, to Alchemy, to Sword Fighting, to god-like powers, to... well to everythign short of farting and picking your nose, then you'll probably like this game. The graphics are very low req but I still recomend a decent computer, OS, and connection.\n\nIf you do join I suggest, STRONGLY, that you research the different servers for people who suit your play style, be it RP, Social, or being a butthead, seriously the servers populations vary so look into it.\n\nThe game is a bit over hacked imo, I don't really care how someone else plays their game unless it interferes with mine, and it has come to that a few times, the fault of which is the second side to this review.\n\nI do not make a habit of bashing companies, in fact I usually support them and use to try to support this one. Now I understand that Nexon KR and Nexon NA are two separate companies and that Nexon KR treats it's customers very well, but Nexon NA does take it's orders from Nexon KR. Nexon NA has repeatedly lied to it's players, ignored problems until they're just so out of control that we had to reset and lose weeks of work (they use to only backup once a month a policy I hope has changed). They allowed players to rob NX (that's Nexon cash) without recompence and seemingly without bans for those who did it.

I've been playing since December 10thish? of 2014 lol\nSo I would say I'm still newish to the game, Mabi is.. Unique, People complain about the glitches, I've always found some of the funniest moments when running into these, most of the time they arent even serious things, for example I once punched my friend through the dunbarton wall during a pvp match it was hilarious, the point being sometimes bugs arent a bad thing.\nThough ive been playing for about a year and a month or two I've discovered I'm a higher lvl than a bunch of people who've been playing 2-3 years, the lvling curve isn't broken it just requires effort it also helps if you dont wait until lvl 100 to rebirth :P\nI love the community, the people you can meet can end up being your best friends in the end, I personally try to help any new people I run across and returning players from whenever, It's always fun because helping people gives you something to do, lots of players do the same thing as me and help others which is great to see.\nNothings quite like the open class system mabi has, if I want to be a chef and punch some monsters in the mouth as a boxer with tangerine gloves, then I can do it because I want to ! You want to use guns but also stab people with a sword then go for it! (Personally I recommend going warrior first just for the defense/hp boost)\nPvP.. haha.. -facedesk- PvP can be very very broken, however, again The community! theres certain rules thats always agreed upon before a match begins prohibiting certain skills just for the sheer fact that they are broken, so pvp is fun as long as your fighting a honorable dualer~\nOne of the biggest issues is the lack of "support" for like if your account got hacked or your client doesnt work etc..\nOther that I dont personally have any issues with the game, honestly if you put a little effort into the game you'll understand how to avoid most bugs and most of the bugs you avoid arent even big things ust mostly stuff like walking glitches lol.\nI only play (Mari) server btw <3","January 29","true","089.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's become pay-to-win, but in this kind of game, "winning" doesn't really matter, so you have freedom in that aspect.\n\nPersonally though, I don't have much reason to play anymore as all my friends have moved on to other games.

My experience with the MMORPG genre is minimal due to a combination of disliking the pay to play model, the fact that I usually get bored of them fairly easy and the sheer amount of time those games seem to absorb. However, I do love games that allow for customization and are all about lighthearted fun. Mabinogi caught my attention because of this in addition to the fact that it was also free-to-play.\n\nSo I gave it a shot and I’m still enjoying a good game play experience so far. This game takes place in an anime cartoon setting with surprisingly well-written characters, colorful visuals, and a fun loving community of players that don’t really take anything too seriously. Every character you create starts of as a blank slate from a choice of three races to a variety of age groups. Ageing is a factor in Mabinogi as well as a rebirthing mechanic that if used right can lead to almost limitless leveling, but basically every action you whimsically perform molds your character’s skills, career, event list and in some case your physical traits over time and experimenting with this potential is half-the fun.\n\nGameplay wise, there is almost too much to do.  Explore dungeons, manage property, building a house, discover creatures to tame, finding hidden abilities, starting a guild, guild wars, special story lines and events, craft pretty much anything, manage an in game business, pvp…. etc. I haven’t even seen half of all the craziness that fictional world provides, but like I said I’m a player that appreciates choices and Mabinogi has a ridiculous amount of choices.\n\nMabinogi, as I understand it, is game that has also been around for a good deal of time. So it funs smoothly on most computers people would be using now, making it accessible almost anywhere. So if you are not exactly up to date, don’t want to pour more money into games at the moment, don’t mind the JRPG setting, and are just bored and want to play a game you can just goof off in, then Mabinogi might be worth a try. I certainly thought it was.","July 13, 2014","true","65.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(Took me 5 years before I quit, A lot of hours aren't logged on steam) Imagine an MMO where you don't have to kill anyone. If you so please you can spend your time composing music, Making food, Potions, Clothes, Ect ect ect.\nThe pace is set by the player, so the only limitation is you. This makes it good for people who tire of the constant "Questing Only" Thing that has taken so many mmorpg's. The lag is minimal (for those of you outside the US though, Good luck) The quests that are there have meaning and you actually have to pay some attention to what NPC's say to understand what the ◘%╦○ is going on.\nIts actually fairly lore intensive, And its still getting updates in actual content. Its combat system is pretty "Rock paper scissors" though, For example an enemy loads smash. You would load counter. Of course you could alternatively use windmill or hit them with magic, But sometimes that can be hard to do depending on proximity.\nSpeaking of skills, theres a ton, I mean. A TON. You can mix and match how you please, There are no class limitations. So yes, you can be a ninja healer that also can cook the best food ever.\nI got nothin' left, Just ask about certain details and I'll probably explain better there (In comments, if this ever -gets- comments)\n\nTL;DR: Old game, Still fun.

The gachapon system is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, it may seem tempting but the chances of getting something truly good is all based on RNG or simply how lucky you are.

The level up system is like any other train skill kill enemys no problem but there is a rebirth option this allows you to keep you total level this mean you get more ap when you rebirth because leveling up is easyer when you got that nice sword of yours you do keep your hp/mp/sm (health/mana/stamina) and your skills that you trained. the only downside is travel/getting gold now there are ways of getting gold kinda have to work your way up and get more as you go along now for travel if you do most of the starter quests you get a horse and a eagle but they are limited each day when you summon them they have a timer that goes down but can be stopped when you finish summoning them and the time refills every day and the time limit for the horse is around 90 mins and the eagle around 80 mins still plenty of time. There is plenty to see and do there is also life skills mostly such as things as cooking potion making and fishing just a name few of many. There is a problem with the skills if you want to learn all of them your gonna have to take some time and scroll but there are filters to help you pick if it is a life skill or magic or fighting but some skills don't have this filter at the moment but if you like hotkeying then you'll have plenty of time to. There are plenty of quests but some are a little tricky to understand but there is a wiki page for mabinogi (if you need to resort to this) you can sarch up your quest and there is likely plenty of pages from the community and strait from the wiki to help you along. For the players or fanbase most of them are realy nice but some do get into charater or just hard to talk to but this only come time to time for most of the people ive met most of them are nice players. So if you thinking of downloading this game I highly suggest not to do ace but if you think you need some help going into the direction of fighting/life skills then use aces but if you want to spread into many skills and see for your self how you like them i would choose milletian. Over all this game is great if i would to rate it id give it 9/10 for the missing 1 there are bugs that break the flow of the game but mostly doesnt happen such as npcs won't move from there position you can see the npc try to move in a direction but won't move by just teleporting back from where they were and you can walk using the wasd keys but sometimes get trapped when trying to move foward (moslty is dungeons) but other than that the game flows nicely and i highly recommend downloading and give a try p.s. you do need to create a nexon account register with one if you have one if you ever played vindictus or maplestroy and registed with your nexon account you should be good. ALSO if you notice my hours it's because i register with a wrong nexon account so i went in to steam files you can run it from there (mabinogi.exe) all the diffrence is you have to logon every time you get on not that big of a bother to me.","June 18, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yukarin/recommended/212200/","Yukarin","🎴 Imaizumi Kagerou 🎴","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yukarin/","113 products in account","Lv 7.8K Remilia :>\n\nJust in case you are wondering, yes. This is the STEAM account of Johan from Ruairi. I've played this game ever since 2008, during Closed Beta testing. In this review, let me summarized for you a short history of Mabinogi.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nLong before I've started my time in Mabinogi, I enjoyed MMORPGs mainly for the communities within. Many early MMOs tend to have helpful communities, which is why I joined in on this joy ride the moment I knew about it.\n\nMabinogi started off as a simple game of rock, paper and scissors. The three basic combat skill goes with Defense, which blocks normal attack, Smash, which breaks through Defense, and Counter, the skill that allows you to counterattack Smash. The skills are based upon loading time and latency, meaning that if you lag, it is more or so likely that this game will be more difficult for you.\n\nThe game evolved from simple melee, magic and archery to the wide spectrum of skills you have today; from sharpshooting to even puppetry, where you make use of puppets to fight for you. The community was welcoming in the past, and the game was fresh, being a half-sandbox, half-quest-and-instance based orientated RP. Events were plentiful, and every day would be an interesting experience for all.\n\n-----\n\nSkills, level and attributes:\n\nMabinogi is a game with endless possibilities. With hundreds of different skills, you have countless ways to combine and make use of the combat technique of your dreams. Feel like being a gunmage? Mabinogi has that. A spellknight? No problem-o! Perhaps you are a fan of Naruto and you would like to use ninjitsu along with puppetry? Mabinogi has it all.\n\nIt is generally one of the most complex, and yet simple, game I've ever played. Skills are trained based on how much you use them, and sometimes it can be quite a grind. However, ever since the Adventurer's Seal Shop update, players can purchase skill seals every Sunday to help with training on difficult skill ranks.\n\nAttributes are mainly gained via levelling up, or ranking of skills. Based off the game's endless possibilities of limitless levels, you can get your character up to insane tiers. For example, the maximum level limit for every "Life" is capped at 200, but you can rebirth to reset that back to zero, gaining valuable ability points and keeping all your skills and resources.\n\nLevelling in Mabinogi is generally easy for the first few steps in the game. The game labels anyone under the total level of 1,000 as a newbie, thus giving them perks and benefits for new players to try out new skill sets, reset their current skills, and even rebirth once every day (After your 1,000 levels, rebirthing will be capped at once every week unless you have rebirth potions). Leveling allows players to take on more challenging aspects of early game due to the amount of attributes and stats it gives. However, in the late game, levels barely give less than 5 to 10% of your kept statuses, and thus becomes less of an importance.\n\n-----\n\nCustomizability, clothing and fashion:\n\nIn Mabinogi, you are given a wide range of hairstyles, facial features, and even colors to go along. Being my favourite portion of the game itself, the freedom they give to you as to customize how your character looks, fights and lives is incredible.\n\nEver wondered how old your character is, or how your character might look years down the road? In Mabinogi, characters age once every week and grow in terms of size. From the age of 10, capping out at the height of 17, the game keep tracks of your current age and gives different levelling stats and attributes based on the character's current age.\n\nHow about eating? Do you enjoy a good roast beef, or perhaps having a beer or two? In Mabinogi, eating food will actually change your appearances. Yes, that means you can become amazingly fat, buff, slim or even slender based upon the food you eat. Each portion of the body is customizable, based upon the sort of food used. Top, which includes the chest (Or breasts, for female characters) and arms. Bottom, which includes the hips, the waist and the legs. Customize your character to the size you love!\n\nNot just the fact that you can change your height and size, however. Mabinogi also gives you loads of facial features, hairstyles and colors to create the character you love. This is just a little about the character themselves.\n\nWhat about clothing? In Mabinogi, there are hundreds of clothing available in game in a full spectrum of colors. From light skimpy skirts to full metal body armor, each clothing has a maximum of 3 dyeable slots, giving the player the customizability to make them unique in their own very way.\n\nIt's a fact that unless two players intentionally dress up the same, it is almost impossible to find two exactly similar characters within Mabinogi. Why not start your fashionogi adventures today?\n\n-----\n\nQuests, life skills and economy\n\nMabinogi works itself along side a full storyline of quests, from fighting monsters to celtic gods. Each quest revealing a little more about the world of Erinn. There are a whole bible of quests for you to go along with, each possibily traversing different worlds and dimensions.\n\nLife skills allows players to create pre-determined equipments of their own, from clothing to armor, gloves, boots, hats and even swords and staves, shields, guns and more. There is just countless of things you can find to do in Mabinogi. Feel free to roam and go wild, experience life as never before!\n\nMabinogi, being an open economy, late-stage game has seriously inflated prices. However, in comparison with most of the MMOs of it's age (Mabinogi is 7 years old now), the items are not really THAT expensive. End-game quest grinding gives around 2 million gold per hour, and most of the equipment price range goes from under a million to a twenty, at a most. Unless you are a perfectionist who will aim for the best possible weapons to squeeze for that last ten damage, Mabinogi wouldn't be too hard to get into.\n\n-----\n\nActions:\n\nMabinogi also has many ways of levelling up your character. Combat isn't the only way to get good. For example, mining gives EXP, cooking gives EXP, potion making gives EXP... Even merchanting gives you EXP. There are part time jobs given by NPCs for you to gain EXP from and train your skills, so level your character which ever way you want. Dungeon grinding is just the most basic of them all, but that doesn't means much in a world where everything gives you decent EXP.\n\nMabinogi also gives you many different ways to do things. For example, merchanting or bartering would require you to bring products from town to town to sell and make money. Farming requires you to tend to crops. Winemaking allows you to create dank brews and more! The possibilities are endless.\n\n-----\n\nOf course Mabinogi sounds all dandy and all, however, like all good things goes, there has to be a con that goes along with it. Mabinogi has quite a few cons, and it is important to know what you can do and what you can't do in the game.\n\nLatency is a huge issue in Mabinogi. If you lag, it is going to make your experience in the game itself worse. Skills might become unusable. For example, Blaze, which is a skill that makes use of magic being in melee range and has a loading time based on how long and how close you are to the enemy. Lagging in Mabinogi WILL cause "rubber banding", a term MMO players use when they jump back in time because of server desync. Several skill sets fail to function at optimum, like archery, gunner and ninjitsu. If you lag, I recommend playing something that gives you a wider range of leniency, like magic, for example.\n\nThere are more issues, like as with the community and more, however there is a word limit in STEAM, therefore I will cut this review short.\n\nThe game is good with friends. Know what you want to do, it is a sandbox. Most importantly, have fun!","October 10, 2013","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tympy/recommended/212200/","Tympy","Tympy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tympy/","99 products in account","Mabinogi is a game based off of the Celtic myths called Mabinogions. I don't know much about celtic mythology, but the game's icon is based off the celtic knot. The game is made by Koreans who are well-versed in the art of coding crack cocaine into video game form.  You look like an anime character from the PS2 era, doing mundane tasks to rank up how well you can sheer a sheep, or mix strawberry milk.\n\nOnto the gameplay,\nThis game has no excuse to run at 15 fps at some places, being from the 2000s. If you can get past the horrible engine this game forces you to play on, you're in for some not very exciting gameplay. The game is based off of a rock-paper-scissor type combat (at least for the basic combat skills, this starts to matter less once you get more specialized skills) which would work well if the game didn't lag to ♥♥♥♥ing oblivion.\n\nI forgot to mention the lag. Depending on the day you play, time of day, position of the sun and moon, and if your oven's clock is synced to your microwave's clock, the game can lag terribly to unplayable.\n\nAfter 6 days (everyday if you are under a total level of 1000), you can rebirth and reset to level 1, but keep the progress you have made on any skills you were ranking up. This is a core aspect of the game. Optionally, you can use rebirth potions that you can buy with real life money (NX) to rebirth anytime. Eventually, you'll be level 80 after one day and have a whole 5 days to wait, wondering what the hell to do now. The game tries to keep you playing everyday with events, and opportunities to give you more ability points (what you use to rank up skills, these run out very fast).\n\nThe community is absolutely awful, since it mainly attracts weeaboos, middle schoolers, weeaboo middle schoolers, edgy middle schoolers, edgy high schoolers, people from Gaia online, and actual adults who spend way too much money on a Japanese anime life simulator. All of the above will try to prove how much better than you they are by using the classic "my damage is higher than yours" reason. Although this doesn't really change the fact that you are both playing a Chinese timesink.\n\nOne thing I do like about this game is it's NPC art. Not the graphics themselves, but the little portraits that appear when you talk to NPCs. Also there's cute waifus which is VERY nice. The music is ok, some pieces are actually pretty good. But one of the things that attracted me to this game originally was the fact that there are musical instruments in the game, and you can compose songs using MML (Music Macro Language). Eventually, everyone just ends up playing Naruto openings, Bleach openings, Mario, Pirates of the Caribbean, Zelda, Skyrim, Carameldansen, Power Rangers, and other songs you've heard to death.\n\nThe skill ranking system goes from rank F - A, then from 9 - 1. Getting some skills to from rank F to rank 1 can take either a day, or a few months. You spend AP, or ability points, to rank up these skills. Some skills will take about 60 AP to get from rank 2 to rank 1, and that's not including all the other ranks before that. The main reason for rebirths is to get more AP for your skills, which to why you keep coming back to this Taiwanese basketweaving tutorial.\n\nThe quests are ok, I guess.\n\nThis game is ok, I guess. Play it if you have a few hundred-thousand hours to waste. It's easier with friends.\n\n\n","June 5","true","501.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I am one of those who played before Mabinogi entered steam, and just as what others mention, this game really is one of a kind. I'd be tragic if Mabinogi ever died.\nI don't remember the exact year when I started playing, but there only used to be three or four classes you could pick, being the typical around MMOs, Mage, Melee, and the Archer classes.\n\nThe community, I also found to be as good as family. Like most others, I also wish we could still be in contact, because of how such an amazing time we had merely just socializing. The best part is, that you can actually start a family by getting married and adopt others. "Living the fantasy life" just as they say.\nBeing unique is also a very major thing they worked well on. Having the exact same clothes, with the exact same colour, is even more rear to find than in real life. But I happen to be lucky enough to get the majority of my clothes that I buy at the time to be themed Yellow and White, giving my own signiture no matter how much time passes.\nThe major parts in customization would be the absurd amount of clothes they have available to sell. While some are very high price, nice clothes can still be bought at a decent or rather generous price for their beautiful, impressive, or complex design.\n\nWhile I can understand the complexity it takes to upgrade the graphics and having to almost completely rebuild the game to impove the travel and combat system, as well as the general animations for the envioment interaction. I find the lacking of these improvements really bothered me, even when I continued to play frequently, or when I return every couple of times. It really annoyed me when I get stuck in complex or tight spaces, like in small stores, or between trees, when chopping for some wood, and having to click a lot to get out. I like how the designs are improving, but because of the old age of the game with it's unimproved flaws, it really sets me back on how much more I can actually enjoy it. But I guess that makes it classic.\n\nStill to this day, the combat system is a bit lacking, but it's very unique, being able to approach combat with different tactics and styles. Especially over time when they began to implement much more unique ways for combat that are not found in many other MMOs.\nThe thing I love the most about the combat system, is that you don't have to stick to your class all the time and could use a mix of skills, hybridizing any skills you decide to build on your character, beaing able to master all classes and obtaining hybrid titles to prove your skills.\nThere are times when people mention how bad I am at building my skills, especially when contributing to melee even though I'm an elf. At first combat was really hard for me, being an elf was really being like a glass cannon, having impressive magical and archery power, but heavily lacks on the armour and defence department.\nUntil you manage to get stronger, then even an elf, with just light armour on, could withstand just as much as humans and giants can.\nBut as a hybrid, I looked for more ways to withstand damage, the exciting part, is that I can actually do that. My most happiest momment is when I obtained the Mana Shield skill. Able to withstand all sorts of attacks, but the weaker the skill, the heavier burden it is to your mana pool.\n\nLater on, with the release of a dedicated music skill set, with the already ability to write your own songs, they included skills you could use to support your team directly by improving their abilities in combat and non-combat situations, much more instruments and the ability to fight with them. Being a big musical fan at the time, I loved the update and used my instument for every close combat situation, expressing how much I love music.\n\nAt first I got into alchemey and tried to master the golem, but as it was high maintence and quite costly for long term adventuring, I dropped it for more simpler skills, but I still figured ways to reduce direct combat for my elf. Such as obtaining and training a pet. They helped me a lot in a varity of situations, such as holding my things, saving me from a group of monsters, or healing me and my party. But even when they are strong, they were not as efficent as fighting directly.\nThen after a while more classes arrived in Mabinogi. The most unique and game changing for me, was the marionettes. As an elf with a weak body and the massive difference in the marionette combat style, I absolutely loved this update more than anything else and I still look back in all my adventures with my pierrot marionette when ever I think of Mabinogi.\nThe biggest difference in this combat style was when you equip the control rods, you could still use them like regular weapons and includes three skills you could use to bind and pull your enemies with, but the main role is to control your marionette, which you had to summon with no cost, other than actually taking care of it, had a ridiculous amount of health and defence conpairable to some or most boss grade enemies, and the combat, had their own unique damage, which mean't any enemy with any resistances will not be able to mitigate a marionette's attacks. They are also one of the few classes which has skills that can directly break through the defence skill and able to combat multiple opponents with a very large attack range. Also the stats required for marionettes are majored for Strength and Dexterity, which gave versitility for both melee, archery, and life skill majors, letting any race to be reletivly equal in terms of mastering the marionette. Using the marionette skills require stamina, but quite little compaired to most other stamina required classes, allowing for much longer combat with little worry of overspending your stamina and having to carry extra potions.\n\nThere is little negitives I have for the marionette, other than being quite slow, which gives long range enemies opprotinities to attack it, but can be overcome by walking up to them yourself and using act 1 or attacking directly. Also it has incomplete skills, or "acts" having little combat varity but it does have a very high flexability for all sorts of enemies, dispite only having six marionette skills.\n\nAll in all, I would like Mabinogi to be improved even if they have to rebuild Mabinogi, but I really would like them to keep all their content, and unique apporach to the MMO world. All the've built, really attracted and kept many people loyal to the game for a longer life span than most other MMOs.\nBack then when I saw them advertise with "Live a fantasy life." I thought "What a joke!" but when I look back, it was a life totally worth living. But now that many people I know are gone, it feels really lonely. To me, making new friends got a lot harder than before. But there still are some really good people out there.","May 30","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Over these fine months, the game has grown from a somewhat-playable glitch-fest to a nicely polished MMO. A few of my friends even dubbed Mabinogi "Runescape done right".\n\nThe community involved in Mabinogi is one of the best you could ever get. Most players are friendly, and many are willing to help new players with anything and everything. It does, however, have an odd learning curve.\n\nWhen I started playing, the beginner quests were somewhat lacking, and hard to find. All players will be taken on a "Generation 1" quest line, in which they will be introduced to the enormous plot and equally enormous world. Thankfully, they've added a merciful transportation system in the form of moongates and mana tunnels, which used ot only work during the night and day, respectively.\n\nOnce the player gets through the first three mainsteam quests, they will generally feel quite strong, usually ending up to be around level 300-400 by that time. Levels are handled with a continuous rebirthing system. A play may choose to rebirth into a new life, setting their character's age between 10 and 17, and resetting their level to 1. Their previous skills, stats, titles, and accomplishments are retained, however, effectively increasing a player's ability to level up without losing anything.\n\nSkills in Mabinogi are vast, useful, and the main focal point of "Fantasy Life". Each skill set is separated into tags ranging from Life Skills to Warrior, and so on. This does not mean you are restricted by their use, either. Effectively, every player can play as any class at any time without the need to change. For instance, in a Warrior's primary slots, he could have a pair of sharp, deadly blades, and in his auxilary slots, a wand and book to increase his magic potential. The game calls this combination 'Spellblade' in the form of a "Talent Title". Generally speaking, so long as you train the skills and obtain good equipment, you are able to switch between any fighting style at almost any point of your career. If at any poiunt your are stuck in obtaining or training something, there is a user-run wiki readily available with very few advertisments from J-List.\n\nThe most common complaint about Mabinogi is that the publisher, Nexon, charges insane bills to those wishing to venture through the cash shop, but the player is never REQUIRED to use it, and why should they? They can get the same, if not, better things by playing the game. Events will generally drop free, usually valuable and strong items that cannot be bought from the shop, or obtained anywhere else. Players will always sell event items they don't want or need. Sometimes DevCat also gives everyone a free month of Premium, or double AP weekends. The advantages of premium don't take away from free users, either. Basically, premium players get cheap items once a week, they get about 10% more EXP, and a bit more inventory space. There's also a daily VIP mission that gives more gold and EXP. The only thing extremely worth paying for are pets, and if a player uses the pets they get from Generation Quests, they won't even need to buy those.\n\nIn short, Mabinogi is a great game, and surely worth checking out. Nexon has a very minimalist hand in what DevCat does, so that complaint should not be the first thing that comes to mind.","May 16, 2014","true","452.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rydaro/recommended/212200/","rydaro","Microsoft Word","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rydaro/","232 products in account","Although it is advertised as a free to play game, sometimes I feel like I can't afford to play this game if I did not have the incentive of playing for such a long time.  I would recommend this game as an exploration tour of how different and open-ended this MMORPG compared to others, with its unique leveling system. I however advise not to get too attached to it as a long-term game, due to getting and creating great equipment relies heavily on the cash shop rather then skill and labor (via fine reforges and prenchanted gachapon items.)\n\n+ Very Open-Ended Character Customization; you'll be sticking to one character and he'll eventually have every skill.\n+ Unique Leveling System;  Although it follows traditional leveling; your relative power is based on what skills you invested in. Combined with the ability to reset your level AND keep your skills that you have ranked over time, you will continue to grow and grow.\n+ Unique Combat System; This is a not a turn-based combat where your stats and gear can save you, but rather skill-based.\n+ Consistent Flow of Events; Rarely you will never see a day in Mabinogi without an in-game event going on, so you can find yourself occupied with something new every week. Great goodies for everybody.\n+ Aesthethics; You find more then 1000+ types of clothing to decorate how your character will look, and the ability to dye them to the color of what you want.\n\n- P2W Cash Shop; The introduction of fine reforges and gachapon (enchanted gear, titles that increase your stats, buff potions, etc) tend to drive competitive PvE'ers away. Maintaining good gear is extremely expensive, but these are fortunately tradable from other players.\n- Server-sided Issues; This game is very prone to rubberbanding and lagging at times during peak hours.","January 17, 2015","true","898.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nolifinggalios/recommended/212200/","nolifinggalios","Galios ;, watch a movie with me.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nolifinggalios/","292 products in account","A game that seems amicable at first glance and for the first few weeks of playing soon turned into your personal hell. Mabinogi has a way of looking and feeling amazingly pretty until you start noticing what you've been ignoring. Over the course of six years this game has grown and showed a lot of progress, but at the same time hasn't shown progress where people want it shown. Either abuse your wallet with cosmetic items, pets, and gambling gachapon to amass your pride, or spend year after year working up to a higher place to the point where you feel you're actually good at the game to not feel content because of the amount of time you spent on it with little to show.\nPros:\n- Rebirthing; The ability to reset level and change age after a week, rebirthing will allow you to change your age and level, allowing you accumulate a higher cumulative level, which gives means a lot more points for skills that would normally be limited by a level cap.\n- Talent System; There is no classes in Mabinogi, only talents. Every rebirth, from creation on you are forced to choose one of seventeen(fc) talents. Choosing a talent will provide bonus experience when training skills of that selected talent, and some offer unique tips and tidbits, like any of the adventure talents will show you locations of smugglers.\n- The fact that there's so many talents to choose from. There's a lot to do in the game, from being a grandmaster warrior to gaining the highest magic attack, from using alchemy to dual guns. The choice of having puppets to fight for you, or using a ninja star to level the playing field. There are a ton of weapon archetypes, and if you aren't into combat, there are life skill talents such as cooking, blacksmithing, tailoring and adventure. Each of these are a welcome new change when you get tired of the usual.\n- The community. Say what you will, the community is a positive and negative thing. While there are some people who  are snobby and elitists about fashion or combat, there will always be a few people you can befriend and have a great time with.\n- Beginner bonuses: This game is a whole lot more friendly to new players than it was when many veterans started playing. From free skill resets to multiple character slots, being under the cumulative level of 1,000 provides a lot of nifty bonuses that surely help out.\n- Events: Another positive and negative, there are a lot of events. Events, while either tedious or not viable for everyone give opportunity to get some decent items and experience, and most are repeatable within the time frame the event lasts. Most MMOs I've played have advent calenders or double experience events, but Mabinogi provides from role playing dungeon events to daily gathering/tasks to  get good rewards.\n-Strong Update: While a lot of the problems I wish were solved aren't, the developers aren't stupid. They notice things that many players have issue with, and aim to fix them. Before, inventory was limited to a main 6 x 10 slotted inventory, and eventually if you paid money per month you'd be available to use additional inventory slots. Since, that's become a free service. There are constant updates that help a lot.\n- Player-Based economy you will see here and in cons. The reason for this is because items are usually a bidding items in trading or selling from player to player, so it's not rare to find someone selling an item you think looks cool for an affordable price.\n- Free services. While the game has a literal ton of items and pets and advantages you can get from using in real life cash, with a bit of hard work and dedication, you can get a good amount of stuff that will benefit you as much.\nCons:\n- Player Based economy is my biggest issue with the game. While there are good things about it, there's also the fact that not every item is in abundance, and a lot of items wont be cheap. That isn't my issue though, my issue therein lies that players are given too much power in deciding how the economy shifts. Recently, a lot of people have taken to trading in game items for real cash, upwards from fifty to over two hundred dollars. For singular cosmetic items. This is insanely limiting, and not to mention against the terms of service, but little is being done about it.\n- The cash shop; It doesn't provide many things that completely shift the balance of the game, but there are some things. While you can't outright buy an end-game weapon, you may buy gachapon which offers anywhere from useless common items to rare and near end-game items with a higher grade. There are also pets, which once you have some, feel like a necessity to the game. It boosts overall speed of play as well. Why walk from one area to another when you can just get on your 3x movement speed flying horse and dash through the skies. Pets also sometimes provide a combat bonus of stats after a certain time of being summoned, or AoE attacks on summon or in their skill tab that you won't get otherwise. These save hides, and make the game a /lot/ easier. Most of these items and pets are unobtainable by others means, unless you buy them with gold from other players; and pets are not tradeable(usually).\n-The voidless gap and journey to end game. For people that are casually playing this, this does not apply to you. After a while, you'll take notice to the difficulties of the game, from Basic to Heroic/Lord/Elite. It's because it's a classless system that viability becomes a problem. Chances are, if you don't stick with your initial combat-oriented talent, you won't be as strong as half the players. While combinations are great in this game, until all used combinations are maxed out, you'll be doing far below normal damage. Stats are also a pain for this. You might reach the level needed for a new difficulty, but stats are a problem. If you choose to be an Archer, chances are your damage will be insanely lacking, and this is because more than half the gainable Dexterity(source of damage for archery) comes from life skills that either you aren't looking at, or do not want to waste time and effort ranking. The only clear answer for this is a recent game mechanic, Reforging which amplifies the ability of your skills and stats on equipment. The problem with this is that the NPC-sellable kit won't make a big difference for you, and the rest of the kits are in the cash shop, as well as not definite. So, even if you do buy from players or the cash shop, there's a chance you'll need anywhere between one and a hundred kits to get the effect you want.\n- Skills: Other than communication, you'll be spending your time ranking skills. Unlike most games, you don't just level up and spend your points on skills. Skills have requirements in order to be ranked that get tedious as the rank up. The requirements could go from use this skill five times to use this skill five thousand times to rank it. This is why talents are cool, it cuts requirements in half.\n- Gear and crafting is a pain, if you're used to the usual "oh cool, boss dropped a rare drop. wooo, enough mats to craft my ultra legacy weapon." Mabinogi doesn't do that. Most good items are bought with currencies from doing daily quests or through crafting which is rigarous compared to other games where mats are common. Most of the mats needed are scarce and require hard mode dungeons or difficult tasks such as raids.\n- Performance. The game was released in Korea in 2004. The system is ages old, and no matter how pretty they make it looks, it's easy to notice. From crashes to obscene lag there are a lot of wrongs that can grow to frustrating.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is a beautiful game, that when played casually can be the most fun you've had in ages, but if you have plans to play more than casually and reach end game, you'll likely just end up frustrating yourself or regretting the time and money you've spend on it when you've lost interest. If you don't mind, and have time, check it out.","August 5, 2015","true","151.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

You can do dungeons, cook, fish, craft (tailor, blacksmith, handicraft, carpentry, engineer), explore (rafting, hot air balloons), jousting, fashion contests, cooking competitions, dragon raids, and so much more.  It's not one of those games where you see everyone walkin' around with the same "gear".  Everyone can customize their character's features and dye their outfits as well as keep a dressing room FULL of different outfits.  I haven't found a FREE game that has this much variety and customization, so this game definitely is a "must try".\n\nI've played since beta and I'll tell you right now that the combat system may take some time to get used to, but once you do, this game can get quite addicting.  Optimization on this game however is really horrible and it'll consume a lot of CPU, so prepare to occassionally lag, disconnect, or crash completely.

I simply can't.\n\nI've spent a lot of time on this game. 2+ years on it. I don't even know how many hours. I lately came back to it after some odd months of not playing anymore, and was interested in some of the patches. And then I looked on the wiki about some of the new "character cards".\n\nIce Spear is a pain. Literally the worst. I've spent along time trying to get it. Ive spent every dollar to my name in game trying to get it, maintaining my character, working so long just to get this thing. And when I turn around, I realize that you can simply buy a character at 2000 total level with Ice spear level 3, AND Thunder level 3, AND Fireball level 3. All skills are a pain to get. A horrible pain. Like, I have spent WEEKS trying to get just one of these skills. Just one. Not even counting all the other skills that you get on this card for absolutely nothing, other than the base price of a simple 24 dollars.\n\nI realize Nexon doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Everyone in game knows it. We all know they don't care. But I guess it wasn't until I realized how little they cared that it really hit me: I am worth 24 dollars to these people. Less, even; the amount of time needed to get everything on this card is almost double what I've done in 2 years. My entire investment in this game, worth 2+ years and well over 200 dollars on luxuries and stupid other stuff, is worth 24 dollars at the most. 24 real dollars for me, myself. Me. This is my price to Nexon, in exact change. 23 dollars and 90 cents.\n\nI was speechless for a long time. And then the anger set in. That knife between my shoulders really smarts.\n\nI am going to continue to play this game, because I feel like I have to. I enjoy the game and I've already put so much into it that stopping would be a horrible waste. But for the love of everything good that you hold dear to you, please do not spend money on this game, and please do not start to put time into it. Nexon does not value you and never will. The worst I can do to them for this betrayal against me and all the other customers that have been sinking time and real dollars into them is to write this review and never spend another dime on these capitalist scumbags ever again.\n\nDon't play this game. If you haven't already, just don't. Won't take my word for it? Play for free for a while, and just ask around.

I can’t, in good conscience, recommend it.\nThere’s a reason it’s FREE, after all.\n\nPros:\nFree\nNo combat required to gain experience\nTons of different activities you can do, from making clothes, mining, to decorating your home-y space, or going dungeon-ing, etc\nThe soundtrack is awesome\n\nCons:\nLots of the good stuff is locked behind a paywall.  To be expected but that still  doesn’t make it a good thing.  *shrug*\n\nA Glitchy, unforgiving mess  (Want to finish your mission?  Too bad.  The door’s glitched.  Have fun doing it all over again.  Oh, hey invisible bandits that the devs still can’t be bothered to fix. Have fun with that.  Oh hey, the game just crashed and now you’re being penalized for it.  Enjoy the profit loss. Hey, don’t you just love it when the enemies can steal from you when they are that far away? Or attack you through walls?  Well, they can. Oh and don’t you just love it when people in your party can steal gold from you with their dolls? Let’s all be thieves. Cheers!)\n\nCommunity is crap  (Sure, it’s nowhere near as bad as WoW’s but it’s STILL crap. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.  Want to enter that dungeon that requires another player?  Only if you bribe them. ^^  Want to get some black dye?  Cough up a million.  Want ANYTHING?  Cough up millions.)  Only play this game if you have friends that do too.\n\nThe Cooking Mini Game from Hell  (Many a rage-quit to be had.  Fun stuff. Those that have ranked Cooking up to 5 already know what I mean. We got through hell guys.  *highfives* )\n\nVery very very grindy\n\nSeriously, If you are not patient, just save yourself time and sanity and avoid this game like the plague.  It’s an MMO so grinding is to be expected, but Mabinogi takes it to stupidly absurd levels.\nWant to max windmill for the title?  Have fun windmilling 4k+  enemies of various CP levels to death then. (and that’s if you have a combat title that gives you a 2x bonus and have gotten to the max level to BEGIN with ) Yeah, have fun with that. It sucked and it wasn’t even WORTH it.  For bragging rights?  Meh.  Guess so.\n\nYou will never feel incredibly strong even after months and MONTHS of work.  I speak from experience:  (read: It’s been YEARS)\n\nWelp. At least I get to walk around in a penguin costume?  :3\n","December 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","16","30","5","0"

Also, keep in mind that this game is on a custom built engine.\n\nThats really the only complaints I hav.e\n\nThe good? Everything else. Variety of Skills (COUNTLESS of skills, each one can be leveled), Countless of customization options for you and your weaponry, A Big but learnable world, .. there's much more that you can do here that you wont be able to do with your typical MMO. This is NOT like other MMO's.\n\nAnd last comment: THIS IS NOT PAY TO WIN. I can not STRESS that. Look at their bloody shop before you make that assumption. Heck, read their VIP service even. There's nothing about it that can boost your abilities. NOTHING. You cant buy gold. you cant buy strength.

Yes they did try implementing the WASD controls but clicking where to go works even better but nice to have both, BUT! thats besides the point the thing that makes Mabinogi so good is that shear fact its so open. Your only locked by what race you play as other than that you can make your character be what ever you want it. Want to be a giant that can punch stuff in the face and make stuff explode you can, want to be a human that sings and make snakes and huge puppets appear from the ground you can, want to be an elf that blows up everything around them and then pick off the survivors with arrows or other stuff you can! It goes even so deep you can even color your clothes and even any new pet that comes out now. Surprisingly as well as the years gone by the story and lore (for those that needs there lore fetish completed >.> you know who you are) has grown so well. Every game though has its kinks and the only i really have to say and may be obvious is the people hosting the game, Nexon hosts alot but cut alot of content out.... Aside from the poor customer service and lack of content we should have already and support by them, it does prove to show if a game is good enough it will be seen by the number of people who play now. For those who don't know what was cut out  and  has played for a long time try taking a look and seeing their elfs and humans on foreign servers or even giants for that matter. But yeah its like an open world with you to decide what you will be in it.

I wasn't around in the beginning, only since the 7th Anniversary or so...\n\nTruth is this game is fun, and kinda cutesy.\n\nPros:\n\n+Aging & Rebirth - Be any age from 10 - 25+\n+Cute Anime - Self-explainatory\n+Truly Class-less leveling system\n+In-game Costumes are plentiful\n+Now you get more characters (six i believe) and 2 free pets (without inventory slots, but mountable)\n+Everything in the game has a cost, and most things can be bought with play-money (gold)\n+Fun - atleast for those who precieve fun as doing their own thing\n+Now Races other than humans can get more than 1 free character.\n+Accelerated Time(Erinn Time) / Real Time(PDT) Hybird Time System.\n+The Game is constantly being actively maintained and updated\n+Game has something for everyone - Fashion,Dungeons,Fields,Poor Chat Moderaton xD\n\nCons:\n\n-Although not pay-to-win the game is much more enjoyable if you spend money on it.\n-The game can be boring and repeative, especially once you get all the skills you are looking for\n-NX or Pon (aka USD) are required for quite a few appearance options.\n-Objectives in game are alittle unclear at times, and sometimes you have to create your own to suffice the mean time.\n-The Game's got a character creation system that screams, "Don't Delete Characters" - b'cuz you have to buy "cards" which are 1-time use character slots, once you use a card it's "used up" and a character takes it's place - however this is a one-way transaction as deleting the character does *not* return the card.\n\nMisconceptions:\nMabinogi has many misconceptions surrounding itself. Yeah it's more enjoyable if you pay, no it's not pay-to-win.\nYeah the combat system has some elements that are tied into the cashshop but no they really aren't that big a deal.\nYeah everything seems out of reach, but that's part of the fun of collecting, no 2 players have the exact same set of clothes for example.\nAnother Misconception - Dyes require USD - NO! They require USD to buy the "Normal(Paletted) Dyes" (but you can also buy them from other players) but "Fixed Color/Flashy Dyes" can easily be obtained via in-game methods.\nEven More - The game's community sucks; True enough at one point, but the majority of the hell raisers are gone for good.\nAnd last but certainly not least - You can't use the same character to gain every skill - except for racials (of which there may be 6 between all 3 races) totally untrue, it'll just take forever to master them all.\n\nEdit: Although I still believe it far too long for them to act, my faith in Nexon's Technical Support hass been restored hence the removal of the con on that effect.","February 9, 2015","true","040.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If you're under a total of 1000 levels you're considered a beginner and despite its homely appearence the game is quite brutal. Not vindictus brutal or god of war but you feel pain after taking 60 damage. they're still using Polygons for their character models but that holds its old school charm when combined with its cell shaded graphics. The game has an easy to follow storyline and gets pretty immersive but I'm going to keep this as neutral as possible. First I'm going to look at the cons.\n\nIf you made it this far good. Here's the con list:\n-Most customizations cost actual money. before you gripe I'm talking cosmetics.\n-While free to play some things you have to buy if you want to look nifty. If you're cool with getting your own look through hard work then play free. I do reccomend saving up for at least one Karma koin at some point as a just in case you hit over level 1000.\n-Rebirth's do cost money but for the first 1000 levels its free.\n-Tough combat. This game doesn't have auto attack you have to click each time you want to hit your enemy. It follows a very rock-paper-sissors combat formula. While rewarding, mess up and you end up hurting.\n- Prices. In game armor and weapons are expensive and repairs can get pricey. While the numbers may not look all that impressive they do stack up.\n- Death and Ressurection. Is both a positive and negative. Its highly inconvienient to die in a dungeon but at the same time if the boss killed you its because of a reason. when you're out of nao stones is when dying is bad but normally its a drop in the pan.\n- camping field penalties. Killing field enemies is rough in that stay in one area too long and you'll get penalized. Getting less and less each kill.\n- Cel shaded graphics. This is for those of you who are very nitpicky. Its cel shaded so if you don't like those I put this here and in the positives.\n-Hard work. If you're like me and have a blacksmith, or a similar profession in game you know that its not easy being that. You need materials which sometimes means going after dangerous enemies. It can suck but the reward is in the product. See positives.\n- Solo play. This is very hard to do as there is power in numbers.\n- time consuming.\n\nPositives:\n+ Use any gear. You can use any gear avaliable to you as long as its in your inventory. Want to be a ninja gunslinger? Go ahead. You just need a shuriken, dual pistols, ninja skills and gunslinger skills. Want to be an explorer? Then grab some gear and go do some dungeons for that loot.\n+ Rewarding combat. When you're doing well in combat it feels very rewarding especially if it means maximising your loot by the boss of a dungeon.\n+ soundtrack. Great soundtrack that is very catchy and nostalgic. After 8 years of playing this I'm still going back to this classic.\n+ dungeoning with friends. While chaotic this is still very fun. At times a necessity as the later dungeons become longer and harder to complete.\n+ many ways to level. whether its leveling up from gathering eggs from chicken, defeating wolves or mining ore there are plenty of ways to earn money and level up.\n+ the options. As long as you know the skill you can use it. There are even some secret skills that used to be harder to learn like the Fire Arrow skill.\n+ getting to higher levels of combat. This in and of itself is rewarding to see enemies that previously murdered you deal only one damage.\n+ generally a very supportive community. I myself have on several occasions handed out armor and weapons I crafted by hand to people without gear. If you're not an archer and you see an archer, give them some arrows.\n\nNeutral:\n+/- Time consuming. Don't let it rule your life. Remember, its a virtual world, its not going anywhere.\n+/- traveling can take time but good things happen to those who wait.\n+/- rebirthing after a cetain point costs money for character cards.\n\nultimately I think if you like games similar to mabinogi then give it a shot. This game isn't for everyone but you'll never know until you try it. I reccomend it to those who like being creative and getting into a world. I'm someone who first went to Mabinogi as an escape and now go back to it as a fan.","December 17, 2015","true","377.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Originally the game was very small with only a small main quest line and a few dungeons the player could partake in. With that being said it had one unique skill that wasn't introduced to the gaming world till LOTRO and that was the ability to play music and not just any music but what ever you wanted. There's a big difference in the 2 games though, like WoW, LOTRO is a tab targeting combat game were you hit tab and start mashing 1, 2 and 3 when ever they light up. Mabinogi's combat system is more strategy based and not tab targeting at all. When you go into combat you decide which skills to use and if they are going to be effective on your current target. Mabinogi is a very unforgiving game in the sense if you decide to use skills that are not going to be effective or deploy them in a ineffective way then you die and yes there is a death penalty like in most KR/JP RPGs.\n\nMabinogi today has grown huge from the 1 small main story line to 18 very big story lines that completes the last. Outside of the main quests there are things todo ranging from shadow missions to skill based quests. There are so many different things todo in mabi that it will keep you busy for a long time just trying them all out.\n\nA few key features are your char isn't given to you, you have to earn what you got. If deciding to make a magi type char don't expect to get all your spells for free and be ready to put in the work to beable to cast those "♥♥♥♥" spells, same goes for higher level skills. It a sense of reward when you do get them and you will remember the blood and sweat you put in for it.\nMusic - in mabi allows the player to compose any song they want weather against copyright or not so have a good time and try that out(Iron Man on Lute is amazing)\nFantasy Life - If you decide combat isn't your style then there's always crafting and yes you could craft and gain skills from crafting alone with little or no combat.\nLots of Events - I'll be the first to rag on Nexon for being the masters of the F2P MMO model but they do well to keep the player entertained with many events that they host ranging from Zombies to taking a spooky walk thru a hunted mansion.\n\nOverall it is a F2P game with a cash shop so why not give it a try","November 27, 2013","true","302.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's simple but addictive as hell.  I'm hoping that it will become more popular because the channels seem more barren lately.  I've been playing this game off and on since 2009 and there's about 2000 hours unaccounted for by Steam.  I've spent plenty on this game, probably far more than I should have, but it is just too much fun.  Getting with the right group can make or break the experience for you.\n\nThe game has been streamlined and cuts out a lot of what was there in terms of quest based padding to get some of the earlier quest lines out of the way. I was able to get through the first story (G1) in about a day and G2 is shaping up the same way with G3 not far behind.  I'm hoping that with redoing G2 I'll get another crack at being a Paladin so I can make other skills easier to train.\n\nThere's always something to do.  There are no set classes so you can be whatever you want.  Any weapons, spell, combat skill, or life skill is available to you with only a handful of abilities segregated for race.  They've made it so that you can spam to Lv1000 and catch up quick and still be a beginnger so that you're not lagging behind the veteran players so far. Earning levels is also much easier for everyone.  Once you hit the Lv1000 and Lv2000 milestones, you can start new characters at those levels and not have to completely start over on another character.  This is a HUGE boon considering that it wasn't like this from the beginning.  There are many more free options to play so you don't even have to pay to get access to most of the options in the game unless it's something extra that you're really looking to get.  Even so, there's generally plenty of spill over from the paying players that the pay items are readily available to free players for in-game gold.\n\nThe battle system can leave a little to be desired if you're getting slammed by four or five enemies at once, but if you're in a party it evens out.  I personally really enjoy the life skills because it leads to more business options.  There's a lot of support now that wasn't there before for those who really want to focus on building life skills.  No more are we forced into battle to gain AP in order to build our life skills.  It's wonderful.  It's not for everyone, but it's a second home for me and I love it.

Originally the game was very small with only a small main quest line and a few dungeons the player could partake in. With that being said it had one unique skill that wasn't introduced to the gaming world till LOTRO and that was the ability to play music and not just any music but what ever you wanted. There's a big difference in the 2 games though, like WoW, LOTRO is a tab targeting combat game were you hit tab and start mashing 1, 2 and 3 when ever they light up. Mabinogi's combat system is more strategy based and not tab targeting at all. When you go into combat you decide which skills to use and if they are going to be effective on your current target. Mabinogi is a very unforgiving game in the sense if you decide to use skills that are not going to be effective or deploy them in a ineffective way then you die and yes there is a death penalty like in most KR/JP RPGs.\n\nMabinogi today has grown huge from the 1 small main story line to 18 very big story lines that completes the last. Outside of the main quests there are things todo ranging from shadow missions to skill based quests. There are so many different things todo in mabi that it will keep you busy for a long time just trying them all out.\n\nA few key features are your char isn't given to you, you have to earn what you got. If deciding to make a magi type char don't expect to get all your spells for free and be ready to put in the work to beable to cast those "♥♥♥♥" spells, same goes for higher level skills. It a sense of reward when you do get them and you will remember the blood and sweat you put in for it.\nMusic - in mabi allows the player to compose any song they want weather against copyright or not so have a good time and try that out(Iron Man on Lute is amazing)\nFantasy Life - If you decide combat isn't your style then there's always crafting and yes you could craft and gain skills from crafting alone with little or no combat.\nLots of Events - I'll be the first to rag on Nexon for being the masters of the F2P MMO model but they do well to keep the player entertained with many events that they host ranging from Zombies to taking a spooky walk thru a hunted mansion.\n\nOverall it is a F2P game with a cash shop so why not give it a try","November 27, 2013","true","302.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you think that's an awful idea, then the rest of this review will be meaningless, since that's the main draw of the game.\nTo start with, it's your basic Korean MMO, where you can grind forever and make marginal progress if you so desire. Can be fun, can be quite dull. But if we go back to that phrase I began with, there is a reason I absolutely love the game. A storyline's included, intertwining Brionac, Lugh, Morrighan, the Tuatha De Dannan, Tir Na Nog, the Fomori, Druids, it goes on. Known as "Generation" quests, it places the player front and center in this story, and carries it well with the art style. There's some later Generation quests that I'm still scratching my head about, but following the storyline will get you a good deal of enjoyment out of the game.\nGameplay's not similar to any other MMO I've played. It's a mix of real-time and turn-based combat, to the best of my descriptive ability. When a player or enemy lands an attack, normally they can follow up with some sort of combo. Once the combo ends, the recipient is knocked back a short distance. If both simply run at each other attempting to attack again, mor often than not the tables will quickly turn. The key is to anticipate what kind of attack the opponent's going to try, and react accordingly to open up another combo of your own.\nThe graphics at full settings may not be the best, but it'll certainly run on your toaster. Though do note that if you have a laptop or AMD graphics card your computer may soon double as a space heater. When minimized, the game runs itself perfectly fine in the background and ceases taxing your processor if you intend on doing so.\nAnime Celtic Mythology. I'm dead serious, if that idea interests you, that's what gets me to stick with the game. Oh, and it's free. It's freer than free, since Nexon isn't extorting you to play the game. Granted, there are pay-to-win options available, but all of the Generation quests, all the storyline, all the skills, all the land is available for free.

Not only that, but they keep coming up with updates with newer features every so often, and it is a fantasy mmorpg for sure.\n\nHowever, it is probably more worthwhile to play spending quite a few dollars in it, for example: Pets. Pets can not only be a good extention to inventory space, but help in combat. Downside to them, is their spawn time, where its like even older mmo rpg games ive played like Dungeon Siege, where summons have time limits, but Mabinogi's pet time is considerably worse, seeing as how they only have a set time for a full 24 hours and cant be taken out until the next 24 hours.\n\nI've spent quite alot of time playing this game, since generation 1 i believe, and have had my ups and downs, but i've definitely enjoyed my time playing mostly, and thats just when I find suitable dungeons for my level and want nice clothing or better gear.\n\nI feel this game is a hardcore kind of game, seeing as how it has alot of realistic aspects to it, where if armor being repaired can actually break, and lose durability, which then can also eventually make it un-wearable... but because of that, makes it a challenge, and something to look forward when you get more gold from those few dungeons you ran for hours earlier that day.\n\nBut if theres anything that really brings down the game, it would probably have to be Nexon. Nexon's support for I think any game, really, ends up being the worst I have probably ever been victim and witness to, seeing as how a ticket for support can be put up for 4 whole years and not once be looked at, while my account being hacked atleast a maximum of 8 times wont even be a care for Nexon it seems, sadly enough, but it could just be me and my friends that have had support issues.\n\nOther than that above paragraph, ive had quite a blast meeting people who really gave me the feels, good friends came from this game alone, and I have yet to quit playing it for good.","July 20, 2014","true","389.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

The dressing room supplies you with a catalogue of haristyles, mouths, eyes, and skintones that apper to be straight out of a "How to draw manga characters" manual :)\n\nReplayability( Meh... ): There are no randomly generated field quests, so there's nothing to sit around and wait for. So the only way to avoid sitting around is to actually get up and run a dungeon or read a Job Board. You will not find quest NPCs out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nPromotes group tactics?( NO . ): Almost every quest, and mission in this game is soloable and people would rather run them alone. This game hasn't been an MMO in terms of group-quests in years and does not promote the use of party groups whatsoever in any of its new questlines. There are no group quests outside of events and Campaigns(within reason, hence lacking just enough for me to claim this statement). Quest and Mission rewards do NOT scale based on participation, so having a partner with you has no boost in rewards gained. Because of this, people choose to run everything alone to avoid greifing.\n\nRaids?( Meh.. ): There are only 3 raids in this game: Black Dragon, White Dragon, and Girgash. Since Nexon is dumb(to say the least), they release a new Gachapon(web shop item) almost every month containing random rewards that far outclass anything you could craft yourself in-game. This renders the need to participate in Dragon Raids pointless and you will be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to Raid more than once a week(at the time of this review).\n\nCrafting?( Meh.. ): Yes there is crafting in this game. The wiki contains a catalogue of every creature in the game that you can possibly fight and they each tend to drop their own exclusive items. This makes crafting quite an adventure on its own, but sadly: The crafting manuals are never updated and almost ALL of the new/event outfits and weaponry aren't craftable. Period. And life skills such as the entire tailoring and blacksmithing category are deprecated and are only useful for the miniscule stats that they give your character. You will probably never need the crafting skills anymore, they're dead.\n\nMy opinion: Probably the only MMO in existence that is NOT reccomended for loners. Also, the AFK fashion crowd is NOT the minority in this game, it's the majority: so good luck finding active friends that will play when asked","December 17, 2014","false","828.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","7"

Theres a lot of skill types including the typical mage, warrior and archer sets but with the addition of life skills, fighter, dual gun, alchemy, ninja,  puppetry, music, etc. Overwhelming enough? Each of those skill sets has roughly 10-25 skills in its category that you need to rank up from rank F through rank A and then from rank A through rank 1. You rank these skills with AP that you get from leveling up. And that's where the concept of 'rebirthing' comes into play. Every two weeks you can rebirth your character back to level one. You are probably thinking "whats the point then if all of my leveling is gone to waste?" Well, its not. When you rebirth, you keep all of your stats and ranks. Only your base level changes. And current level doesn't matter as much as total level anyways. Your total level is just all of your rebirthed levels added together. (Situational reference to enhance understanding) Think of it as collecting cherries. You grab a handful of 20 cherries. But then you put them in your cherry picking basket. That doesn't mean they're gone, they're just in the basket and youre hands are now free to collect more cherries. (End sidenote) When I first started playing 3 years ago I wish someone would have told me what I'm saying now because the concept of rebirthing seemed idiotic and counter productive to me at first. Its really just a way to allow you to collect AP easier since unleveled characters are simple to level up.\n\nAnd theres tons of other things to do in mabi. The community is great, everyone I've met has been nice. You can grind dungeons, explore the reaches of Iria, go on hundreds of side quests or finish the main quests and get your trans. You can collect trans medals and transform into animals or other npcs or collect titles for buffs or craft weapons. Theres tons of weapons that can be upgraded and enchanted and reforged to be even stronger. There's even a huge fashion side to mabinogi if your someone who just likes to dress up your character in expensive clothing and stand around. Theres tons of pets too that give buffs and even fly. Mabinogi has something for everyone. Personally, I enjoy the market the most with the idea of personal shops and the housing board where you can set your own prices on your items to sell. And a lot of it is based on supply and demand which is fun to watch prices fluxuate and trying to sell your items when the sale price is at its highest. Nexon is constantly having events and gachas that keep the game interesting and fun. When you first start everything can be super overwhelming but don't be afraid to ask someone for help. Everyone who plays remembers how confusing it could be when they first started out and they will make an effort to help you.\n\nGreat game.","October 4, 2015","true","162.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

To this day, it provides an experience no other game can quite capture, though saying that also gives me personal grief. The updates the game has seen in the last few years have not played well to the game's strengths, and have soiled what I once considered a "historically inspired" MMO.\n\nUp through the first major expansions, the title held true to its Celtic and Irish mythos and assets-- which is bizzare because the art style doesn't inherently lend to that type of setting. True with any MMO, the developers sought to appeal to the playerbase en masse, and tossed aside their creative direction in favor of something more widely appealing (being anime, japanese culture, and straight up crossovers with anime titles).\n\nThe hay-day of this title persisted up through the 4th generation, just before the expansion involving Iria and additional playable races. The playerbase was not centered in any one area due to convenience, and the content available in-game gave every location significance.\n\nI would reccommend this title if you enjoy anime, slow-paced (strategic) combat, and want to take things day-by-day, or if you are looking for an unique MMO experience. That being said, the age of the game is very evident, and the developer has not updated old content. It's very obvious, playing through quests and observing different items in-game what assets are newer and which are older.\n\nPros\n- dynamic weather\n- wide variety of in-game activities\n- thoughtful combat (Mashing buttons WILL kill you.)\n- aging system/ no level cap/ not pay-to-win\n\nCons\n- infrequent updates/ developer is bad\n- clashing art directions\n- graphics have not aged well\n- combat is buggy\n- user support is almost nonexistant (I've had tickets sit for months without being reviewed.)\n","May 20","false","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

At first glance the game looks simple enough though it's not till you've entered the world of Erinn will you truely appreciate the games mechanics. Graphically the game is not anything to marvel at, using the excuse that the game is old and dated does little to soften the blow. I remember playing this in it's early days and even then the graphics weren't up to the top tier MMO's out at the time. That being said the game's graphics are unique enough to not get completely washed away with what is offered today though it is evident that it's graphics won't be a big selling point in whether someone would play this game or not. The sound direction in the game is nice and cheery for the most part. Whilst exploring you won't find many out of place sounds but at times you won't hear anything at all, though that's not a bad thing. By not hearing anything at times you gain a sense of loneliness which inturn brings you to make choices that ultimately benefit your experience. Grouping up with others is where the game truely shines. Being an amazing fighter means little if you have nothing to fight for, Playing beautiful music means little if there is noone to listen to it and the mabinogi experience offers little if one has noone to share it with.\n\nMabinogi was a game I played back in it's first year of release and till this day I have tremendous respect for it. The overall game design works in perfect harmony with the games mechanics and it is evident that the design choices were made with a set goal in mind which I think they accomplished.\n\nA small issue I have with Mabinogi isn't an issue with the game itself but with it's steam integration. Unlike some of the other nexon games currently found on the steam F2P section, Mabinogi seems to have the most troubles being integrated with steam. If you want to play the game then I would highly recommending downloading the game directly from it's website which can be found published under Nexon.\n\nMabinogi is one of my favorite MMORPG's of all time, it's unique and very memorable. Anyone who has never played it but has some kind of interest in it should definitely try it out as this game is really an experience to be had and a marvel of excellent game design.","December 31, 2013","true","9.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Most of the game revolves on making yourself LOOK cool, with special clothing, pointless weapons, micro-transactions from hell, etc. It dangles skills, weapons, armor, trinkets, and whatever neat stuff in front of your face saying "Hey, this stuff exists! And you can get it! But only if you spend 300 hours grinding the same action over and over again!"\n\nThis game is also very buggy, both for and against you. It can be VERY unforgiving in certain missions, making you start completely over if you fail. The in-game store for micro-transactions has some items that help you quite a bit in surviving, but your spending can quickly add up if you aren't careful.\n\nHowever, if you DO put enough effort into it, you can get a lot of really cool stuff. And I do mean A LOT. They do a good job rewarding you, even though it often feels like you will never make it. Also, the community is surprisingly helpful. There are rarely people that exist just to give you a hard time, and most people will help you if you ask for it. And playing this game with a friend can make for some really fun adventures.\n\nI recommend this game to people with a lot of time on their hands, and not an extremely critical way of looking at games. It can be very enjoyable, but it will eat away at your soul if you let it.","January 19, 2014","true","401.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is compounded by a proneness to serious lag, which loves to pop up in the middle of combat just to murder your face for trying. Many-to-most features of the game are quite opaque and tricky to understand, and there's a lot of grindy crap.\n\nBut, uh... Well, I enjoy it. It gets easier to enjoy as you get used to its flaws, I think.\n\nThe combat would actually be quite fun if only it were less laggy and buggy, as it does at least have a nice weight to it. And then, if you'd rather not fight so much, well, there's just so much to friggin' do in this game. Go into one of many schools of combat if you want, or choose a more peaceful lifestyle of commerce or production, bearing in mind that you'll almost certainly want to be able to hold up in a fight whatever you do. It's a big and engaging world that's fun to just hang around in. The playerbase is... hmm. Well, it's... you can find some good folks, but I'm just glad it's easy to blacklist people.\n\nIf you end up paying for anything, it will probably be pets, which can serve all kinds of useful functions to include simple combat backup and extra inventory space. You'll want inventory space.\n\nAnyway the point is, this is the sort of game where you can lose yourself for a long time if you're not careful.

Also this game is great for anime fans of sword art online cause it has huge similarites to the anime such as the irl aspects i said before but this game keeps getting bigger and better i rather enjoy this game and with a lot of events going on that means new content.\n\nCons: Bugs(duh), poorly optimized, needs to have a auto-detect for graphics, crashes at times and lag. Also you cannot use razer cortex on this game since hackshield thinks its a hacking software.\n\nOver all this is a game that i can keep coming back too.","July 24, 2014","true","123.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The leveling system makes it so you can always play any 'class' you want and have any and all skills or equipment you desire. You do have to rebirth once in a while to reset your level and get the ability points required to level skills efficiently, but fortunately it was made far easier when they somewhat recently added a conveniently free rebirth every time you hit age 21 in-game, which takes 3 real-life weeks after a rebirth to the maximum age.\n\nThere is also quite a bit to choose from in ways of character customization, and if you don't fancy the anime style there are a few more neutral choices, as well as different races to choose from. You can also edit your characters height, and gain or lose weight and muscles depending on what you eat. There are also tons of clothing and armors to choose from, as well as dyes- although some colors are somewhat difficult to achieve, but there are always fixed-color dyes available from rebirth, gachapons, and other players.\n\nThey're currently giving out a free Holiday pet, along with the two free mounts you get for joining the game. Unfortunately a lot of the older pets have been retired and may or may not be re-released, but there are still a decent amount currently available.

Mabinogi is a complex and mature game entrenched in Celtic mythology. I would describe it as a "sandpark" because there are many sandbox elements but also many themepark elements. The game somehow found a way to blur the lines of casual and hardcore. I could write a long drawn review, but I will leave it at this\n\nIf you are an anime fan, Play mabinogi\n\nIf you like to roleplay play mabinogi\n\nIf you like to craft, play mabinogi\n\nIf you like to socialize, play mabinogi\n\nIf all you care about is how cool your character looks, play mabinogi\n\nIf you like exploring the world, play mabinogi\n\nIf you played Everquest and ever raided (attempted to kill the "unkillable") the sleeper, play mabinogi (There is a white dragon in the game i'd love to see you beat. He is a beast)\n\nIf you ever played Lord of the Rings Online and used the music system (Mabinogi has a complex music making system with many different instruments. In fact "Mabinogion" is collection of Welsh tales based on old Celtic legends and mythology and the word that was used to name the game "Mabinogi". Also it is widely known that J.R.R. Tolkein used a lot of Celtic mythology to write LOTR.)\n\nIf you like to do dungeon runs for rare (and EXTREMELY valuable items in game) play mabinogi\n\nIf you like the idea of a classless system (you can be everything eventually.. but it would take years like EvE online) play mabinogi\n\nIf you want a character that ages, play mabinogi (1 week in real life ages your character one year in game. The physical changes are noticeable from age 10 to age 25.)\n\nYou are tired of typical linear MMO's and want a game that lets you express yourself........ PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF MABINOGI.\n\n\nThe only person I wouldn't reccomend this game to is PvP'ers. There is open world faction PvP but there is an option to turn it off, which leads to nothing but high powered ganking and no real incentive to pvp, although that may or may not change in the future. Other than that, you will not be disappointed.

Not only can you just pick and choose what skills you would like along your journey but you can pick out your own outfit from a large selection of clothes. In this game the battle system is real time and you can be knocked back or even knocked DOWN, same goes for the monsters you fight. You have to be constantly on your toes making combos, it's not that forgiving.\n\nWe have a large selection of classes that you don't even have to dedicate yourself to as you have the freedom to just expand to any and all at any given time. It's as easy as switching out your weapons from swords to wands. You can dual wield swords with humans or maces with giants. Giants can use 1 hand to wield 2 handed swords normally meant for humans and can also equip a shield with it. Giants can't dual wield 2 handed swords tho.\n\nGoing back to clothes, you can color your outfits to your liking and you very rarely find people wearing the same stuff as you. When you put on an outfit you're making a statement about yourself and creating your own identity and that is the fun part about clothes.","December 24, 2013","true","141.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Most of the game revolves on making yourself LOOK cool, with special clothing, pointless weapons, micro-transactions from hell, etc. It dangles skills, weapons, armor, trinkets, and whatever neat stuff in front of your face saying "Hey, this stuff exists! And you can get it! But only if you spend 300 hours grinding the same action over and over again!"\n\nThis game is also very buggy, both for and against you. It can be VERY unforgiving in certain missions, making you start completely over if you fail. The in-game store for micro-transactions has some items that help you quite a bit in surviving, but your spending can quickly add up if you aren't careful.\n\nHowever, if you DO put enough effort into it, you can get a lot of really cool stuff. And I do mean A LOT. They do a good job rewarding you, even though it often feels like you will never make it. Also, the community is surprisingly helpful. There are rarely people that exist just to give you a hard time, and most people will help you if you ask for it. And playing this game with a friend can make for some really fun adventures.\n\nI recommend this game to people with a lot of time on their hands, and not an extremely critical way of looking at games. It can be very enjoyable, but it will eat away at your soul if you let it.","January 19, 2014","true","401.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Combat is by far the BEST combat system I have seen in ANY mmo. It requires skill and timing as well as knowledge of how to counter situations. To learn skills you must use them and meet certain requirements to upgrade them.\n\nThe game has slightly shifted to a pay 2 win style with reforges in the cash shop, but it's not enough to really effect you if you simply don't buy them.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a good MMO.

I heard it bing a fantasy life game where you could virtually be anything you want, as long as it was reasonable. I thought this game was a big lie, until I tried it.  It was as amazing as they promised it would be, letting you become a musician with a huge amount of string and wind instruments and the ability to write any song!  You could become a chef creating dishes that tasted good with a few tools to help you that kept it easy to do and not so complicated. You could become a warrior, knight, bowman, mage, and fighter, each with its own verstile equipment and skills! The thing that made Mabinogi truly great was the fact that they let you do all this- at the same time. You could eaisly switch off from being a warrior to chef if you had enough AP (ability points). Also the fact that every time your character hit age 20 he/she could rebirth to level 1 again and age 10-17  for free! You wouldnt even lose the skills you learned before rebirth! For all of you wondering right now if this game is great, I say it's probably the best MMO you will play in a long time.\n\n\nNote: This game IS NOT  PTW ( Pay to Win) though it just requires some dedication to get a vast colection of money","February 25, 2014","true","188.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm sure many people have stated this, but the combat can be not so great at times, however this does not make the combat terrible. I've played many MMOs and have run into some with far worse combat.\n\nMabinogis' combat holds up. The fact that Mabinogi isn't completely combat driven helps that.\nAs far as skills go, theres a lot that will keep you busy. The class system is set in a way that you may have chosen mage, but you can easily learn another classes skills. If it wasn't for that Mabinogi might have been slightly more boring. I know various MMOs have used this same concept, Runescape for example. Back in the day that is what kept me playing that game, and I'm sure this game for just as long, if not longer.\n\nOkay now for the community. Like Any MMO there are helpful players, then there are those stuck up players who don't care about you unless you have something they want, or your what they would call "Strong". During my first few hours of playing I met this player who was a big help with questing. (Seeing as I for whatever reason couldn't make it through) Most of the community I've met through my experience are nice. (Thats just a personal preference of mine)\n\nOverall, I would say if your looking for an MMO that you can invest loads of time into, check out Mabinogi. As long as your into a not so combat driven MMO you should fall in love with it.","November 25, 2013","true","124.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Move the mouse, click the enemy, kick its ♥♥♥, and repeat until you die of old age or kill yourself.\nYou can go fishing to raise your dexterity, but it takes about 9,000 years before you can go up a rank in it. The game revolves around training your skills, then spending AP to raise them. The more you do it, the harder and harder (Read: More money you spend) it gets to actually raise it, and it will cost moar AP.\nWith a name like Fantasy Life going for it, you can bet that people do treat it like it is their only life. You can make an ugly female character and buy a maid outfit and learn how to cook and pretend you are an actual anime woman! You can buy an explorers outfit and grind exploration levels (Which reset every time you rebirth, meaning you have to keep doing boring quests over and over again)\nIt's full of incredible amounts of busy-work that you just don't want to do. If you're not leveling, you're probably grinding for materials that go for absurd amounts on the in-game market. NPCs don't give you squat if you sell anything to them, so don't bother. But the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will turn around and overprice certain items regardless. If not that, you're probably trying to gain proficiency on your weapon. You don't just go to a blacksmith and tell someone to upgrade your weapon, it doesn't work like that. You have to beat up enemies with it and get points on the weapon, THEN you can upgrade it. It costs tons of gold and tons of points just to get one upgrade too, and if you don't do it you will insta-fail.\nNot only that, you have to worry about the repairing of these said weapons. If you want to try and keep your weapons in tip top shape, you have to shell out so much cash you'll probably end up buying some gold from Chinese Gold Farmers to make ends meet. All blacksmiths except one have a repair rate of 96% or lower. The one with 98% charges unbelievable rates for just one point of repair, the kind of rates that would make even Bill Gates think twice.\nThe monotony doesn't end there. Not only does it take a few years of dedicated game play and credit card swiping to get anywhere in this game, you also have to worry about a broken e-Conomy that overprices ugly clothes that were released on old events because the ♥♥♥♥♥♥s think it's "retro". There are even dyes that have flashing properties, when applied to clothes they flash between colors and give epileptics one hell of a seizure and hurt the eyes of those healthy. People literally ♥♥♥♥♥ out for these in order to act cool among the other trash that plays this game. It's all about getting the prettiest clothes made for you\ntl;dr, this game is boring.","November 12, 2013","true","387.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I recommend FFXIV if you're looking for an anime-esque MMO with good customization and solid combat.\n\n\n~~~~\nOld Review:\n\nI joined the game originally as a closed beta tester, there was almost nothing to do, but the interesting combat/skill system caught my attention and I continued to play the game. Since then they've added a ton of free content- such as singing, piano playing, dual gunning, farming, commerce, shadow-missions, etc.\n\nThere's weeks worth, if not more, of storyline content to play and they're still adding more. The leveling system makes it so you can always play any 'class' you want and have any and all skills or equipment you desire. You do have to rebirth once in a while to reset your level and get the ability points required to level skills efficiently, but fortunately it was made far easier when they somewhat recently added a conveniently free rebirth every time you hit age 21 in-game, which takes 3 real-life weeks after a rebirth to the maximum age.\n\nThere is also quite a bit to choose from in ways of character customization, and if you don't fancy the anime style there are a few more neutral choices, as well as different races to choose from. You can also edit your characters height, and gain or lose weight and muscles depending on what you eat. There are also tons of clothing and armors to choose from, as well as dyes- although some colors are somewhat difficult to achieve, but there are always fixed-color dyes available from rebirth, gachapons, and other players.\n\nThey're currently giving out a free Holiday pet, along with the two free mounts you get for joining the game. Unfortunately a lot of the older pets have been retired and may or may not be re-released, but there are still a decent amount currently available. There's still a lot more to experience in the game, but you should try out the rest for yourself. If you ever need more information about the game you can always go to the mabinogiworld wiki, which although fan-made is pretty in-depth, active, and well-written. All things considered, I do recommend the game despite it's flaws and old age. It's definitely a unique experience and still pretty fun if you can get into it.","December 28, 2013","true","94.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Even eight years after the game's initial debut, not only has it withstood the test of time, but can directly compete with other "Innovative" game ideas. It literally transcends the normal spectrum of MMOs into something far greater.\n\nThe leveling system is comprised of your traditional numbered levels, but there is no actual cap for your characters, nor classes. Leveling gets you Ability Points, which you use to rank skills in a very Disgaea inspired fashion (Rank F to Rank 1) Every three weeks you can "Rebirth" which will set your level back to 1, while retaining all of the status bonuses and skill ranks you have been achieving through your past lifes. The result is you ARE ALWAYS getting stronger and there is no real endgame.  My own toon is now above total level 7000+ and growing.\n\nYour character from the start can do anything they want from all available playing types. Talents serve as a very loose archetype for your play style, encouraging specialized play without taking away from t heir unique experience. Gameplay demands legitimate skill from it's players; attacks stagger and stun you, knock you down, and prevent you from retaliating. If Rock paper Scissors were turned into an action game, this is roughly what it would look like. All skills have ways to be counterracted, negated, blocked, or even avoided. It is up to the player to learn the complex knockback system to succeed. Even the lowest level fighters can complete endgame content with the right strategies. (It may take hours, but it's possible to not get hit even by the strongest foes in the game if you are really good.)\n\nQuite possibly the best thing about the game however, is that it is not instanced, much like similar action title games like Dragon's Nest or Vindictus. You can explore this great vast world, fight field bosses, perform merchant commerce runs and more, all with your friends or strangers at the drop of a hat. There is a dungeon system catering to high level players and new players alike that is instanced. You can create parties or enter these dungeons yourself with passes you hunt from monsters or chests in the dungeons themselves for OTHER dungeons. There are also Hard Mode versions of each dungeon in the game which provide a greater challenge and better  loot, though a few are unreleased as of now. All in all, I recommend this to anyone who may be tired of cruddy MMOs as a whole. It will change your thoughts on what makes a good game, and good gaming world.","December 7, 2012","true","514.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most of the game revolves on making yourself LOOK cool, with special clothing, pointless weapons, micro-transactions from hell, etc. It dangles skills, weapons, armor, trinkets, and whatever neat stuff in front of your face saying "Hey, this stuff exists! And you can get it! But only if you spend 300 hours grinding the same action over and over again!"\n\nThis game is also very buggy, both for and against you. It can be VERY unforgiving in certain missions, making you start completely over if you fail. The in-game store for micro-transactions has some items that help you quite a bit in surviving, but your spending can quickly add up if you aren't careful.\n\nHowever, if you DO put enough effort into it, you can get a lot of really cool stuff. And I do mean A LOT. They do a good job rewarding you, even though it often feels like you will never make it. Also, the community is surprisingly helpful. There are rarely people that exist just to give you a hard time, and most people will help you if you ask for it. And playing this game with a friend can make for some really fun adventures.\n\nI recommend this game to people with a lot of time on their hands, and not an extremely critical way of looking at games. It can be very enjoyable, but it will eat away at your soul if you let it.","January 19, 2014","true","401.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is no small feat, because I have major attention deficit and MMOs generally do not hold my attention long.\n\nYou explore the land of Erinn as one of three races: Humans, Elves, or Giants (and yes, Giants really are more than twice the other races' sizes).\n\nWhat is unique about this game is the leveling, aging and rebirth system: your character can be from 10 to 17 years of age to start with, and every week, he or she will grow age a year.  This provides a small boost in stats, but more importantly, once you reach Age 20, you can Rebirth.  Rebirthing allows you to reset your level to level 1, and your age to 10-17.  Sounds pointless, right?  Well, though you lose the stats you got from leveling, each level-up earns you 1 AP (ability point), and you keep all AP and skill ranks when you rebirth.\n\nAP is used to rank up Skills, whether they be combat skills like Combat Mastery, Ranged Attack, or Defense (to name a few of many), life skills like blacksmithing and tailoring, magic skills like Icebolt and Healing, or any of the many other types of skills: the highly-defensive Alchemy skills, the wide-area, dual-attacking Puppetry skills, the buff-providing Bard skills, the massively powerful single-target Fighter skills, and my personal favorite, the lightning-quick, highly offensive, wide-area Gunslinger skills.  A higher-ranked skill will be more effective, and will also permanently boost your stats.\n\nThis means a veteran player who is currently at level 1 but has rebirthed many times before could easily be stronger than a newbie who managed to reach level 50 for the first time.  So, the best way to size up somebody is their skill ranks and stats, not their level.\n\nThere are also extremely powerful Transformation skills, and they come in two flavors:  Race-specific and Demigod.\nRace-specific transformations provide an impressive buff to all stats as well as resistance to certain forms of damage, and most allow you to use a unique skill.  Demigod provides regeneration, increased movement speed, and the ability to fire off some of the most powerful attacks in the game.  They're really cool looking, and once you get them, you have a couple highly effective trump cards up your sleeve to pull out for boss fights.  If you're really desperate and/or going for overkill, you can use both at once!\n\nAnother unique aspect of Mabinogi is the ability to play music.  You program a song onto an item called a Score Scroll (or copy paste it from the Internet...), and equip the scroll with an instrument, and voila, you can play MIDI-like tunes to your heart's content.  (Until the scroll breaks, that is, but you can always make another.)  Yes, hearing those tunes from your favorite games, like Mario and Zelda, echoing from the town square is really cool.\n\nThis game has a massive amount of content, so if you're just starting to play, you definitely won't get bored, especially if you play with friends.  Mabi is a highly social MMO, and is at its best if you are screwing around with your buddies.  Of course, there's plenty of room for serious play, because the enemies can get brutal in dungeons like Peaca.  Mabinogi used to be much harder than it is now, but its original difficulty still shows at times, especially in early dungeons and story quests at low levels.  But it's never unfair, and having a full party of friends is always enough to even the odds.  *fondly remembers newbie bum rushes of Rabbie*\nMabinogi does have its flaws, and Nexon, its developer/publisher, has dropped the ball many times before.  (Nexon is legendary for its screwups, though in recent times, they seem to be doing a lot better.)\nHowever, I highly recommend this game if you're looking to get into a new MMO.  And I'd be more than happy to show you the ropes if you add Kiera563 on Alexina.","December 2, 2013","true","007.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Mabinogi brings a lot to the table, from open world exploartion, a dyanmic combat system, and one of the widest array of life skills I've seen. To call this a game is an understatement, hence it truly is a "fantasy life". People of all ages of any play style can enjoy this game. It's array of skill sets cater to a wide range of interests, and the best part of it, there are no classes! You can literally mix and match any skill you want. One of the most unique features of Mabinogi, the rebirth feature, which allows a free rebirth every 3 weeks and an OPTIONAL paid rebirth every week allows one to reset their level whilst keeping ALL of their accumulated skills. With this you can truly pave the way you play. If you aren't a combat oriented person, then have no fear. With Mabinogi's life skills which range from cooking to blacksmithing theres plenty to do, and of course having more crafters in the game will be helpful, they are hardly looked down upon. Not a fighter or a crafter? Well do you like music? Mabinogi has one of the coolest music systems that I've seen so far, literally being able to COMPOSE your own musical scores to be played in game from a wide selction of instrutments. Mabinogi truely is an interesting experience, if you're looking for something new or fresh, than I point you in the direction of Mabinogi.","December 6, 2013","true","761.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Literally anything you want, you do.  Want to murder things with the most intimidating equipment?  Beat things with a stick?  Send meteors on your foe?  Go ahead!  There is an open world to explore, a variety of skills to master, and exceptionally well-done storylines across multiple generations.\nAn active player community, an active economy, and much more.  There's also music.  From Lute, to Flute, to Pianos and electric guitars, make your music and play it with impunity.  Getting bored with the game?  Here, have an event to spice things up.  Finished all the storylines?  Here, we've been working on this new one for a while.  Mastered all the talents?  Let's toss another one in here.  Mastered that too?  Let's combine them into a new one we call an Ace.  Not to mention are the three races, Human, Giant, and Elf, which specialize in whatever they do, but nothing really limits you in becoming Grandmaster anything, except maybe archery for Giants.\nIt's an experience to play, but the learning curve is oddly shaped.  Familiar to some, hard for others, but still odd in its own way.  It soon becomes second nature over time, though.  Other than that, I give this game the highest of scores, and encourage those interested to play, and hopefully stay long enough to enjoy the fun.","January 21, 2014","true","629.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Mabinogi is a fantasy anime MMORPG with a rich character development system, unique combat system, and a rich story that separates it from other generic MMORPGs. As you dive into the world of Erinn, you can do a variety of things. From fighting monsters, performing quests, and leveling up to fishing, jousting, dressing up, and even playing and composing music. Each time a player gains enough experience from doing these kinds of activities, they will receive an AP (attribute point) that lets them distribute it to any skill and rank it to make them stronger or more efficient. There is a rebirth system where a player can reset their character's level in order to easily acquire more AP. This means that there is an infinite amount of levels so you can create a character that will suit your own play-style. Since the amount of content Mabinogi has to offer, the possibilities are endless. This is a game I can see myself playing for many years.","December 4, 2013","true","44.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The1Flame/recommended/212200/","The1Flame","Velox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The1Flame/","155 products in account","The easiest way to describe this game would be 2007 runescape, except with an actual (REALLY REALLY FUN) combat system.\n\nMabinogi doesn't suffer from pay2win as much as most MMOs do. There is a "reforge" system, which is the same as maplestory's cube system (use this cash shop only item to give your item random bonuses). But the tools needed for this are tradable, and somewhat cheap in the player market (plus the bonuses are rather low). There's several way to get mounts and AoE stun pets without paying a dime. The only clear cut advantage you can get with real money is rebirthing every week for $10 a week, rather than every 3 (which is probably going to change soon anyway, juding by the updates that the other versions have received).\n\nThis game's rebirth system means you can play it casually and not fall too far behind those who play it religiously. Someone who plays about 4 hours every 3 weeks will still progress about 25% as fast as the person who grinds to level 200 combat + 30 exploration every rebirth.\n\nMy one warning to anyone who's trying this game for the first time, or returning, is that the UI is poorly deisgned. It's a mess of buttons, most of which you won't use, as you'll have hotkeys for them memorised. It doesnt' scale well to low resolutions, and will look like an eyesore until you move everything around to where you want it to be. The combat tutorials are also annoyingly long. Once you get past the tutorial and get used to the UI (and outdated graphics), you'll realize how amazing this game can be. I'd personally say this is the best MMO I've ever played.\n\nThis game also has a very large modding community. Most of which are simple model swaps and sound changes, but there's also ENBs and some clientside script editing.","February 13, 2014","true","528.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They could work on the customization skills so that way its more free rather than having to have some sort of pon accumulations that you, I believe, can only get use real life money- BUT ITS GREAT. This is definately for everyone who enjoys anime or maybe even not, to try out. There are wasd controls, which though Ive never seen them before, so its new to me, which add lots of freedom for playing the game rather than dull point and click (though that is included in case you're more comfortable with that rather than wasd).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paxseko/recommended/212200/","Paxseko","Paxseko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paxseko/","327 products in account","Mabinogi has been and will be my main and favourite MMO for a long time to come.\nIt is essentially a life simulator that happens to have a combat system.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to customize your character and feel your character truely represents you: there are a variety of skills to advance, activities that will help you advance them, and many varied and beautiful places to see. There are also many wonderful people to meet, in the forms of other players, as well as NPCs.   There are major questlines that unlock new skills and advance the narrative, which plays with Celtic mythology in the ways that Norse mythology has been played with in the RPG arena for years. The game also has an interesting, quirky personality and sense of humour, which is especially expressed through the unique graphics. The environments and characters  are expressed through a mixture of fascinating anime-like drawing and rendered objects. The game itself is wonderful and engaging and asks for you to spend many years there.\n\nThat being said, the game has some issues. Let's start with the narrative. I want so badly to love the narrative, but it's fragmented at best, especially since the developer took it upon themselves to shorten and eliminate missions to help newer players out. That left some major unfilled holes in a few plots. Furthermore, the game was developed in Korean, and as you may expect, the intertitles are sometimes poorly translated. Furthermore, a few questlines-- the ones that present Shakespeare plays, alack and alas, speed through the dialogue faster than the player can read. The older questlines, as you may imagine, are more frustrating and potentially more repetitive than some of the newer questlines. Many players skip the narrative and dialogue altogether, and while I would like to say they are missing something amazing and groundbreaking, I simply can't. What's more frustrating is that all of the building blocks of genuis are there, but the execution is poor.\n\nAnother place where the building blocks are there, but scattered, is in the actual ranking of skills to become more powerful. In general, there is no need to 'grind' or 'spam' certain quests, missions, or anything like that, though some players may choose to do so. In general, a typical Mabi sit-down consists of doing a variety of different activities that rank a variety of skills very slightly. But some skills require much more persistence, and in order to make any progress at all, you may end up doing the same thing for hours. Some of the 'life' skills, like cooking, weaving, or blacksmithing, encourage this behavoir. Some combat skills may have a particularlly quirky rank that may require the player to travel and kill a certain type of enemy, which may lead to 'grind' play. Some people play this game in a very 'grindy' way, but there is no need to do that at all. The game has been out for 8 years, and expects that kind of long-term dedication. Ranks weren't meant to be knocked out in a few days. Many gamers may find this long term dedication difficult to swallow, and may want to move on to another experience more quickly than this game allows.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that takes dedication and experiece is the social aspect of the game, which many find overwhelming. What started off as my Mabinogi guild now consists of a gaming guild that is as close, or closer than, the average family, though we hail from all over the United States (and now also a few other places, too). Much of my 'gaming' time has now been spent socializing and organizing this gaming family. Do I miss major sit-downs with powerful narrative games? Yes, though rarely I find the time.\n\nAll-in-all, few games have changed the course of my life as much as Mabinogi. And that perfectly expresses its power as game, life simulator, and social platform.","December 24, 2013","true","440.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/herostar/recommended/212200/","herostar","Herostar~Corrupt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/herostar/","103 products in account","Hey, herostar here. Yes, herostar of alexina, the blue haired gun toting bard of spiral hill.\n\nIf you know me, then you already know this game is more worth your time, and perhaps a bit of your money, than I can ever recommend. I've played this game for almost 5 years now, my 3rd year milletian title proving this strong. I've collected pets, learned all the skills, met so many wonderful people, and even speak to the community manager through steam (I've got more hours on this game than Sabina, the dedication is Real.)\n\nRegardless, I'm gonna give you my review of this game. Hold tight, we got a Lot of points to cover.\n\nLet's start with the first impression. Mabinogi is not a hold-your-hand type of game, and you'll get little to no explanation on how things work. This led me to blunder around for nearly a year before I figured out how things worked, and yet, looking back, I still don't think it was a bad experience. The game holds true on it's free to play title, as you can go from 0 to 100% absolutely free. Pets and other things can even be earned in events, and just about every bit of clothing is sold on the market.\n\nCombat. Well, it's certainly entertaining. From the unique rock-paper-scizzors approach to some moves, and just how well you can time moves against foes, it's possible to do an entire dungeon or mission without being hit once. The game's combat flows smoothly, giving you time to react to the challenge ahead, and prepare accordingly.\n\nClasses: Let me get this out of the way real fast, you are not limited to one class in Any way, shape, or form. You can go from warrior, to mage, to archer, to bard, all in the same week. You can learn every single skill in the game (provided some exceptions with race and the like) all on one character. Infact, I have learned everything an elf can learn ingame!\n\nSkills: Now this is a topic I love. First off, every skill is unique. Unique in animation, unique in execution, unique in effect, in damage, what effects it, every skill has it's own specialty to it. Each skill goes from Rank Novice, to Rank 1, minus some that have a rank limit due to there being no more content for that skill. (Yet*) And as an added bonus, the skills also can give, and often do, a variety of stats to increase the power of your character in many different categories.\n\nStats: Oh boy, these things... There are a total of 5 stats, being Strength, Intelligence, Will, Dexterity, and Luck. Each stat effects your skills and other aspects about your characters. Some stats even effect the chances in skills, such as Dexterity effecting Cooking. You can have Rank 1 skills, but if your stats are laking, there's nothing that'll save you from being underpowered. There's also of course, health, mana, defence, protection, magic defence, magic protection, and so many more, but these are all effected by the base 5, as well as certain skills.\n\nCommunity: Sadly lacking. While there is a few good souls left, mabinogi's community has really fallen apart over the years... it makes me sad as a bard to see noone follows Bardic code of Conduct anymore, as simple as those rules are. A tip from a true erinn hero: If you have to mute your game for any reason whatsoever, there's a problem. And with important figures like Tanino being chased off from the game entirely, I truely fear for the worst...\n\nCompany: Nexon's not perfect, not by the longest shot possible, but it's not the worst. Nexon is doing what they can to keep the game bug free and happy, and you gotta give them credit for where credit is due. That's all I'll say about that, since the less said about their customer service ticket waits, the better.\n\n*And finally the best perk: It's constantly being updated and added to. It's always changing, for better or for worse, and so far, I'm enjoying the content they've added. Talents like Ninja, gunslinger, fighter, puppetteer, even the massive list of bard's buffs weren't in the game when I started. But god, do I love that they came <3\n\n\nOverall, mabinogi's a game I grew up with, it's a game that I love and respect like a brother, and even if it might see a downfall, it's still going down as a golden gem in my history books. Overall rating 9/10, I'd recommend this game to everyone who owns a computer.","January 31","true","674.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/McKernel/recommended/212200/","McKernel","The Colonel McKernel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/McKernel/","103 products in account","This is a game where you feel immersed in its world. I have played countless of hours in the amazingly detailed world of Mabinogi. I have 300+ hours on Steam from when I wrote this review but I've played this game before it was even on steam, back in 2009. The world is vast and beautifully made. I have still not visited every destination and I have plans to in the future to do so. The community in this game is outstanding. Never played with such an amazing community. There are many items that you can purchase from other players with an in game economy. Or you can buy some with real money using a gachapon system (Kind of like the Team Fortress 2 crates without the keys). But you honestly don't have to buy any of those cosmetic items to enjoy the game. There are hardly any level up restrictions with no level cap. But levels don't really matter. Its all about the skills. Every time you level you gain a skill point that you can put into the many skills you will get to improve them. Rebirthing to make your level back at 1 is possible every 3 weeks if your character's age is 17. Thats my only problem. That it takes 3 weeks for you to rebirth unless you pay for a weekly rebirth. It is not needed because you will be spending those 3 weeks leveling you character like crazy if you're a beginner. Playing music with in-game instruments is an option using a music language known as MML (Music Macro Language). I would sometimes walk by an amazing composer with an amazing song or even bands that just play music for people's enjoyment. Mabinogi has a very strategic combat system with many different classes to play as. Nexon is constantly updating the game with in game events and even different storylines and generations(quest lines). You will not beat this game in a matter of weeks or maybe even months. I still haven't because of the quantity and quality of this product.\n\nIf you enjoy role playing games and MMO's you will enjoy this game. The community in this game is amazing and will make you keep coming back. This is a different kind of MMO. Its unique in its own way.\nServer: Alexina\nIn Game Name: Cloudstride","August 8, 2014","true","376.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure the graphics are a little outdated and there are a few minor glitches but nothing worth complaining about.\n\nIf your new to mabi then just give things time.

I haven't played a single game so far that is remotely similar to this game, and I love that about it.\n\nNow I know what you're saying: "This sounds too good to be true" and well... it is unfortunately.\n\nI'll list the pro's and con's for this game:\n\nPros:\n\n-Unique combat system, it's not a typical "click and wait for your character to kill it" kind of game, there's a stun meter, and it resets depending on how much you hit the opponent, Making mashing away, unless you are higher leveled, useless.\n-No class system, I swear when I join an mmo, I have a super hard time thinking what class do I want to be, and what if I don't like it later? Well, Mabinogi has a "skill" system that gives you stats, instead of having to be limited to certian skills because a class, everyone has skills equally, with the exception of a very few amount of skills (Those skills are locked into race).\n-Mainstream storyline quests, I will say it, I hate most mmo plots, the characters lack personality, there isn't a feeling of depth within the bosses, and most of the time, you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about, nor do you really CARE. This plot had me paying attention, I won't say it's an amazing plot, but if a plot in an MMO actually manages to have me wondering what will happen next, then I say it's at least decent. The bosses (due to the combat system) really have you feeling like you're facing off against a MENACE. Plus, you know a plot is at least decent when you have players sometimes actually TALK about the plot in the game.\n-Armor and clothes. Oh God how I hated games that were like "Wait you want this cool looking armor or that adorable dress you always wanted? LEVEL UP AND GET THERE! Oh what's that? The next armor looks like -bleep-? Well if you wanna be good at the game, you gotta WEAR THAT ONE INSTEAD!" You can wear ANYTHING at ANY LEVEL. Although the exception is Elves with wearing heavy armor, other than that though, you can wear anything with any level character. Are you a level 1 that so happened to get a rare item that EVERYONE wants? Wear it and be proud!\n-Pets These things actually HELP YOU in combat.\n-You don't HAVE to do combat. You don't... and I love that... I mean I still play the combat system, but if that's not your thing and you just want to socialize? Then go ahead! Want to make music for everyone to hear? Compose away! Want to be a farmer? Ee-ai-ee-ai-oh it up!\n\nCons:\n\n-Once you have leveled to a certian point, there's nothing to rank anymore, and once that happens, unless you log in just to talk to friends, the game gets boring.... fast... rally fast...\n-Most amazing armors and clothes in general come from gachapons... which you have to PAYYYYYY for, not only that, you only have a SMALL CHANCE to get the clothes you want...\n-If you reaaaaally want to be damaging in combat, guess what you gotta do? you gotta PAYYYYYYYYYYYYY for it, just to HOPEFULLY get that equip enhance you wanted.\n-Appearence changing, if you've got money to spend, this shouldn't be an issue, heck you can change your character's gender if you wanted to (which is free to do). But... you need money to actually CHANGE your appearence. I mean it's good that you are able to change that hairstyle that you hated at first, but most good hairs you have to pay for...\n-Pets are good, and valuable in storage and combat, but... you need to PAYYYYYY for it...\n\nOverall review: Great game- amazing even in my opinion, but it IS owned by Nexon, meaning you gotta have money, and lots of it. If you want to play this game casually and just have fun with it, it shouldn't be a problem that much. If you want to get really damaging or be a fashionista? Gotta have that stash of the cash to be ready to flash.","October 29, 2015","true","630.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I've even got my own ♥♥♥♥ing Maid and little sister followers (Yes, I need a virtual little sister cause my real one is lame af </3)\nJk jk\n\nAnyway, the list goes on. Though not going to lie, most current players are pretty high level, and prices on the market are high, and a lot of old rare items aren't around because of low amount of players now...  But regardless, if you've got a friend to run through this game with - despite its age, theres still a lot of really great content in this game, and its really the only game where a Kirito outfit from SAO actually looks good on an avatar.","January 28","true","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The difference with Mabinogi compared to most MMORPGS is that your character is you life. You dont have to follow the questline instead of fighting, why not cook or commerce? You want to fight using a sword while having a flamethrower strapped to your wrist? Go ahead. Mabinogi is a game where YOU'RE in control. Theres no level cap so you can keep playing and getting stronger and stronger. You even get benifits once your character reaches a cetain level. The story line is catching [Although text heavy] will leave you wanting more and more. The community is one of the best you'll ever meet, don't know what to do or where to go? Simply ask anyone and they'll help. Just play this game its hard to get into but once you understand it you'll have tons of fun with friends.","June 25, 2014","true","712.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Theres not enough time to do everything but i actually like that. That feature could push or pull its community which is fine. If there was a perfect game i wouldnt be writing this. Also, most people i have noticed that quit the game are barely half way done. I still play (in fact for atleast the past 2-3 years my account has been made) and I still look like a noob.... sorta. Bottom line is, its a great game to just enjoy yourself and if your a SAO fan they just had or is having an event on that. The combat system is decent, all i can say is play this game if you want the closesest experience to SAO. If you've read this far, Congratulations your a patient person, a.k.a the possible player for Mabinogi.","January 15, 2015","true","345.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's repetitive, boring, ugly, has a terrible community, and makes you feel like you're in purgatory. It's managed by Nexon, one of if not the absolute worst MMO conglomerates in the business. It's a time sink that leaves you sitting in town squares rather than fighting because fighting for more than an hour or two is an Olympic test of patience and fortitude. I have many hours on Steam, but I barely play it anymore. Before the Steam release, I sank 20,000-30,000 hours and upward of $300 in rebirths into a character, which got deleted by a hacker while I was taking a long break from the game. Did Nexon compensate me? No. Did they have so much as the decency to respond to my ticket? No. Seriously, why are you even looking at this game? Go play something good. Unfortunately I'm cursed by a history with this game, so I've yet to be able to fully shake it. People keep drawing me back in. Now I get why people keep playing ♥♥♥♥ like Runescape. Just get away while you can. I could've done so much more in life with the time I wasted on this unfulfilling, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.","September 7, 2015","false","354.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Usually you find games that play themselves by you just clicking a quest (*cough* aura kingdom *cough*) or Anime MMOs that have you picking one class and the skill/armors/weapons are extremely linear (*cough* Luna Online *cough*), However, this one throws all of those out the window. No equipment is "unequippable" save for a few that require tons of training. None are just "better" than the others. The combat system is incredibly well-paced, and even if you chose to be one talent (class), it doesn't stop you from training/having skills from another talent, and that's really what takes the cake for me. As someone who's played for 4 years (without steam, of course), I can say that I'm still finding more and more things all the time and it's never a dull moment.\n\nAnd I will say; this game has the best composing system. If you're good enough, literally 'any' song IN THE WORLD can be in the game. It just takes a bit of work, but so worth it to me, and a huge veriety of intruments to work with too.

It's fun, addictive, and anime-styled. It plays well for the most part, save for some server lag in certain areas.\nThe other players are pretty friendly.\nMabinogi, in my opinion, is more fun playing with other people rather than on its own all the time.\nQuests are optional, you're not forced to do them whenever.\nThere's lots of combat skills and then some "life skills" which are non-combat like cooking, blacksmithing, etc.\nMost events are fun and often give free stuff which is amazing!\nNot pay-to-win, but pay-to-look-good, I guess is how I'd describe it.\nThe music is pretty great, gets repetitive after a while, though.\nThe pets are cute, too!\nPVP is optional, so if you don't like it, you can just turn it off!\nYou're not forced into just one class, you can be all of them if you want.\nUpdating skills gets a little difficult if you don't have the AP for it.\nAside from that,\n8/10 is my rating!","February 4","true","138.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you spent countless hours playing RuneScape or Harvest Moon back in the day, you'll probably like this too.\n\nGrinding by endlessly fighting monsters isn't necessary in this game, though the dungeons and fields offer the opportunity. Instead, much of your experience will come from quests and skill building. Part-time jobs offered by the shopkeepers of Erinn are a helpful way to gain exp, gold, and crafting supplies. Each character in this world is unique, so doing quests is a good way to build friendships.\n\nThere is a huge selection of skills, and you are free to build as many as you like. This includes, but is not limited to, fishing, cooking, tailoring, carpentry, metalworking, transformation, alchemy, music playing, swordfighting, archery, and magic. Practicing your trade(s) contributes to your skill level and your overall level. This allows you to use new techniques and recipes.\n\nYour character ages at the rate of 1 year for every 1 real-life week. If your level and age get too high for your taste, you can be reborn as your younger self (or a completely new person with a purchasable character card). You keep your skills and items, but resetting your level allows you to try new quests and gain AP faster to promote skill growth. Your character grows and changes weight as you get older and vary your diet and activity, making rebirth all the more refreshing.\n\nOverall, Mabinogi is a great MMO because it offers enough variety to last for countless hours of playtime. Even if the cutesy anime style graphics aren't to your taste, Mabinogi is worth a try if you long for a quality crafting/exploration MMO.","January 6, 2013","true","15.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It provides a unique gamplay experience and is constantly adding new content. The gameplay is simple enough for casual players, yet has a number of facets that can make it complex if that's your thing. It's also not a huge hardware drain, and can be run on stuff as old as Windows ME if your specs are good enough (Although I personally suggest nothing older than XP).","December 24, 2013","true","186.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The seemingly endless amounts of content, good storyline, and attention to detail makes up for the lack of great graphics. There's also a good sense of a helpful community in the game that are often missing in MMOs that are lost in pure competitiveness. Mabinogi is one of the few MMOs that lets you take it easy when you feel like it; you aren't pressured to grind, you can focus on training more than one group of skills at a time, or just talk and have good times with friends.","November 26, 2013","true","437.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/212200/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","Mabinogi is an intriguing game in some ways, and an extremely frustrating one in others. I'll break it down for simplicity's sake.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics, while simple, are clean and polished. If you don't have contempt for anime styling, it looks pretty nice.\n- The sheer variety of potential skills, combat-related and otherwise--it's extremely rare for a game to have its own music system, for example.\n- The community is fairly friendly and welcoming.\n- With the rebirth system, leveling is treated completely differently from most MMORPGs. It's still necessary, but more focused.\n- Combat requires more input than clicking skills on a hotbar. You still do that, but timing matters and knowing the right time to play defensive is key.\n\nCons:\n- There are very few enemy models, with constant recycled ones given a new coat of paint. This is to be expected in MMOs, but Mabinogi is hit extremely hard by it.\n- The dungeons are likewise very formulaic, all series of hallways and square/rectangular rooms filled with enemies or incredibly simple puzzles.\n- While the rebirth system takes some of the pain away from leveling, it still feels somewhat limiting. Initially, with the bonuses of a new character, you can rebirth and start from level one with skill levels intact every real-time day. Once these bonuses wear off, it's once a week. For some, this is fine. For me, it's tedious.\n-Travel on foot is extremely slow. The game gives you the option of buying pets or using less feature-complete beginner pets to make up for this... Which is great, except it then puts pets on a timer. Once the time runs out, the pets go inactive until the next real-life day. It's needlessly limiting.\n- While the rebirth system helps, leveling still slows substantially over time during the period between rebirths.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still like Mabinogi, and I still recommend checking it out... But you will know very quickly whether you have the patience for its unusual format.","January 31, 2014","true","99.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a lot to do usually, but it sort of forces you to play alone most of the time unless you're doing an event or sitting around in a town and playing your lute while you talk about things with friends.\n\nReally, the only way you can enjoy this game is if you are baked out of your mind or are 12 years old with an extremely long attention span. It's fun, though, and there is a lot of customization available. Your character path isn't extremely limited to one class or playstyle, so you can pretty much just wander around and do whatever.","December 28, 2012","true","51.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really one you just have to try out. High points are that it's very original and adorably quirky. The combat system pulls you in and can be deeply rewarding, but that same combat system will be one of your greatest drawbacks if you don't live near the server. If this is the case, a lot of time will be spent taking hits when your character is waiting for the server to respond to your commands, and in spite of this being an MMO, almost the entire storyline of the game forces you to play alone, which turns way too much play time into a lonely grind through waves of monsters who aren't hindered by server speed. The overt glitchiness is an early sign of how little support the game receives from its managing company, which is easily the root of its issues, but the community is awesome and the game really does play like nothing else out there. Definitely worth a shot. Don't pass it by if you haven't at least put a few hours in, because if it grabs you it grabs hard and you have a great time, but beware that you will deal with a lot of frustrating errors due to lack of support.","February 12, 2014","true","071.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fact that you don't need to do the same thing over and over like other MMO's, you can do a lot of other things beside dungeons. You can farm, have a life style of a chef and be who you want to be in the game.

It's packed with things to do both combat and non combat related. The community is great depending on what server you're on (I'd suggest Alexina if you're a beginner) and is truly one of Nexon's crown jewels in the F2P Market that holds up with new content even after 6 YEARS. The style is friendly, warm and inviting. The music is also calm and relaxing in my oppinion. The skills are a point and click with a skill hot bar system which may turn off some people if they're tired of that kinda thing like I was, but the combat animation looks so cool I barely cared at all plus some skills require you to press buttons like the martial artist talent which I found pretty sweet. However I must explain the cons, The game's Rebirth System maybe confusing to some people. Basically it's the system that replaces traditional "Level Up, Up a few of your skills". Mabinogi has a ranking system with each and every skill and you rank up these skills by spending a certain amount of "AP" which you get by Leveling Up and Doing quests that reward AP. So for those that feel at one point that they need to get more AP they're free to "Rebirth" which means resetting back to Level 1, BUT you keep all of your skill ranks so you're able to increase them further by leveling up. (NOTE: LEVEL UP YOUR WINDMILL SKILL FIRST, IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO LATER ON) Next on the Con List is the steam version..I've ran into so many problems with the steam version that I just up and decided to un-install everything and re-install it from the actual site. In fact you'll probably get the best performance from just installing it from the website. Last on the con list is Nexon, Now I do love some of their games but I dislike their company mainly for my poor experience in Customer Support. I don't know about you but I expect AT LEAST average to good customer support whenever my money is being put into a company (You can purchase additional content not required by the game in the Nexon Cash Shop for Character Customization, Different mounts, and Pets). Nexon's customer support is poor, so poor that it's almost insulting so buyer beware. So in short, I do recommend this game just not the Steam Version :/","January 12, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat is not terribly complicated, but it beats standing in place and spamming abilities on a hotbar. There's also tons of stuff to do outside of combat now, and learning skills is easier than when it was first released in the states. The greatest flaw in this game is the cash shop, as it gives paying players a clear advantage in-game (for example, one can purchase pets/mounts that grant additional inventory space as well as items that reset points spent on skills).","February 22, 2014","true","43.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some changes good and some pretty bad... ;;  If you've never tried Mabinogi befor, it's an interesting game to pick up and play with your friends. This game has a lot of story elements, that is tied with plenty of social interaction with other players. Once a huge hit when it was first released to English speaking shores, but now slowly dieing off into history.\n\nThe graphics are now dated, the engine... Surely, and the players of old have come and gone. The thought of a sequel or a spiritual successor is unknown to me. But if this game was rebooted, then it may have a brighter future. Sure there is Vindictus, aka "Mabinogi Hero's". But it's not a Mabinogi where the cute graphical art style stood supreme and friends were your best and loyal comrades that help you out when you need them most. Not many games of today are focusing on R and R to just sit around a campfire and chat these days and tell stories...\n\nPlay this game if you're interested, but sure it's not going to compare well with titles of tommorow, but it has some charm. Old and New gamers alike still could say, this was a good game for its time. But now, unless you have a friend on hand... Well. It's not a very good game by itself anymore... It's really getting to the point of extinction.","March 2, 2014","true","44.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My suggestion to any one new! Go to the mabiwiki website and make a friend on the game if you can. Don't be noobie and beg for peoples help, but start a regulare conversation and get to know them. It's not too bad once you get moving through the quest and levels and achieve new abilitys. It's worth a try.\n\nP.S. Start with a human, you get a free elve and giant if you make a human.

I was wrong about it not being my cup of tea.\nThink of it as a much more challenging and multiplayer harvest moon, but without the farming. The community is almost always fantastic, the non-combat skills are great, and the minigames are fun. At one point, in the game, I sat around a campfire with some fellow I'd just saved and cooked and then ate some bread, generously sharing some with him.

It's one of those games where you have to put in a lot of time to get in any results, but I didn't mind. I had a lot of time to kill.\n\nAs time passed, it became increasingly clear that this was a pay-to-win, even moreso than in the past. The price of pets was rising to over twenty dollars. That was alright, I could still play. It wasn't as much fun, but I still had the friends I made in the universe of Mabi.\n\nAfter a while, I started to have trouble launching the game - sometimes it would crash after a few minutes. Not long after, it started to do that every time I tried to play. I tried reinstalling it; at this point it quit launching altogether. I submitted a ticket to nexon, which was automatically canceled since it fell under Tech support; the automated message told me to post in the Tech support forums. I was a little irritated, but I did anyways. I had sunk a lot of time into this, so I didn't want to give up so easily. I didn't get any help, just a few useless comments and one or two people saying they had the same problem.\n\nI found the game was on steam, and all was well for a time. However, when I helped my Guild mine stones for a castle we'd won in an Auction (it would only be ours temporarily) and we completed it, I found that I needed Premium service to actually enter the dang place. I was less than pleased. I still played a little, just dinking around and talking to my friends now and then, working an undeveloped character I happened to have when I had some time to kill. (I avoided playing it unless I KNEW I had a lot of time; many of the quests require a maddening amount of running back and forth to two NPC's who were often on different ends of the continent, or at least a few cities apart. This game is impossible unless you drop some cash on pets to get around without going insane. Even then, travel takes longer than is fair, and with the increasing size of cities, much of which are empty and with a handful of NPC's spread over something that can take half an hour or more to traverse on foot...) Then, after a while, it started crashing after a few minutes again. At this point, I begrudingly cut my losses, deciding that it wasn't worth the effort and the frustration I was getting from the worsening pay-to-win environment and rising costs.","January 25, 2014","false","29.3"," 39 of 80 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","39","80","0","0"

They banned me for something I shouldn't have done.\nI deserved it.\n\n\nThe GMs Think They're Gods.\nThen when I got unbanned, I stopped making and distributing mods entirely.\nIt seemed all well, then I wake up in the morning and I see that my account has been banned AGAIN.\nI sent a ticket to Nexon, and in the meantime I go through the live chat and ask for the reason why I'm banned.\nThe GM says he doesn't know, so I just waited patiently for a reply on the ticket.\n\nAfter 3 days or so, some other GM says I'm involved in distribution of mods again.\nWhat? I haven't even made any mods since last ban, so why are they banning me now?\n\nI asked for evidences, evidences that wouldn't exist because I didn't do ♥♥♥♥!\nAnd the GM just says "the status on your account wouldn't let me unban you" or some crap.\n\nI've talked to several people and found out that there's a private Skype chat between the GMs and some players,\nand one of those players' hobby is to ask GMs to ban players he doesn't like.\nSadly I was one of those players who caught the attention of this abuser.\n\nWhat's more is that the GMs set up a group called New Player Ambassador and enlisted these privileged abusers join the group to receive items that are not available in the game by any means.\n\n\nConclusion\nI'm not even going to seriously try to get unbanned, because I know these money hungry pigs will simply let me blow more cash on the game and ban me for fun.\nMy point is, their staff members are corrupt and have no standards when it comes to dealing with players.\nThe game itself is great, the staff is what makes the game absolutely trash.\n\n\n...\n\n\nTL;DR\n1. Got banned for distributing mods.\n2. Got unbanned, stopped distributing mods.\n3. Got banned again for distributing mods. What?

What I liked was the customisability and open world feel to the game, with many different play options to explore.\nHowever, after my terrible experience with paywalls a few years ago, I subsequently quit playing. Downloading it again to see what improvements had been made.\nPROS\n- The game is up to you how to play and explore.\n- There are many different ways to customise your character.\n- A devoted fanbase.\n- Opportunity to waste many hours.\n\nCONS\n- Compatibility and anti-aliasing issues.\n- It's an old game, so some textures look very low-res, whilst newer items/areas look far more detailed, which breaks the flow of the game, in my opinion.\n- While the fanbase is devoted, the player base is much smaller than it was, leading to the world feeling barren and empty.\n- The combat system takes a lot of getting used to, and often made me want to flip the table.\n- Some story aspects seem forced to add content (race war, really?)\n- Pop up windows, annoying and always at the worst times.\n\nOverall, if you're new, you're a bit late to the party. Has Nexon quality (generally p2p and such). But if you can cope with the cons and somewhat annoying pop up windows, and playing mostly alone, then go for it!\n\n[this review is my experience and opinion, debate it any way you see fit :)]","October 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

If there was a point where I wasn't AFK, it was because I was talking to friends. Why nothing else?\n\nYour input is delayed if you don't adjust your network settings, the game's so unoptimized that the font they use is even capable of causing frame skips, and any new content they have have gets stuffed into a gachapon.\n\nWhat's a gachapon?\n\nA gachapon is a form of gambling that is legal for people of any age if you do it in Mabinogi, as long as you convert your real money into a fake currency they call NX and spend your NX on these boxes that are more likely to have garbage inside of them than what's advertised. And the people who localize this game even embrace gachapons enough to make them into a Steam emoticon.\n\nSo I'll re-emphasize my point. Stay away from this game while you can.

Nexon doesnt do customer service... the page is there only for show.\n\nI would have to not reccomend playing this game only because its run and managed by Nexon a very terrible game develloper/producer that has a tendancy to destroy wonderful creations and has an almost blantant disregard if not hatred of American & European customers. the game itself and its vibrant and adorible community are wonderful however.\n\nif you plan on spending money on the game, make your purchases through Steam... as there isnt a limit to what or how much you want to spend... and Valve will butcher Nexon if they rob you. which Nexon has done in the past with thier game cards and homepage credit purchases.\n\nmabinogi is adorible & fun... but my personnal experience with Nexon has ruined any chance ill ever play any of thier titles for risk of loosing an eye or limb.","August 21, 2014","false","73.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It was the most beautiful experice i have ever had the privledge of being apart of. it all starting with a young 10 year old boy that i created in the game named BLAZITO420 together, i traveled with my pet and companion BLUNT420. we discovered all that life has to offer within this game. we did one quest in total, in whch we talked to a man. that was it. on the way there i met with several mexicans. they spoke in that language the entire time. i knew that i had to instill democracy amongst them, so i told them of the legendary america. they did not recieve my words well and responded with horrific slurs such as, but not limited too: taco, taco, burrito, k pasta, and worst of all sieesta. through my cunning skills, that the game taught me btw, i was able to traverse the situation and find peace among the ruffians. later on my jouney i found a group of what i would come to call my beloved friends, i told them of how i lived in a box, and stole wi-fi from my neighbors home. i was gifted with a slab of meat to feed my children for the winter. it was a fantastic event in my life. to top it all off, my dad works at barbies dream house so i was able to ban all of the mexicans on the server.\n\n10/10 best game i have ever played in my exsistance i only want to kill myself a little.\nalso the game looks and smells like butts","May 16","true","1.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","33","2","6","5","0"

Character customization skill-wise is my top priority when it comes to MMORPGs, but when you start shifting the focus towards vanity items that do absolutely nothing except for making your character look good and you add a crap ton of random classes that confuse the heck out of enemy AI who've only had to deal with melee, bows, and magic, that's when I start frowning on the game. Ignore the playtime Steam has. I've played for quite awhile on the standalone launcher. Anyway, back to the review. In a nutshell, Nexon has turned Mabinogi into a cash grab with no good updates in who knows how long just to satisfy their greed. Yes, I just called Nexon out for being greedy. Yes, I will continue to point out Nexon's flaws through out this review.\n\n| Gameplay |\n\nThe original system for Mabi's combat was a modified rock-paper-scissors match which required skill more than luck. Smash broke through Block, Counter evaded Smash's slow attack, normal melee couldn't break Block, etcetera, but with the addition of new classes and skills along with it, the AI of the mobs just can't cope. They only know the bare essentials with maybe a special skill or two for the bosses.\nOutside of combat the economy of Mabi is jacked. You can hardly get started nowadays without buying something with real money from the Nexon store. Maybe, just maybe, if you find a experianced player then maybe they'll give you some gear, but with Mabi's playerbase dropping, it would be very rare.\n\n| Graphics |\n\nPerhaps the greatest point of Mabi is the graphics. But even then they look a tad outdated. Anime/Manga styled characters and mobs is the core concept of Mabi's graphics. Beutiful landscapes and sunsets, dark and grim dungeons, it is pretty cool, but still, it all could use a good polish.\n\n| Community |\n\nThe second most important thing to me is the community of the game. Friendly players willing to help out the newbies, a good rivalry between guilds, the lightest touch of drama here and there... Mabi used to have all this, but with the player base dwindling, well, it's going to be hard to find a person and not a bot. And a reason behind it all is Nexon's inability to respond to support tickets.\n\n| Summary |\n\nGameplay   - 3/10\nGraphics     - 8/10\nCommunity - 3/10\nAverage - 4.5/10\n\nMabi was fun. I loved this game entirely. Now it's just a shadow of a shell of its formor(reference) self.","March 7, 2015","false","20.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/212200/","BluePaw","BluePaw 🐾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/","164 products in account","Unlike other Asian MMOs where it is filled with fanbase of big boobs, panty shots, etc. for the male/lesbian taste, and mainly focused on combat. This is a fun MMORPG to try out for at least 3 days (or your money back).\n\nWhen you first start, you may feel overwhelmed and excited to try out as many skills as you can. It is highly recommended that you try out each skill at least a few times before leveling it from Novic to F (if it requires 0 AP then go ahead) because you will not get those back. Eventually you'll figure out which talent you want to invest in, take your time on that.\n\nOne thing I really like is that the clothing/equipment doesn’t always look the same in color and may not have the same stats either, if created by tailoring and/or blacksmithing, same for some weapons. This game really focuses on teamwork and is very welcoming to casual players as well. Another thing I really enjoy the most is how some of the NPC's break the 4th wall at times, or that some of the enemy's you meet will wear funny disguises. Lastely, weapons and equipment are sort of irrelevant in damage and defense. Talents are what really helps you grow whether be combat or non-combat talents. Level, Age, and Race also play as a factor for stat increase. Can also earn money not only by questing or grinding, but by part-time jobs or commerce as well! If you play your cards right, you could earn 10k+ in no time!\n\nThere are a few flaws/annoyances though: Can only make one character (Only bright side is that with your first character you can pick all the choices, normal and premium, for customizing, however will have to purchase another character card via cash shop, depending on type price varies, or make an alliance with either Elves or Giants to get a free card of that race). There is no advance warning that you’re using a beginner inventory package till level 30, where you’re able to use the full bank inventory, but the right half will be locked after level 30 and anything stored in there will be stuck unless you get the Inventory Plus Service from the Cash Shop for $8 for 30 days. The inventory on your character may get easily filled if you’re taking on too many talents. When buying a pattern or a blueprint for crafting clothe, weapon, armor, you don’t know what materials will be needed till after you purchase and start to use it. Best to use the wiki for this, it’ll save you up on gold.\n\nRecommend doing 2-3 life skill talents that require frequent inventory space like Tailoring, Medicine, and Cooking. It is nice to have at least one combat talent too like Close Combat (aka Warrior), Lance, Magic, etc. Say no more than two combat talents though if you wish to do any non-combat talents, and vise versa.\n\nOn the server I go to, Alexina, the community is friendly and helpful to newbies (however there are exceptions.) I have rarely seen any players that gloat/brag/show off about their W/L record, about how strong they are, or about their equipment and skills. This makes the game fun and comfortable to play in. Overall, who needs skill when you can have fun? That’s what the game is really emphasizing, fun!\n\nThe only piece of fanbase you’ll get the best of is at the start after making your first character. Enjoy the bouncy boobs while you can, because that’ll probably be the only time you’ll get to see anything jiggle on a woman!","March 7, 2013","true","701.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

It has a lot of promise buried some where deep within it, but it never really appears.\n\nThe story you experience in the game consistently has you helping NPCs you'd rather brutally murder.  And the quests tied to these stories have various levels of imbalance, either being way too easy for a long time, or way too cheap all of a sudden causing you to die like crazy.\n\nAlthough the game gives an impression that you can choose what skills you want to learn, what race you want to be, what equipment you want to wear, and what you want to do, you quickly learn that, in order to be good at the game, these choices quickly stop being choices.  Due to Combat Power requirements that only get worse as you level up and learn skills, you practically have to learn the skills in a set manner, with the most gruelling and reviled of these coming first simply because your lower Combat Power makes them "easier".  The races are imbalanced, with Elves being the butt monkeys of the game, Humans not really excelling at any one thing, and Giants being "teh best evarz".  Equipment is heavily restricted by Race and Gender, with the best either being horrendously ugly or costing an in-game fortune because they were once cash-shop items that you can no longer get.  And, as for doing what you want, you have the choice of pretending this is a fancy chatroom like Second Life or you have to do almost everything permanent, including the story, to become skilled at the game.\n\nOf course, this game also has problems with lag and latency.  Regardless of how fast your connection is or how good your computer is, you will find yourself getting cheaped on by enemies you should be owning because they have consistent 0 lag and erratic movement while the game's engine is struggling to display certain graphics or send commands at a reasonable rate.  This hinderance continues as you will also occasionally to frequently miss the timing on certain skills, such as the Chain 2 and 3 Fighter skills, because the server starts the timer on them before it even sends the data to your client and you have to go through as series of back-and-forth messages with the client and server to line whatever skill you are trying to do to whatever enemy you are trying to do it on.\n\nYou might have better luck with the game than I did overall, but I'm just posting how I feel about the game.","September 23, 2014","false","487.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Mabinogi is very rough around the edges, thanks in part to the localization being managed by Nexon of all things. It's over a decade old and much a product of its time, unoptimized, laggy, hard to get running on a modern OS, not very user friendly, the game does not explain itself well, you will constantly have to reference the wiki to make any headway in a number of things and understand the convoluted backend systems at work, Nexon support is nonexistent, and above all else the barrier to entry is horrible.\n\nThe way character progression works is by leveling up to gain "AP", which you use to rank up your skills that not only improve the skills' functionality, but often grant incremental stat bonuses. Then when the level grind gets too slow, you rebirth and start over from level 1 to continue accumulating AP. The end result is that the game is tailored around accumulating ridiculously inflated stat bonuses from skill ranks, to the point that your character level means little to nothing. Unfortunately, early quests are not very well balanced and have about as much chance of being a cakewalk as stoving your face in in an instant, as you are extremely fragile to start.\n\nWhere the game shines is in breadth of content. Combat is action-based and operates on a sort of rock-paper-scissors triangle that has since bloated outward but is still pretty interesting, on the rare occasion when it isn't being crippled by lag. Combat skill trees include swordplay, blunt weapons and axes, battle alchemy, magic, puppetry (yes, really), dual guns, one-on-one fisticuffs, archery, lancing, musical buffs and bludgeoning instruments, and for the hell of it, ninjas. Production skills include blacksmithing, fishing, cooking, mining, tailoring, herbalism, metallurgy, magic craft, engineering, carpentry, various alchemy, commerce, and for the hell of it, playing instruments via MML - the latter of which is what hooked my interest to begin with, actually.\n\nIf you're wondering where the payment incentive comes in, the answers are: pets, extra storage, and crappy lottery gachapons. Your starting inventory is pretty pithy all things considered; pets (that come with storage), special events, and limited edition cash shop items are the best remedy to this. Pets have the added bonus of being cute, and a semicompetent combat companion (if you level them up before they age).\n\nSo it's a bit hit and miss, but as a whole the game itself is a remarkable sight better than it once was, between all the retoolings and added content. It's still kind of a guilty pleasure, but a good romp with friends. If you ever play, be sure to set up on the Mari server. It's where all the cool guys are at.","September 23, 2014","true","780.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Nexon is an inept company that always fails to get it right the first time. Nexon's first and foremost concern is taking your money. Anything useful, conveient, and in some cases, necessary you will have to pay for. Nexon's customer service is abysmal; commonly taking them over a year to respond to ticket and even longer to actually resolve it, if that ever manages to happen.\n\nServers regularly crash and/or are under maintenance usually for a long time, especially during or after an update in which they inevitably break something. If they aren't, they're usually lagging, sometimes pretty bad. Hell, initally you need to mod the game just to make it acceptable to play.\n\nIf you do decide to play this game be prepared for attention ♥♥♥♥♥s, severe weeaboos, 12 year old girls, 13 year old boys, adults that act like 12 year old girls and/or 13 year old boys, meme spewing, and rampant hacking. I say more power to them (hackers). There needs to be people that can remind everyone about how bad Nexon sucks with this game.\n\nA good game for people with a whole lot of disposible income ( or stealing mommy and daddy's credit card until they notice $100 vanishing every month) and people who can't play anything better.\n\nSome pros for those that think (and will probably continue to do so anyway) that I'm being biased:\n- Very moddable, pretty much everything, from the sun to the UI to the music can be modded into whatever you can find/make.\n- A good break-away from your typical mmo; offering things other games could learn from.\n- Interesting battle system. Although with a past update, took a bad turn imo.\n- Expansive customization from characters to clothes (be prepared to pay for this too though)\n\nCheck out the forums.","December 8, 2012","false","0.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","2"

It is an ANTI-Recommendation)\n\nThe game is Okay and all, but Nexon is crap. they are a horrible publisher, and choose to charge insane amounts for things that shouldn't be that high price. What's more is, if you try to get the BBB involved with trying to get your support ticket noticed (Mabinogi tickets have a 6+ Month waiting time at least) the BBB will tell you that Nexon America has opted out of BBB, and therefore support cannot be given via BBB. (Shows how much they care for customers, etc.)\n\nThe content updates are quite lacking nowadays, running out of ideas, still trying to milk money out of Mabinogi players, until Mabinogi 2 comes along (No, it's not Vindictus, there WILL be a Mabinogi 2.) Then they will just delete everyone, no refunds, no nothing, clean slate on Mabinogi 2.\n\nOf course, this doesn't come without issues. Nexon KR, the parent company of Nexon USA, has always disliked their USA Nexon branch, and maybe won't even push Mabinogi 2 through to it. So in all, if you play anything from Nexon, you're better off just quitting, or following the crowd like sheep or lemmings. I'm not trying to be rude here, but because of Nexon's inability to "Play Nice" with its community, I'm pretty much forced to.","December 8, 2012","false","0.3"," 23 of 50 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","23","50","0","2"

I can play most of the high end games with graphics on high with my computer. This and the fact that after playing for a few hours then logging off, I have to rewatch all the starting game intros and play the stupid villager killing monster before I can do anthing again? Pressing ESC wouldn't let me skip them. I looked for a save when I was done playing the first time but there was nothing in menu. I assumed it would save when I logged off. So instead of starting where I left off I was forced to watch intro again. All this means I will be deleting this game and playing something better. If this game is taking real money from folks they should really invest in updating the game engine and bring this title into the modern times. Good Luck.

I was first introduced to the concept of this game, by a fellow student in a Irish folklore and folk life class and it seemed to me to be everything I was looking for in an MMO when it came to lore and interesting mechanics, however that sadly did not turn out to be the case.\n\nThis game is defiantly for those who like to explore and have little to no guidance in what choices they make, which for me sadly meant wondering around a lot, losing time trying to figure what I was doing with my character, class and abilities and what have you. Between an almost dead community presences online (at least when it comes to help guide) and just overall becoming boring after the first few hours, Mabinogi just was not the right game for me\n","June 23, 2014","false","26.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Allowing a person to make one character per account or card is just silly and was a big turn off at the beginning.  Then suddenly I'ma  horse running around attacking spiders and wolves but unable to talk to anyone and no idea what was going on.  It's basically a game for older players.  As in, people who have been playing it for a couple of years and have gotten to know one another rather well through the game itself.  Which is fine, if you're looking for a social game.  I was looking for something with more adventure.  This was not that game for me.\n\nAlthough it does have combat, it's tedious and slow.  With numerous combat progamming issues such as slow to no response, it get boring and annoying very quickly.  If you want to be with your friends from the beginning you have to make the same type of character.  Unless you are one of the players who has played for some time then you're aware of how to get where and what exactly you're doing.\n\nI was enticed by the farming, cooking, trade skill aspects only to learn that those are the main skills you pick from the beginning.  While you're welcome to learn other skills or professions, if you picked cooking then cooking would be the only thing you truly excelled at which gives the game another annoyance factor for me personally.\n\nI'm not going to say anything about the graphics because I believe that graphics do not make the game no matter how beautiful or up to date it is, if the game play is awful it is awful and god rays won't save it.  t's dated to be sure but it works for what (I assume) the game is going for.  After awhile I got tired of children players running around and elves with large breasts giggling constantly and decided to try something else.\n\nIt's a charming thought but all in all this game left me more confused than with the feeling of enjoying a real role playing game.  If you have extensive amounts of time on your hands, do not like social interractions in the real world or are one of the few serious fans left of the game, enjoy.  Otherwise, I would try something else with better, more responsive controls and doesn't rely on extreme amounts of beauty shop items in order to enjoy the "game".","December 5, 2013","false","2.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I feel like there should have been more of a tutorial for the game as I had no idea what I was doing. I felt lost, and the character customization was lack-lustre. I expected more options than what was offered to me. A lot of the hair and eye colours and styles were locked until you purchased something. I was also disappointed in the fact that you could not choose your own clothing at the start of the game. This is definitely a game in which you'd want to level up in, and I'm assuming that leveling up in this game takes a long time. However, I will say one thing: the online community present in this game is very helpful and friendly. They were willing to give me and my friend really nice new clothing when we accidentally sold ours and were quick to offer tips and advice on playing this game. My only advice to you is that if you're interested in playing this game, doing extensive online research on how to play the game before playing would be highly reccomended in order for you to have a good start. However keep in mind that my friend and I did a little research; including watching a few "Let's play" videos on youtube, gong to the official website and wiki, and also going to a few fansites, which made us excited for the game and caused us to have high expectations of the game after seeing all the things you could do (after leveling up and/or spending real money). Added to the issues of not knowing how to play the game, and the ridiculously long download time (which after doing some research we discovered that it varied from person to person - one of the people we met on the game waited 3 days whereas some took no time at all), I found that this game was also incredibly boring, especially if you haven't leveled up. It definitely has a slow start and I'd definitely reccomend using a mouse as character movement proved difficult with a trackpad. Combat was confusing and even after I attempted to get through a short training exercise (which I did not complete since there were no tutorial instructions) I was still unable to figure out how to successful maneuver my fighting ability. However, between waiting for the game to install on Steam (which took about 7 hours) and waiting for the patch to download there was still an issue with creating an account. The account creation system we found was buggy and tempermental, and finally after that was dealt with and we were excited to start playing, there was still a patch to install. We found that while this wait was a one time thing, and is a lot faster when downloading from steam as opposed to the game's website, it still took about 22 hours to install, even on a relatively fast computer. While there are still a lot of good things to say on the game, there are more bad ones and in my opinion it all boils down to what your expectations of a MMORPG are. In my case, I was just looking for a fun game with easy-to-use controls and lots of options on what sort of things you can do. The game probably would have been better if new players received an extensive array of items when they first started playing. Things like a starter weapon, a fishing rod and a few more books focussing on starting level abilities associated with your class type would be useful. Overall, this game took way to long to download for how long I played for and for how much I enjoyed the game.","February 18, 2014","false","5.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

There were just so many times where I would enter a building and get stuck and have to relog or be fighting an enemy and your character will literally just sit there. With that being said, this MMO is more of a social game rather than a combat game, which isnt really my cup of tea. The graphics are nice but they definitely haven't aged well at all. I think the biggest flaw though is the somewhat Pay-to-win aspect of the game. You almost HAVE to spend a decent amount of money to even make the game convient enough to play. They give you a mount to use, but even then it only lasts for 1 hour and a half each day unless you buy the "permenant" version, and in a game where the quest NPCs are sometimes continents away, you'll find yourself spending more time walking from place to place than actually enjoying yourself.","June 9, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

Immediately. Go into your control panel, turn down the Client.exe or Mabinogi volume through system settings, then play. If you do not do this you will be blasted with late-90's synth music that will at least make you ill, and the remaining sound effects will make you deaf.\nIf you are still playing you will notice that you have nothing to do, and no idea what to do at all. While odds are you won't need the wiki at this point, you will need to do anywhere from 20 to 30 missions depending on the class you picked just to unlock your skills.\nIf you manage to actually do all of these 15 minute long missions for each skill, you should just stop. Close the client, because  what you did was all you should do.\n\nYou see, the game developers (at least for the north American side of the game) don't actually like it when people play the game, because their "special events" give you more experience for doing half-programed mini-games than actual dungeon crawling, which no one does because dungeon crawling is obsolete, and has been for years. How? simple: buying "gachapins" from the real-money shop can give items that are better than anything you will ever find in any dungeon. What about making the armor with blacksmiths? NOPE: event and gachapin items have better stats than anything a blacksmith can make. The newest lifeskills even? nope, new armor an weapons where released a few months later. Anything that doesn't involve throwing away real money and standing around doing nothing will just make you a second-rate character, and sometimes, you just have to sit around and do nothing, since most events reward you if you're AFK!\n\nThe only thing that 90% of people do in this game is sit around town in their outfits, or try to make money by doing event mini games to make money. The few people who actually play the game typically hate what the game has become, and would play something else if they hadn't invested so much time and money in the game.\n\nOh, did I mention that the story will make your eyes bleed? Don't read the fluff text, especially if it involves Shakespeare.\n\nTL;DR: doing nothing in this game is more rewarding than actually playing it. Do not waste your time and sanity.","March 1, 2014","false","6.2"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","5"

The battle system sucks and is frustrating as hell, however the music system is original and good, it allows you to put any song you want into the game, if you know how.\nOn the music system there is a lot to offer, ranging from different instruments to creating your own music score, solo or band optimized.\nThe music system is the largest pull of the game, and is certainly what got me to get the game and stay in it for longer than I care to admit.\n\nBe wary of the "free" grab as well, everything is free except quite a lot of the game, which can be frustrating because to have more than one character, you have to buy, to have your character look unique, you have to buy.\n\nHowever it has addicting game play and interesting NON-combat orientated systems, but the moment you get into the combat, you're greeted by a poorly designed system, that not only makes it boring to fight, but painful, on that note the combat side feels ignored, the drop rate ratios are far from decent, and the dice roll based damages, can be quite unforgiving for new players, or Australian players, as there are no Australian servers which makes latency, a royal pain in the left butt cheek.\n\nThis game gets a 4/10 from me.","December 16, 2012","false","100.5"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","2"

Sorry for the ovbious sarcasm, but let's take a look at Mabinogi:\n\nThis game first off immediately tries to ♥♥♥♥ you off by playing super-loud music at the start screen that you can't change until you've made a character. Now I know what you're thinking: There's a mute button stupid, but at the same time an experienced friend of mine is trying to teach me the basic stuff about the game. To add to that, the game is impossible to figure out unless you have a friend guiding you the whole way. Also, the game is ridiculously slow-paced and boring with just everything that you do. The combat system is ridiculously tedious and annoying to use. When you first create a character, you instantly discover you can only have one character per account and VERY limited customization options. If you try to create a male character, it will always look like a female. The pay to win system is unbelievably bad and stuff costs way too much. The resolution isn't even optimized for all screen resolutions so it looked really sluggish to me. Everything in the game looked horrible and low-res. There is tremendous lag on every server and channel even though I have way above the recommended system specs for this game. The worst part is, the customer support for the game by the publishers, Nexon, are unresponsive and couldn't care less for the community. The servers are practically barren and the few people I find outside of the 2 friends that tried to guide me through the game never leave me alone and spam the chat like crazy. The first guy you meet, Duncan literally tells you that: "All of these jobs may seem boring to you." So heed his warning. The only things that are nice about this game is that it is a bit different from other mmos and the story is set up well. But other than that, this feels like a boring, tedious, annoying, and a confusing experience the whole way through. This game is slowly dying so I advise not to get in to it. The sad thing is, I hear from lots of dedicated players that the game was decent when it first came out back in 2003, but then Nexon screwed it up significantly. The worst part is, there are way better Free-To-Play MMOs like Planetside 2, Warframe, SWTOR, Rusty Hearts, Cosmic Break, and so on. This game was so bad that my testicles committed suicide due to the lack of testosterone considering that no matter what you do to customize your character, you'll always look like a female! Not being sexist or anything, but I want to look like my own gender please, come on now Nexon!\n\nTo sum it up, this isn't just a bad F2P MMO, it's probably one of the worst F2P MMOs I've ever played. Just do yourself a favor and just play a different F2P game unless you enjoy grinding for several hours just to earn or do anything that is cool or fun at all.\n\nP.S.

This game really is spectacular. It takes getting used to, but there is SO MUCH TO DO. You are not limited to fighting in this game, you are not restricted to one class. If you want to be an archer-warrior-mage-musician, then go for it. Mabinogi is by far the ultimate MMO. It is NOT pay to win in the slightest. Which is why it is the only mmo I can play. It is not grind heavy either like most MMO's. The anime aesthetic is very nice as well. If you haven't tried this game, I highly recommend doing so.

Just look at the woman on the cover, COME ON REALLY!\n\n\n*THIS IS HIS REVIEW*\n\nWhat can I say about this "Thrill-Ride" of a F2P game? Sorry for the ovbious sarcasm, but let's take a look at Mabinogi:\n\nThis game first off immediately tries to ♥♥♥♥ you off by playing super-loud music at the start screen that you can't change until you've made a character. Now I know what you're thinking: There's a mute button stupid, but at the same time an experienced friend of mine is trying to teach me the basic stuff about the game. To add to that, the game is impossible to figure out unless you have a friend guiding you the whole way. Also, the game is ridiculously slow-paced and boring with just everything that you do. The combat system is ridiculously tedious and annoying to use. When you first create a character, you instantly discover you can only have one character per account and VERY limited customization options. If you try to create a male character, it will always look like a female. The pay to win system is unbelievably bad and stuff costs way too much. The resolution isn't even optimized for all screen resolutions so it looked really sluggish to me. Everything in the game looked horrible and low-res. There is tremendous lag on every server and channel even though I have way above the recommended system specs for this game. The worst part is, the customer support for the game by the publishers, Nexon, are unresponsive and couldn't care less for the community. The servers are practically barren and the few people I find outside of the 2 friends that tried to guide me through the game never leave me alone and spam the chat like crazy. The first guy you meet, Duncan literally tells you that: "All of these jobs may seem boring to you." So heed his warning. The only things that are nice about this game is that it is a bit different from other mmos and the story is set up well. But other than that, this feels like a boring, tedious, annoying, and a confusing experience the whole way through. This game is slowly dying so I advise not to get in to it. The sad thing is, I hear from lots of dedicated players that the game was decent when it first came out back in 2003, but then Nexon screwed it up significantly. The worst part is, there are way better Free-To-Play MMOs like Planetside 2, Warframe, SWTOR, Rusty Hearts, Cosmic Break, and so on. This game was so bad that my testicles committed suicide due to the lack of testosterone considering that no matter what you do to customize your character, you'll always look like a female! Not being sexist or anything, but I want to look like my own gender please, come on now Nexon!\n\nTo sum it up, this isn't just a bad F2P MMO, it's probably one of the worst F2P MMOs I've ever played. Just do yourself a favor and just play a different F2P game unless you enjoy grinding for several hours just to earn or do anything that is cool or fun at all.\n\nP.S.

(if you can ever get there)\n\nOverall, however, dispite all its grevious shortcomings, Mabinogi is an amazing game. It has a massive pool of content and the options for character customization are as close to literally endless as I have ever seen in any game before short of going old school and playing D&D or some third party variant thereof. Something that I tend to use as a selling point is the games lack of a level cap. Basicly how it works is leveling up gets you ap, ap gets you skill ranks, skill ranks give you permanent stat boosts. Once per week you can rebirth, which resets your level to 1 but lets you keep all skills you ranked and all the stats they gave you. The game keeps track of your "total level", which is exactly what it sounds like, the total number of times your character has leveled up since creation. On average a powerful player can gain 100 levels or so each week between rebirthing withut any trouble, each level up grants you 1 ap, each skill on average takes 200-300 total ap to get to the maximum rank with extremes ranging from skills costing only 50 total to costing 500+ total. There are enough skills in the game that the total number of ap required to max out every skill is so high that my level 6500 main character is nowhere near achiving this, and I have participated in enough events that reward ap or double the ap gained on level up (events which are held pretty frequently) that my total amount of ap gathered is likely closer to 10,000. In addition to this they release more and more skills all the time. With this system the game rewards veteran players greatly as your characters power never stops growing. (this is even used as a theme throughout the games story) This means that with this game, unlike a game like WoW for example, the people who have put the most time into the game will be much more powerful then those who started only recently. In WoW particularly there is no diference in character power between a character that was created back at the games birth and a character that was created only a year or so ago. This does, however, lend itself to one of Mabinogis not so obvious flaws. With the way the level system is set up, considering the games age, it makes starting out seem like kind of a hopeless situation. Even my 6500 levels is relatively low for the age of the character because I have taken breaks due to events in my life or simple distraction by other games. This can be discouraging to players who, after their first few hours of gameplay, are most likely only level 30 or so if their not being assisted by stronger characters. This is, however, a problem that has in the past been addressed and adjusted for and likely will be again in the future. As of right now there is a feature in the game that gives new players whos total level is under 1000 items for easier transportation throughout the game world, items to assist in combat, free permanent ground and flying mounts, free premium service and the ability to rebirth every day rather then every week. This means that for your first 1000 levels, roughly 1/7th of what I accumulated over the course of 5 years, your progression is increased to 6 times regular speed (players over total level 1000 can rebirth only roughly once per week, every 6 days is the exact time) on top of being given other things to speed up the flow of the gameplay as a whole. This game also has a very involved and extensive crafting system and a huge range of options for gear customization and enhancement. In some cases, with good enough gear, a characters damage can be multiplied by 10. My critical hits average 12,000 damage, if I had fully upgraded and reforged gear (which takes an insane amount of time, in game gold, luck, or cash) I could potentially get criticsl hits of upwards of 100,000 damage. Currently I dont believe there is anything in the game that requires gear that good but getting gear of that quality is nearly impossible. (though I have seen it in action a few times before) Upcoming content for this game will be focusing a bit more on the endgame content, however, so we may one day in the very near future see content that does require the most carefully crafted gear possible.\n\nI would absolutely recommend that anyone with a computer capable of running this game relatively well give it an honest chance. Break that total level 1000 mark and play after that for a while and youl realy start to get into the meat of the game. Our community could use more new players who will stick around for the longhaul. If you want to play with me personally I play on the Ruairi server and my characters name is Blortad. Its worth mentioning that the 1300 hours I have logged on this game is only my play time over the last year or so since I started playing through steam. I have been playing this game for over 5 years, nearly since its relese in the United States, so bear with me if I go a bit too fast for you at first.","February 3, 2015","true","718.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be seriously worth a laugh though when you see something like the pelican pet's running animations\n\nin the end though the game's sheer volume of content that's surprisingly high quality overpowers the downsides so once you get into it the game's very good for being mostly free. I've played it since it came out in 2006 and I've probably spent $60 tops on it, and most of that was not needed to be competitive in gameplay.","November 22, 2014","true","637.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those few. The fact that there are a large number of people playing this, some friendly, others that troll, as well as a unique skill upgrade system that doesn't cost any in game money (Save for a few), it's not a matter of what can you do next, it's a question of what WILL you do next. For all intents and purposes, this is what ESO should've been, and this was out years before any trailers for ESO... or Skyrim. However, the downside is to how dull things can seem to get, especially with repetitive gameplay. So, this gets a 4/5 for showing a unique side to MMOs, as well as having a multi-sided theme.","November 23, 2014","true","705.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But everything else is great: A player community full of people who are usually very nice, MANY classes that you can choose, and a rediculous amount of quests. Completing all 19 of the main storylines is quite the feat, and even after having played this game for 400+ hours, I still haven't done so. Just be prepared for the game to not work at all when you first install it.

Theres even a skill for egg gathering! You can honestly do anything on this game, tame a random mob, turn into a butterfly or raid the biggest dungeons.\n\nThe combat is fun, with VERY cool looking animations, there is a wide variety of mobs for you to fight and gear isn't hard to get.\n\nIt is not pay to win at all, the only thing you can pay for is Pon, which only makes your character look cool and occasionally it gives you that for free. Premium outfits are usually sold at the Dunbarton market for gold, and there are various, easy methods to get gold.\n\nOnce you get bored of combat in general, you can devote your life to adventuring, or cooking, maybe even a grocery store clerk? This game can't really get too boring unless you hate life in general.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that the movement gets glitchy once in a while and some of the animations seem to skip frames, either than that, very good play.

This game has an exuberant amount of life skills, providing plenty of hours of entertainment. Life skills range from the standard mining/weapon crafting to cooking and music composition. I personally enjoy any game that allows for a lot of gathering of needed materials and this game surely provides. The fighting system is very involved, so don't expect a point a click. Defense is key to making it through dungeons. They are constantly updating their jobs and quests. The best part is the rebirth system. This allows you to start from lvl 1 while still retaining previous skill levels and an overall level as well as being able to change jobs. One week your a cook, the next a gunslinger. Out of all the free mmos I've played, this one definitely allows for greater amount of freedom than others. The quest and storylines are creative and unique. My only complaint (and it's huge), is that any tume there is an update I am suddenly unable to play the game. I can uninstall and reinstall the game but it doesn't seem to help. I have to wait (usually up to months later) to play the game. This has been happening to me for years; even before the game came to Steam and I have yet to still resolve the problem. Sadly though, the game is just too good for me to stay away permenantly.","January 12, 2015","true","382.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
