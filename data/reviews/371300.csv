The setting is set on a stage and it's really surprising the first time when you see the buildings and environment being built right in front of your very own eyes. You as the player have some control over the three main characters of the play. I say some because I felt as though some of the selections that were given felt forced on me.\n\nAnyways, there are choices you can make (in a form of news reports that you can send to your editor/boss), that will determine how other non-playable actors will react to you.  Now, since there’s only one act, I am not sure how much of an impact my decisions will have on future acts so that is to be determined. I will update as more acts are added.\n\nThe characters are quirky, albeit strange at times but they all have unique personalities that set them apart from each other. I mean it’s not every day someone asks you to feed a raw chicken wearing a diaper to an alligator. (However, if this is an everyday occurrence to you, please call me.) Some of the dialogues are funny and the story is engaging. I believe it took me about 3.5 hours to complete the first act so it’s not too long.\n\nI would recommend this game, especially since the price dropped to $9.99. The developers are pretty responsive to their players.\n\nI’m not much for scoring but I suppose I would rate the first act a 7/10.\n\nFor your viewing pleasure, I uploaded my playthrough of this game on YouTube.\n\nKnee Deep Playlist","July 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","31","34","5","1"

The game is presented as a play, with you being the lead actor in it. Not all the three characters that you play are very likeable, but the fact that you do play different people gives you an opportunity to play to varying character tropes and see how they mesh together. What really impressed me the first time playing this game is how the theatre theme is played around with in the visuals, in that locations look like parts of the same theatrical stage, and rotating it is how you transition from one scene to the other. The stage lighting gives the scenes a unique noir look that adds to the atmosphere and masks the relatively mediocre quality of the character models.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward point-and-click adventure stuff. You talk to NPCs, pick what to say, get information accordingly, and then move on to the next scene. Every once in a while, you get to single out a piece of information you either picked up from the world or from a conversation and then publish a report on it. The chosen tone of the report and subject matter affects the way some characters react to you later on. There's a couple of puzzles in there, but they're very minimalistic and obviously not the focus of the game.\n\nThe writing is quaint, intriguing, and mostly enjoyable, with some laugh out moments in it. Think Twin Peaks in Florida.\n\nThe lack of voice acting might bug some people, but I didn't mind it as much. I had trouble remembering who was who, and voice acting might've helped make the NPCs stick to mind more, but I can't imagine the budget of the game would allow the voice acting to be of a high enough quality to justify it being there.\n\nThe music amps up and slows down in just the right places, making the tense scenes even more exciting and the tedious ones bearable. What did take me out of the game a bit is the couple of bugs I had here and there where the characters would just stand there and do nothing, but the game autosaves often enough that it wasn't a big hassle.\n\nOverall I had a great time with the game and can't wait for the second act.\n\nUpdate: Haven't had the time to play through the second act all the way through yet but from what I've played, the plot is progressing as well as before and the voice acting is decent. Stil, I prefer playing with it turned off since I end up reading the dialog faster than it's being spoken and I'm glad that's an option.","August 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","1"

I wanted to review this from Act 1, but thought it would be better to save it until Act 3 was released. Now that all the acts have been released and played I figured now was the perfect time.\n\nI personally really enjoyed this game. It's more or less a simplified point-and-click game where all you need to do is really press 1 of 3 buttons to make decisions in game. The characters of this game are also wonderfully written and funny. On top of this, the whole game takes place on a theatre stage with you as an audience member who is also the director (somehow) who decides many of the lines in the game.\n\nI would personally say that Act 1 starts off a little slowly (but considering the game is set on stage like a play, this is expected) in that not much really begins to happen until the very end of Act 1. In my opinion from the second half of Act 2 to Act 3 is where everything ramps up dramatically. To me, the entirety of Act 3 was the best part of this game.\n\nI'd recommend this game to you if you're looking for an episodic style game where you don't need to be paying attention 100% of the time as there are (thankfully) no quick time events.\n\nMy only complaint would MAYBE be the current price of it. It was £10.99 (UK, full price) at the original date of posting this review, and for something that took 4.4hrs to complete. But then again, you get SO MUCH of that value in Act 3 alone. A definite recommendation from me!","March 9","true","4.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","2"

The story takes place in the back waters of swampland Florida. There are all sorts of strange characters all with possibly shady pasts and even shadier motives. From Remy who keeps telling you useless facts, to the strange religion that seemingly is connected to everybody. These characters and interactions is what makes Knee Deep rich. The basic mechanics of the game are simple, this is a visual novel with an interesting aesthetic. You go through the game talking to many characters trying to find out what really is going on. What makes Knee Deep unique is that you form the narrative in many ways, from inner monologue to the back story of certain characters. Things can play out many different ways and it adds a lot of replay value. Occasionally I found the animations and the way conversations ended rather odd. This could be due to Knee Deep being a stageplay that you are watching. As far from a technical standpoint everything works well but increasing the shadow quality of the game caused massive frame drops. This became noticeable and I had to lower the quality to get a smooth game. In all this isn't your usual style of Visual novel, It tries to be different for better or worse. If you come into this expecting a traditional visual novel or something more akin to Telltales games, you may be disappointed. On the other hand if you approach this, curious about weird characters and an unusual murder mystery you might enjoy Knee Deep. It also helps that there is two more acts coming that are completely free with the purchase of the game.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/rgfqwGuS-ik\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","July 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","2"

As with a good film, I'm swept up in the story and the mechanics of its telling. I really wanted to sit through the credits that cleverly display when you choose a "bathroom break" at the end of the Act.  I'm definitely looking forward to Acts 2 and 3 but as importantly, the next project this team tackles.  I hope they can remain viable.  I've been a gamer for over 50 years and it's rare to see a game that so expertly captures my other passions: movies and theater.  I've enjoyed such cinematic games as Life is Strange but Knee Deep nails the emotional experience evoked by the best of the arts.  It is a gaming masterpiece.\n\nUpdate:\nPlease note the dev's comments that I am wrong regarding length of Act 1.  That would indicate the length, with all three acts, is good.  Regardless, I bought it even though I thought it might be short.\n\nOrginal review:\nFor those of us who love cinematic games, this is a terrific addition.  It deftly provides the cinematics in a theatrical manner that is graphically dynamic and highly unusual.  The characters are a bit stiff and rough in comparison but that doesn't detract from the visceral pleasure of advancing an interesting story line.  With sublime lighting and evocative music, Knee Deep has flair to spare.  And for those who may be put off by earlier reviews citing lack of vocalization, know that the devs have listened and supplied voiceovers to great effect.  I've also noticed they have responded to most, if not all, of the reviews here which generally signals devs who really care.  If you're on the fence, just play the demo.  That's what hooked me.  Even though the game may be short (the demo is supposed to be all of Act 1 and I finished it in less than two hours), I decided these devs deserve support.  There are some reviews that compare this to Telltale games but I think in many ways, Telltale and other "choice-oriented" adventure game companies could learn from these folks.","January 28","true","5.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","3"

In classic mystery fashion, our three main investigators start with a seemingly simple suicide, only to unearth a snakes’ den of unsavory characters and forces. Like any good old ingrown community, everyone has an intertwined, violent and/or illegal backstory.\n\nThe overall plot backbone is constant, but your conversation and reporting choices open unique subplots and relationship angles: Will he make his cocaine pickup? Will one main character expose another’s dark past? Who lives and who dies? I’ve enjoyed playing through the game several times, trying to uncover new story angles and clues. One thing is for certain, the Act 1 conclusion was completely unexpected and has me dying (no pun) to get my hands on Acts 2 & 3.\n\nThis is NOT a game for world explorers or physical clue gumshoes. The designers hold to the stage metaphor and focus your attention on one scene at a time. The 3D world is stage-minimalistic. The sets and lighting nicely capture the nightmarish quality of a backwater town on a hot, muggy night. The 3D characters and their animations are simple but effective. The music was a pleasant surprise for me — haunting and ear-worm worthy.\n\nI enjoy a game with great replay value, and this one lets me explore the consequences of risky convesational styles. I catch glimpses here in Act 1; ultimately, it'll be interesting to see how Acts 2 & 3 bear out the fruits of my game play.","July 6, 2015","true","15.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

I emerged, several hours later, pondering the clues I had uncovered and wondering what will happen next? An exciting, well-staged cliffhanger at the end of this episode got my pulse racing as events rapidly escalated to an unexpected conclusion.\nI love this theatrical premise, with gorgeous sets and lighting, and I find the characters fun to play. There are choices to make which influence how other characters will respond to you (whether they will give you much information, for example), but you really cannot fail at this game, which encourages you to take risks and experiment. The game conveniently stores discovered information and clues for you in an easily accessible journal which you can refer to at any time. I found this particularly helpful as there is a lot going on in this first episode.\nCannot wait for the next installment and glad to hear it will be out in just a few months.  Meanwhile, I will be playing this again and making different choices, just to see what happens! A game which rewards experimentation and which is, in a word, FUN.\n\nACT 2 REVIEW:\n\nKnee Deep's Wonderland offers new scenes but continues its strangely addicting combination of murder mystery with witty (often snarky) repartee. I love the option of choosing edgy reporting or weird responses. Why not? It's a game, not real life. I can take risks.\nStill in Cypress Knee, that strangely familiar Florida town, but now there is a weirdly creepy fair complete with a  set of rhyming villagers reminiscent of an off-kilter broadway musical. The body count continues to grow as the clues accumulate...\nThe occasional short interlude of "match the patterm" challenge allows a chance to engage a different part of your brain.  This act is well paced and all in all, an excellent use of the 90 minutes or so it takes to play it. Great fun all around, and I look forward to the final act.","July 8, 2015","true","7.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

It's very much in the spirit of Telltale's iconic Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us games, using well-written (and frequently hilarious) dialogue-branch gameplay to further the narrative.\n\nThe big thing that struck me was Knee Deep's staging and production design. It's a modestly sized project, but you can tell a lot of thought went into how each scene transitions from one to the next through clever lighting and inspired set design. Buildings spiral, transform, and rotate to take you to each new location, creating a gorgeously fun ballet out of limited art assets.\n\nIf I have any gripes at all, it's that I found the swelling cast of characters tough to tell apart after a while. Since many of the scenes are told through static, stage-play inspired shots, it was tough to get a good look at anyone's face up close. I would have loved to have seen an occasional close-up during heated moments to build some intimacy and tension.\n\nVery much looking forward to Act II!","July 16, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

The rate at which characters are introduced during the beginning of the game can be a little overwhelming as you try to get to grips with their names and backstories; but it’s hard to resist digging deeper into their answers to uncover their stories and grudges against each other. Some have criticised the visual style by claiming that it’s outdated; but what better way to portray a backwater town far past its heyday than to use an artistic style which evokes the same feeling?\n\nIf you’re not a fan of releases in the same vein as Telltale Games’ titles, it’s likely that Knee Deep’s gameplay style won’t be for you.

No score will be given. A full review of the entire season will follow once all three episodes have been released.\n\nIt’s a good thing that I’m playing this game on a hot summer evening. It’s also interesting that I live just a few miles away from one of the largest swampland areas in Europe and the humidity, as always, is unbearable. It’s just curious that there are no mosquitoes tonight. All in all, a perfect situation to immerse myself into Knee Deep, a self-proclaimed swamp noir in three acts. And I am immersed in a matter of seconds. The first thing that strikes me is the music, a brilliantly moody mixture of American folk and blues. I start the game up and I am immediately seated in a theater. I silence my mobile phone out of respect for the actors. As the curtain rises on the stage, I find myself in a backwater Florida town of Cypress Knee. It’s a grim start as a washed-up actor has hanged himself from a tower next to a local inn.\n\nIt is at that time that I am called up to control the story. Even though a wider narrative is in place, the player is able to move the story along through the actions of three distinct characters. Romana Teague, a 20-year-old blogger kicks things off as she decided to report on the apparent suicide. Then there’s Jack Bellet, a local reporter whose career and marriage is falling apart. Lastly, private investigator K.C. Gaddis, hired by the film studio to look into Tag Kern’s suicide, arrives on the scene as well. Not all is as it seems in Cypress Knee and each character will stumble onto different pieces of information as they survey the surroundings and talk to the locals. Certain critical choices will affect relationships with other characters. Also, as you uncover certain details, you can choose which story to run and what spin to put on it. Whether you choose to keep things grounded, put an edgy spin on a story, or go all out sensationalist, it will have an effect on the narrative and other characters. What I found most compelling was the ability to choose the playable characters’ past and motivations and that is something I hope to see more of in upcoming episodes.\n\nThe overall story is certainly intriguing with all manner of seedy and eccentric characters. However, the writing is a bit of a hit-and-miss. Romana in particular comes off as rather obnoxious too often in an attempt to be snarky and that’s definitely not a trait you want the lead character to have. Some situations are realized to great effect while others fall flat. The gameplay revolves around choosing responses when interacting with characters and choosing which story to write and what spin to put on it. There are only two puzzles in the game and they’re an extremely basic affair of putting several puzzle pieces together. It is clear that the gameplay in Knee Deep takes a backseat to storytelling and atmosphere. And the atmosphere is truly palpable.\n\nAside from the already mentioned brilliant soundtrack, certain graphical effects are pulled off masterfully as well. While the graphics are technically rather modest, the slick utilization of a theater stage makes up for it. The game takes place during a single evening and the stage is mostly very dark with a few lights coming on to highlight points of interest. As the lead characters enter buildings, the outer walls and ceilings rise up to reveal the interior. Also, as you go from one location to another, the entire stage rotates and changes the backdrop. It’s truly an inspired series of effects that completely nail the vibe of both a dark stage and a small Florida swamp town.\n\nThe first act will take you about 2 hours to finish, so it’s a bit short even for an episodic game. I played through it a second time to see how different choices affect the story and to get some achievements. The remaining two acts will follow at an undetermined date. The end of Act 1 brings closure to this particular part of the story, but there are still things left to uncover.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nKnee Deep Act 1: Wonderland is a solid start with an intriguing story, lots of choices and interesting characters. A bit too light on gameplay, it does manage to make up for it mostly due to its fantastic presentation which masterfully uses graphical effects and music to provide a strong sense of place.","July 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","2"

The twist here is instead of being inside a TV show, you choose your own adventure inside a stage play. This allows for some novel cinematography and very clever, well-paced scene transitions. The mechanics are no different to anything else in the genre, but by embracing the idea of the player being the director rather than an actor, the more tedious walking from point A to B aspects of the genre are removed, which lets you focus on the story.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plot has all the right ingredients - corruption, rednecks, mythology and a down on his luck private ♥♥♥♥ - it never quite comes together. I am not sure if it is the direction of the voice acting or the script itself, but it feels like the characters never really react to one another. The dialog is somehow missing whimsy, given the absurdity of the whole setup. The second and third acts go a bit more in a self-consciously theatrical direction, but it's not enough. That's a bit of a shame, because as mentioned the concept is incredibly strong, and both the set design and the music is excellent. It's definitely worth giving this a playthrough just for the ideas it brings to the table. I look forward to whatever the devs come up with next.","June 4","true","3.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The characters are engaging, if not always likeable, the story is superbly written and the mystery itself enough to make me want to keep digging.\n\nWhen it comes to negative points. If you're after action, or a rich puzzle-filled experience, as some other adventure games showcase, Knee Deep may not be for you. As I'm sure it says in the description somewhere, and probably another review, the game is about choice, dialogue, and character (As I see). The dialogue also falls into a similar problem I found in L.A. Noire (Admittedly a very different game) where the dialogue choices you make may not always be quite clear on the tone you're about to throw at a witness/friend/boss. But all in all, very minor problems.\n\nThe choice of graphical style is quirky, but fits seamlessly into the tone of the story as it's written. Witty dialogue, wacky backdrops, and a story and characters that could really have come from a Florida backwater. With only one playthrough of one act under my belt, I'm sure that Knee Deep is money well spent.","July 7, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

It's artsy and weird in a good way.\nThe gameplay is very simple and streamlined - you just make dialog choices and choose one of 3 spins on the reports you publish. The game even alerts you to when your choices "matter" and then later when the effects of those choices materialize, exposing the inner workings of the game model rather than trying to hide it from you. The game cuts out all the walking around and re-checking the people you might have already talked to for new clues, just takes you straight from one dialog choice to the next. So it feels like you're always driving forward at a fast pace (even though there are no actual time constraints or anything)\nBut there are tons of little details everywhere that really flesh out the world. Random signs people are holding, other set dressing, the way that the characters move as they are transported from one set to the next. The pseudo-theater metaphor really works well. It draws parallels between the limitations of the two genres (see, artsy). There are funny moments that have absolutely nothing to do with the story.\nPlus, you get to play as a girl who says weird non-sequitur stuff *and* a guy with a bloodhound. and also some third guy who's OK.","February 17","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Every choice felt like it truly mattered, even if only in a small way. The characters each had their quirks and felt likeable and the story keeps you guessing. An unwelcome intrusion may have been the few supernatural elements that were poorly explained but hopefully a sequel could explain these as the ending is quite open. I feel the ending may at least have explained what the characters questioning by the agents ended with but not every thing can be explained and it might be best if left to interpretation.

Otherwise, you may be better off watching the game on a YouTube channel.\n\n\nThis game has a really good storyline as mentioned above, and starts off when an actor apperently commits suicide at a small town in Florida. The game portrays itself in a theatre with a really creative way of changing scenes. Throughout the game you realize it has strong hints that the actor who \"suicided\" is similar to Tom Cruise and his love for Scientology. You play three different characters, two of which are reports Romana (who has a quirky personality), and Jack (who tends to be more belligerent). The last character is K.C. who is a detective with a more depressing outlook. Of course the player deicdes how exactly these characters will answer, so their personality can be slightly shifted.  They spend the course of the time trying to figure out if the actor really was suicidal,  or if there is a thicker plot yet to unveil. While it is a drama, there are a lot of comedic scenes that add to the game.\n\nGameplay, this is where the it is hugely lacking. The only things you can do in the game are select conversation options and move your character to a set point. I think I would like it more if you could explore the scenes. But again, its made to  take place in a theatre and looking around scenary may take away from that ideal. There is about two/three puzzles in-game, but they\'re fairly easy to get.  Its pretty idiot-proof to play, as you\'re pretty much just watching a movie.\n\nI wouldn\'t buy this game for full price because I like my gameplay.

This game really excelled at walking the line between bizarre and emotionally-engaging.  Many adventure games which stray into bizarre territory lose me, such as D4.

However, there's enough to hold the game back that I wish there was a neutral thumb.  It's not strictly bad, but there are some serious negatives.\n\nThe game is a select your own branching narrative styled game that follows a murder mystery taking place in the Florida Swamps.  Think Carl Hiaasen like feel if it were a novel.  For the first act of the game it seems to follow this pretty well, a strong drama with some action and black humor to keep things varied.  But the next two acts seem to lose sense of what the game was about and the final act feels like it is rushing to close up all the loose ends the first two acts used to keep us wanting more.\n\nPositives:\n\n+Technical: The game worked just fine on my computer.  No problems to speak of.\n+Soundtrack:  The soundtrack is amazing and easily worth listening to on it's own.  It cements the feel and tone of the game.\n+Time:  If you want a quick play, you can easily knock this game out in a few hours.\n+Sense of Humor:  The game isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.\n+Visual style:  The game looks great and has an original feel thanks to the stage like atmosphere.\n\nNegative:\n\n-Dialogue:  Ranges from "okay" to "please stop talking."\n-Storyline:  Starts strong, but then it seems like it can't decide if it wants to be funny or not.  Rushes into an ending.\n-Time:  If you wanted a longer game, look elsewhere.\n-Characters: While interesting at times, they vary from stereotype to just nonsense.\n-replayability:  few of the choices truly seem meaningful and there is little incentive to play again after the first time.\n\nUltimatly the game isn't worth the $19.99 it has right now.  Wait for it to go on sale and only if this genre of game is something you really love.","May 22","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Really acomplishes atmosphere and story, length is decent as well(I'm halfway thorugh Act 1 at almost 3 hours). So far so good, and will be doing at least a second playhthrough to try different choices..\nAlso, I have to say the music, sounds, & voice acting fits the style pretty well, not messy or anything at all. Another thing to point out is yes, there are a few missed oppertunities here, and I only say that because i felt in some instances they could have done "more", storywise or graphically, but there are enough surprises, especially in the story itself to forgive these minor things, even more in art and sound like I said more than makes up for it..\n**Also, Act 3 releases shortly from time of this review.**","January 7","true","7.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

The story is enjoyable and replayable, with just enough variety as a result of your choices. I think some UI design decisions could have been different (text and interface are almost web 1.0) but all other aspects of design, with particular credit to the level design, are really fun and creative. Looking forward to more by this developer.\n\nWorth mentioning this works with full settings on a Macbook Pro, taking up about 1GB.

Very much a story base game. not much movement or puzzles in it. The only let down is the fact you get some lag during the game, and sometimes during puzzles like fingerprints etc, it bugs out and won't let you switch the pieces that you have your hand on. 7/10 Definitely worth a play if you like Decision based story games!","April 26","true","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","3"

It plays like a distilled Telltale game, where you spend all your time choosing dialogue and investigating, and no time wondering around or exploring.  It's got a backward-looking narravite structure, cutting to police interviews after the fact.  It's tone is somewhat like Twin Peaks, in that it's dark but with a touch of zany comedy.  All in all, it's got a clever premise that the game is a staged play, great environments, and great music.  And it doesn't ovestay it's welcome, which I appreciate, as a time-pressed gamer.","May 1","true","4.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

However, I found myself quickly engrossed in the games quirky and interesting story. If I had to pick one major complaint, it would be the lack of voice acting. I personally wasn't too upset by the omission, but voice would have really helped to advance the characters and add some more color to the setting. I still say that this game is worth a look, if you're into narratively-driven or choiced based games.","September 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I've tried verifying the  games   files, I've made sure i have the latest drivers for my  graphics card and also  have   other  drivers up to date, I make sure  admin priveledges are  checked and have tried it in various compatibility modes, none of which have enabled me to play this game.  Every time I boot it up I get a message  saying  a folder labelled  with a string of numbers has been  placed next to the games executable containing   a crash dump  file an error document and an output log.  The  developer requests  I send t her.\n\n\nHopefully if I do get this game to work I will update this   comment appropriately, especially as out of 64 comments there are only two thumbs down, mine and one that really doesn't say much.  I presume it is my  computer that is at fault as no one else seems to be having the  problems I'm having .
