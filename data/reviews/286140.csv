"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/286140/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","On the 24th, I was sent a letter telling me that Wolves in the Throne Room were holding their farewell concert in Olympia, WA. In order to discover who was truly worthy, fans would be forced to hike the Washington wilderness to find their way to the venue. Only those in tune with nature would arrive in time. I strapped my pack on, filled with enough food and equipment to manage the day-trip, and headed out into the woods near Mt. Rainier. How foolish I was to assume that the few documentaries I watched, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, would have provided me with enough survival information. I spent seven days rolling around the mountainside, vomiting my brains out every time I shoved a handful of assorted berries into my gullet to maintain any level of nutrition, passing out, watching my wound fester and my fever slowly eat at what was left of my humanity. By the time I was finally clear of the wretched disease that addled my body, I was reduced to my bare minimal animal instinct while foaming at the mouth.\n\nIt’s been a hell of a week, let me tell you.\n\nEidolon’s first move is to drop you directly into the game’s world without explaining itself. You are given no goal, no disembodied voice in an earpiece to guide you along a path towards an ending, and no objective marker. Hell, they don’t even give you a map to start with. A scooped out east-Washington valley stretches out in front of you as your red, well, green carpet welcome. For all of the pastel colors and cheery daytime design, Eidolon lets you know from the get go that it is not going to hold your hand in this massive playground. It’s easy to fall into a false sense of warmth and security after a few in-game days. The beautiful sunsets brush a delicate pinkish-orange tint across the trees. Foggy mornings give way to blue skies and occasional rain. The stars come out at night and leave you in awe of the light show. It’s quite jarring to come across the skeletal, wireframe remains of fallen skyscrapers juxtaposed over the lively brush like the violent designs of a Stephen O’Malley album cover.\n\nScattered around the Godless Washington forest are green blocks which will contain everything from maps to letters, copies of tweets or emails, vestiges of the past left behind by owners who are no longer around to see you snooping through their diaries. Everyone has their thoughts on “collect the logs” gameplay, which for some is about the same as “sawing logs,” but Eidolon takes it in stride. Each of the pieces you find has a character it was written by, each with their own unique handwriting and strong personality. Each note is tagged with characters, places, or groups of importance. Clicking on a tag will cause a green shard to point you in the general direction of the next letter that deals with that specific subject. It’s great for this to be such a strong point for the game, as what Eidolon mostly boils down to is looking for the subtle hint on where to find the next letter while trying to stay alive long enough to piece together the entire mystery of why all of humanity appears to have vanished.\n\nThe survival elements are light and unobtrusive, but generally provide enough activity to keep a player idly occupied collecting food or tinder for fires. Several types of wild berries and mushrooms are plentiful but may spoil if not eaten fast enough. In the opening area, you’re given a fishing rod to catch all manner of aquatic life to fry up for dinner. You stumble across a bow and arrow set, as well, for hunting larger game, though this proves to be an extremely risky move. Most pray won’t go down very easy and you’ll have to get very good with the trajectory of the arrow to nail some of the more antsy critters. You’ll need to eat every once in a while to stave off your hunger pangs, sleep regularly to keep your energy levels up, and tend to your wound, should you ever take a large fall or drop your arrow while Smokey the Bear rolls his sleeves up to give you what-for.\n\nHowever, the wound mechanic is a small sore spot for the survival bits. You waste so much time and lose so much food trying to keep yourself nourished while the illness subsides, requiring frequent naps along the way to restore your quickly dwindling energy. Why bother when you can just let death take over and respawn you at one of the few healing checkpoints scattered around the forest? Perhaps such a system may be a suitable punishment for death due to the distances you’d have to cross if you hadn’t seen one for a while.\n\nAfter all, the sense of scale in the game world is utterly massive! I traveled for hours in all directions and only ever found a few barriers. I felt more lost and afraid than in any other large-scale world, as getting lost here meant having no idea where you’d end up when the timberline broke. The developer has, perhaps jokingly, quoted Eidolon’s world as being equal to about “9 square Azeroths”. According to my calculator that is almost as bad at math as I am, that comes out to about "Really ♥♥♥♥ing huge."\n\nWhere Eidolon will no doubt shine for some, there will be many who will not really be down for a walk in the woods. And that’s alright; not every game can satisfy all tastes. Eidolon is a relaxed, almost meditative experience that you can pick up and put down as often as you’d like. There’s a small novella’s worth of story to be dug out from the fractured industrial remnants of mankind. Within, a tale of faith versus science and the lives of dozens of characters as the great cities fell around them. It gets appropriately dark considering that humanity is wiped out by the time you get there. I enjoyed taking a break from reading about paramedics choking out failed suicide victims and crazy youth getting involved in Death culture to just sit around and fish for a while. It gave me a quiet place to collect my thoughts and consider the implications of each scrap of story I uncovered. Thanks to my good friend Richard T. Ionary, I discovered that the word “Eidolon” has two meanings. A ghostly apparition, or an ideal. It was rather rewarding to see how differing human ideals began to clash and, in humanity’s final moments, they all became nothing but ghosts in the sky.\n\nIf you liked this review, check it out at http://rgz.ca/gaming/eidolon-review-a-walk-in-the-woods-and-all-my-friends-are-dead/ as well and see my other reviews.

Only the rolling green hills, groves of forests teeming with wildlife, and icy mountaintops remain all concealing mysteries of the past and the loss of a culture once thriving.\n\nThis civilization long lost, leaving behind only traces of what was once its former glory. The world is now empty as you seek to find answers to your past.\n\nBroken images and entities before you, a fox greets you from afar and you give chase only to see it dissapear behind a tree seconds later. Are these visions of what once was, or are they simply the ramifications of your lost and wandering mind? This is a truly psychological undertaking.\n\nUsing my newly scavenged tinder I pitch a fire by the bend of a flowing creek, the eyes of nearby deer watching me gaze up at the stars and clouds rolling by. Dawn breaks through the treetops and the singing of birds is heard, I've survived another cold night alone in these woods and can continue my exploration. Eidolon is a genuinely natural experience, it is the closest experience to nature you'll find in any form of interactive entertainment.\n\nDespite living in the West Coast most of my life I have never had the pleasure of visiting Washington but did grow up camping in the wilderness of Big Sur and Santa Cruz and the feelings evoked by this game really bring me back to those places. Based on discussions between the developer and play testers the transcribing of the wooded lands are depicted very accurately - accurate enough to have playtesters' journey tracked on a real world map\n\nMassive landscapes reach out endlessly past the horizon providing several hours of exploration in any one direction, and is fleshed out with several more hours of narrative-rich collectables in the form of documents, articles, and lovingly crafted writings of the people who previously called Western Washington their home. Their fate is yours to discover.\n\nThe shift from day to night is gradual and realistic, drawing you into your surroundings through bright pink-orange hues of the sunset to the pitch black dead of night lit only by the vibrant and beautiful stars above. The land you travel is authentic in its portrayal, there's an obvious amount of devotion and love put into details.\n\nNothing repeats and nothing overstays its welcome, you are constantly on the move into new lands to discover new histories. Evolving and changing with the scenery around you is the melancholy and serene soundtrack, utilizing a wide array of wood and stringed instruments that encompass the natural wonder you find yourself in. Before even starting Eidolon I was taken aback by the very subdued sounds being reminded almost of the backdrop to a Jim Jarmusch film, giving me vibes of Neil Young's improvised soundtrack for the Old West-themed Dead Man with its subterranean guitar twangings.\n\nUpon questioning one of the developers on the origin of Eidolon's incredible, massive, and evolving soundtrack I learned that the masterpiece had been composed by a full-time English instructor at Western Washington University, from which several of the development team had recently graduated from. By some fluke, the man that had apparently taught these developers about game design in the first place ended up making this engrossing soundtrack for their first commercial game, and what a soundtrack it is. This shows that Eidolon comes from very personal and very human roots, and with a background in professionalism and academics.\n\nThe first reaction from fans of the explorative genre of games will be quick to compare Eidolon to the likes of Dear Esther or Proteus, but the similarities stop right at the visuals. This is clearly a much grander experience and manages to shed the ill-perceived "walking-simulator" tag by providing much more than simply taking in your surroundings.\n\nThis is a living breathing world, your actions have consequences and your survival depends on your alertness, foraging, and hunting capabilities. History and culture is all around you and only needs to be discovered for the bigger picture to become clear.","August 1, 2014","true","16.1"," 185 of 225 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","185","225","0","4"

You more or less walk around, as the game description says, a massive post-human Western Washington. The art style is simple but effective and evokes the feeling of the great outdoors. It's nice to stand atop a hill and look out towards the sprawling landscape, often rendered in eerie mist, drifting cloud or scattered rainfall. You may run across the odd animal scampering across the forest floor.\n\nYou will occasionally run across various documents and writings that reveal the game's backstory, which is quite interesting and leads one to think about what might have happened. My main complaint is that the game environment is very sparse and there are very few things that you can interact with, and it doesn't appear that you can build anything. While I appreciate that it's not supposed to be Minecraft or a survival horror, the lack of interactivity starts to grate after a while. Much of the structures appear in that bland, proceduarlly generated way that have little meaning or depth. It all feels a little like window dressing. A little more structure in terms of directing the player and telling a more cohesive story would likely have helped. All in all it feels like Eidolon is a game with a decent skeleton but a lack of any real depth. More content and/or player engagement would certainly tip my hand to recommending it.\n\nIf you're the type of person who enjoys making up their own story and exploring for the sake or exploring (without necessarily finding anything, interacting with your environment or being rewarded for it), you might well enjoy the game. I'd sum it up as a sandbox without any toys.","August 2, 2014","false","3.2"," 232 of 313 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","232","313","0","9"

It doesn't present you with any formalised tasks or goals, which I assume accounts for the mixed reviews, but if you're prepared to explore a large environment and piece together the story of what happened there from scattered texts, Eidolon is rewarding and fascinating. The survival elements are rudimentary enough that they don't make up the majority of what you're doing (And I feel like they are there more because of expectation than because they are integral to the design), and leave you mostly to explore and find your way around. I get that this is not what everyone wants from a game, but I got a lot out of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tentonsofcheese/recommended/286140/","tentonsofcheese","Furious George","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tentonsofcheese/","251 products in account","I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It's pretty (for 2003), expansive (enormous and empty), has a good story (chopped up and scattered over literally hundreds of square miles of identical forest), and has a nice blend of exploration and exposition (gimmicky survival elements slapped over a walking simulator).\n\nJoking aside, I honestly can't recommend this game to a wide audience. Yes, it has a good story, one that is leagues better than that of a lot of modern games, but even though that story is so interesting, the method of actually uncovering the story is painfully dull. I do like it when a game rewards exploration, and I love it when a game will focus on story rather than the old tried-and-true 'shoot anything that's not the same color as you', but the massive amount of story (150+ items, or so I hear) is diluted so badly by the amount of walking you need to do to find them that even though I was hooked, I couldn't come back to it after a while because finding another thread of the story was not worth holding down my shift and W keys (yes, I know there are auto-walk and auto-run settings, but don't you think that's a symptom of the problem?) for another half hour, occasionally stopping to click on story fragments to watch the green flare point to the next story fragment or eat some fish.\n\nIt seems like Eidolon is trying to marry purely story/exploration based games like Kentucky Route Zero and solo survival games like The Forest, and I can't say I'm a huge fan of what resulted from it. The survival mechanics are barebones, but in such a way that it's not an added challenge to survive a day, more of just an added 'collect these unrelated items to continue' minigame. I won't rip on survival mechanics being unrealistic, they're minimalistic and that's understandable, but it seems like it's too easy to survive. All you need to be able to run for a day is two cooked fish, that's it, and after you find the fishing rod, you can get fish within about a minute or two of walking from nearly any point on the map. In fact, the only ways to die are starving (via illness or stubbornness), falling to your death, getting mauled by a bear (I never saw one), and freezing to death. If you don't jump off cliffs continuously, catch more than one fish a day or press E every time you see a prompt come up for mushrooms or berries, and don't stand in water for too long, you won't die. It's more of an added chore than an added challenge.\n\nThe art design is sort of a balance between 'minimalistic' and 'lazy', with everything in the game rendered with solid-color polygons, which in the right circumstances can be quite pretty, but most of the time is just bland. For the lazy part, some of the design is just cutting corners. If you're not within 30 yards of a fox, deer, or other animal, they either stand stock-still like a statue or glide around in the same pose a few inches off the ground. Objects are almost always half in the ground, half floating in the air since they don't really account for local geometry. Skyscraper remnants are strangely even more low-res than the rest of the game, with blurry, off-color edges.\n\nThe rest of the game is quite well executed, though, the story is intriguing and engaging, the music is appropriately minimalistic and atmospheric, and the game occasionally has moments where I need to stop and take a screenshot. However, unless you're a fan of walking very long distances to read single pages of books, I can't recommend this game to you. I think that the story would probably be better executed as a collection of vignettes and the rest of the game as a minimalist but immersive and difficult survival game, but that's just me.","April 25, 2015","false","2.8"," 81 of 102 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","81","102","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddmutation/recommended/286140/","oddmutation","Mei Mutant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddmutation/","3312 products in account","“It’s a great, well written survival game”, I was told by someone trying to get attention towards the title. This isn’t a survival game. It has survival elements, but the general mood of the game isn’t survival. What Eidolon is though, is a walking simulator pushed to the extremes.\n\nYou begin in the woods with nothing, and you just start… Walking.\n\nAnd walking.\n\nAnd walking.\n\nUntil you see a cube, it’ll either be green or white. If it’s white, you get a tool to aid your survival. If it’s green, you will get a page or two to various stories that are scattered across the vast landscape.\n\nThe tools add up, but you’re not spending most of your time working to survive, or even thinking about it. Food is plenty and it takes a rather long fall to injure yourself, and if you do, you’ll still heal over time. Animals are scared of you and I’m never witnessed an attack on my 4 hour playthrough.\n\nWhat you will be doing, is walking.\n\nAnd walking.\n\nAnd walking.\n\nAnd hopefully you’ll come across another cube.\n\nNow, the green cubes seem to be the purpose of the game. The stories they hold are really well written, some are captivating while others depressing and melancholic. From brain damaged cultists to people just trying to survive whatever happened, the stories draw you in and makes you want to read more.\n\nNow, you can find tags under said bits of stories to generate a green spectre that will point you to the next part of the story, but that’s about it in what the game tells the player to do. And even though it will point you in the right direction, they never indicate how long the trek is, and they can be long. Super long.\n\nIt’s vastness may be the biggest thing I have against it. Now the idea of exploring a vast landscape is a great one, I grew up on a farm that owned 100 acres of forest, most of my childhood was spent exploring these woods, discovering things that resided in it.\n\nBut Ice Water games have stretched themselves a bit thing to make this landscape so vast. I can dig a simple art style, but it’s concern about the big things result in a lack of detail in the little things. Flat surfaces and large, tall trees make up so much of the land and it’s lack of threat results in being unable to “believe” these woods.\n\nAlthough everything is not all like that. Once you find the desolate highway and blown out buildings, the game picks up a bit. The density of story cubes increases and the landscape gets interesting as you traverse through these ruins of modern civilization.\n\nI also should mention the music, the music is great. It sets the tone better than the artwork, from rustic acoustic guitars to roaring electronics, they tremendously help add the mood to your journey and the stories you find within.\n\nSo overall, it can be a interesting experience. But it can also be a monotonous one. Don’t get into the story expecting the game to immediately point you to what you need to do. The stories you’ll read are great, and some will even motivate you to trek miles for the next piece. But the game could have really benefited from being less vast and instead try to be a little more dense.\n\n6/10","November 1, 2014","true","5.7"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","57","67","5","0"

I really like the concept, but I might have done a few things differently on the execution.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to give a little overview of the kind of game this is:\nEidolon plays fairly simply as games go.  It takes place sometime in the future (it is not clear exactly how far).  You wake up somewhere deep in the forest in Washington and you need to explore to find out where you are and what happened to the place you are exploring. This is done by walking. Lots of walking.  Lots and LOTS of VERY repetitive walking.  Thankfully the developer did include a way to push a key for auto-walk so my "W" finger didn't get too tired.  Still though... you walk incredibly slow and the map basically covers all of the greater Seattle area including the Olympic Penninsula... and while it may not be "to scale" it certainly feels like it due to the time it takes to get from place to place. It would seem like the gameplay is meant to feel immersive and realistic, although the graphics are very artistic and simple due for the most part I'd imagine to this being an indie game that is meant to be able to run on a lot of computer systems (did I mention the HUGE map size?)  I'm sure there were other creative reasons for the particular graphical style chosen, but I won't get into that really... it suits the game fine and it doesn't need to be "realistic" to get the appropriate feeling across to the player.\n\nOkay, back to the gameplay... near your starting position you can find a few items to help you in your journey: a compass, binoculars, bow & arrows, and a fishing rod.  All these items are useful in either staying alive, or finding "clues".  The items and clues both appear in the form of flashing orbs that float above the ground: white for items, green for clues.  Clues can be either a map of a portion of the game area (usually in a hand-drawn style) or snippets of paper letters, notes, or sometimes photos of events or people that have been in the area before you but are now gone.  I don't want to give away any of the contents of the clues in the explanation of the game-play, so I won't say more about them.  Instead lets focus on the process of obtaining said clues.  These glowing orbs you will find clustered all over the map... there are a LOT of them.  Each one has a link at the bottom that, when activated, sends some flashy lights flying off into the sky in the direction of more clues that touch on that subject.  Unfortunately, you will spend the majority of the time playing this game in-between clues just walking from place to place.  It starts to feel very tedious after a few hours... Did I mention the HUGE map size?\n\nOkay, sorry, getting distracted again... So clearly finding these clues is the driving motivation behind playing this game.  I actually really enjoyed the part about discovering the history of the area and what happened to make it so different.  There are some very well thought out stories explaining the events that took place that "ruined civilization" (I don't think that's giving away too much... I'm still trying to keep this "spoiler-free")  So now I'm finally going to go into the part of the game I wasn't so satisfied with: In order to travel from place to place you obviously have to traverse the natural envirionment.  You can sprint, which I highly recommend because walking is PAINFULLY slow, but only until you get tired and have to sleep, and sleeping makes you hungry when you wake up.  So, aside from a lot of walking, which I think I've mentioned a few times now, you will also have to gather food and eat it to keep yourself from starving, one of two ways that I think you can die in this game.\n\n(Quick disclaimer: I haven't tried dying to see what happens yet... not sure if you lose all progress or what.)\n\nThere is plenty of food to find in the game, though the bow & arrow was next to useless as you can't aim with it well enough to hit a moving target. Despite that, I didn't have trouble finding enough food to keep me from starving. The other way you can die is by freezing, which is fairly easy to avoid so long as you stay out of the water and don't climb any mountains. You can swim in water for a short period, but if you stay in too long I assume you die of hypothermia.\n\nIn the wilderness you also have to avoid predators... they will attack if you come too close or try to shoot them, which brings me to my biggest gripe of this game: wounds. Unlike most "survival" games where you have a health bar of some kind, Eidolon instead has a kind of system where whenever something bad happens (eg. you fall from a height or get mauled by a predator) you pass out for a few hours and wake up with a "serious wound" which either heals over time... or doesn't. This happened to me several times while playing and kinda caused me to stop eventually. I think there is nothing wrong with the system of getting hurt... that keeps with the realism of the game and the seriousness of surviving in the environment.  My issue really stems from the system for getting BETTER. When a wound gets better on its own you don't have anything to worry about... however when it becomes infected, it won't go away.  In addition, it causes you to become "ill" which wastes a lot of your food becuase you can never stop being hungry, and makes you have to sleep a LOT (which uses up even more food). Most of the time you have a "festering wound," you will be ill. When this finally happened to me from falling off a ledge in the game, I nearly quit on the spot... however I wanted to see if there was a way to heal the wound, as it says something about "put an antibacterial on it" in the game interface. After hunting around the steam forums I found a post that was somewhat helpful... it said there was an item called "honey" in the game that you supposedly find in beehives up in the trees that will work. Only one person had ever found it by the looks of it, but if it does exist in the game, I never could find out where.  There was only one other thing in the game that can cure wounds, and that is a special swamp. I happened to have found said swamp earlier in my exploration because it is not too far from where you start the game, but it contains some warm "brown" water with floating will-o-the-wisp lights over it that miraculously cures all wounds and illness instantly... this would be great except that when my wound became infected, I was probably about a 5 hour walk away to the north (this swamp was in the south-east end of the map).  And did I mention that you have to eat a LOT more when you're ill? That means stopping to fish or collect berries almost constantly, and then you have to keep sleeping so you can continue running instead of walking, because lets just say a 5 hour run is a lot longer when you're limited to walking. So needless to say I just wasn't up to the time commitment. I had to finally resort to console commands to try and free myself of the festering wound.\n\nI am probably almost out of space here, but I didn't really get to mention the day/night cycle with weather... It goes from foggy in the morning to clear in the afternoon, to dark at night... with rain mixed in a lot. Which is accurate to the region, but it makes the exploration really annoying when you can't see where you're going half the time.\n\nAlso, there were a few bugs... mostly things that break immersion like floating grass and stuff, and campfires cast no light on the surrounding terrain. Nothing major.\n\nThe only part about this game that really feels broken to me is the inability to cure wounds that become infected.  If you're going to say "put something antibacterial on it" and then give a decent percentage of the inflicted wounds infections... PUT MORE ANTIBACTERIAL ITEMS IN THE GAME! Seriously! If beehives do exist, they should be a LOT more common. It is a critical design flaw, in my opinion.","January 3, 2015","false","10.4"," 71 of 92 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","71","92","4","2"

You'll love it if you enjoy a variety of interesting storylines, lore and exploration over a massive world that you can relax in, with a beautiful soundtrack to boot, or you'll hate it as one of those "Walking simulators" with not much to do and survival elements that are weak, if I'm being honest.\n\nIt's a good game that could have been made better with more raw gameplay, perhaps being able to scavenge things from the ruins like sheet metal to build shelters and a temperature system so that you could keep warm at night.

I'll say this; the story is not what you'd expect and is full of surprises that I'm still discovering, and it's quite deep at times as are some of the characters in them. The notes are spotted as floating green orbs that you walk up to, and you can find more by following the bird that flies above you or clicking on a story piece in your journal and following the green light from that. I would have liked them to be found through searching drawers or in the boots of cars, though I understand why it's done this way. Some of them are hard to read though, so a more 'plain text' version that you could have switched to would've helped. There's also a journal that you can write in and keep track of things, which is a very nice touch.\n\nThere are tools in the game as well, things like fishing poles and binoculars, although you only find them as floating white orbs, which is one of the things that could have been done better with crafting or scavenging.\n\nThe graphics are very... minimalist, and they actually grew on me. When I bought the game, I did worry about the graphics not being too detailed, but like minecraft's graphics they actually work for the game, though I can still imagine the world being real. Perhaps all too real at times. Standing atop a tall hill and overlooking the rolling forests and ruined cities is actually quite incredible if you find the right place, and the music completes it. The only thing I don't like about it are the animals; they look a little bit derpy at times.\n\nThe soundtrack; oh dear, where to begin? There are dozens and dozens of tracks in the game, all of them suited to different places, there's a theme and ambient version for each place and one track for day and night. Some are quite melancholic and others are strangely upbeat or tribal, even sci-fi sounding at times. It's all very ambient and there are no combat tracks or anything too fast paced. They work for the game fantastically and I'd recommend buying the soundtrack for yourselves off of Bandcamp if you like Ambient, or perhaps Wilderness Ambient?\n\nI think having more dangerous animals scattered about would have been nice, I'm not sure why there aren't bears or wolves living in the ruins. Just something to make the game feel more 'alive', like it really is all abandoned and nature is reclaiming it.\n\nOverall, Eidolon is a game I would recommend if you don't mind walking long distances to collect more pieces of the story and if you enjoy lots of story and lore, as well as plenty of deep thinking and wonderful music. If you're looking for a survival game like The Long Dark, this is not it, nor is it a combat focused game. The only game that comes to mind as being similar is Dear Esther, although the two are still different. A good game that could have been a lot more, but it's got just enough to keep me going and has been one of the most inspiring games I've played in my life, hands down.","September 3, 2015","true","20.5"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

There are almost none that focus on it exclusively.\n\nEidolon has a few token survival elements - you need to eat, you can't leap off cliffs, and you can only spend so much time in freezing water - but they're window dressing. If you want mechanic or systemic challenge, look elsewhere.\n\nInstead, Eidolon is a meditative exploration of a landscape. As a native of the Seattle area, it perfectly captures the sense of scale of our forests - dense yet empty, far sightlines from our mountains muddied by constant clouds and fog. The story uses the "fragmented narrator" method popularizied by System Shock to tell the story of this largely post-human world.\n\nAnd it's slow. You will spend many minutes walking between finding notes or bits or narrative. You will get lost, and need to use your natural sense of landmarks, a compass, and a few maps to find where you are.\n\nBut there's nothing else like it, and it's one of the best before-bed games I've ever found; contemplative, calming, yet thought-provoking.","January 18, 2015","true","15.1"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","0"

I would NOT recommend this game if I didn't know what are they aiming for, personally I didn't quite enjoy it. If you're expecting a survival experience à lá DayZ or The Forest you should not buy Eidolon. If you're looking for a relaxing experience after a long day of work this might be for you. The world feels huge, actually too large to the point where you sometimes need a break from all the running aimlessly. You start without any specific goal, this is where I think the game struggles to keep the player interested, until you discover something like a compass, binoculars or a note. But before that happen it might take a while.\nThe art style is one you either love or hate, I enjoy it and at times it provides beautiful landscapes to screenshot and use it as your desktop wallpaper. The sound is, in my opinion, poor. The game relies a lot on the sound given the simple aesthetics. It needs more work, the music is poor and repetitive, the sounds are also lacking. Should the game had better sound work and the atmosphere would have a much bigger impact.\n\nPros\n- the geometrical aesthetics, the art style, it's unique\n- it's a relaxing experience\n- the world is huge...\n\nCons\n- ...but there's isn't that MUCH to do in it.\n- the sound, is my biggest complain\n- at times you feel like you're running aimlessly for hours\n- if there is a crafting system I haven't found it, would make the game better and also with more to do, sometimes I just don't feel like picking anything over the fact that there's not much to do with it","August 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","56","81","0","3"

I can understand how some people got bored with it, but, for the right people this game will grab ahold of you and not let go. At times, there is a zen-like, meditative calm in which you float thru this homely yet alien world, untouched by the ruination. At times there is the feeling of utter desolation and fear, even anger at the long dead people who have left you so alone, One night I huddled against the overhang of a ruin, hiding behind the firelight. The next day, I climbed a mountain and stood alone, open to the world watching the sun rise and set and the rain, fog and clouds swirled around me. With no clue as to who or what I am, I vacillate between a noble phantom and low, mean, wild beast. *ahem* Not many games make you wax poetic like this. Not  many games achieve beauty with minimalistic graphics.  And once you get past all that, there are the stories....the eidolons (that word means spirit, soul, phantom). You can follow one at a time or wander freely. I've by no means found them all. I believe that will take a very long time. Yet, the glimpses you catch of lives long vanished are so engaging and enigmatic that you are driven to find more. There must be an explanation among these far-flung eidolons.\nAs for the practicalities, you can negotiate with compass and map, or let the terrain and foraging guide you. Both are rewarding enough. The basic survival tools are easy enough to acquire in the first few minutes if you keep your eyes open. There is no combat, unless you count shooting a deer or running from predators. The survival part of the game is basic common sense. Stay warm, dry, fed and rested. Armed with a fishing pole and a brain, this should prove quite easy.\nTLDR: Just buy it if you've ever enjoyed a poem and don't expect FPS killkillkill constant stimulation.","February 19, 2015","true","14.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","2"

(Don't worry about the metacritic review. Some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ click down on it a bunch of times.)\n\nLet me just start off saying this game is beautiful...you climb a mountain to build a fire and wake up to a snowy wonderland surrounding you. And as one of the people who helped optimize the game I can tell you that the devs take suggestions, and usually respond to you.\n\nGameplay: 9/10. Mostly you are running around explororing, but sometimes you stumble across orbs. Pick them up, and start a story of someone who was in the wasteland. The controls are quite easy, and not too many so don't worry. Also, you feel a nice feeling running through a Pacific North-west forest while listening to beautiful, nicely polished music.\n\n\n\nGraphics: 9.5/10. Is it just me, or do you love the look of these graphics? It totally suits the game.\n\n\nHunting Mechanics: 7.5/10. The hunting is simple, something I was expecting, the only problem though. The fishing poles and hunting bows are not 3D. So you are basically using paper tools, and you cannot retrieve your arrows. The fishing, is also too easy so I hope they make it harder to fish, and hopefully they make it so you have to set up your fishing rod and make arrows and find bait.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10. I reccomend this game to anyone who wants a soulful, beautiful gaming experience and likes exploreration games.","October 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/286140/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","How did I end up spending more than twenty hours in a walking simulator? I guess a large part of it can be attributed to the mystery. Eidolon is a game that doesn't spoon-feed you anything at all.\n\nYou're dropped into the massive forests modeled after Western Washington, USA, with no equipment or directions of any kind. Soon enough you'll find some rudimentary survival gear and some documents left behind by people that came before. These documents, which range from personal letters to posters and diaries, detail the happenings of the area spanning an era of hundreds of years.\n\nAnd that's basically Eidolon - One document leads to another, that one to yet another, or maybe to a completely different story strand. There are about twenty different stories containing well more than a hundred pages total to find, all adding their distinctive perspective to the overall picture. How much of it will be uncovered is left to the player - as far as I can gather, Eidolon doesn't really reach any kind of a conclusion, even though all of the individual stories eventually will.\n\nWithout revealing too much, Eidolon deals with subjects like posthumanism, transhumanism, mortality and what it means to be a human in the first place. The stories are well written and quite thought-provoking, as they should be, since they're the sole force propelling the player forwards through the vast stretches of wilderness.\n\nEidolon requires a rare kind of patience. "Vast" only begins to describe the distances required to be crossed in search for the next scrap of history. It isn't just that the play area is absolutely huge, it's the lack of reliable maps and the presence of large, uncrossable bodies of water that will frequently require you to take the long way around and sometimes even backtrack several hours worth of wandering.\n\nWhether it's all worth it depends on the player. There's really not much actual gameplay in Eidolon - you need to occasionally forage, fish & hunt to keep yourself nourished, but the game isn't actively out to get you unless you get foolhardy. I found myself doing a lot of thinking and soul-searching while trekking, pondering about more than just the lives of the people on the paper. Eidolon evokes a profound sense of isolation, loneliness and melancholy that lingers.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is further cemented by the excellent post-rock/ambient soundtrack that I count among the very best in gaming. Graphics are extremely simplified and minimalist yet frequently beautiful, unless you look at things up close. Technically the game does have some problems, ranging from flickering polygons and hitches while loading terrain to more serious issues like getting stuck and falling through the world geometry. Despite these issues, I found the narrative strong enough to keep on exploring.\n\nIt's clear that Eidolon is a product of a singular vision with no input from focus groups or marketing forces. It demands a lot of your time - maybe too much for most - but for people like me with too much time on their hands anyway and a penchant for self-reflection, Eidolon can prove to be a very fulfilling experience.

Next to this were several giant wireframe takeout boxes that I took to be toppled skyscrapers. That was all.\nI saw a fox once, found a few glowing orbs, picked berries for some reason. All of these things combined constituted about 1% of my time playing, the rest was spent walking to the damn things.

A specific girl. One that I have a mega crush on. Let's call her Felicity, although that's not her real name. I had thought I had been pocketing hints that she liked me too, but I wasn't sure. I needed to think. So I open up my favorite game of the year, Eidolon, because I sometimes find myself lost in insightful thought when I play. I glance around and find myself in Bellevue. In the distance, I can see a document, flashing like a lighthouse in the middle of a hurricane. I walk over to it and pick it up. It's the first document in the Cultist storyline. I won't spoil anything, but I kept reading all the documents until the stream ran dry. I played some more so I could muddle over what I had read. I put both myself and my crush in the perspective of the girl who wrote the documents, and out of this I found some valuable insight. If Felicity really liked me, then, if she was in the same position as the fictional girl, what would she want Jon-Saint Pierre (or me) to do, or what would she want to happen in general? I came to the conclusion that she would probably want Pierre to keep hanging out with her and talking with her, and eventually want to hear from one of her friends that Jon loved her. So, I put this nefound knowledge to work. I kept conversing with Felicity for a little while and offering extremely subtle hints and flirts. After a little while, it was time to make a move. I chose a friend of mine who was very unreliable and would probably tell Felicity the first chance she got if she found out. Let's call her Sally. That's not her real name, but I know most of you know a Sally. I told her that I liked Felicity, and sure enough, the next day she told her. A confrontation went down between Felicity and I. She said that she liked me too and would like to catch a movie with me sometime. We've been dating for about a week now, and so far so good.\n\nI ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.\n\nTL;DR: The Cultist storyline gave me valuable advice on a girl I liked, and now I'm not single anymore.\n\nPart II: The Review\n\nFirst of all, Eidolon is NOT a survival game. It does have some basic survival mechanics, but if you are thinking of buying this game for gameplay similar to Rust and The Long Dark, look somewhere else. But, if you want a beautiful work of art to display in your Steam library, then buy this game.\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about Eidolon. An important thing to mention is that EVERY SINGLE INCH OF THIS GAME IS WORTH A SCREENSHOT.  I have dedicated a folder in my computer and an entire imgur album to my photography. It really makes me wish I lived there. Oh yeah that's right I do. Suckers.\n\nEidolon is also a masterpiece of literature. I think the devs said somewhere that there were over 40 intertwining storylines that contain a myraid of documents in each one. And ♥♥♥♥ gets really crazy. REALLY crazy. The writing is beautiful, and I can only imagine how crazy Ice Water's office looks like with that giant bulletin board covered with pictures and documents and lines connecting them in a huge spiderweb. It only takes a few pieces to understand how hard the devs worked on this game.\n\nThe game is also HUGE. I have yet to actually measure it, but I imagine that it's a little bigger than GTA V, which is 49 sq. miles in area. Skyrim was 16 sq. miles. But, that record shouldn't remain for long because the folks down at Outerra are making a game engine that literally generates full-scale planets. Google it.\n\nSo yeah. Eidolon is basically a child of Proteus and Gone Home, with a little bit of a Rust, stripped of all of its more complex survival mechanics until its at its basics; hunting, gathering, hunger and health stauses and a little extra coldness status because it's Western Washington. But, Eidolon is not for everyone. If you absolutely love to play fast paced games, are 12 years old or less or you have ADD (on second thought, you might like this game if you have ADD), then you probably wouldn't enjoy this game too much. But, if you own a good amount of slower paced games, like games with good amounts of exploration and especially if you liked Gone Home and/or Proteus - even just a little bit - , then buy this game.\n\nTL;DR: Eidolon is a masterpiece of both visual and literate art, candy-coated in survival mechanics and a massive open world to explore.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nMade me go outside today\n9.8/10 GOTY","October 6, 2014","true","46.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","15","21","6","5"

There will be moments where you reach a new place and you'll just stare at the screen at awe. You will find well-written documents that will wave together a remarkably rich, sad, and inspiring story.\n\nUnfortunately, you will mostly be bored. The game is far, far, far too slow. How slow? Think that reaching the next location can take 45 minutes. Sure, it's a beautiful ride to get there, but actually the scenery is not so diverse, and it will get boring. With a game so focused on nature, there really should have been more than three kinds of trees and shrubs.\n\nThe slowness is exacerbated by a raw navigation system that will not let you easily plan your journey, so that you will surely have to go back and revisit places you've already been. Since it can take 45 minutes to get to them ... you may find yourself looking up a cheat code for faster travel (and it still will take a very long time!), or just quitting and heading to the wiki to read the rest of the documents and get the whole story.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, there is a terrible "survival" system that is an entirely unnecessary addition to the gameplay. It's charming for the first 10 minutes, but then it's just a bother. I wish, instead, that there was a good navigation system.\n\nA wonderful idea, and I did thoroughly enjoy some moments in the game, but the execution would have benefited from more development.","May 21","false","7.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Everything about that is right up my alley, so this is probably the best game purchase I've made in the past year. I can understand how the gameplay style might bore or frustrate some players; and while the survival aspect is less than frantic, if you make a wrong move or two, it can also be brutally unforgiving.\n\nEidolon is a relaxed game and has been described pretty aptly as a "walking simulator." You simply roam the vast landscape (really vast) seeking to piece together the story of what happened to the people who once lived in the area in an apocalyptic scenario and its aftermath. You can follow specific story lines from one clue to the next as you discover them, or you can just explore freestyle.\n\nThe graphics are minimalist, but in my opinion they are gorgeous and beautifully successful at evoking the character of the Pacific Northwest. I rarely find myself being critical of the graphics. This is good for people playing on less-than-beefy computers, as the game isn't terribly taxing on resources.\n\nStaying alive in Eidolon is just a matter of eating enough and avoiding sickness or injury. There is really no crafting to speak of, and no building. Mushrooms, berries, and fish (after you cook it) are your staples; it's also possible to hunt for meat if you find a bow and arrow, but this is really difficult and I've only had one successful kill after a lot of trying. You can collect tinder to build campfires. Wounds from fall damage and aggressive animals (wolves, bears) are the main sources of injury, and eating spoiled food or freezing are the main ways in which you can be injuried, as well as from wounds which fester. You *don't* want to get sick from a wound -- the situation can get really dire quite fast.\n\nI've only found one bizarre bug in several hours of gameplay, and that was a deer that got stuck in the side of a hill at the very beginning of my game and couldn't seem to get out. The animal AI behavior is a little "blocky" and unnatural, but I didn't find this to be a serious problem since interaction with animals is pretty rare on the whole.\n\nThings I love about Eidolon:\n- Sparse graphic style and massive open world work well together in this particular context\n- The documents and maps that you find are beautifully designed and rendered\n- The writing with respect to the characters and their stories is excellent, some of the best I've seen in a game\n- Soundtrack and audio are atmospheric and appropriate to the game\n- The survival mechanics are not unnecessarily cerebral and convoluted just for the sake of being fancy, and are fairly realistic, e.g., it's a low-key piece of cake until something awful happens and then you're f****d.\n\nImprovements I would suggest:\n- A slightly (not greatly) more involved system for hunting and fishing. As-is, it's so basic and easy as to be unrewarding, particularly the fishing.\n- The graphics for manmade structures are not up to par with the graphics for natural flora and fauna; the discrepancy is pretty damn glaring at times.\n- A more nuanced system for moving from one story clue to the next. The clairvoyant "Now that I've seen this, I magically know to go *this* way" thing is a cop-out; a little more intensive writing and design centered around the maps and documents themselves would be more realistic and engaging. This was the only aspect of the game that broke my sense of immersion.\n- Some reviewers have suggested that the game needs more density of interactivity overall; while I agree that this wouldn't hurt, the sparseness and slow pace are part of the game's basic aesthetic and I wouldn't want to see that sacrificed for the sake of giving bored people "more to do." So maybe a few more interaction possibilities, but just a few.\n- I also think this game could benefit from a slightly more involved cooking system, such as the ability to make a few different basic campfire recipes with different special properties or bonuses for the player (cold resistance, movement speed bonus, healing bonus, that sort of thing).\n\nIn short: one of the best games of its kind, and an awesome experience if you're into the genre and don't require a constant life-and-death struggle or lots of shiny, flashy things to keep you involved in a game. Kudos to the producers of Eidolon!","January 5, 2015","true","44.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weird_vector/recommended/286140/","weird_vector","rh. Lox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weird_vector/","209 products in account",""Do you recommend this game?", Steam asks me and for once I honestly don't know which button to choose. I like Eidolon, I really do. But I'm not able to play it anymore, after just a couple of hours. I have nothing against walking simulators. But this... this is pushing the idea to the limit. The area is vast. Any kind of map is hard to come by and it's mostly just fragmentary and vague. The only kind of hint can show you only what direction to go in order to get another random piece of narration. With no word as to whether it will take you one minute or one hour to get there, it's not really all that helpful in the long run.\n\nOn to the positives: the story is interesting and told in a way that suits the idea behind this game. Together with the overall feeling of the game it puts the player in a very specific mood. You really feel lonely in this empty, strange-yet-familiar world as you try to discover its past. This atmosphere is the best thing that Eidolon has to offer. Visuals are a matter of taste - it's clear that not a lot of priority was put on them in the development process. If solid color polygons are something you can't stand, it's not for you. There are moments, however, when the game is simply beautiful. The night sky with its myriads of stars is quite stunning and effects such as fog or sunset/sunrise light work wonders even with such simple graphics. The soundtrack is pretty, but it gets repetitive after a while. Oh, and the game has some sort of survival system. It's very simple and easy, but at least it makes up for some slight alteration from the usual "walk, walk more, and then walk yet some more" routine.\n\nEven with all its flaws, I enjoyed this game when I still had the patience for it. It's peaceful and works well with the right attitude - I would strongly recommend to play it at night, with nothing to distract and enough time not to hurry anywhere. That being said, I usually like this kind of games but couldn't get very far in this one. I've just had enough after some time. So in the end, do I recommend it? I clicked "Yes". But only, ONLY if you know what you're getting yourself into and are okay with it. It's a very specific game for very specific kind of gamers.","September 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

You see, I was born, raised and currently live in Washington. While I have travelled and lived all over the US, I came back here because I LOVE THIS F***ING STATE! I will never leave it, except to visit other places, again. I love this place, and I spend a lot of time wandering around the backwoods and old growth forests (yes, we actually have real forests here) of Washington. The Northwest itself is pretty cool, but Washington's beauty and live and let live mentality overrides anywhere else Ive been.\n\nSo with that said, the review:\n\nIf you are from Washington, this game is worth getting because its set here, in some weird post-human land. But natural landmarks are recognizable. The first time I saw Mt. Rainier I was like wow cool. Theres also a neat story. Its medatative to wander through the wilderness, finding scraps of stories and piecing together what happened.\n\nIts also got a tiny bit of a survival aspect. You have to hunt and eat, you can get wounds or ill. Thats cool. There are also items you can find (a bow, fishing pole, ect) to help you on your journey. the art style is great, kind of pseudo-realistic. It works. The music is medatative and fits the state of the game and world.\n\nNow the bad. IMHO, there isnt enough to do. Its a walking simulator. Now I know the focus on the game is more the exploration instead of survival. Im not one of those games that needs constant high-stimulation of multiplayer FPSes or anything, but it just feels empty. Its cool when you find something, a story, a map, a landmark. But I had visions of being able to see (at least from a distance) the ruins of the cities around here, of the I-5 corridor or something. A lot of it, you spend wandering through endless rolling woods and mountains, ocassionally shooting at a deer or stumbling across a journal or hut left by a previous human. When that happens, its awesome. Othetwise, its just walking walking, grabbing berries and twigs for fires. The landscapes are pretty and fun to look at.\n\nWhich is fine, but as I live here I can go dwander through the trackless wilderness IRL.\n\nStill, there is something undenialbly awesome about this game. The exploration and story is great.\n\nI just wish there was more to it. More things to look at, ruins to see, items and journals. Animals, or even other beings.\n\nStill I have to recommend it.

This is an exploration that will take hours and hours to complete, and I find I like it best in occasional small doses of a half-hour to an hour at a time.\n\nGraphically it's very simple and the area is extremely vast, so it can get monotonous if played for long lengths of time.  There are two "hint" systems to the game: clicking on a topic in your journal shows you the direction to the next document of that topic, and a flying bird in the sky leads you to the next closest document regardless of topic.  Unfortunately, the flying bird "hint" is sometimes obscured by the trees which may or may not be intended.\n\nThere are many, many intertwining stories and with each document you pick up, you unlock a little more of that storyline.  But don't go into it expecting everything to be tied up with a little bow at the end.  You're expected to think about the stories, and the landscape, and the history of this area.\n\nThere are some aspects of survival included in the game but they are very much ancillary to the experience.  You have to eat, sleep, stay warm, and stay away from wild animals that might want to nibble your giblets.  But the food is plentiful and the predators extremely rare (in ten hours I've only encountered a couple), so the survival aspect is an afterthought that is very easy to manage but does give you something to think about other than "walk, walk, walkwalkwalk, walk more..."\n\nSo if you enjoy walking simulators, are very patient, and aren't looking for an action-packed experience, and especially if you enjoy the discovery process of uncovering bits and pieces at a time of larger stories, you will probably like this.  Otherwise you'll probably hate it.","March 21","true","10.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I am not a member of Eidolon’s development team, but I have been playing Eidolon since its earliest builds and having conversations with its creators about the game for even longer. Since I’m not capable of writing an objective review of Eidolon, I’ll attempt to describe as best I can from an insider’s perspective what Eidolon is and why I think you should play it.\n\nWhat is Eidolon?\n\n“Eidolon is a game about exploring a mysterious landscape and uncovering the stories of the people who lived there once before. It is a game about history, curiosity, interconnectedness, and the slow and inevitable beauty of life.” - Ice Water Games\n\nEidolon is an exploration game set in post-apocalyptic Western Washington. A thirst for adventure and a sense of wanderlust are all you need to enjoy Eidolon’s beautifully handcrafted world. Beyond that, Eidolon is entirely what you make of it.\n\nThe menus and interfaces of the game, much like the world around it, are clean and minimalistic. When you click the “play” button on Eidolon’s home screen, no cutscenes or tutorials appear. Instead, the menu simply fades away as you’re seamlessly dropped into its world.\n\nIts map is over 100 square miles in size and jam-packed with sights to see and hidden gems to find, but there are no bright arrows or nagging narrators to guide you along your journey. You don’t need to be anywhere. There is no winning or losing in Eidolon. You can die, but death is merely a stopgap. You can collect everything the game has to offer, but that wouldn’t really be the end of Eidolon.\n\nThe story of Eidolon is told through scattered journal entries, newspaper clippings, and various pieces of media which have been left behind from before, during, and after the apocalypse. The lore of the game manifests itself as shining squares of green light that permeate across its landscape. When collected, the lore is placed into your journal for you to read and piece together the history its world.\n\nThough you can choose to spend your time searching for collectibles, Eidolon is far from an RPG. Your character will get hungry, tired, and sick as you wander, but Eidolon isn’t a survival game. It shares the open-ended, no-objectives feel of a sandbox game, but Eidolon isn’t about building or attaining something - Eidolon is all about the journey.\n\nI’ve been conditioned by video games to expect conflict at every turn, but conflict in Eidolon is almost entirely self-inflicted. Eager adventurers might choose to fight a bear or swim through the freezing waters of the Pacific Northwest, but these ideas can prove just as fatal in the game as they would in real life. Your only “enemy” is the environment, but in Eidolon’s lonely world, the environment is also your only friend.\n\nWhy should I play Eidolon?\n\n“Minecraft’s greatest strength, in my eyes, wasn’t the potential for building, but the potential for exploration; you wandered this completely random, endless world and made your own stories along the way. Eidolon is the embodiment of that spirit; except here there’s intricate craftsmanship on show. Ice Water Games have created a world that is at the same time subtly detailed and sweepingly beautiful, with no hand holding and minimal guidance as to what you should be doing.” - Max Downton, Coffee Break Gaming\n\nEidolon is a game of beauty, adventure, and solitude. I’ve spent almost as much time admiring the landscapes of Eidolon as I have actually playing it. Its filled with sights to see, content to discover, and experiences to have.\n\nEidolon will not hold your hand. There are no completion percentages to track or achievements to unlock. Eidolon simply exists for you to experience. In my opinion, this is Eidolon’s greatest strength, but I understand that this might be off-putting to gamers that are looking for a quick thrill. To me, Eidolon is equal parts video game and interactive art. Eidolon is not for everyone, but for those that it strikes a chord with there is simply nothing else like it.\n\nFrom the earliest stages of its development, the goals of Eidolon were to tell a story, to craft an experience. The majority of the team at Ice Water Games were writers, fully devoted to creating the lore of the game. The sheer amount of content in Eidolon reflects that, as does the occasional bug.\n\nIf you come into Eidolon with the expectations of a survival game like the The Forest or DayZ, you will likely be disappointed. There are no guns to shoot in Eidolon, no enemies to fight. Eidolon is first and foremost a story-driven exploration game, and the survival aspects of it take a backseat to its rich emergent narrative. With that said, Eidolon is the only game of its kind and an experience unlike any other.","August 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The game looks alright (A strong Unturned feel to the graphics) and the music is deent, though it fades in and out, possibly depending on the area? Nothing was ever explained, even though the notes that seem to be the only purpose you have in this world, other than hoarding berries until they rot.\n\nNow, I may have been playing it wrong for the two hours I gave it, but again nothing was ever explained to me in terms of gameplay, so I'm still taking points off for it. Apparently, after you collect a note (And not a map note, a note-note) you're supposed to click tags under it in oder to get a path to the next note in it's story. Should I have known that, I may have given the game a 5/10. But alas, the one time I did attempt to click on the tags my journal was closed, so I assumed it did nothing.\n\nThe game itself was alright off the bat. A pretty forest with mushrooms and rain, and you stumble upon a lake where you get a fishing rod and a map of the general area. Of course this map has no legend, resulting in confusion on what the markings all mean other than two words indicating some sort of settlement that is located just off of the sliver of gameworld shown to you. My first instinct was to go  north towards the city that looked like "Believe", and this trip took me at least a week of gametime. You'll occasionally encounter some spooky music and dogs that will maul you but not do anything more... and that's about it. Besides the trees, bushes, rocks, and non-functioning radio towers, there's not much to see from point A to point B.\n\nYou're also equip with some futuristic tablet with three fuctions, but only one of which actually fuctions (slightly) due to your "out-of-range" of some beacon. I assumed this to be the radio towers dotting the map, but apparently I was mistaken. No explination as to why, so I'm just left with this useless thing that tells me when I'm hungry and hurt.\n\nMy run finally ended when I had walked around the coastline of one island, only to spot another off to the east. Without a boat, of course, I was forced to swim in the freezing water until I finally passed. Passed being a relitive term of course, because as soon as i was ready to embrace the sweet peace of death, the game told me I was perfectly healty and dropped me off in the middle of the woods in what appeared to be where I had originally started; my progress over my gametime had been nullified.\n\nSo again, I can't reccomend this game unless you really enjoy walking aimlessly, occasionally reading cryptic letters and getting mauled by bears that... don't do to much.","January 3, 2015","false","2.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Many compare it to Proteus or categorize it as an art game or walking simulator, but I feel it is a lot more complex than that would lead you to believe.  I liked Proteus, though it was a small, procedurally generated island with no purpose but to wander around and listen to the music.  Once I'd seen it all, there wasn't much more reason to keep playing.  Eidolon is only similar in the basic retro look.  The territory is set on a map of the Washington area, which I might as well say because the cat's out of the bag on that one, and the territory is huge.  You probably won't run out of things to see and beutiful landscapes to cross for a long time.  If that's all the game was, it would be worth it for that alone.  There is the need to eat, sleep, and heal wounds if you get them, but don't expect it to be a very difficult survival experience.  It is very forgiving, and it isn't anything likely to satisfy someone expecting a combat FPS or roll playing experience.  What you will be doing is experiencing what amounts to a non-linear novel of personal letters that feed into a broader post apocaliptic story.  It's a story that you will have to piece together over a long haul of traveling.  Don't let the sleep poetry fool you; it is a tangable story, and not just someone's abstract artsy ramblings.  If you are patient and like to take in the scenery while experiencing a great story, this will not disapoint.","October 14, 2014","true","55.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

When I walked down the sweeping green hill, I was alone. When I first looked up to the sky I was alone. When I caught my first sight of water I was completely and utterly alone.\n\nI was alone, yet the world was full of life and activity. A gentle wind pushed along white clouds, foxes and deers pranced about in the water, there was the ever present sound of birds chirping. I sat on the peninsula where you find the fishing rod, and while I learned to work the damn thing (a simple right click and some patience) I was full of introspection.\n\nIt was a while before I found my first tinder so I could make my first fire and cook my first fish to eat. I didn't learn the harsh lesson that the cold had to teach until I was on the brink of death. Turns out sleeping on the edge of a lake is not such a good idea.\n\nWell-rested, fed, and armed with new knowledge I set out in the direction I believed to be east. Or perhaps it was west. Maybe south. I had no map, no compass. There was no one to point me in the right direction.\n\nAt last I found a little cube. A pleasant glowing green cube. It, like the fishing rod cube, glinted and pulsed in the distance. I walked to it and found my first trace of another being. It was dated 2225. The writer of that note was long dead.\n\nAs I explored the world that I had purchased for fifteen dollars, I found more floating green cubes and was able to piece together a tentative knowledge of the world, what happened, and the people who had lived there. When night started falling and the time I could safely march in the world passed away, I found myself reading and re-reading those diary pages in the hopes of gleaning something new from them.\n\nIn Eidolon I passed from introspection to inspection of others, inspection of the information they wrote on little scraps of paper.\n\nI am afraid I cannot provide any comparisons, I cannot say 'If you liked THIS GAME you'd love Eidolon'. There are simply no games I am aware of that are like Eidolon. If you enjoy a read, and a walk in the woods, and are a patient, thoughtful person, Eidolon might just be for you.\n\nThank you for reading this far. Now if you excuse me, I have to go play Eidolon.","September 26, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm somewhere in the middle of it and I love it, despite the fact that my fingers hurt from holding down the W and Shift buttons for 12 hours.\n\nIt's very easy to get immersed in the sounds, sights and story of the game (once you find it, that is- it took me two or three hours of wandering to find my first note after getting all the tools). I just spent about three hours following one of the story threads- once you get enough notes, you can basically follow any thread you want to find out more about, and there's plenty of mysteries to unravel. The graphics are simplistic, but feel appropriate, and the music never seems to get repetitive.\n\nI probably wouldn't recommend this if you don't have a lot of time to sink into it or if you don't like walking simulators because you definitely won't like it. If you're ready to jump into a game like this, though, I would heartily recommend it.","January 5, 2015","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

It paints an absolutely gorgeous picture of the Washington forest environment you explore. The game uses simple polygonal graphics but everything seems vibrant and alive. The music that accompanies it is also very serene. The story is intriguing, if a bit (intentionally) fragmented. The player pieces together the story through diary entries found during their journey. Each story chunk found leaves the player wanting more. Why did these people die?\n\nWhile Eidolon is great at setting mood/atmosphere, there is a lot to be desired in terms of gameplay.  The game has simple controls and a simple premise based on survival, but nothing is explained to the player. Even a small tutorial would have made all the difference. The controls (when mastered) are clunky and awkward.  Also, the animations of some of the animals you find is laughable (deer running off sideways, no leg movement).\n\nA big sticking point to me has been the in-game weather. While I understand that the game is set in Washington State, there is WAY too much fog and rain. The game has such breathtaking scenery, and this is obscured by fog 9 days out of 10. This also seriously affects the game's main mechanic of finding diary notes. While these notes do glow green, the fog seriously impedes any effort to find them.\n\nOverall the game has great potential. While it is a slow and plodding survival game, it somehow makes wonderful environments out of polygonal shapes and ambient music. It just trips over itself when it comes to controls and mechanics.","August 9, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike many exploration-style games, nothing (at least for me so far) reaches out and tries to kill you. It's the equivalent of yoga in video game format - meditative and relaxing. Finding scraps of the former culture is highly rewarding; the journals are beautifully written. Stumbling upon something in the forest is equally as exciting - a watch tower, a former town, a deer - all of it is rewarding.\n\nAs someone from western Washington, the simple aesthetic of this game truly captures what it feels to wander around the forests - the fogginess, the smattering of rain, the different vegetation, the solitary nature of the experience - it all adds together to form a perfect rendition of what the great outdoors is like.\n\nI unintentionally played this game for several hours without noticing - it's a highly recommended experience.","January 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself is extremely beautiful. The music is very calming, and the landscape is very, very, very nice to look at, and the map is HUGE, which is good for exploration. HOWEVER, since the entirety of the game revolves around you collecting these little glowy cubes, it takes FOREVERRRR because the map is big and movement is horrendously slow. Also, the game's ridiculously fast hunger/sleep cycle doesn't help either. (When you get tired, you walk even slower)\n\nWhile I understand the game's use of day/night simulation, it felt that the time passed far too quickly for me to really get anything done before everything went dark and I stumbled into a pond and then got hypothermia. Yeahhhh.\n\nThe "story" is a bit tedious at times, especially since it comes in chunks of tiny text that I really can't be bothered to read when I am bleeding to death from falling down a cliff. Wounds or sickness in general heal extremely slowly, tire you out faster, and cause you to move even slower than before.\n\nOne good thing about the game is that you don't really need to worry about starvation, since there are always fields of mushrooms/fruits to forage. Hunting is a little difficult at times, but relatively easy to get the hang of.\n\nIn the end, I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if you're the type of person who likes to just aimlessly wander forever, then go for it I guess...","June 25, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The story is interesting, and I'm only a few hours (real time) into it so I doubt I've even touched the surface of content.\n\nGraphically it is minimalist, and I would like to see it be a bit better.  It doesn't need to be next gen graphical design, but at least a bit better to aid in the imersion aspect.\n\nOne thing it doesn't have which I would very much like to see is a keybinding allowing me to look around while I'm walking.  At the moment if you want to look around while walking you have to turn your entire body.\n\nGiven the caveat I have only been playing a short time, I would also like to see a bit more interaction with my environment.  Being able to manipulate objects and perhaps even being able to build rudimentary shelters such as lean-tos to further the survival aspect of the game would be awesome.\n\nEven with my 3 suggestions above, it is still a great game if you just want to relax and go fishing, hunting, camping, or exploring.","October 30, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

From vista to vista it pulls you along, and when you make a discovery, it's nearly impossible not to be entranced, enticed, induced into going forward to the next step, if you can find it.\n\nLittle details make this especially beguiling: birds piping up as the sun rises; understanding that food is everywhere, yet it is possible to forget to gather enough to last a little while, because if you hold on to it for too long, it will go bad. Stars that shine down all across an otherwise empty and dark sky.\nUnderstand, the visuals are simple, hovering somewhere between simple suggestion and crudeness. This is an older child's rendition of the way the world looks, not quite abstract, and certainly understandable: you can tell the evergreens from the deciduous trees, the loaded blueberry bushes from the empty ones, a fox from a random mushroom on the distant landscape.

That desire to see what's over the horizon, what's beyond that next hill. That drive to find the next clue to solving the mystery. Specifically, it's my own search for answers in this game that I'm referring to. Answers to what happened to near-future Washington state, and what led to human civilization's downfall.\nDon't be put off by the constant, slow-paced walking that is Eidolon's gameplay. The landscapes are beautiful. The atmosphere is peaceful and relaxing during the day and, at times, terrifying at night (though there are no baddies beyond local wildlife to elicit such terror; the darkness and the groaning of metal from what had been grand skyscrapers will do that in their stead). And, most importantly in my mind, the stories told by the articles, journals, logs and internet pages you will find will leave you wanting more, justifying that trek across a valley to find the next clue. If you ever played Fallout 3/NV, and enjoyed finding pieces of history from people long gone as I did, you will enjoy Eidolon's tales. Unlike Fallout, however, there are no enemies to kill, no true threats to your safety to contend with. You CAN die; the wilderness is an unforgiving mistress. But there is no real consequence in death, save for returning to a spawn point. You are instead left to enjoy the beauty of Washington state post-man and the journey that your search represents.\n\nPros\n\n- Wonderful storylines told through the clues\n- Great visual style\n- Great music, ambient nature sounds\n- Very relaxing to play after a long day\n\nCons (These are really just little nitpicks, not true cons)\n\n- Wasn't quite sure how progress was saved at first. The game appears to autosave every so often and when you exit the game. Other than that, I haven't seen a manual save feature. This can be a problem if the game crashes, causing you to lose progress.\n- Some sort of crafting mechanic/some other type of survival mechanic would have been nice, if only to help pass the time on your trek.\n- Lack of torches/the fact that campfires put off no illumination is a ♥♥♥♥♥ at night.\n- Bears.\n\nAll in all, 10/10.

There's walking, and bland environment. That's ninety percent of the game. It feels like you have about six different kinds of flora, there's no such thing as grass, it's simply a green colored texture. The tree's are smooth with NO detail, and if they're too close to each other, they don't integrate, the just pertrude out of the other side of the tree next to it. You'll see grass floating at eye level above the landscape. There's no detail to anything, whatsoever. Seriously, none. That's usually what walking simulators have going for them. There suppose to be relaxing with beautiful environments, or a gripping story that unfolds with unique gameplay elements. This game is so far from any of those, it's ridiculous. The stories are pretty cool (as in the slips of paper) but they are so few and far between, it literally takes you an hour or two to find each one. You walk slowly, EXTREMELY slowly, and the "survival" aspect of this game is a joke. I've never actually died from anything, you just pass out. I've fell a good 40 in game feet with no consequences, stayed in freezing water for 3 minutes, and tried to freeze to death in the mountains. That's not why I bought the game of course, but at least make this "thing" have SOMETHING going for it. The devs didn't care when they made it, and the only thing the game has going for it are the memoirs you find... sometimes. The game's dead, and it's receiving no more updates, and it's ludacris to call it finished. This game isn't worth 99 cents, and this 15 dollar crap has to be a joke. Use the money to start a real fire before you buy this, at least you'll GET something useful that way.","July 1, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have walked a long way, I ate some mushrooms and some berries, collected some fire wood, saw a cow (well, a brown box) became ill after being attacked by a brown and white box, couldn't hold down my berries any longer. My questions is quite simple - WTF is this game about? I am yet to find anything of any interest and frankly wandering through a forest looking at cows, feeling sick and eating berries is not my idea of a good time.\nOh and what is the matter with the physical universe here. I light a fire and a snow flake appears on my "status" bar accompanied by a warning that I am cold................ WHY!!!!!!!\n\nUPDATE:\nI discover a bow and soon begin moving VERRRRRYYYYYYY slowly indeed. This is a novel approach to engaging a disengaged gamer - make the game LESS interesting! It works though and my already non-existent interest in this game dies with a long drawn out death rattle akin to a man suffring terminal flatulence.\n\nThis is the most horrid gaming experience I have had since I purchased YOLANDA for my Amiga 500 almost 25 years ago. I'd rather stab myself in the brain with a fork than play this again.\n\nAnd why do people continue to mention the "beauty" of the game in their reviews?

You just keep walking and the biggest problem is that you have no idea where to go. If you find a direction then you cant go that way because of mountains. Mountains, lakes or walls make you go around and waste more time. You spend hours just to find a document with a random story on it.\n\nThese simple graphics dont look great either. Sometimes there is no music playing so the only thing you hear are your footsteps and birds or rain. This person, youre playing as, eats like a tank. Who the hell eats 50 mushrooms at once? And when you get ill, you eat even more. So you have to keep looking for food, avoid falling damage, avoid eating rotten food, avoid water(you can fish when you find the fishing rod but standing in water for too long will make you freeze to death) and sleep when tired. You can also hunt animals with your bow(if you find it) but why would you want to do that when you can find a lot of mushrooms in the forest.

I've been wandering throughout the forest for a good 1.5 hours now and there has been barely any gameplay or story payoff, other than picking mushrooms, berries, using a primitive bow, and lighting a fire, and some uninteresting notes that provide no context. There is no direction in this game as to what you should do or where you should go. There is also extremely limited interaction with the game world. You would think that this would be an invitation to explore the world, however, the graphics, to me, are ugly and basic. I understand the appeal of a minimalistic style of art, but after having marched through field after field of dull greens, polygonal trees, and ugly grass blades, it gets to be old real fast. There is no beauty in this world to explore and there are extremely dull periods where I'm basically pressing the "up" button as I march into nothingness. There needs to be more to do, more to interact with, something to drive the player forward. I finally hit the main road on the map expecting some kind of payoff, but nope, still waiting. The road looks unfinished in terms of graphic design too. Am I missing something here?\n\nSome people have described this game to Gone Home. This game is NOTHING like Gone Home, other than the exploration aspect. I loved Gone Home. There was a driving story narrative and alot of components that you could interact with to explore the story and the game world. Gone Home was also a beautiful game graphically. Here, there is literallly NOTHING to do and the graphics are BASIC. Even the items you find are represented in ugly little glowing orbs, instead of seeing the actual item itself.\n\nBased on reviews of this game, and the article from Kotaku, I was hoping for an exploration based game where you could fend for yourself and survive in the wilderness. However, I should have read the game tag, because it describes this game perfectly - it's a WALKING simulator, not a survival based game. And if I wanted to walk, I could go outside on a hike. I'd buy it if it was on sale for a few dollars, but I would not spend $15 on this.","August 6, 2014","false","1.3"," 25 of 57 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","25","57","0","4"

An apparition of someone? Of somewhere? Of something?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nEidolon is an interesting little (not by way of space, but actual content) survival/story game. It is no DayZ, The Forest, or Minecraft, mind you, but it's certainly serious about the player's life. You can be attacked by bears and mountain lions, or easily fall to your death. Freezing is also an issue. Wounds can fester and cause illness, or you might starve to death.\n\nThe exploration is quite nice for such a video game. At first, you are given nothing more than a journal. This might help you in remembering landmarks, if need be. Later, you should start finding maps of separate areas of the landscape. None of these will tell you where you are, but with a compass and your eyes, you should be able to figure it out.\n\nThe story of Eidolon, while I'm not much yet into it myself, is something of a curveball. I'll go ahead and put a spoiler here if you don't want to read.  Eidolon takes place long after the downfall of humanity, in Washington state. Groups of survivors were formed and settled communities, which you may find the ruins of. Notes are spread all around the world, telling of the people and the villages.  Other than this, I've not yet found more.\n\nIt's a wonderous beauty of a game, though. The graphics are simplistic and beautiful, with mountains rising up into the quite puffy clouds from just above the tree canopy. It reminds me of Proteus, which I also highly recommend. The feeling, however, leans me towards a slightly brighter version of Dear Esther, with the isolation and distant story.\n\nSo I suggest Eidolon. Yes. It's wonderful, it's simple, huge, and desolate. Don't expect action, but be aware of everything. You might wind up with a serious case of anxiety when your leg is broken, you can't find medicine, and you're throwing your food back up thanks to an infection.","August 14, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On my first attempt, I was eaten alive by a wild cat animal as soon as I spawned. On the second try I froze to death within minutes. Third and most recent attempt: starvation. In the time i've played this game, I haven't come across a single note, transcript, tool or other noteworthy item despite doing my best to look for them,\n\nThe closest I ever got to finding something interesting was just recently when I saw something that looked like rows of little cottages along a swampy lakeside. I had emerged from the forest at the wrong side of the lake and so I had to get around it. After several attempts and a few in-game days later, I reached the cottages. To my great dissappointment, they turned out to be trees with oddly shaped foliage. I remembered that one of the "cottages" was located a bit further away from the rest and had a bit of a different shape, so I decided to check that out for the hell of it. At this point however, I was fatigued. cold and hungry, so I decided to rest for a bit. When I woke up a thick mist had crept in, covering the entire lake and the surrounding area. I tried to make my way to the cottage-shaped piece of mystery through the mist, but then I starved to death.\n\nFrankly I really want to like this game, but it´s just too unforgiving for me to enjoy. Be prepared to sink some time into this if you want the most out of it. I will give credit where it's due though; the soundtrack is pretty good, even great in some cases, but it triggers far too rarely to compensate.\n\n-EDIT-\n\nJust now I gave this game one last, serious chance. I summoned every bit of patience I could muster, and set out to explore the world. having already tried going in multiple different directions, I decided to try venturing past the giant, snow-clad mountains, hoping to find something beyond. I gathered mushrooms and tinder for days, planned my route to the best of my ability and set off.\n\nAfter travelling for what felt like an eternity, barely avoiding freezing to death by building campfires along my path, I finally passed the mountains. For the first time in a long time, I was actually excited to see what lied beyond the misty veil that greeted me.\n\nThen i fell off the end of the world and got dumped back where I started.\n\nAnd then I uninstalled.\n\nAlso, someone said this game has stories on notes in it, but I never found any. Supposedly there are tools too, but I never found any of those either.","January 10, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or maybe it was the other way around, I don't know.\nAnyway it seems silly, but in the end it did kinda work. Eidolon is a meditative survival game where you spend most of your time hunting for little nuggets of information scattered everywhere - letters, diary pages, etc, - and try to piece together what happened here. All the while trying to find food and stay healthy, which is not really hard at all.\nThe story told by all those pieces is interesting, and there are a LOT of things to read. The only real problem is that the game world is WAY TOO BIG. This game even has an auto-move button, which s a sure sign that the developers care about our cramped hands, but are OK with us dying from boredom.\n\nTo sum it up: if you like piecing together a story from scattered written clues, and don't mind walking 15 minutes straight from one clue to the next - you're gonna enjoy Eidolon,","January 4, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no score. You don't level up. The survival elements are minimal.\nYou are alone in the world, except for the occasional animal that might cross your path.\nTo cover any distance takes a long time, as you don't run or walk very quickly. There is no fast travel.\nThere are no vehicles, except for the rusting shells of cars.\nYou may find the odd hand-drawn map. These maps do not have objective markers.  As far as I can tell, the game does not seem to have an ending.\n\nBut what is left is a small beautiful thing. You take your time walking through a huge landscape, finding scraps of paper that gradually tell the story of a people long gone. That's it. The ambient sound is really good, as is the understated music. Even though the graphics are simplistic, you'll find yourself pausing sometimes when you discover a nice view. The starry night is perfect.\n\nIn short, a relaxing/zen-like experience.

Well, first and foremost, I will say that this game is absolutely not for everybody. There are no enemies constantly hunting you down, there is no guided story. What there is, is a beautifully portrayed post-human Pacific Northwest, and you. Alone. Trying to figure out what happened to this land; to the people that must have once lived here.\n\nThe story unfolds through diary entries, "audio logs" (written), and pictures, all collected by searching for green orbs called "Eidolons". It does not unfold in any particular order. It's up to the player to take it all in and make what you can of it.\n\nSome will say that there is a lot of walking in this game, and that is true. There ARE times when the walking is a bit tedious. But in a way, that aspect actually adds to the gameplay, because you truly get a feel for the environment and the sheer vastness of wilderness which used to be bustling metropoli, and have all fallen to ruin.\n\nThis game is a fantastic way to relax. It's all about discovery and exploration. It's about trying to make sense of the bits and pieces of history left behind and told through the personal stories of the people who lived through these times. It's about contemplation. Empathy. Lonliness and sorrow. And in some cases, joy, for those people who your character has never met (but how you somehow become connected with) when you hear signs of them living a good life despite the calamities which befell these civilizations.\n\nIf you are looking to just escape the real world for a bit and do some self-reflection, this game is probably for you.\n\n","August 3, 2015","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eidolon is not for everyone: There is very little action. Instead there is a beautiful world, portrayed in a fashion similar to that of Proteus. The game is very peaceful and simplistic. Hunting and fishing are presented in a minimal fashion as activities in the game but are almost an afterthought. You can also die from cold, but there is no permanent death and you are instead respawned, seemingly at random, to a location within one of the games healing swamps.\nI believe that many people may be turned off by the endless walking with no apparent goal. There is however a simple beauty behind the story as it is told via pieces of scattered journals located across the map, represented visually as glowing blue orbs. The games apocalyptic tale is revealed in piecemeal fashion  but there is a timeline that slowly unfolds as you gather more documents/orbs.\nTo enjoy this game, you must be patient, as before mentioned, the endless walking is most certainly not for everyone. But the wonderful pastel color palette is soothing, the music is fantastic and adds to the overall experience.  In this game,  I felt more absorbed in the games world than I do in many more "modern" games. I felt like I was exploring a lost, lonely and decayed civilization. A bird I adopted as my spirit guide would lead the way to new journals, of which there are over 150 entries.\nThis is my first and potentially last Steam review. However this game impacted me in a way I would not have expected. Though I have collected all of the journals,  after playing viridi ( their recently released virtual plant potting simulator) I now have the itch to reinstall and play again, the first 43 hours I put in the game apparently were not enough.\n","January 6","true","49.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
