Up untill a week ago.  (No play time on steam, played through their client because steam was not working right.  You can download their client directly from www.panzar.us)\n\nThe last patch made the game 100% pay to win.\n\nIf you dont plan on shoveling out loads of cash to buy gear for each level range Im sorry to say, this game is not for you.\n\nSure it needed some balance changes but overall the gameplay was very engaging and a lot of fun.  However, the crafting system needed a lot of work.  By level 15 it was taking me 50+ (5-20 minute games)  to get the components to craft the easiest pieces of my level tier gear.   The harder ones or "epic" items were clearly our of my range, needing almost 10x the ingrediants of their lesser version.  I didnt mind though.  I would just craft them as I played....\n\nHowever now.  If you want to craft an item you must collect almost 150% more materials and now have a 50% to successfully craft the item(which you can increase to 80% chance by sacraficing vital skill points better used elsewhere).\n\nThats a 50% chance to destroy all the materials you spent days gathering (if you play a lot)\n\nOf course you could pay....  paying has 100% chance of success.\n\nI really hope they change this fatal error.","August 15, 2014","false","1.4"," 335 of 360 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","335","360","6","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swishdota/recommended/240320/","swishdota","Swish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swishdota/","120 products in account","The good :\n\nThe gameplay is solid, the classes are all varied and each has their own weakness and strength.  Unlike many multiplayer games, this game is very reliant on team-work.  If your team isn't working together efficiently, you aren't going to win.  Plain and simple.  This is a game that I feel can truely be called a "MOBA" (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), as opposed to games like League of Legends or Dota 2.\n\nThe variety of maps and gameplay modes put it into the higher tier of online gaming.  Something like 24 maps and 6 gameplay modes will give you hours of enjoyment.  While it might look hectic in videos and screenshots, after a few matches youll adjust and be able to spot enemies from allies easily.\n\nThe game runs smooth, and looks great in action at max settings.  There are some customization options with being able to paint all your gear different colors as well as some facials features like different hair styles, but that's where the downfall of the game begins.\n\n\nThe bad :\n\nThe way this game makes it's money feels very cheap.  Allow me to explain.  At the end of each match you are given X amount of materials like linen or gold nuggets or bark.  The amount you are given is based on your overall points in the match, which materials you are given is completely random.\n\nAs you level up, you are able to craft various sets of gear that add substantial stats to your character like + hp or +mastery (mastery being the attribute that increases the power your special abilities).  At first it seems great.  Level 4 opens up and it takes roughly a half hour to craft each of the handful of pieces available.  But that's where things start to suffer.  By the time you reach the max level (currently 20 on EU/NA servers) you are looking at spending, quite literally, WEEKS crafting the item sets.  The amount of materials it takes to create the top level gear is ridiculous.  So not only will you spend weeks grinding the materials, but you'll also wait additional days/weeks to actually craft the gear.\n\n\nThe ugly :\n\nIn itself, this wouldn't be so bad.  Tweak a few numbers here and there and it would be no biggy.  But this is where the cash shop comes in.  You can flat out buy the same armor sets people will spend weeks grinding/crafting out in a matter of seconds.  While this game may not seem like it's pay to win at the early levels, once you hit the max level I assure you it comes down to two tiers of players.  Those that drop 40$ or so to get the best gear, and those that will spend weeks getting decimated while crafting it themselves.\n\nMany fans of the game will claim that "skill owns gear" in this game, and they are partially correct.  Skill plays a major role in this game.  If you cannot block properly or do not learn the telegraphs of specific moves, you are going to get creamed.  However, at a certain point skill becomes a moot point when you're attacking someone at the same level and same class yet he has 2x your health and does 2x your damage simply because he decided to outright buy the gear rather than grind and craft it.\n\nThis is a very poorly thought out system and screams cash grab.  Combine this horrid use of a cash shop with the fact that the game (nearly a year after it's Russian release) is still riddled with game debilitating and breaking bugs and it quickly becomes a chore.  I have had sessions where within 2 hours of playing I crashed to the desktop nearly a dozen times.  Add to the fact that just recently it seems either their servers got hacked and it's simply a no go.\n\n\nFinal thoughts :\n\nThis game has amazing potential.  The actual gameplay is very fun, but everything else about it is bad.  Would I continue to play it if they hammered out all the major bugs and reworked the cash shop?  Absolutely.  But I cannot realistically see that happening anytime in the future.\n\nIt's worth a try if you want to see what a real MOBA should play like, but not much more than that.  Gameplay I give it a 8/10.  Everything else I give it a 2/10.","December 3, 2013","false","31.1"," 576 of 677 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","576","677","3","1"

It has some the most visualy impressive graphics i've probably ever seen in a free to play game. But while it looks pretty and all, the game's main issue is that it's a straight up money grubbing pay to win game.\n\n\nAt first, the match ups are fair and, for the most part, well balanced. Everyone has an equel chance to kill and be killed. Sadly this can only be said about the early matches. After you get settled into the game and you think that things are going to be progressing at a fairly paced rate, like a good game should, you start getting matched up with people that are WAY stonger you simply because they invested some real money into their character. They get an enormous advantage over anyone who didn't pay for the in-game currency and ultimatly win. And when they win they win HARD! You'd initially think to yourself "Eh, maybe it won't happen too often" or "its not that bad" to try to make yourself feel better about your horible defeat. Then match after match, loss after loss you realize that it's a constant and reaccurring cycle that completely frustrates and irritates you to the point of hair loss. The only way to even have a remote chance to beat those players are if you happen to have one of those pay to win players on your team or you succumb to the pressure and cough up the dough. Either way you get screwed!\n\n\nThough this next problem might not seem very big, it actually is the very root of the pay to win problem. That honor goes undoubtedly to the dreaded item creation system. This game's creation system is one of the most sneaky and insulting kick to the groin! To create an item you must not only get a bunch of materials that are hard to come by,  you must also have a ton of money to then buy the item. In addition to having to buy the items at a ridiculously high price, you also gain a ridiculously low amount of money from battles which makes paying for items a really daunting task. And if you think that they could'nt possibly make it any worse you are sorely mistaken. It then gives you a wait period for your item to be made. And this could last for several hours to even days to recive the item you have worked tirelessly to get. The game's creators purposly designed it like this to push players to buy their in-game currency. Sure it rewards the ones that purchase the in-game currency, but they completly neglect and almost punish the players that didn't want to purchase anything and simply wanted to play a good free game. It can be argued that in a buisiness stand point a free to play game has to make some profit somehow. Which is very much true. But they fail to realize that it should be left as an option for the player to choose from without the fear of facing an unfair advantage. Many thriving free to play companies do this, and they have some of the most happy and loyal fanbases along with more than enough money to keep afloat (a good example of that is Team Fortress 2). This creation system takes away what makes the game fun for EVERYONE and just serves as something that stops it from reaching it's full potential.\n\n\nBut of corse, credit has to be given to where credit is due. Despite it being a money grubbing machine, the combat is really well done and diverse (this is the potential i was talking about earlier). Each class has their own unique abilities and play styles. They all play smoothly when in combat and each of them have an important role to fill in the team. Wether you're the support or the tank, each one is equally just as vital to achieve victory. The character designs are very unique and interesting enough to keep you entertained for a while. The amount of attention put into the graphics is fenominal! The max graphics settings looks fantastic with the amount of detail put into the characters and battlegrounds. When it comes to gameplay and graphics this game passes with flying colors.\n\nPanzar is one of those games that i personally would not recommend, but if you think that you can get passed all of it's outragous problems or you plan to spend money on this game then go right ahead. play and enjoy this game as much as you possibly can. =)","October 14, 2014","false","6.0"," 266 of 296 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","266","296","9","7"

It has great graphics and is extremely engaging.  It used to have a good battle and loot system, and was reasonably fair in terms of the offered monetary VIP options.  However, the 08/11/14 latest update took all the fun out of this game.  Instead of the battle - get resources - craft items system it turned into an inbalanced roulette and an impossible grinder of a game, thus eliminating any incentive to play it.  The players are now very obviously squeezed for cash.  In my opinion this radical change will not only disappoint and drive away the dedicated players that have already put hours (and money) into this game, but will also scare off new potential players.\nUnless Panzar reverts back to its pre-update stage, it will not continue for long.","August 11, 2014","false","255.3"," 94 of 111 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","94","111","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/240320/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","It's a Team Based PVP oriented game set up in a typical F2P format where players can grind to earn what they want or simply pay for it.  The cash shop sells a variety of items such as cosmetics, level ups, crafting materials & potions.  Currently the only game modes available are Capture Point, King of The Hill & Domination.  There is a lack of a server list & choice of game mode so you won't know what game mode or map you'll be getting into until you start playing.  Several different maps are available & range from small, medium & large & all hold up to 20 players or 10v10.\n\nThere are 8 Classes Available Including: Warrior, Tank, Rogue, Healer, 2 Engineers, & 2 Mages.\n\nThe warrior is just that.  A hard hitting force to be reckonded with.  While the tank hits almost as hard, he can also absorb a substantial amount of damage compared to his counterpart.  The Rogue (Or Inquisitor as this game calls it) is a stealthy assassin type of character that does bonus damage when behind his target.  The Healer is just that, & is almost required to win games. The engineers play both as support & damage roles by building useful tools for themselves & allies to use such as teleports, mortars & turrets.  The Ice mage is mostly a support role, freezing enemies so others can destroy them but can also do damage when she needs to.  The fire mage plays as the main ranged damage dealer, & is very weak at close range.\n\nEach class has their own variety of moves & gains more as they level up VIA the skill trees.  There are 30 levels total & 30 talents in each skill tree.\n\nThere is also a crafting system, while it is fairly simple can be a tad frustrating if you don't plan on paying for bonuses.  Materials are given randomly after each game & getting what you need for a particular item can become time consuming.  You do gain additional materials based on your overall performance & if you win a game.  You can also trade materials you don't need for ones that you do.  After gaining enough items it's a simple process of clicking a few buttons & waiting for the item to be made.  Higher level items take longer to produce.  The items crafted go into a queue & you can play games or simply turn the game off while it's produced.  If you buy a booster you can craft more items at once & gain more materials from matches.  The crafting is set up to 3 catagories: Equipment, Support Items such as potions or gems & higher ranking materials.\n\nThe graphics in the game range from down right beautiful, to slightly cartoony.  You may want to take a moment to admire the craftmanship that went into each level.  Some levels look better than others & range from a lush forest scenery to that of desert ruins & run down fortresses.  The character models can be compared to those in World of Warcraft as being fairly cartoony but enjoyable to watch.  Animations are a bit choppy at times but feel good overall when playing the game.\n\nThe game feels unfinished, however.  There are bugs, balancing issues, & crashes.  There is also a cursor issue where it will stay on your screen even during combat.  While this is annoying, if you angle your camera properly it can be less so.  There are also some performance problems, long load times & occasional slowdown.  My machine isn't the most powerful, mind you.  As with any online game nowadays we can probably expect most of these issues to be resolved in future patches & updates.\n\nThe sound in the game is... In progress.  You know how in other games when you slash your foe you hear some sort of impact sound?  Well this game doesn't have that.  At least, not yet.  It becomes difficult at first to know if your hits are even connecting to your target.  Some classes attacks have impact sounds, others do not.  I do not know if this is meant to be intentional or if it is simply unfinished in the sound department. The music is fairly generic as well & is forgettable.  Sound effects are also generic & not really satisfying but they get the job done.\n\nOverall the game is fun & is free so it's probably worth your time to at least try it out.\n\nA good game.","November 25, 2013","true","19.4"," 350 of 544 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","350","544","0","0"

I have only just started with the crafting system but it seems pretty straight forward.  Could be a bit of a grind to get decent gear but being F2P that is what was expected.

This is what lured me into trying it in the first place, it looked so incredibly awesome I couldn't believe it.\n\nEasy to learn, giving you only several abilities to deal with at a time, while also being unique in its classes and fun to hop into. Being a PvP game, they have recently gone into the alpha for a PvE gametype where you need to race the clock and capture points and defeat bosses, while trying not to wipe the group. I recommend trying it out, allowing you to learn the class you wish to play and its abilities.\n\nNow, lets talk about the actual gameplay. Aside from the pay to win, the game features bland combat that is dominated primarily by two classes, the Gunner and the Tank. These two can pound out insane amounts of damage while easily avoiding death which makes life harder for everyone playing the other 5 or so classes.\n\nMatchmaking is also pretty slow, as it has a very small player base, mostly russian. On Steam, it seems to peak around 400-500 people. If you happen to get into a game, make sure you stay the whole time and immediately enter the queue for another game, as you will get in faster, likely with several of the people from the previous match.\n\nUnless you play as tank or berserker, you will die pretty quickly, so the game can be slow for new players trying to understand how the game works and can discourage people from bothering at all.\n\nThe game is also pretty glitchy, sometimes trapping you in walls and other bulges or cliffs in the map. I have noticed it most when playing Gunner and trying to place turrets beside cliffs or rocks, making it collide with the environment.\n\nLast but certainly not least is the pay to win. People will argue and say its "pay to progress" and I am very well aware of this term and what it means, but this game forces you to grind so long for so little reward that to have the best armour in the game requires you to do two things, play either 200-300 hours or pay a simple 35$ (around that, its in euros) and have enough of the in game currency to buy you everything you need to destroy everything in sight.\n\nIt's free and the graphics are nuts, if you have an hour or two and you're bored, give it a go.\n\nPersonal Rating: 2.5/5","May 9, 2014","false","7.2"," 52 of 68 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","52","68","0","0"

Sounds good, is good.\n\nStarting Up\nThe tutorial is ok, but a bit long for what it teaches you. Most is learning by doing. Important things like what's the HUD, how does the character screen work and such is a bit tricky to find out at first, but possible. Hints in loading screens give you well chosen information about the game and fills up the incomplete tutorial to a fullfilling knowledge about how things work.\n\nFirst Gameplays (Lvl <10)\nWell, talking about how people play in lowlevel, it's just like in a kindergarten, trying things out a bit. But that's ok, I mean you gotta see the arenas first, see other classes, maybe try out a skill - that's exactly what you need at that point. You'll learn how your skills work and what class does how much damage and so on. So feel free to be a kindergarten kid yourself ;)\n\nLater Gameplays (Lvl 10-30)\nHere things start to get a bit complicated. You'll be put into games against better geared players, or players with a higher level and therefore they have more skills available. Some of the players are leveling a twink, and actually know how to play and suceed by experience. And you are in the mid of this, neither having gear, nor skills, nor gameplay experience. This may seem frustrating. This may be one reason why lots of people give negative comments after 2-3 hours of gameplay. However, this is how you learn to play. One guy in the forum said it pretty well, although it's a bit mean: Put out your diapers, level up, make 2-3 new pieces of gear, and observe why you die and do next time better - then you are the one farming the others, instead of getting farmed. It's important just to give the game a chance here and not stop instantly. Even if you loose 5 games in a row, the next day you win 5 games in a row.\n\nEngame 1 (Lvl 30 but no gear yet)\nHere you'll probably gonna say, that you need freaking ages to get your best tier gear ready, and that they only want you to buy that gear. However, the match maker sees that you are not fully geared yet and puts you in corresponding games. So be happy to have something to achieve in the game: Get your gear ready. I mean Hearthstone all golden heros and all heros maxlevel take longer than this here. As you get your ressources together, you're continuing to learn how to play and will slowly notice, that there are nice combos within characters, you'll notice some kind of team work may be good... :O\n\nEndgame 2 (Lvl 30 full gear)\nSeems pretty balanced inbetween classes and stuff. The single problem is that the matchmaker may try to balance out the teams, but often it happens that you eithr farm the other team, or your team is getting farmed. And that kinda sucks. Tight matches aren't happening so often, but are exactly the most fun ones. Cool is though, that lots of people leave the match when you get farmed, and new ones join, and this repeats until both teams are plus minus equally strong.\nFor the play itself, it's pretty awesome. You should find some friends, team up and play together. Said in last paragraph, teamplay is important and makes fun. For example, the fire witch shoots a freezing frost witch into the air, stopping her from her action, while the friendly frost witch can now easily freeze the enemy frost witch. Or a Dwarf puts bear traps on a spot, and a tank pulls an enemy onto those traps, killing him instantly. There are tons of combos like these, and I like the versatility given into the game by those combos.\nAnother important point is that basically every skill can be countered by the enemy team. E.g. the freezing of a frost witch can be countered by: Fire witch shooting up, Inquisitor dusting you, Paladin unfreeze, Zerk 'sucker punches', Tank shield, Sapper steam hammer, and Gunner... guess he just kills the Witch. Poor Ice Witch...  I guess that's the reason they are always so mad ^^. However, so can the ice witch basically counter every class and every action by freezing them. The question will be, who does his job better? Who has the better team support? And it may be these questions, that are defining the gameplay. Anyway. I love the gameplay.\n\nGraphics\nCry 3, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome.\n\nSound\nVery lovely made, orchestral epic style, some really nice tracks in there. Like it.\n\nSound effects\nSound pretty good, although Panzar probably didn't invest much in them (guess all computer generated). But quite ok for that.\n\n"Trivia" / Things to know\nA big aspect is the fun put into the game. E.g. there is an emote for the Orc, laughing like hell and falling on his back. You will laugh yourself when seeing this first time. Or the Golem, that repairs gunner's and sapper's structures, is made so stupidly, that it's simply pure fun to watch that guy. There are tons such little funny details, that are very cute.\n\nCommunity\nLots of kids in public chat, as usual. But it's ok. On the forums, it goes quite polite and more or less educated, the community holds together against stupid patches, and the devs listen normally. There is a weekly livestream by the community manager, where some news and stuff are told, pretty cool. Also if you put a question or a report onto the forum, they are usually quickly answered. Guys that are online on a daily basis will meet each other in the matches repeatedly and therefore know each other by time, getting easy friends this way.\n\nTournaments\nAre weekly and very fun and the biggest part in the endgame. Very good concept. So find a clan, and participate ;)\n\nP2W\nAll you get by paying is either a time advantage, or you get pretty colors, emotes, and so on. But: Everything that is game relevant (gear, skills, useable items, and so on) are achieveable without money. Therefore it's theoretically not pay to win.\nThe matchmaker defines a 'battle value' for you, and puts you in matches where people have more or less the same battle value. What gear you wear plays a significant role for the battle value. Therefore, all players in your game have around similar gear as you. So there is not even a need to buy gear, since if you do, your value increases, therefore your enemies will also be better. All you can do by money is just speeding up the whole process of reaching full gear.\nOf course in the endgame, you wanna keep up with your useable items, that run for a limited time. So you need to play quite a bit for that, so you can recreate your amulets every week. That works more or less well as long as you play regularly, but latest patches made it impossible to keep up with certain time-limited gear. P2W or F2P, as in any game that is announced as F2P, it's worth a discussion.\nLot's of people write here in their reviews it's p2w. But sorry, it's not that simple. If you suck you suck, you suck with low gear (fighting against low gear due to battle value and matchmaker), and you'll still suck when you buy the best gear (fighting against the best gear).\n\n\nOverall:\nVery awesome game and recommended, at least give it a try. I mean it's f2p, so nothing to loose ;)","April 18, 2014","true","986.5"," 72 of 105 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","72","105","0","8"

The combat and classes are interesting, the crafting system is a grind but manageable, and it is actually fun to play.  However, it has some keyboard smashing features that just aren't fixable:\n\n1.  Long queue times.  For a MOBA, you'd expect multiple games to be starting every minute for every level range.  That doesn't seem to be the case in this game, with queue times approaching 20 minutes or more for a single game sometimes.  And there is little transparency in the matchmaking process, no indication that games are forming, completing, or that players are even queued.\n\n2. Everyone on your team is Russian.  They don't understand you, you don't understand them.  It makes a team based game very difficult.  You may as well remove voice chat, which doesn't really work anyway.\n\n3. Lack of new player information available.  The English wiki is unfinished, there is little information on the English forums, there is little information provided in the game, and the tutorial is so uninformative and restrictive that it's a chore just to finish it.\n\n4. Everyone seems to be terrible at this game.  I've played less than 10 hours and not past level 5 with a single class and I have topped the board with all of them at least once.  How hard is it to stand on the circle?  I chalk this one up to the previous two bullet points: lack of communication and in-game help.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game that seems to be failing simply due to a lack of interest from US players.  If there were language based games, that alone would solve 3 of the 4 problems I have with this game, but then I'd still be sitting in the queue, waiting to actually play it.","October 12, 2014","false","9.1"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","36","51","4","1"

The fact that it is free and the graphics are great. I would say this game has the best graphics and pvp gameplay of any free game available. alot of people complain that it is pay to win which it kind of is but it doesn't take much of an investment to put yourself on a level playing field. just spend 10$ or so a month (you could get by with less than that) and make your account "premium status" you get double xp double crafting mats etc. if it didn't have an ingame market where you have to buy things occasionally i would have gladly paid up to 40 bucks for this game. so just take 40 bucks and buy some in game currency and you will have everything you need","December 8, 2013","true","85.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

This Russian made Online Battle game is pretty awesome. Going in, you need to know that the voice acting and tutorial level is painfully terrible. Try to suffer through it so that you get the free rewards from it and learn the basics of battle though.\n\nAfter that, a solid but rough game awaits you. It is very fun and has a robust action combat system with LMB attacks and RMB power attacks, as well as special attacks/abilities on the number keys. There's also a loot drop system after every fight that will give you resources to build more armor and weapons for your character, as well as get XP for unlocking new abilities.\n\n\nThere is some extreme balancing and you might feel like the sneak attacks from the Stealth character are cheap... until the big 2-handed club wielding Orc rolls up and one shots that guy for you.\n\nAnyway, try it out, it's pretty fun, but keep in mind it's a Russian game that is rough around the edges and still getting updated regularly.","December 2, 2013","true","3.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Sure this game has a few hiccups now but I believe it could become a great game in the not too distant future.\n\nI'll start with what I don't like.  First bad thing I noticed was the game tends to crash.  However, after updating my graphics card, it started crashing much less frequently.  I also don't like that you can only form a group of three friends when joining a queue which makes it hard for me to invite more friends knowing i won't get to play with them all at once.  Even when I do have a full party (3 people) the matchmaking tends to be a little slow; especially when you're lvl 5 or higher.\n\nHere's what I did like.  The graphics, first of all, are spectacular but that goes without saying since its cryengine.  When I played by myself i was a little lost but when I finally got some friends online I found it to be a very well put together team game.  Someone put it ealier it's kind of like Team Fortress and World of Warcraft had a baby.  A lot of people hail this as a pay to win but i see it more as a pay to progress faster game.  If anyone giving this a bad review would have played it longer than an hour they may have figured that out themselves.  I don't think i've ever run into an instance where I was fighting someone who out leveled or geared me to the point where they absolutely destroyed me.\n\nLike i said, it's without its issues now but I really do think this game could be fun if the community were to expand.","December 9, 2013","true","24.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I do not see a need to pay to win, But i do not mind forking over a few bucks for a great game, because without profit, great games would not be made.

There is a skill tree for crafting that reduces craft time but it's useless in my opinion, only makes me hate spending a perk on it.  Also i think there is a bug that makes u spend gold for upgrades but doesn't really add stats - when u try to add multiple upgrade levels at once.\nBad business model, makes u spend money for little content.

Oh yeah - especially after level 4 or 5 when a player actually gets enough abilities to choose between them and starts using some strategy thinking instead of constant clicking. Then it becomes just more and more interesting.\nCan't understand all the fuss around its monetization system. If you don't want to buy smth in the game you can always craft it.

I personally have not seen anything in the game yet that a little hardwork and elbow grease won't get you.\n\nThe game is not entirely dependant on microtransactions as many seem to believe possibly due to the main menu advertisements mentioned earlier. The game itself has a rich and diverse trading community with public and clan trades happening often due to easy management of resources and clear menus and social chat boxes, also in-game ability to trade resources without other players when the trading front looks bleak for example, say i wish to trade iron for wood but none of my friends are online at the time so i go to my resources menu, from here i can use the static trading system to trade 2 iron for 1 wood with no real  cash involved. Very simple very effective.\n\nMany people claim the game is pay to win for those of you unfamiliar with this term it usuallys confers that the games microtransaction market will allow you to purchase items to make you better than everyone. I'd like to go into a little depth about this, all the items i have seen so far including cosmetics are easily obtainable through a little work usually on par with your skill and level bracket purchasing things such as levels will push you up a bracket (For example your level 9 and buy your way to level 10, all this does is put you in with people the same level as you.). Things such as items, weapons and armour can also be bought with microtransactions but once again these things are easily obtainable in-game and make no real diffrence in combat and gameplay if you are semi competent.\n\nI have encountered no pay to win so far.\n\nNow onto the graphics and gameplay.\n\nGraphically beautiful and exciting with a wide range of effects enhancing the action and gameplay with a feeling of rich immersion. All of this is on par with all of todays lastest games.This Free to play game easily nets half of a £40/$45 price tag through sheer detail and attention which have quite clearly been lovingly crafted by the development teams.\n\nGameplay wise its highly entertaining for all types of gamers with options for brute force, team meat shield, stealth, magic and steampunk style engineers each with their own skill trees and all highly focused around team progresion. While early on in the game many battles may just feels like capture and hold the point to win around lvel 3-5 you start to join assault and defend matches with moving landscapes and defenses. With these new additions to the gameplay comes more in-depth tactics which affect the entire game.\n\nThis is the more positive side of the game and summary i'd like to just point out the perks of this game.\n\n-Free to play.\n\n-Character development and building is fun rewarding and easy.\n\n-At certain times of day they have bonus experience points for everyone, along with competitions and free giveaways.\n\n-A live and active competitive community with tournaments.\n\n-The game is graphically beautiful with visually pleasing landscapes and backgrounds..\n\n-Easy social menus and chat menus, with an intuative interface.\n\n-Controls and gameplay mechanics are easy to learn falling into the nice category of a minute to learn a lifetime to master with a rewarding learning curve.\n\n-Classes are balanced and quite fair. (I find many disagree with this, however they have to realise that a turret building dwarf is not going to take down a "squishy killer" beserker, you are not a one man army and you never will be in this game, win as a team or lose as a team thats your options.)\n\nNow as they say there's no smoke without fire and as such we should also address the issues with this game. This list is a lot shorter and i feel i don't have to go into much detail here as most of it is self explanatory but i will add some details for clarity.\n\n-With the recent release on Steam Panzar has sadly gained a large chunk of new players and while a minority of these players are polite, kind and courteous, many of the new players are immature and childish spamming chat rooms and trying hard to ruin games however a bright light is on the horizon as the Panzar forum response seems very positive in fixing this. Intrestingly most of this stops around 10Pm at night, i'l leave this up to you to figure out.\n\n- I think this really goes without saying but with all games especially online games there are bugs, but once again the Panzar team on the forums seem to be active in dealing with these issues fortunatly they are not to noticeable in game. An extra plus note here for those of you who have played many online games is that i have yet to hear of hackers or see them.\n\n- Not really a negative but for those of you who prefer games with everything at your disposal from the start this game does take a little time to unlock things with the crafting sytem being in realtime, however this does not stop you playing matches with things you are upgrading or making. Its is a time sink but name me one game that you've enjoyed that has not been one?\n\nHopefully this covers most of the basic aspects of the games and allows you to have a perspective from both sides of the fence on the game now.\n\nYours hoping you're having a great time -CPW-\n","December 5, 2013","true","11.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Yes it has microtansactions, as a free to play game it is unavoidable. But I am so very glad to say that the 'gems'  are used mostly on optional things, like speeding up crafting or cosmetics.  Speeking of crafting, panzar has quite the heavy focus on gear.  At the end of every match you are given materials such as leather and ore and from those materials you use the forge to construct your armor and equipment.  The crafting takes time, hours even at the higher teir, but it keeps going even when you are not in game so it is easy enough to que somthing up and let it build overnight.\n\nDo not come into this thinking it is an MMORPG. Panzar has persistant characters yes, but the gameplay is broken into matches. This is where the biggest issue is most clear. Waiting times for matches are far to long, but in truth that is not the games fault, it is simply a lack of players. Part of the reason i write this review is to actually encourage new players to check this game out.

Later that night I found myself wanting to play Panzar, so I had to give it another try.  Im glad I did... below is a quick review then a short do's and dont's list so you can survive until things get a bit easier...\n\nPanzar is a third person, action MMORPG with a MAJOR focus on PVP and a simple lobby/crafting/clan/social system.  It is true action, meaning you aim your melee and ranged skills/abilities much like a first person shooter...no tab targeting. It has 8 gender/race locked classes to choose from, ranging from tank to stealther.\n\nCrafting is more happenstance in Panzar than something you 'try' to do, as both PVP and PVE award crafting materials and experience. You also do not need to have all of the materials in order to begin crafting an item and may stop and move to another at any time, then resume.\n\nClans do not serve much function other than supplying you with a group of people with whom to form groups. HOWEVER, the server is dominated by Russian speaking people so you will wish to join an english speaking clan ... just ask in general chat and ye shall receive.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. FUN gameplay in pve and pvp\n\n2. simple system, easy to understand and use\n\n3. no grinding or farming\n\n4. limited pay to win\n\n5. heavily emphasized team play (great when people do their JOB)\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Mostly russian speaking community that is impossible to communicate with (google translate can be used as a one way means to talk AT them but you cant copy and paste from Panzar's chatbar.\n\n2. If you elect to level up in PVE the first 5 levels will be VERY difficult due to lack of ranged abilities in the party to combat the archers, inexperienced players you are forced to PUG with , and language barrier.\n\n3. Somewhat lacking in content overall, particularly in PVE but they are adding new things very slowly\n\n4. no interplayer trading of any kind (money, items, cash currency, NOTHING)\n\n5. HEAVILY emphasized team play (nightmarish when people dont do their JOB)\n","July 9, 2014","true","527.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And it also has set races/classes, the customiation leaves something to be desired. If you can take all that though and are looking for quick LoL type matches with orcs and dwarves I think there are lots worse than this game. All it is, is the action pvp part, there is the concept of juggling resources and picking skills off of your classes tree which can change the game some for you or your class, in the end though it's a constant state of rpg fighting that I've found myself enjoying quite a bit. I haven't dropped money on the game either, sure I'm not at end game but as it's going they try to match you with people at your skill level (battle effectiveness I think they call it) so while I may one day go vip just for the crafting part that gimps out for free players, is a solid choice for some time killing imo.","September 10, 2014","true","86.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I'm really, really enjoying it. Typically play for 8 or more hours at a time.  Of course, did the same with War Thunder, Shattered Horizon, The Stanley Parable, etc. I'm a marathon player; I burn the camo at both ends!\n\nSure, it needs improvements. The game requires a patch immediately after installing it, but it downloads at 56K modem speeds! This isn't the first game that relies on a launcher to update a game, but 100MB taking 30 minutes to download is appalling! And having never played this kind of game I could have used better tutorials on crafting and why I should craft some things over others. And speaking of tutorials, 9 classes equals 9 identical tutorials if you want to earn a class point for each one. And you are forced to watch the same badly done cut-scenes over and over with no option to skip them. Those voices! UGG! Better to just skip the tutorials altogether and earn your first rank by playing a round or two.\n\nThe game has various classes and after you get past rank 5 there's supposed to be only 2 of each class on each team, greatly extending the matchmaking wait significantly. But if the devs want to make money (and they do) they will find a way to reduce the wait times. Speaking of which, the money you can spend on this game is for actual improvements to your skills and equipment vs just cosmetic stuff. This can lead to a P2W mentality, but a lot of games survive regardless if they're still fun to play. It's certainly easier to rank up in this game than others I've played. War Thunder would take years to rank up all of your crews if you simply ground your way vs paying to upgrade, for instance. I've spend $85 on that game already!\n\nI'm not very good at reviewing games, so that's all the ramblings of a Christmas Crack Monkey you're going have to put up with for now. Bottom line, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for casual and addictive fun.","December 1, 2013","true","63.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The combat system and mechanics feel unique. I am not really into games like Dota or LoL. I do enjoy smite, but this game is not in the same category as those games even though when you look for similar games to Panzar those always come up.\n\nThe main problem with this game is playerbase. I started playing as an East Coast player in the morning around 8am to 1pm. I had no issues getting into either OnE and PoP games. I do prefer the PvE aspect it has different unique scenarios based on the map. It does have a limited PvE playlist, but it provided me with hours of great gameplay and I still am not bored.\n\nDuring my playtime it was 90% Russian players, which means that teamwork it based on playing together each game and getting used to no vocal or type communication.\n\nI did not find this to be a problem as I prefer this to having 12 yr olds tell me how they have had sex with my mother.  Although it's possible buried in the Russian gibberish in the chat pane she was mentioned.\n\nThis game is kind of like TF2 MvM game mode on extreme difficulty. It is like this in the sense that you are required to work together to defeat the PvE content. Going off on your own pretty much means you are going to die a lot and waste everyone's time.\n\nEach class has great abilities that contribute to the team.\n\nThis game offers very little in way of tutorials. Each character goes through the same boring tutorial and after the first time it does suck. You can choose to skip it, but you lose valuable buff items and having a level up which unlocks a skill point which would greatly hinder you in your first encounter.\n\nThe other non wave based PvE encounters resemble a nice sized dungeon like you would encounter in games like WoW.\n\nYou move through a linear map and complete objectives while battling a large number of enemies. You face a couple of mini boss like minions in a few sections then at the end you have a boss battle.\n\nThere is a steep learning curve in this game. There are many environmental hazards and boss mechanics that you must learn to counter and avoid. Most of the time you learn the hard way.\n\nAt times I felt like What The ♥♥♥♥! As I get gang ♥♥♥♥♥ by about 20 some mobs who chain stun me. This is something you learn to work around. If your team is useful and you're a tank like class they know to widdle the mobs you have aggro on down. There is a lot of kiting in this game at times that can get old if your team is useless. Otherwise it's fun being the center of attention and plowing into a ♥♥♥♥ ton of mobs.\n\nAnyway, if you are on the fence just give it a shot up until around level 10 so you can unlock some of the better skills. The gunner is a wicked class and really dishes out some well needed DPS.\n\nI suggest you check out steam charts to ensure that you are joining when there are over 100 ppl playing. I know the player's is very low, but this game is just too much fun to not give a chance. When I played in the morning during the week I waited less than 3 minutes to get into a game.\n\nHTH,\n-pdTN\n\n","May 8","true","16.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miniling/recommended/240320/","miniling","Miniling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miniling/","72 products in account","A fun game that requires teamwork.\n\nSome may say the game is P2W but I disagree. The statement (of P2W) is based soley on the ability that paying players can buy 'time.' Time that is required to level up and craft gear; gear that requires crafting time, and material (that is needed to craft) awarded by playing the game. Which will inevitabily set back a free player as they need to put a considerable amount of time for gear (comparable to World of Tanks). The statement is also really dependent on the extent of said advantage to a lesser geared player. It is obvious that better gear gives higher stats but the importance of gear comes into question. It is of my opinion that skill prevails overall with gear only being complementary. In fact, several players go naked into battle. (Some hoard their materials for higher level gear)\n\nAny other P2W argument couldn't fit in this game as anything achievable by a paying player (with exception of asethetics/animations that give no advantage) can be achieved by a free player; albeit slower as a free player. But as said in the previous paragraph, it could be seen as P2W since free players would have to essentially grind for their gear. Nevertheless, I still see skill prevailing overall; where teamwork is at the driving wheel as to which team will be victorious.\n\nPanzar's matchmaking generally takes the brunt of the criticism. There are many times where people would become frustrated with the matchmaking mechanic. Most of the frustration really comes to the wait times - but that cannot be helped because, sadly, Panzar doesn't have the population it deserves. The other is: some classes stacking on one team. Let's say, hypothetically, one team has more Orcs (Orcs are the frontline fighters) than the other team, and said team with more Orcs wins. People on the losing team would lay their lost solely because the winning team had more Orcs. This might seem correct but in another instance a team with more Orcs would lose. Having played many matches, I've seen many scenarios played out; and because of this, my perspective is strongly of the idea that the game is heavily dependent on the teamwork used via skill. Everything else jsut complements the players' abilities on either team; it really just comes down to the better team.\n\nAnyways! There are eight classes you can play which is a nice variety. Multiple unique maps, but the basis of every map is 'capture the point.' So far the maps can be classified as either 'stronghold: attack and defend' (which allow siege equipment to be used, cannons, ramps, shields); arena, where there is either 1 point where teams can fight over who holds the single point the most; and, attack defend (similar to stronghold, but with less points to cap, and less to no emphasis on siege equipment).\n\nThe only con I see from this game is its low playerbase.","December 27, 2013","true","101.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Only reason I haven't played it more is because I'm still more interested in AC4 and Batman AO. But those are both $60 value games, so it's unfair to compare with a F2P. Nonetheless it is Pay-to-win.  Contrary to what... alot of the reviewers are saying.  I have yet to find a game dominated repeatedly by a pay to win fanbase.  There are people with less hours than me on here claiming the oppisite, how can they do that? Were they really that unlucky? In the end, this game is free. It only takes about 5 hours or less to download, so it's worth a try.  I like the combat, the art, the leveling system.  Yes, pay to winners can get a big boost but they all die the same if you get em outnumbered which outnumbering happens on a regular back and forth basis, I like it..  But I've actually won more than I've lost.  Now there are only two ways this can happen.  1) There aren't as many pay to win players as others claim or 2) pay to win people are equally put on sperate teams so there is no big domination factor.  At least not on a constant re-occuring basis.  Seeing as how I see alot of half naked people like me running around, I'll go with 1.  If you are half naked, you are just starting.  Its beautiful, fun and free, like I said, it's worth a try.  Just have fun and dont put on your try hard pants right out of tutorial. I mean, it's a free to play.","December 3, 2013","true","5.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Hardcore gamers may have to put money down.\n\nWhat I liked:\n----Combat:\nThe combat is fluid and fast paced.   Every class seems to have a defined role that they are expected                                                 to play for the sake of synergy.   The teamplay doesn't look apparent at first, but after a few hours in you see how the better players coordinate. Tanks will shield allies behind them, Inquistors will assassinate the ranged targets etc.  It can feel a bit "weightless" at times however.\n---- Presentation and Graphics:\nJudging off the tutorial alone, you would assume that this game would actually be a competent single player. (Its not.) However it seems the groundwork has been set for it.  The lore is kinda interesting and all the characters seem quite interesting. (or at least interesting paradodies.)  Dwarves walk on stilts, elves are beauty queen models right up their grotesque faces. The arenas themselves are all gorgeous as well and invoke an interesting world.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n----- Repetitiveness\nGranted, because this is a multiplayer lobby shooter/fighter, you cannot expect too much variety. However it can begin to feel grindy quite quickly. A lot of the battles just begin to feel the same a few hours in, especially since most of the maps have the same objective. Grinding for levels and exp can be quite slow as well, so you may feel quite a drag unless you fork over some real money to expedite everything.\n\n\n\nVerdict: Give the game a try if you want some casual fun, but do not expect too much.  The game aspires to be an esport and the ground work is definately there, but will players stick around for everything else? I don't know.\n\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game tries to be a parody of fanatasy and it does well on that orcs leaping across the map elfs freezing entrie parties to change the course of the battle, and other fun moments.\n\nTrying not to take it self very serious the gameplay at first childish picks up on some maps and later levels to being pure fun while working as a team, although most maps are as simple as run to the middle hold it for as long as possible.\nBack to the childish feel of the gameplay even though you will have a few spells that can knock your enemy back or down your basic attacks will be about as fun to watch as swinging it at the air since they don't do anything, but lower the HP of said enemy not even stoping them from swinging.\n\nFor a game that tries to parody the fantasy world your left feeling like the market place is taking it to serious I mean every thing in this game can be bought with RL cash even leveling. This can turn alot of people away, but all and all it's got plenty of fun for a weekend run maybe a little more if you can clan up and find some good people to play with.\nI don't really need to say much on the graphics since they speak for themself in the screen shots it's a pretty game even if moving around seems blocky at times.\n\nI'd give it a 6.5/10 it does have some redeeming aspects.","November 26, 2013","true","17.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Admittedly there are inherent flaws in the design and it does favor players who are willing to contribute to the game monetarily but that's to be expected from any free game -- after all, designers and programmers and customer support etc., etc. have to earn their keep too.\n\nThere are some solid ideas behind the gameplay despite the problems Panzar has with balancing, and so on and so forth, that provide a good foundation. Most of the other issues are smaller fixes that could, with time and effort, be adjusted and "fixed." If they aren't, then the game isn't worth any serious commitment, but if their staff decides to amp up their game, no pun intended, then maybe playing wouldn't feel like such a waste of time.","January 31, 2014","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You choose a class, lvl doing pvp, no pve at all, gain levels, put stat points in talent tree, craft gear, lvl some more, unlock more abilities, but all while pvping in.\n\nThere is no pve in here so don't lose you time if its what you want, but if you want some solid fighting in a Warhammer atsmosphere, try this game.\n\nFinally, about pay 2 win, bof, more like pay to progress, a la LoL. Yes you can do everything faster if you pay, but whats the point really, unless you only care about reaching the cap asap.

Panzar is a very fun title right out of the box, the paid options basically seem to be 'shortcuts', which I've got no problem with. The progression, even without the paid options, is very satisfying and hasn't frustrated me just yet. The battles take place on some of the best multiplayer maps I've experienced, and while there are by my estimate, fewer than a dozen maps, the variables within each make each battle play out uniquely.\n\nThe classes are varied, and they all have their place and fill their niche nicely. There's certainly something for everyone here, whatever your playstyle may be.\nWhile it does have its share of minor bugs, I've not encountered anything gamebreaking as of yet. The matchmaking during non-primetime hours can get very long and tiresome, leading to many players constantly re-rolling new characters to keep in the common levels 1-3 bracket. I sense that as this game has more time and exposure on steam, some of these matchmaking issues will clear up.\n\nEspecially for the 'price', I highly recommend, one of the best F2P titles I've played.","November 27, 2013","true","34.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Set aside for later.  In a stand mixer, combine the oil, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and gel paste.  Mix until combined.  Add half of your flour mixture into the oil mixture, stirring on low.  Add half of the buttermilk.  Repeat until all the flour and milk is gone and mixture is combined completely.  With mixer on low speed, in a small separate bowl, combine baking soda and vinegar, and quickly add to batter, allowing the mixer to mix for about 10 more seconds.  This will make the batter light and fluffy.   Using a cookie scoop, fill cupcake liners 2/3 full, and bake at 350F for 20 minutes.  Allow to cool to room temperature.\nPrepare buttercreams (white and blue).  Using an round open tip, pipe a blue swirl onto the top of the cupcake.  Then, using a round open tip, slowly build up the white buttercream to a point, shaping it like the Smurf hat.  Add a nose with the blue buttercream by squeezing a small dot onto the blue base of icing.  Add the candy eyes.\n\nHappy Baking 10/10\n\n","December 8, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

When mage has spell ready moves soooo slow and when it cast it - as if nothing happen. If you plan to have this slow movement mechanics - then make spell devastating. Almost no damage vs OP players while they can catch a mage in a blink of an eye. Mana is drained in no time!

Obviously they spent a lot of time in game checking out the full crafting system and playing multiple games and leveling up their characters. The game gets deeper as you go (much like MMORPGs but without the open world).  If you haven't made it to the 6-10 bracket then you're only playing the small maps and not any of the interesting maps that come after that. The first couple of levels are "boring" because its giving you the ground work so you dont get smoked later.\n\nListen... you can call the game P2W... while there is a grind everything in the game can be earned as apposed to paid for. Then again the western market for F2P is horrible with the screaming of P2W.\n\n.:EDIT:.\nadditionally... i dont believe they've put up any North America servers yet. so some of the "issues" are due to NA players playing on Europe servers","November 27, 2013","true","0.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Most of the negative reviews for this game are coming from people who have only played the game on steam and have under an hour on record, not exactly people who's opinion I would trust.\n\nNow for the actual review: The good;\n\n+The game looks visually stunning, it's running on the Cryengine and is one of the most graphically pleasing and atmospheric games available. The terrain and characters are flawlessly animated, the models are excellently rendered and the particle effects are magnificent. However the more technologically minded among you may be wondering "if it looks so good it must have hardware limitations and optimisation issues". Well, not that I can tell. The graphic scaling options allow the game to run on my current PC (I5+HD7950) as well as it does on my five year old PC, just not at the same quality. As for optimisation I can say that, even with the fact that Troxit (the developer, I believe) are a reasonably small operation, they have pulled out all the stops for optimisation, even big budget games like (Battlefield 4 for example) would be envious of the optimisation work that has gone into this game, it runs flawlessly on all of my rigs.\n\n+Variety of game modes. The amount of game modes available and the objectives range from the obvious capture and hold game mode to the simple capture point gauntlet and the simple closed in arena archetype. However there are several truly intriguing game modes along the lines of castle defence and siege game-play. One map involves a team attacking the gate of a castle, breaking in, opening the gates for your allies, securing a safe foothold and then making a stab at the centre of the castle after using a mechanism to raise the final capture point. The variety of game modes here really adds to the flavour of the game and the map designs clearly show an attention to detail on the part of the artistic team.\n\n+Each map has several of its own context sensitive items and mechanics. From slingshots to launch you onto an objective to a siege ramp that allows you to lay siege to a castle. I thoroughly enjoy messing around with these mechanics and finding a way to use them to the best effect. My current favourite trick is to run towards a group of enemies on my dwarf with an explosive barrel in hand and then laugh as the enemy players scurry for dear life. This may not seem like much to some but for me it adds a much needed feeling to the game that other multiplayer games lack.\n\n-----------\n\n+Classes are so diverse that there is enough here for everyone.\n\nTanks, I have a question for you. Do you like playing a tank? Great, a position just opened up, have fun getting in the enemies face and showing them the value of orcish durability. You may need someone to support you, to pick you up when you're feeling down, to protect you with nothing more than pure faith (and magic). These men are known only as...\n\nPALADINS! Do you have a fascination with incense burners and helping incredibly reckless allies to not die within seconds of making contact with the enemy? Great, we could use someone like you. Just avoid huffing too much incense during battle, it's bad for your health kind of like....\n\nA sister of fire! Are you someone who wants to watch the world burn? Do you find yourself wishing you could cause large fireballs to land on small people? This role is for you! Please just watch where you aim, fire isn't the most precise weapon in existence, no that would be...\n\nThe blades of an INQUISITOR! Hide in the shadows, watch and wait in silence as your enemies health dwindles and then ATTACK while yelling "Nobody expects the inquisition!"(Optional but satisfying). Yes the inquisitor is everything you want in a bloodthirsty, puritanical murderer. Your enemies will not see you coming as they feel your blades plunge into their back.\nSapper: "Great, you died! Well don't just stand there!" Get on the sappers teleporter and go back to the fight! Yes, the sapper. A devious creature so well equipped for battle that having one of them at your back is enough to give you the support you need to win any battle. Place traps, build energy replenishing totems and then your greatest creation, a high powered mortar launcher that can turn an invading force into nothing but a charred hole in the battlefield.\nMaybe you like the idea of being a sapper but want to play a more active role? Well the GUNNER class may have what you need. Lay down heavy support fire with your portable heavy machine gun station and let the enemy know that your name is the lord as they're ripped to shreds in a volly of high calibre rounds.\nAll these explosions and fire may sound fun but don't you wish you could cool things down some times? Like...right down...to freezing? The ICE WITCH can do just that for you, the ability to freeze an entire enemy force solid for several seconds leaving them at the mercy of the TRUE lord of the battlefield...\nTHE BERSERKER!

Most of the negative reviews for this game are coming from people who have only played the game on steam and have under an hour on record, not exactly people who's opinion I would trust.\n\nNow for the actual review: The good;\n\n+The game looks visually stunning, it's running on the Cryengine and is one of the most graphically pleasing and atmospheric games available. The terrain and characters are flawlessly animated, the models are excellently rendered and the particle effects are magnificent. However the more technologically minded among you may be wondering "if it looks so good it must have hardware limitations and optimisation issues". Well, not that I can tell. The graphic scaling options allow the game to run on my current PC (I5+HD7950) as well as it does on my five year old PC, just not at the same quality. As for optimisation I can say that, even with the fact that Troxit (the developer, I believe) are a reasonably small operation, they have pulled out all the stops for optimisation, even big budget games like (Battlefield 4 for example) would be envious of the optimisation work that has gone into this game, it runs flawlessly on all of my rigs.\n\n+Variety of game modes. The amount of game modes available and the objectives range from the obvious capture and hold game mode to the simple capture point gauntlet and the simple closed in arena archetype. However there are several truly intriguing game modes along the lines of castle defence and siege game-play. One map involves a team attacking the gate of a castle, breaking in, opening the gates for your allies, securing a safe foothold and then making a stab at the centre of the castle after using a mechanism to raise the final capture point. The variety of game modes here really adds to the flavour of the game and the map designs clearly show an attention to detail on the part of the artistic team.\n\n+Each map has several of its own context sensitive items and mechanics. From slingshots to launch you onto an objective to a siege ramp that allows you to lay siege to a castle. I thoroughly enjoy messing around with these mechanics and finding a way to use them to the best effect. My current favourite trick is to run towards a group of enemies on my dwarf with an explosive barrel in hand and then laugh as the enemy players scurry for dear life. This may not seem like much to some but for me it adds a much needed feeling to the game that other multiplayer games lack.\n\n-----------\n\n+Classes are so diverse that there is enough here for everyone.\n\nTanks, I have a question for you. Do you like playing a tank? Great, a position just opened up, have fun getting in the enemies face and showing them the value of orcish durability. You may need someone to support you, to pick you up when you're feeling down, to protect you with nothing more than pure faith (and magic). These men are known only as...\n\nPALADINS! Do you have a fascination with incense burners and helping incredibly reckless allies to not die within seconds of making contact with the enemy? Great, we could use someone like you. Just avoid huffing too much incense during battle, it's bad for your health kind of like....\n\nA sister of fire! Are you someone who wants to watch the world burn? Do you find yourself wishing you could cause large fireballs to land on small people? This role is for you! Please just watch where you aim, fire isn't the most precise weapon in existence, no that would be...\n\nThe blades of an INQUISITOR! Hide in the shadows, watch and wait in silence as your enemies health dwindles and then ATTACK while yelling "Nobody expects the inquisition!"(Optional but satisfying). Yes the inquisitor is everything you want in a bloodthirsty, puritanical murderer. Your enemies will not see you coming as they feel your blades plunge into their back.\nSapper: "Great, you died! Well don't just stand there!" Get on the sappers teleporter and go back to the fight! Yes, the sapper. A devious creature so well equipped for battle that having one of them at your back is enough to give you the support you need to win any battle. Place traps, build energy replenishing totems and then your greatest creation, a high powered mortar launcher that can turn an invading force into nothing but a charred hole in the battlefield.\nMaybe you like the idea of being a sapper but want to play a more active role? Well the GUNNER class may have what you need. Lay down heavy support fire with your portable heavy machine gun station and let the enemy know that your name is the lord as they're ripped to shreds in a volly of high calibre rounds.\nAll these explosions and fire may sound fun but don't you wish you could cool things down some times? Like...right down...to freezing? The ICE WITCH can do just that for you, the ability to freeze an entire enemy force solid for several seconds leaving them at the mercy of the TRUE lord of the battlefield...\nTHE BERSERKER! No. Nobody is bigger, nobody is stronger, and you can be sure that nobody is DUMB ENOUGH to stand head to head with this barbarous monster. Where the others such as the inquisitor find refuge in the shadows and the gunner depends on range to protect him the BERSERKER! only knows one thing. A dead enemy is not a threat. Smash the stupidity out of any enemy that dares to stand in your way. The berserker waits club in hand for a day when he meets an enemy will be able to withstand his  sheer might.

You get 5 gems every time you level in this game and by level 5 you can get the recruit pack which gives you premium for 7 days and a bunch of runes. Which is all you need to put yourself on a level playing field. After that if you are still playing the game after that maybe you should cough up some money? Most of the people disliking the game haven't even played an hour.\n\nWith all that said the game matches you with people who are relatively near you in levels and power. So if you just buy a bunch of levels and gear you aren't going to be just beating up level 1 people for fun. Really you will be up against better people then you because they will know how to actually play.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nThe game basically plays like a mix of WoW and TF 2, the classes are all useful and fairly interesting. Though some are abit better then others. The game is just gorgeous and it runs well on high end systems which is more then I could say for crysis 3. The castle siege maps in particular are quite epic with devasting cannons and catapaults that can launch you over the defenders walls. Think objective mode in chivalry, or the assault maps from UT.

The entire concept is based around teamwork and how well you and your teammates can effectively plan or work together. The best games are when both sides do this effectively, leading to huge brawls over a control point that can last for minutes.\n\nGeneral Gameplay: ( 9/10 ) Some classes could use a bit of tweaking in terms of fairness, but the overall class balance is nice.\n\nGraphics: ( 10/10) Beautiful graphics and a gorgeous arena on every map, not to mention certain maps have awesome features. One example is a wintery map has a blizzard every so often and makes visibility practically 0, making it hard for both teams to fight coherently.\n\nFighting Mechanics: ( 7/10) Could use some improvement, but it includes a working block system, power attack/regular attack combo and every class has atleast 2 ways to attack, one from melee and one from range.\n\nMap Mechanics: ( 10/10 ) I have not found a game that has unique map interfaces like this one. If you're sieging a castle, you can work with your team to build siege ladders to get to the control point and defenders can destroy them. Or you can put up gates and barricades to slow attackers down for a while and give yourself not only a bit of breathing room, but a more manageable way to fight the enemy and maintain control.\n\nMultiplayer: ( 5/10 ) The reason this score is low is solely because the game is -entirely- PvP. There is no such thing as PvE for joking around with friends - only the cold, harsh battleground. Another deduction is from the game's seeming 'pay to win' at later levels - instead of having to farm gear, players could simply buy the highest tier gear. Even if it is availible to everyone, it would certainly give them a bit of advantage.","December 5, 2013","true","29.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Moba with only a few maps giving you lanes, not the same kind of lanes in a traditional MOBA since, but lanes none the less that allows you to flank and take objectives through an ambush type of take over.\n\n2.

This game gives you the bare bones to which you build off of allowing you to create your own champion, tailored to you and your play style.\n\n3. No item store like DOTA2 or LOL. You literaly build your character through time and progression.\n\n4. You gain materials to build things after each match regardless if you win or lose.

You start your first character: You choose 1 of the 6 available classes at the beginning (2 more classes unlock as you level a character) and then choose your name and you're good to go. You can either choose to do the tutorial (which I think is basic but might help a bit) or start playing for real either in PvP or PvE. If you complete the tutorial, you get some potions and you automatically level up to level 2, which grants you access to a new skill (you can get a new skill every level for free).\n\nNow, for the gameplay, I think this game is original. Some might say it's repetitive, but you can always change tactics and team-play with your mates, which is the key to victory as Panzar is a team-based game. Each class has the same base mechanic: left-click for a basic melee attack and right-click for a powerful melee attack, which consumes energy (that replenish by itself or when you attack enemies with a normal attack and blocking, with CTRL. Then, as you level up, you get skills. Every class has really different skills that are useful in different situations. Those skills are placed on one or two skills bar in the bottom of the screen, using the F* keys or the numbers 0 to 9 on the keyboard. You can craft equipment from the materials you gain every time you finish a level, which are used to get more HP and Mastery. Mastery affects every attack and every skill by increasing their power, so they deal more damage. The thing is, even if you got equipment, your skills (real life skills, not the skills/powers in game) will really affect you in a good or bad way. There is no automatic aim and you need to aim your attacks and powers on your enemies by yourself if you want to deal damages.\n\nGraphics: Just, WOW. Probably the best graphics ever in a free to play game. Just to give you an idea, Panzar uses the CryEngine 3. Folliage, vegetation, lightning effects and effects in general are stunning. The textures are really good and all of that, maxed out, will require you to have a really good computer. However, I found that very intelligent, I got two computers: A really crappy one and a really good one, but both computers can actually play the game with decent FPS! One one the lowest settings and one on the highest... but, hey, I can still play on a crappy computer! That's an example of what I call a greatly optimized game.\n\nCons: Crafting can be a pain as it requires a lot of time and a lot of ressources after a certain level, but it is still achievable. Another con is that half the players on this game won't really play as a team and mostly result in multiple defeats.\n\nVerdict: I really recommend this game and if you're not so sure about it, just try it! It's free after all. I almost have 350 hours on record and I don't even reached max level on any of my characters (max level is 30, which is plenty).\n\nI'd give this game a nice 8/10.","June 20, 2014","true","470.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sure, there are things to purchase to speed up the time it takes to craft items, you can purchase items for crafting, purchase items outright, purchase 'premium' account time, etc.. but honestly I think they did this right.  The game is quite enjoyable, and some might call it a 'MOBA' game - don't know anything about it, can't compare them.  To me it's like a straight-on PvP (teams) deathmatch with arcane magic, orcs, dwarves, 'steampunkish' weapons, and no lag or stutter or frame rate issues.  Graphics are quite good, and overall it's an enjoyable game, and less demanding on reflexes than ArcheBlade is.

However, after spending some time getting the game installed, updated as well as the times that I could actually finish a match without the game just randomly closing, it became apparent that this game is very shallow in the game-play department and is monetized very heavily.\n\nI encountered some problems with installation as well as this game didn't like my anti-virus solution requiring me to disable it during the installation of the game which shouldn't be necessary and is the first time I have had to do so in a very long time.\n\nThe micro-transactions present in this game make it very much a pay to win game. They allow you to purchase hero levels, gear, consumables, etc which gives those who spend a good amount of money a significant advantage early on and a continued advantage later in the game.\n\nThe tutorial was very short and is the same for each class save for the 30 seconds where the game allows you to use your class specific ability. For completing the tutorial you get enough experience to level up your character and some potions.\n\nThe game-play itself felt very unrefined and balanced heavily around melee combat. Attacking felt very inconsistent as to if your strike would actually hit the enemy and blocking seemed very sluggish an unreliable. most class abilities are limited to a few uses before you are out of mana and then have to chug a potion to continue, engage in melee combat regardless if you are playing a melee class or not, or block and hope your team-mates are around to kill them while you recharge your primary resource. Death can take but a few seconds and then you must wait up to 20 to re-spawn.\n\nPros:\n- It is free to play.\n- The game looks fantastic.\n- UI is clean and intuitive.\n- Shows promise if they can clean up combat and remove micro-transactions that grant characters power.\n\nCons:\n- Combat felt very wonky.\n- Perceived low player amount as games I played were frequently not full and teams were lopsided.\n- I personally encountered installation problems as well as stability issues throughout my play time.\n- Heavily monetized to the point of Pay to Win.\n-- Can purchase hero levels with real money to make character more powerful.\n-- Can purchase gear with real money as an alternative to earning and crafting it.\n-- Potion (Heath, Mana, and Energy) use is mandatory and you mush craft or purchase them.","November 26, 2013","false","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

As a F2P game it has really good graphic, be realistic guys, did you ever seen a F2P game which have such a good graphic like Panzar? I think not. This game WAS Pay to Win but now, since few patches ago, its not longer! You can craft everything without pay any Cent into this game. You need only time, nothing else. Panzar has also a Tournament System.\nPanzar is the best Teamwork game you ever played. You can't win a game without teamwork. But you need to know, this teamwork "feeling" you cant see on low lvl, only on high games. Just watch Tournaments and you will see what i mean:D\nTournament example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu1LwKqt53w\n\nIf you start to play this game, you will notice that this game plays a lot of russians. This game made by russians devs and isnt so familiar in Europe and USA yet.\nThe Main Problem in this game is the low playerbase which makes a bad matchmaking and even you need to wait sometimes long for a game, depend on the time when you want to play.\n\nIf you want to watch this game in action go on http://www.panzar.ru/en/Stream\n\nPositiv:\n-Graphic\n-Tournament System\n-100% F2P (No P2W!)\n-PvP, PvE!\n-Different game modes (Siege, King of Hill, Convoy)\n-Teamwork\n\nNegativ:\n-low playerbase -> bad matchmaking (not devs fault, its just a generally problem)\n-Long time in the queue to find a game -> bcs low playerbase","December 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

The same as any other game. Dont take it serious, this game is all about brute force and how fast to can Power Shot your opponent.\n\nFirst things first: Play with friends. Trust me pre mades and Group fights are quickly a drawn back. Solo is not so great since the game rewards team work.\n\nThe crafting system reeks of pay to win aspect, with a hint at "hey if you play long enough you might get that item you want." Which is ok for my self I dont mind. I dont like the fact that most items during the building/Crafting process take real time to make. Kind of lame and again very pay to win. you can spend money to speed up the process. crafting items are giving by winning and losing matchs. with varying amounts each time. Multiple play thrus will get you closer to that item you want.\n\nSkill Tree: muiltple skills with varying abilitys. My healing spells were very good for a rank 2 chacter.\n\nPoints= EXP: Sadly no real large amounts of points where giving for healing. I healed about 17K one round and only got around 345 points. where as the lead team had about 1200 points. Game seems eager to give more points for Objective and Kills, rather then Support. Sucks but what ev.\n\nGraphics: looks very nice but unless you got the RAM to back it up some video LAG and Frame Rate drop because of muitlple players can get u killed. The maps seem repetative but still fun.\n\nWhy I play it: meh it seemed nice and fun. Laughed alot due to the Ragdoll phys. again dont go with it being any different then other MOBA's. play with friends trust me.","November 26, 2013","true","21.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Какую игру ни возьми, везде перестрелки, пулемёты, гранаты и прочие атрибуты современного треша.\n\nСтранно, что онлайн игра Panzar — явилась чуть ли не первой удачной попыткой сделать настоящий командный экшен в стиле фэнтези. Хотя идея очень долго витала в воздухе.\n\nПанзар - игра бесплатная и от русских разработчиков, что радует, так как проект сделан на мировом уровне, благодаря передовому движку Cry Engin 3 Конечно, это не Crysis с точки зрения физики.\n\nЗато всю мощь знаменитого немецкого движка вы можете оценить по графике игры, которая на голову превосходит всё, что я когда-либо видел в онлайне. С первых же минут вы сразу же убедитесь, что Панзар — это удивительно красивая ММО-игра.\n\nРисовка уровней поднята на беспрецедентную высоту. Все текстуры проработаны очень качественно. Подобную графику не часто встретишь даже в современных офлайн-играх, чего уж говорить об онлайне, где модельки из десяти полигонов и локации, от которых вытекают глаза, вполне привычное явление.\n\nВ Панзаре же мы видим совершенно иную картину - если это снег, то виден каждый сугроб, если это луга, то видно, как переливается на солнце буквально каждая травинка, если вода — то живая, журчащая, бегущая меж камней, скалы так и хочется пощупать, а уж какие здесь деревья! Прорисован каждый листочек, каждая иголочка на сосне. Причём пропорции персонажей и окружающего мира абсолютно реалистичны.\n\nНо графика — это ещё не вся игра, скажете вы, и будете правы.\n\n","May 9","true","29.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It's riddled with display bugs - I set my resolution to 1920x1080 and I was unable to remove my cursor from the screen while in game. I set the resolution to 1600x900 - windowed mode, and the same issue persisted.\n\n- The combat is very clunky, and blood flys from your SWORD rather than the ENEMY you attack, very weird.\n\n- Some of the UI is cut off on the bottom, you can only see half of your icons on the hot bar which makes it frustrating to see which hotbar icons you are clicking or pressing via keyboard.\n\n- The game itself is visually appealing, and very pretty. Models are great, and the character design is very intuitive. Character creation is similar to WoW/MMO-like.\n\nOverall, very good visual state, just some lacking issues with the video displays, UI, and mouse overlay.","November 27, 2013","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's riddled with display bugs - I set my resolution to 1920x1080 and I was unable to remove my cursor from the screen while in game. I set the resolution to 1600x900 - windowed mode, and the same issue persisted.\n\n- The combat is very clunky, and blood flys from your SWORD rather than the ENEMY you attack, very weird.\n\n- Some of the UI is cut off on the bottom, you can only see half of your icons on the hot bar which makes it frustrating to see which hotbar icons you are clicking or pressing via keyboard.\n\n- The game itself is visually appealing, and very pretty. Models are great, and the character design is very intuitive. Character creation is similar to WoW/MMO-like.\n\nOverall, very good visual state, just some lacking issues with the video displays, UI, and mouse overlay.","November 27, 2013","false","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Visual side is beautiful but the gameplay is hell. Starting with 10min queue and ending with absence of minimap which can be realy anoying in the not so straightforward maps. Also I dont see the reason for showing how much dmg you are doing if there is no lifebars. Also if you spend several games gathering random resources, trading them for the ones you need (with painful exchange rate) and the loose it all in 70ish% chande for success can be really anoying. It also seems to me that the frost mage class is a lot imbalaced.\nI played the game for some 5-6 hours (most time waiting for the matches) and I am not impressed. Seems like the developers put incedible amount of effort to grafics which is just great, but in the expanse of gameplay. And in my oppinion  gameplay matters the most in MOBA style games.\nMaybe I'll come back when they improve it more.","March 2","false","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Please, for the sake of your sanity, NEVER play this. At least, not past the tutorial.\n\nThe tutorial was actually ok. It was pretty simplistic, but the dialogue was funny, and the voice acting was... passable. Each class gets a unique tutorial, which I appreciated. The graphics, which I set to mid-level, were good for the most part, but everything that was far away would jump in and out of existance all the time, which was really annoying. All-in-all, not great, but not terrible, which is leagues above most F2P games.\n\nThen came the letdown. I joined a PvE match, which went fairly well. It matched me with an array of teammates pretty quickly, and it loaded up speedily. As soon as it started, though, everything went downhill. Out of all of our team, we only had one damage-dealing class, which became a huge problem right out of the gates. The game throws undreds of enemies at you, which wouldn't be a problem if they were weak. Unfortunately, the weaker ones took 10 hits from our strongest fighter, and the elite mobs took closer to 50. You can't inturrupt them, either, but they sure can inturrupt you! Some of the later-level mooks can stun you for a good 5 seconds at a time, and have a short cooldown on the stun attack. Even better, they come in groups of 8-10, swarming you while your teammates are busy with the other 6 swarms of baddies. My favorite enemies, though, are the kamikaze goblins. They come up, throw a bomb at their feet, and wipe out the whole team. I played a tank, and at full health, I could only take 2 of these guys, and you can't defend from explosions. at one point, we had to get through a cave, which was filled to the brim with around 25 of these guys, and HUNDREDS of the stun guys. Needless to say, I was frustrated at that point. The best part, though, came soon after that. After getting pushed into the 1-hit-kill WATER about 5 times, by teammates, enemies, and glitches, I alt-tabbed out to check skype, upon which the game dissapeared from my desktop. It was still on, it showed up in task manager, it just did not show up on the bar at the bottom of my screen. I could not play the game after alt-tabbing. No. Thank. You.\n\nThis game is terrible. This game makes me want to stab my computer with a knife. Please don't give these people money.","June 7, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's simply a constant deathmatch, with some classic handheld "f2p"-elements chucked in. To make matters worse, it took me an hour to get it to install and properly (SLI rig). It also has a habit of just acting wierdly, such as displaying the mouse cursor at random times. Tutorial is a three minute runthrough that apparently explains some lore. Besides the standard "use WSAD" to move, there's not much else being explained, such as class or game mechanics. I really tried giving the benefit of doubt, but after the fifth crash and tenth "failed to install third party component" I just gave up.\n\nAll in all, 2/5.

Matchmaking is horrible, you can be level 1 facing level 10, with no way to do anything to them. The crafting is real time based, and you can spend real money to skip the timer. All the items that impact gameplay can be crafted, as well as purchased with real money. The opponents can block frontal attacks, but turning is faster than running behind, so they in 1v1 they can pretty much block you and wait for help to arrive. The game focused more on zerging than individual play. It's free so feel free to try it yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alk0h0l/recommended/240320/","Alk0h0l","General Fredrik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alk0h0l/","418 products in account","After booting the game up I met my first problem: the game wasn't scaling correctly for my ordinary monitor (BenQ G2450HM) so I had these black bars that covered my bottom abilities bar. So I changed to resolution to 1920x1080 and that didn't help at all. The game still has these weird black bars on every side and it looks cramped. Sure, I could see my abilities bar again but why can't the game be put on full screen? Why does it have to make it smaller and screw up my firefox on my second monitor? (BenQ GW2450HM) Christ almighty what a bad start.\n\nIgnoring those issues I thought that perhaps the game would be better. OH BOY WAS I MISTAKEN.\n\nThe first 10 seconds into my game, it just stopped completely. It just shut down and Steam syncronized as it does when you close a game. Fine. I boot it up again. This time I got to do my character but then it crashed immediately. Great. So I go into the forums and apparently, I'm not the only one who gets constant crashing. So I do what they say: validate files on Steam. Sure enough the game has to download 54 missing files! Uuuh? What? Then my launcher tells me I have to download an additional 100mb of update.\n\nThe game has been out since the 12th of April 2013. Perhaps time to step up your game development team?\n\nSo after all that baloney I finally make my Dwarf Cannoner. I enter the the tutorial AAAND it crashes. WHOPPIE. What a fantastically optimized game. I launch it again and this time, I am able to play through the tutorial and get to the end. By the way, perhaps you should nerf the guards who defend the gate? Since they one hit the zombies and you can barely get a swing at the zombies before they die, I don't see why there is such a rush to help them defend. They could exterminate the entire tutorial island without an issue and still be back for tea time.\n\nAfter that god awful tutorial I click the big red button that says PLAY!\n\nMy first map is the one with the lava that comes up from time to time. I rush out with my team and set up a machinegun so I can blast away the enemies. Except the gun does pretty much zero damage and I overheat my gun and get killed. My camera goes absolutely bananas when the lava starts coming up and then the game crashes!\n\nMajestical performance.\n\nI boot up the game and immediately press play and jump into a game. Before I go any further, is there some secret that I don't understand about respawning? I got into a fight and killed some mentalist guy and he respawned before I could set up my turret as a Dwarf cannoner. As I was building it, the same guy "bootlord" or something, came running up to me and bashed my head in. While my respawn timer was nearly 19 seconds long. He on the other hand had plenty of time running around, slaughtering my team. I saw no way of respawning faster or anything! I played the entire round but we got steam rolled since "Bootlord" or whatever his name was constantly ran out from spawn after he died and pretty much handed our poor, uncoordinated butts to us.\n\nCon's:\n\n-Can't handle 1920x1080 for some reason, ugly black bars and messes up my second monitor\n-Crashes if I try to play it\n-Energy bar is wack, drains if you jump while running at the exact same speed as running(!)\n-Who thought that having a fixed camera angle to your corpse on a moving platform was a good idea?\n-You need to update it several times before you can get it working for less then 20 minutes\n-Pay 2 win\n-Really glitchy hitboxes, Oh Mr. Orc, your swing hit my despite the fact that I was behind another character? Great\n\nPro's:\n\nEasy to uninstall and especially easy to exit since the game does it for you\n\nAvoid at all costs.

Getting into a game with several classes is practicly impossible - 30 minute waiting for a game is not that everyone can handle. 2 minutes just to check for updates, so when i tried to just get it running, it took 2 hours from my life, and half of that was just because of the scanning that must be done EVERY SINGLE TIME, nevermind that you just checked 5 secs ago. OK, got it running (atlast), created a character, tried to play a tutorial, crashes again (after 30 minutes of searching for cure, found out that the game doesnt support certain properties of nvidia, fixed it no prob), i get into a game again, and to get you guys understand what i'm talking about is 5 minutes loading screen on my powerful PC. SO after 2 hours i run the game, create a character with a class i dont admire, quite an unpopular one, and i start searching for a MATCH. And i'm stuck on loading time once more, now 15 minutes of loading have passed already and there is no response what so ever in that regard. This is a disgrace, really, most of these F2P games are soooo damn uncoded, they have an excelent idea, but the programming background is so shady... I'm not the one to cry about F2P games, i just tried most of the games that are out there and i'm searching a game, which i would enjoy, and yet i could spend money on (i'm a game geek). Conclusion - another unsuccesful steam powered game, had HIGH expectations for this one, and yet again (like with Path of Exile) it let me down just because of the coding side of he game.","January 8, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I may not have played it for long, but I couldn't. I've spent easily 4 times longer on load screens than I have anything else. I managed the tutorial quests on two of the characters and have crashed three times. My computer is more than powerful enough for this to run at maximum settings with no issues, yet I get low framerates and of the jumpiest, messiest gameplay I've ever experienced in a game. This is coming from the tutorial so i can only imagine what actual gameplay looks like. As of now, the game is mostly unplayable. If they fix the lag, load time, and crash issues, the game could be more than well worth the effort.

You are able to craft gear, or buy it with real money. The crafting requires loot given at the end of matches, as well as a time restriction. By the time I had reached level 4 I was only able to craft 2/6 level 1 pieces of gear. Level 4 is the next tier for equipment, and I had reached it before having even HALF of the level 1 equipment crafted. Whereas if I spent real money, everything would just be mine... and I could go on to melt faces with my wallet protected character.\n\nNow the classes... I enjoy healing so I normally play support. In Panzar the healer is the Paladin... very low damage and very low survivability (As he can't heal himself unless healing others, and the self-heal is maybe 10% of what others are healed for). So basically any opponent who is paying attention can kill you fairly quickly. Gameplay is basically horribly imbalanced.\n\nNow for the player base. Many players just seem to ignore objectives and run into the closest fight. Players with experience never share it, they simply call everyone noobs when the team starts to lose. No advice or direction, no leadership... just insults.  It's basically like any online PvP oriented game.\n\nI would give this game a 3/10. Good ideas but a horrible execution.\n\nAnd my absolute least favourite thing is jumping. The jumping animation for character is terrible. Worst jumping I have ever seen.","January 9, 2014","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Getting into a game with several classes is practicly impossible - 30 minute waiting for a game is not that everyone can handle. 2 minutes just to check for updates, so when i tried to just get it running, it took 2 hours from my life, and half of that was just because of the scanning that must be done EVERY SINGLE TIME, nevermind that you just checked 5 secs ago. OK, got it running (atlast), created a character, tried to play a tutorial, crashes again (after 30 minutes of searching for cure, found out that the game doesnt support certain properties of nvidia, fixed it no prob), i get into a game again, and to get you guys understand what i'm talking about is 5 minutes loading screen on my powerful PC. SO after 2 hours i run the game, create a character with a class i dont admire, quite an unpopular one, and i start searching for a MATCH. And i'm stuck on loading time once more, now 15 minutes of loading have passed already and there is no response what so ever in that regard. This is a disgrace, really, most of these F2P games are soooo damn uncoded, they have an excelent idea, but the programming background is so shady... I'm not the one to cry about F2P games, i just tried most of the games that are out there and i'm searching a game, which i would enjoy, and yet i could spend money on (i'm a game geek). Conclusion - another unsuccesful steam powered game, had HIGH expectations for this one, and yet again (like with Path of Exile) it let me down just because of the coding side of he game.","January 8, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I may not have played it for long, but I couldn't. I've spent easily 4 times longer on load screens than I have anything else. I managed the tutorial quests on two of the characters and have crashed three times. My computer is more than powerful enough for this to run at maximum settings with no issues, yet I get low framerates and of the jumpiest, messiest gameplay I've ever experienced in a game. This is coming from the tutorial so i can only imagine what actual gameplay looks like. As of now, the game is mostly unplayable. If they fix the lag, load time, and crash issues, the game could be more than well worth the effort. Until then, I'd reccomend reading other reviews and possibly avoiding it all together.","January 9, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are able to craft gear, or buy it with real money. The crafting requires loot given at the end of matches, as well as a time restriction. By the time I had reached level 4 I was only able to craft 2/6 level 1 pieces of gear. Level 4 is the next tier for equipment, and I had reached it before having even HALF of the level 1 equipment crafted. Whereas if I spent real money, everything would just be mine... and I could go on to melt faces with my wallet protected character.\n\nNow the classes... I enjoy healing so I normally play support. In Panzar the healer is the Paladin... very low damage and very low survivability (As he can't heal himself unless healing others, and the self-heal is maybe 10% of what others are healed for). So basically any opponent who is paying attention can kill you fairly quickly. Gameplay is basically horribly imbalanced.\n\nNow for the player base. Many players just seem to ignore objectives and run into the closest fight. Players with experience never share it, they simply call everyone noobs when the team starts to lose. No advice or direction, no leadership... just insults.  It's basically like any online PvP oriented game.\n\nI would give this game a 3/10. Good ideas but a horrible execution.\n\nAnd my absolute least favourite thing is jumping. The jumping animation for character is terrible. Worst jumping I have ever seen.","January 9, 2014","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I liked the class selection and found that each class was reasonably balanced, but the game does a lot of F2P elements that I dislike. Crafting is done via real time, so it can take hours (maybe days) to craft new equipment for your character. There are a number of other things that give off the feeling of pay2win. To be fair, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with the game, so I could be mistaken on that.\n\nThe gameplay is basically King of the Hill with some variation depending on the map you are on. Hit detection is pretty weak (making it hard to determine if you're actually hitting your targets) and the animations are poor. The player-to-player collision is frequently obnoxious, because it allows you to push your allies around (or be pushed) and allies are often in the way.\n\nThe game also follows the unfortunate trope of half-naked female characters.\n\nOverall, I had some fun playing it, but I can't really see myself going back for more.","November 28, 2013","false","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is 100% Pay2Win.\n\nThe launcher is buggy, requires to fiddle around and google for solutions for update. Game itself is fun, fast paced team arena style game.\nControls feel responsive, although if not for the hit marker you wouldn't be even able to tell whether you hit somebody or not, becouse it feels like you are swinging in the air. Gameplay is fun, although most of the time it's steamrolling becouse everyone either uses tanks to spam and blitz win, or they spam with turrets which is no fun for the most part. The game itself however does offer many customization options in the means of armor, character looks and powers. It has a forging system which is tedious becouse it requires you to farm materials, and that takes time. And of course you can pay real money and level and equip your character fully as it is in the most games, which makes the game kinda P2 win. But for a F2P game it has a lot of potential and is at times extremely fun to play.","November 26, 2013","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It utilizes simple attacks and 'power' attacks, alongside several class-specific abilities that grow in number and power as your character progresses in levels. Unfortunately, the attack have very little 'weight' behind them, and typically one on one combat is devolved to strafing while tossing out little and big hits and the occasional burp of an ability. The fact there are currently no North American servers in operation is also a deterrant to American, Canadian and so on players that seek a PvP experience with a PING level promoting completely even playing grounds. Also refer to that fact that equipment can be outright bought with real life money, thus possibly leading you to combat peers with armor leagues ahead of what you could have possibly acquired without paying.

The animations are a joke, your character can't really jump without looking like he's trying to fake a moon landing, but for some reason he sniffs his pits every 5 seconds, then wretches at the stench. I guess pit sniffing took priority over smooth combat animations.\n\nThe class balance is completely worthless, the tank class is essentially immune to ranged attacks, so since every single match is won by controlling a wide open control point whichever team has more tanks has an absurdly huge advantage. You simply can't win if your team consists of a majority of ranged characters, the win condition is controlling a point, and the enemy unit that does it can't be hurt from a distance. Healers can't heal themselves, so they are completely worthless unless your team has 2 of them that can heal each other, as the enemy will single out and kill a lone healer in seconds every time. Frost mages can freeze you solid, then kill you before you have any real chance to react. The slow animations really rear their ugly head when an enemy is using a highly telegraphed PbAoE spell that you absolutely need to avoid and you're simply unable to waddle out of its range or interrupt it before it hits you.\n\nOne look at the team compositions will tell you who wins the match every single time. Since the reward for winning is twice what you get for losing it's extremely frustrating to rarely ever have a close match.\n\nThis game is also the worst kind of Free to Play there is. From the moment you start the game it's clear that it is built to frustrate you unless you pay. Everything worthwhile is purchased with their premium resource. Whether or not you can get items without paying for premium is pure luck, as you have to construct them from resources that randomly drop from matches. The only upside is that the premium services are cheap, but the game itself simply isn't good enough to bother with.","November 28, 2013","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Sloppy\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n\nThis game look great, interface is clean and easy to navigate. Queues are way to long with no real indication that the game is doing anything. I thought my system was slow loading at first but then I realized it was just the game rounding up players. PvP gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Enemy tags sometimes show up late and since you are playing folks from all around the world there is latency issues. It is kind of chaotic at times. Doesnt feel as if you are doing any damage because there is no significant reaction to a successful hit, a small combat text is shown but it feels soft. A bunch of orcs swinging away on a capture point feels sloppy. If the devs went and played SMITE - copied their queue system and took notice to their combat - this game would be gold. Otherwise, I feel it will just fade away into nothingness.","October 25, 2014","false","4.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

And no people are not wrong when they say that it, like many games these days, although being free-to-play is pay-to-win. You can craft items, and wait real time for them to finish crafting OR you can instantly buy them with crystal-looking things that you can, of course, purchase with real money. I'm not really sure what this game is trying to be, but as an amalgum of it's part as a whole, it is just a weird experience and not one i'll be going back to.","November 25, 2013","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

That was a good skill so i put that point.\nAnd finally game tells me that I am ready to fight and there's a big arrow directed at the big play button.\nOk so I am thinking about looking at wardrobe, weapons or something usefull before battle and then...\n...NOPE - you must battle and pvp only! You can only exit game or fight - no other options. Meh ok so i clicked it and waited.\nFirst I was thinking like - oh it is loading so long because of my crappy pc?\nI went to look at the Internet and Steam discussion board  and i found that after last ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update game lost some playerbase and it was not my pc and long loading times...   ...It hasn't even loaded a map - it was searching for match.\n\n\nConclusion\nCrafting chance system = less players, more waiting in queue and less money for devs - (good for them)\nI am not telling that the game is bad or something (I didn't even had a chance to play one match)\n\nBut I'll rate anyways.\nFrustration 420/10 IGN - I'am going to get addicted to smoking again\n\nSuch queue, so much wait.

It controls terribly, and for added benefits it straight up didn't recognize when I pressed the 1 key, which means I didn't get through the tutorial. What's great though - and I really, truly, definitely mean great - are the animations for female characters. They are COMEDY GOLD. Those butts swing as though they're trying to singlecheekedly cross the Atlantic, with every possible animation meant to draw attention to those prominent posteriors. They're so bad that if they were in an intelligently made game they could actually be believed to be parody. In this game, it is clear that they are a desperate attempt to keep a player invested in dressing up his elf in cash shop lingerie. Unfortunately in this age of easily-accessed porn, such simple dressup games no longer exhilarate me, and I cannot recommend Panzar: Elf Lingerie Broken Combat Simulator.","December 15, 2013","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I don't care how much hot elven a$s there is in the game, I'm not putting up with that rubbish for what I hear is only a mediocre P2W grindfest anyway. Just don't bother.","December 7, 2013","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I was thinking aha pay to win ok. And yeah if you are premium user you get more xp and money and resourses from combat. Ok so what can it cost then wel you buy it in gems that you pay 4 so you need premium 1 day its 15 gems and 25 gems is 1 euro. So if you want premium for a month it cost you 250 gems that is 10 euro srsly that almsot the cost to play wow. So i was testing the game i didnt like that much it was ok. But i was thinking 4 myself it kinda remind me off guildwars pvp. And i have high performance computer but it take alot off time to come into the game.

The maps i played in the time where simply awful also, no hiding spots or anything really two spawns each corners of the map and very little inbetween.\n\nThe tutorial was laughable basically nothing happened it wasn't very informative of anything like the crafting system. At the start you are not able to craft anything like a starter set of armour so you are basically running around in nothing at all especially if you are the spell slingers what by the way if you are trying to make them look attractive change the face because they just look strange. Another thing in the main menu there was like 5 advertisements to buy their currency and you could actually level up ingame using this currency what's simply stupid in a game. The game also what i've heard and what i can now tell as you can also buy ingame gear what's also very silly as the main purpose of the game is to get gear? Also i found that 90% of the games i joined 12 year old kids where spamming their microphones giving me a headache mite of just been the 3 games that i played.\n\nAvoid this game maybe try it just for a laugh. I don't even know why this has been brought to steam.\nAlso one bug that was REALLY annoying what i encountered was there was my mouse constantly on my screen but i sorted it by pressing T then esc.","November 30, 2013","false","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I tried the beserker class (damage dealer, melee)\n\nThe graphic is okay, but not awesome.\nThe controls are sluggish. It takes some practice to anticipate the enemies hit boxes correctly and fight effectively.\n\nYou have two main currencies: rubies in exchange for real money, and gold which is earned with each match you play.\nI say "main currencies" because there is something else which the game calls "ingredients" or "crafting material" which is also earned with each match you play. If you are on "VIP"-mode (costs real life money) you get more. These materials are used for crafting new equipment. Since the material you get is generated randomly after each match this is rather useless. They could have left out this kind of "currency" and replace it simply with the gold as well. It's just something which I would call a "fake-feature".\n\nCrafting new equipment takes a lot of material. You get the possibility to craft new equipment by increasing your char level (done by experience gain through playing). While "light" and "medium" equipment seems achieveable in a reasonable amount of time, the best quality level "unique" takes material for which you can farm easily 50-100 matches (each match takes between 5 and 20 minutes). Then you have hopefully gathered enough material for one (1) crafting attempt. Yes, right, an "attempt"! For the "fun" of it you only have a -chance- of succeeding the crafting attempt. 70% for "light" gear, 50% for "medium" gear and 20% for "unique" gear, which only translates into even longer material gathering. If course you can increase the crafting chance, if you are willing to invest some rubies (money).\n\nNow comes the real absurd part: You can as well buy any equipment for a relatively small amount of rubies (real life money) instant.\nThat is my major problem: Your choice is to spend hours over hours farming for materials for an item or you give in to the temptation and just buy the wanted item. The problem is the comparativeness. The pricing always suggest to just buy what you want, but why playing this game at all if I just by anything I could achieve? For me the game makes itself obsolete in this way.\n\nAdd other factors like character designs which you can buy only for rubies (money) and which add "+xx.x% experience".\nAdd other equipment which you can only buy for rubies (not craftable) and in addition have their lifetime limited to 3, 7 or 30 days, which means if you want a top equipped character, you *will* have to invest in the game regularly.\nAdd consumables like heal potions which are also available for rubies (money) and if you don't have them, you can imagine the disadvantage on the battlefield.\n\nSo at the bottom note let me say: This game leaves you no chance to make up a missing investment by very good or very extensive playing. Forget it! Since this is a PvP game (with some PvE side-content) you need to be top equipped to have a fair chance against others and this requires you to invest money - regularly!\n\nIf you want to play to achieve access to better equipment and enjoy character progression, you will be frustrated and I suggest you stay away.\nIf you just play for fun (PvP) without extras and you have no problem investing money regularly in order to keep your character in top shape, you can give this game a try.","January 23, 2015","false","1.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Problem is once joining the pvp load screen it just sits there waiting. I couldn't find a single match so I don't reccomend it baed on the fact only the tutorial seems to work.

The controls are oversimplified, with nothing beyond a few class-based abilities as well as the standard hit/heavy/block. Despite this being a game about combat, there is no kill counter, or clear way of knowing how effective you are actually being. To add to this game's problems, the crafting system is needlessly draconian, and, though I only played a dozen matches or so, it SEEMS that there is heavy P2W at work.

The graphics and battle dynamics are outstanding, and initially it had a good crafting system. The resources you earned verses the cost of crafting higher end armor and weapons was scaled against you steeply but was acceptable. Sometime between 8/10/2014 and 8/11/2014 an update removed the ability to craft entirely, replaced with shop function only. Resources earned now, go towards a roulette game that doesn't nearly adheer to the probability statistics advertised. What was a great game for computer players has been reduced to a cell phone game in leage with "Kim Kardashian : Hollywood", you meerly pour money in for gear necessary for playing at high level.

The easy mode of pve is a joke everyone dies thats how it always going to be and will stay untill the game developer's get there heads out of the clouds and do something about it so all i would hafto say for this game.\n\n10/10~Would Uninstall Again","September 8, 2015","false","4.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
