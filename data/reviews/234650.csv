However, I'll be the first to admit I'm far from a veteran in the genre.\n\nOne of the key things I think Returns did right, is the tricky task of drawing me into the story immediately. It's pretty simple: your friend is dead, he's left you a "dead man's switch" - a recorded message promising a hefty reward if you can find the killer. OK. I'm in.\n\nAs for the ease of playing the game... as someone who's often daunted by complex RPG interfaces with endless choices, decisions, and items to equip, I thought Shadowrun's interface is a breeze. It clearly shows you your weapon slots, inventory slots, and which body parts you can equip on armor or modifications. As for playing the game itself, you can simply click on your HUD to switch between weapons or end turns, but there are hotkeys for the more practiced player, too.\n\nYou encounter many characters on your way to solve your friend's murder, and you get to pick and choose your own team of Shadowrunners to go on every mission with you. Each has their own specialty - summoning mechs, specializing in "decking" (hacking), melee combat, guns, magic, and so on, and I had a great time testing out all the different classes.\n\nAll of the characters have their own specialties, but the game is forgiving, and you could probably get by just using guns on everyone. I realized one of my runners had a healing ability 3/4 of the way through the game, and had been getting by just fine without knowing that. So if you're worried about difficulty or complexity, don't be.\n\nAnother positive for me is the game is heavily text based. There is a lot more discovery and reading than combat. You can also save anywhere except an NPC turn in combat, or in conversation. So I could get up to answer the door or grab some food without bothering to pause, or quit at a moment's notice if my friends asked me to play a multiplayer game.\n\nI know I'm writing a review no one will ever read, for a two year old game, but it gets an easy recommendation from me, especially if you're a busy person who can only enjoy games in bits and pieces before you're on the go again.","April 27, 2015","true","11.0"," 544 of 554 people (98%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","98","544","554","7","16"

Was looking for an RPG game that I can really sink my teeth into without getting bored, and coming from a gamer background myself, not many games can catch my attention.\n\nThen saw a recommended game review somewhere about this Shadowrun, so being the typical gamer that I am since I dont like to pay for something I haven't tried yet....so I *cough*cough* got  a copy of the game to try.....\n\n...and then I closed the game, went to the Steam website, and purchased a legitimate copy. Let me tell you why :-\n\na) this is an RPG - story, story, story - this is what's it all about\nb) the interface and game - slick, modern XCOM style combat, with that turn based system thats good for my pace and strategy.\nc) the real world/cyber world - the transitions are nice, a good break from the routine.\nd) Story - did I mention story? I like how I have to slow down to read, even the freaking Splash screens got something to really read\n\nSo I parted with my cash to show support to this developer. Keep up the good work and I look forward to purchase Dragonfall and any more of DLC of this kind :)","November 24, 2014","true","18.9"," 358 of 410 people (87%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","87","358","410","26","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inertis/recommended/234650/","inertis","Megillot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inertis/","354 products in account","Strongest point of Shadowrun Returns is its writing. In best tradition of older RPGs, game describes what you character sees in flowery language. Character introductions, location descriptions and dialogues are smart and charming. The setting of Shadowrun is a blend of cyberpunk and urban fantasy - don't think I knew something like this exists before. I wouldn't mind experiencing Shadowrun Returns in book or graphical novel form.\n\nAs a game, however, it is not so magnificent.\n\nSR was made by relatively inexperienced developers on tight budget using Unity and it shows. Graphics are mixed bag - wonderful character portraits, bright and detailed, if somewhat cartoony 2D backgrounds, but awful character models and awkward animations. Sound direction feels cheap overall - music are fine, but forgettable and there is absolutely no voice acting. Combat mechanics ripped straight off X-COM: Enemy Unknown.\n\nThe biggest flaw of SR is its linearity. I just didn't have the opportunity to explore the world of Shadowrun - game kept railroading me on one story after another, with brief breaks in same   small hub. All two side missions are one chance affairs - go on them right now or miss it forever. While writing itself is great, spending points to improve charisma and get new dialogue options felt like total waste - game is too short and there is almost no opportunity to use your mad speech skills - I think I used each etiquette only once or twice in whole game. Story starts as a noir-like murder mystery, but after halfway point abruptly turns into "save the world" scenario and ends with series of boring battles against bugs. Absolutely unnecessary twist, in my opinion.\n\nMy final impression: SR is an enjoyable short RPG; not without flaws but if you are able to overlook them, you will have a great time playing it.","October 31, 2013","true","31.9"," 406 of 500 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","406","500","0","21"

Gameplay may be somewhat shallow and linear, but excellent writing in the official campaigns (Deadman's Switch and Dragonfall) make up for that. Particularly Dragonfall is a MUST PLAY for any Shadowrun fan. The neo-anarchist Berlin provides an excellent backdrop for a genuinely exciting story with lots of memorable characters (each with an interesting backstory that you slowly uncover over the course of the campaign) and some excellent twists and turns til you reach the epic conclusion. I should note however, that Dragonfall is a separate DLC that you need to buy on top of Shadowrun returns (Thanks to pruwyben for pointing this out in the comments - it is a bit unfortunate that I cannot write a single review just for the DLC.)\n\nMake no mistake, this is basically a text adventure, lots of reading, most of the "roleplaying" is happening in big blocks of text and the general storyline can't be changed in major ways. The XCOM-ish battles are a nice intermission between the big chunks of text, but they are not particularly deep or varied for the most part. Every now and then the game mixes it up a bit with a few events that I do not want to spoil, but for the most part this is an interactive novel with excellent music running in the background while you read what is going on.\n\nPersonally, I love it - graphics may be super-awesome these days, but small details and nuances still can't be done with the same ease as plain old text does it. And the superb writing brings the world of Shadowrun to life like no multi-billion dollar production could have done in my honest opinion, the atmosphere and flair Harebrained Schemes achieved with these simple means is just amazing.\n\nIf you enjoy good writing in your videogames, don't mind somewhat limited gameplay and/or are a Shadowrun-nut you need to check out Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall - do it! Deadman's Switch + Dragonfall + the editor to make your own stories a reality, one hell of a deal!","April 21, 2014","true","28.9"," 193 of 220 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","193","220","0","4"

At points, however, it feels like it would be nice to have a little bit more variety to the areas, some of them feel quite samey. Character creation and portraits are ok but you can't go into the level of detail of some other RGPs.      Audio    7    Music and sound effects are good, there is however quite a bit of reading to do in this game, do not expect voice acting for all of the story / dialogue.     Gameplay    8    I really enjoyed playing this game, its a nice mixture of adventure / mystery and rpg with turn based strategic combat (think xcom). You control a small team of characters (you collect them as the story progresses) who follow you as you play through the story completing various missions and solving mysteries. There are some good puzzles to solve as the story develops and you can choose to upgrade various skills as your character advances in levels. A really nice feature is the "hacking" that the decker class can perform, this takes a form similar to combat in the game but its you and your constructs against the computer systems defences.         Story    8    Shadowrun Returns is set in cyberpunk-esque world where magic meets machine. You can play different stories in the form of campaigns, the official ones are complemented by community created ones via the steam workshop. The campaigns are extremely well done and have a very noir feel to them. There's a lot of background and detail to the world (and a lot of reading to be done) and the story had enough intrigue and action to keep me interested right to the end. The nature of the game (your characters acting out the story) basically means that play feels quite linear and that sometimes the decisions you make don't really have lasting effects but this didn't effect my enjoyment too much.         Replayability    5    As much of the main campaign is story based, once you have completed the game there isn't that much to draw you back in. Having said that there is an excellent DLC (dragonfall) and there are community created campaigns and an editor which should add quite a few hours of playability        Overall    8    Excellent game for anyone who loves this style of gameplay or the setting. The community content really adds a whole new aspect and lease of life to the game, just be prepared to do a lots of reading.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/recommended/234650/","ledeir","ledeir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/","522 products in account","As an avid Shadowrun fan, I was psyched when I heard about the kickstarter for Shadowrun Returns. I immediately backed it and kept careful track of the progress. Based on some of the design decisions and the concept art, I was initially concerned. My worry proved to be unfounded though. When I first opened Dead Man's Switch I was immediately pleased with the depth of detail in story and graphics.\n\nIt does a respectable job of emulating the pen and paper game feeling. There is room for improvement, and I certainly hope some of the issues are addressed in the future, but there is enough variety for you to at least customize a character to reflect you (combat) style. Lacking stealth is a particularly strong drawback. So is the way social skills like negotiation and con are replaced with etiquette, but a smart modder can work around that and present an experience which will tailor to your needs.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the editor. Say what you will about the main story, give it a couple months and it won't matter. The game comes with the same editor the developers used to make the game. Based on the community, you can expect some amazing modules to come and I look forward to them in the future! As for the main game, I enjoyed it even though it was fairly linear. It had the feeling of playing shadowrun at a gaming convention, you needed to follow a set script, but there was a decent story to back it up.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns myself, and the community had was the lack of a save anywhere feature. Fortunately HBS was quick to implement this after release. They are very attentive to their fans needs. Now if only they could do something to limit ammo!\n\nOverall though, I am happy with Shadowrun Returns. If you are an avid fan, get it. If you are a casual gamer, do your research first. This game is not made by a major studio, you cannot hold it to the same standards as you would something from EA Games. If you want voice acting, amazing graphics, and more options than you can imagine, this is not for you. If you are willing to give the little guy a chance, and want the feeling of playing Shadowrun with your friends, then you will probably be pleased with what you get. At the very least its the best Shadowrun game out there currently.\n\nUPDATE 6/29/14\nI was asked about the game's replayability, so here is an update to address that. I will (most likely) better update the review later, but for now here it is.\n\nMost of my hours were spent inside the editor, you can easily spend hundreds of hours making your own mods. If you want to tell your own stories, and share them with the community, this is the game for you. The editor is the same tool used by the devs to make the official modules.\n\nA regular player will get less mileage out of the official campaign. The base campaign, Dead Man's Switch is under 20 hours for a playthrough. I played through it 3 times with different style of characters, but the experience is more or less the same regardless of character type.\n\nThe expansion, Dragonfall, was also under 20 hours of playtime. I have only played that campaign once. Its a much more satisfying experience than the base campaign, but still, limited replay-ability. There are a couple optional missions you can play, but they both are fairly linear overall.\n\nThe place where you can get strong replay-ability is the fan made modules. Some of them are really incredible. The downside is that being fan made you need to be patient for them to finish. It is entirely likely that you will start one and then finish everything that is there and be stuck waiting for the next installment.","June 20, 2014","true","525.5"," 116 of 132 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","116","132","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crunchyfrog555/recommended/234650/","crunchyfrog555","crunchyfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crunchyfrog555/","822 products in account","Hype and expectation are funny things. They can invite even the most rational and level-headed into wish fulfulment FAR beyond the truth, and we all know how prevalent that is in video gaming. I honestly believe that this game's reputation absolutely suffers from precisely this, especially from the view of some players.\n\nSo, Shadowrun Returns - the question is "does it", or rather "does it REALLY warrant the return?"\n\nLet's start with the expectation part I mentioned. When this game was proposed, those that were fans of the old tabletop RPG and the old SNES classic sat up and took notice, and for good reason. Nostalgia aside, both are truly excellent games in their own rights. The downside to this is that it tends to set the bar VERY high, expectation-wise.\n\nFast forward to the game's release, and there were certainly mixed views; much of the criticism dealt with there being less on the action and more on the text and story. Also, length was cited too, or rather, lack of it. On the face of it, very valid criticisms, except that many of these either forgot or didn't understand WHAT the game was achieving - a new version of the classic games, adhering closely to the rules - in short, Shadowrun RETURNS. The clue's in the name. It does what it says on the tin.\n\nSo, there's an abundance of text and story, and less of the action itself, and yes, it is a bit short. While they are valid concerns EVERY game buyer should consider before dropping their cash, context is also equally important. Apologies for this slightly overblown introduction, but I felt it valid to lay this down at the outset. Let's get on with the review.\n\nIf you know what Shadowrun is (or was), then there's little point in going over this and you can skim to the last paragraph. If you don't, then as I've already said, there's the classic tabletop "D&D style" game - a pure, unadulterated old-school pencil and paper RPG. The hook here is that elves, orcs, goblins and all the staples of fantasy exist, but the one major difference is everything is a futuristic sci-fi bent. It probably sounds completely at odds with one another, but it works so very, very well, both in lore and in combat ... ESPECIALLY in combat. You can still hack 'n' slash if you want to, you can still use magic if you want to, but add to the mix firearms and a complete veneer of futuristic and modern tech, and you have Shadowrun.\n\nIt rather goes without saying that anyone who has spent any time playing old-school tabletop RPG knows that story and text are perhaps the premier parts, and that is the case here, naturally. But the question to the critics remains "ah, but it is any good?" Thankfully, the answer is "yes, it is".\n\nI confess I'm a little jaded. I've been around gaming since the very start, and have never had a period when I've not been involved. I've seen a lot, played a lot, own a lot, and have even worked in the industry (albeit relatively briefly). For the most part, I care little for story in games - most times I'm merely concerned with the mechanics over everything else. I couldn't tell you the story of Halo, for example, as it never gripped me in any way. So, why on earth am I saying this game's story is good? Because it DID grip me right from the off. It works. You know the story's working on you when you can start to identify and remember the characters. So, being heavy on the story is an ASSET to this game, and in no way a hindrance. I shan't spoil it in any way, but it's a fairly standard story, but it does it pretty well, so in summary I don't see the critique of "too much story, too little action" in any way a bad thing unless it's REALLY not your thing.\n\nNow, onto length. Yes, it IS relatively short. However, you should at least consider the reasoning behind the game's existence - it would never have seen the light of day AT ALL were it not for crowd-funding. Sure, you can claim they made big promises and ran out of resources and/or time, but the conclusion here is that putting all those aside the end product is pretty damned good. As stated before, it very much does what it says on the tin. So, if you don't mind quantity being less if the quality's good or reasonable, then there is no issue here. What does render the length argument completely invalid is one thing - WORKSHOP support. There's TONS of user-generated content out there which not only mimics what tabletop RPGs are all about, but the inclusion of mod tools (which I haven't tried) ensure that it's pretty easy to dole out a good scenario, and it certainly shows. So, if you finish the game and want more, you won't be disappointed at all.\n\nThe combat is best described as being very similar to XCOM. It's turn-based with the dual-turn set of movement/action phases per character, or a mixture of those: you move, you shoot/swing/etc, and your turn's over. Your playfield is peppered with objects that you can utilize as cover, with the shield icon offering how good that cover is. This all offers a lovely tactical play where you don't just consider dumping your character up against the enemy and swing away at them, but you have to consider balancing cover with line of sight, flanking, and a number of other little tricks to make the best use of the battle.\n\nCharacter skills are great. As you'd rightly expect from a combination fantasy/sci-fi, it lends you a VERY wide palette of things to mess around with. Fire-based magic attacks? Sure. Rifles, pistols, or SMGs? Yup, have at them. Fire-based attacks WITH your pistol? Yup, that too. It does the Shadowrun rules well, and the interface is clear and intuitive and you'll have no issues picking it up quickly.\n\nVisually, the game offers a very nice art-style that does the medium justice. Backgrounds are all pre-rendered and hand-drawn (or at least they LOOK hand-drawn) in a graphic novel style which suits perfectly. Nothing I can fault here at all. Musically, the soundstrack is really good. I'm not a big fan of music soundtracks - I'm not one who will listen to them outside of the game. To me, they're a background that serves to provide ingredient to the recipe. They should illustrate without hindering the game in any way. Not only does the style and mood of the music suit perfectly, but it's not repetitive, and remains interesting without hindering in ANY way. If you're someone who does listen to game music absent of the game, you might well find this one very appealing.\n\nSo, final summary time. Is it worth purchasing? Yes. If you are expecting a good turn-based old-shool RPG, it's worth it. Steam Workshop really underlines this, value-wise. The only caveat I would make is that if you're either not sure whether this sort of game's for you, or the length of the official game really is an issue for you, I'd thoroughly recommend waiting for a sale - it's still worth picking up.\n\nFinal note I'm doing with all my reviews now: I'm giving a "what do I think the game's worth?" instead of any score or other metric, as I think that's the most valuable metric anyone could have. I'd say this deserves a £9 (or your regional equivalent).","October 8, 2014","true","5.3"," 95 of 112 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","95","112","0","9"

Excellent. It is difficult to know what else to say... I just thought this was great. I'll just ramble as follows.\n\nAs an RPG it was the perfect amount of complexity, deep but easy to understand.\n\nThe artwork is lovely, everything is well animated and it is just generally a really attractive game.\n\nIt is VERY well written IMHO, the characters come to life through the text and written dialogue, it's great! I honestly felt like I was enjoying an interactive book, which is a feeling I tend to get when I am fully engaged. The locations, the people, the story.. all of it is vivid and believable, not so much due to the on screen action, but more through the filter of my imagination which the writing nutures throughout, things playing out in my mind's eye as I read the next interchange between characters, or digested the description of the place I'd just arrived at.\n\nThe narrative is solid, and makes sense (within the world it is told) and pans out well, I thought the pacing was excellent.\n\nSome might dislike the linear nature of the game, I personally love it. Side missions are available, but they are in direct relevance to the main storyline at all times which keeps things moving, and therefore aren't always available for you to come back to tidy up and complete later, so bear that in mind. I am a fan of a well told story, and "sandbox" games are never as good as experience for me as being told a well crafted story. Shadowrun Returns nails this.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, took me 17.2 hours to complete but it felt like a lot less purely because I was enjoying every minute of it and was just waiting to turn the next page in this electronic short story and learn what was going to happen next. Like a good book, it was tough to put down.\n\nIt has it's flaws here and there, like checkpoint saves (due to be changed in a patch or via the next DLC I understand), some sections keeping you in turn based combat mode when there aren't any enemies about and on some of the longer battles the combat music can get a little tiring, but those are small complaints.\n\nExcellent and I'm looking forward to see what they do next!

The mechanics are fine, but it's very easy to run into unsolvable problems - if you roll a hacker, you're going to have very little to do in the main campaign and are going to rely on NPCs and hirelings.  And if you're not a hacker, every time you NEED a hacker you'll be provided one free of charge.\n\nThere's more too it than that, of course, but that's pretty illustrative.  The game feels extremely limited in a lot of places, from missing mentor spirits to customization through what's available from the NPC stores.   Honestly you'd probably be better trcking down an old copy of Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magicka Obscura.","December 23, 2013","false","6.1"," 109 of 150 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","109","150","0","1"

When I started playing it, I discovered a great world, filled with an unique style and characters.\n\nThe setting is fantastic. A futuristic world where people can replace their limbs with mechanical implants a la Deus Ex, mixed with magic and fantastic creatures. The gameplay is quite fun, it reminds me of the turn based RPGs I used to play when I was younger, although in this game the combat is more tactical, with things like cover and area effects.\n\nThe character customization is great; you can select your character's gender, its race (Human, Elf, Orc, Troll and Dwarf), and its abilities, some of them being street samurai, shaman, and decker. Even then, you can further customize your character by spending "Karma points" to unlock new abilities.\n\nThe story is quite good, and there's plenty of dialogue options during the conversations, even more if you have the proper abilities. Another great point is the soundtrack, which really set the mood.\n\nSo, to conclude, I highly recommend this game.","November 1, 2014","true","13.2"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","1"

World of Shadowrun is rich, full of postmodern and fantasy, yet it is a very pragmatical and cynical one. Lovely thing, just like the big world behind the window, only with magic. Sadly, unlike D&D universe, it was poorely pictured in the videogames (there was 2 good games, but only on 16bit consoles - Genesis and SNES).\n\nAside from my previous experience with the Shadowrun universe, game's a good one. Solid cyberpunk story (and fitted to Shadowrun agenda, as well). Fascinating music. Good battle system (if only too easy for my tastes, even on the hardest). Decent rpg skills system, not without a flaws, but - fair enough.\n\nSo, generally - it's good. Not excellent, but good. Like 7/10 in my book.\n\nAlthough. I love Shadowrun, and I would give the game more - just for good revival - if only they would made Matrix better. That's a major disengage for me in the whole game. They just did another field for shootouts in the Matrix, not anything near hacking. I've played many interpretations of Shadowrun, and that game made almost everything fine - but ruined cyberspace. It's like making a remake of "Singin' in the Rain" movie without actually singing in the process.\n\nThink I'll go and play some blues now.","June 26, 2015","true","19.9"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","45","53","3","0"

I've honestly lost count of how many times I've played through it. With that in mind I started up my journey into Shadowrun Returns with a healthy dose of nostalgia and optimism, and at the end of the journey I came away happy, if not entirely satisfied.\n\nUnlike the Shadowrun of yore, Returns plays like an odd crossing of point & click adventure and turn-based strategy. Your runner is investigating the death of an old friend, and in each scene spends most of their time navigating dense dialogues with the many NPCs on hand. You might also be tasked to click on an object or a door, but the vast majority of the non-combat gameplay is talking. It's good talking, though, with some very colorful characters and attentive writing. The parentheticals get a little too heady and poetic for my tastes, but they set the scenes well enough. Overall the game nails the Shadowrun setting, which goes a long way towards keeping me interested.\n\nCombat is the other side of the coin, and while it works better than the ancient art of "stand in place and shoot forever", it's not without its flaws. Your crew and the enemy forces each take turns expending the action points of their members on a grid map with cover objects, much like in the recent XCOM. AP is spent a little oddly, however. Each move within a certain range costs one AP, whether it be a single step or a dash to the edge of their range. With melee weapons this is fine because the melee attack is included with the move, but ranged weapons cost at least one AP just to fire, so getting into an ideal position and firing can be a costly proposition. Doubly so when the sight lines around the environments are not terribly consistent, and it costs a full AP just to reload. It's an imperfect system that works well enough, but could definitely use more polish.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to kill people though, and enough skill points to earn through the game to make the most of them. You have melee, five different firearm types, drones, and two kinds of magic, and that's not even getting into the support skills. Unfortunately, there's not much reason to diversify, and the game even tells you as much. High ranks in skills are very powerful, and spreading your points around won't give you the ranks you need to pass skill checks or hit later enemies. Plus, you hire party members from a large roster of shadowrunners who can easily fill in the gaps for you.\n\nThese gripes are really part of a larger trend with Returns. You can buy weapons, armor, and other upgrades, but they are unevenly spaced throughout the game. There's not much to interact with in the many levels, and no real branching paths to explore. You can be a decker and get into the Matrix side battles, but they are few and far between. Your hired runners have no personality and can't be interacted with other than ordered around in battle. Even the story, built on some genuinely good writing, is small in scope and lacks any sort of proper build-up. It all points to a game not fully realized, a lot of potential without a lot of substance. The whole time I was playing, Returns felt more like a demo for the game engine than a full product.\n\nThat's not to say it wasn't fun. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8-10 hours it took to complete, and aside from a particularly annoying final mission, had no major complaints about it. The issue is more a lot of little shortcomings mounting to give Returns a very half-baked feel. It's definitely worth playing, and I'm very interested to follow it with Dragonfall, but I wouldn't fault anyone who checked out after a few hours. Shadowrun Returns is a good enough Shadowrun game, and now I want a better one.","November 9, 2015","true","9.4"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","1"

It also didn't help that I didn't really know anything about the Shadowrun universe. During the Summer Sale though, I was in the mood for something new, and picked it up. I just finished playing through the original campaign (Dead Man's Switch - DMS) and have to say, I'm glad I bought the game.\n\nGetting the basics out of the way, I admit that DMS is very linear. There is a lot of reading involved. And besides combat, there's not a lot of interaction with the world. Still, as someone who knew next to nothing about Shadowrun before I started, I think DMS does a very good job of introducing the player to the world and the mythos surrounding it. The reading will probably be boring to someone who is deeply familiar with the setting, but I found it very useful. Gameplay is likewise straightforward which allows a new player to dive in without fear of messing up. I played a Street Samurai / Decker and had no trouble. I did find myself wishing I could build a party and level them up, outfitting them and whatnot ala Baldur's Gate, but perhaps that will happen in an expansion.\n\nAll in all, this game was well worth the $4 I paid. I also picked up the DLC, which I read is much better - I look forward to trying that next.\n\n\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","55.4"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","48","58","0","0"

It will be interesting to see where the game ends up, as the game comes bundled with an editor allowing for a lot of potential from the community making Shadowrun Returns a game that is likely going to grow a lot over time.\nThe current module, The Dead Man’s Switch, is an okay experience which is sadly awfully limited in story decisions and suffers from many little oversights and rough flaws such as underwhelming AI and a lack of simple quality of life systems such as manual saving, but does contain excellent writing that incorporates much of the interesting universe without overwhelming newcomers.\n\nAs such, the potential is definitly there and what it currently contains will be entertaining and fun to go through for the RPG fan, but it isn’t anything that will happily surprise you or amaze you in any way.

I was really looking forward to this game since it showed up on Kickstarter.  Fallout 1 & 2 are among my favorite games ever, and this was touted as a return to that style of RPG.  It...isn't.\n\nI find the combat enjoyable.  It's basically a simplified version of XCOM:  Enemy Unknown.  One problem with it is that once combat starts, it doesn't end until you move to another map, even if there are no enemies around.  So after a fight ends, you'll have to move your party through the map in turn-based mode until you get to an exit.\n\nThe story is good by video game standards.  You receive a recorded message from an old friend who's been murdered and are tasked with tracking down his killer.  For the most part, dialogue is well-written.  There's no voice acting, which some may take issue with, but it allows for more robust dialogue.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't take advantage of that benefit.\n\nThe game is extraordinarily linear.  There's exactly one path through the story.  A handful of situations where you may be able to get from point A to point B by a slightly different route exist (i.e., bluff your way past a guard vs. hacking through an unguarded door), but these are so few and so insignificant that they don't make any real difference overall.  Dialogue is pretty much the same no matter what:  Ask about story-related stuff, ask about general backround/setting information.  Very little opportunity to employ your character's personality.\n\nSidequests are almost nonexistent, and the few that the game does have are simple "go over there and get me that thing," or "while you're on this run, see if you can find a thing I want" sorts of things.\n\nThe whole game is designed entirely around mobile devices and it suffers for it.  The UI is a bit clunky and unintuitive for PC, limited to what would work on a touch-based interface.  The save system is simply unacceptable.  The game has no manual save option.  Not even a save and quit function.  It's entirely based on reaching checkpoints.  This is supposed to be fixed with the DLC scheduled for January 2014, but until then, if you screw up a fight at the end of a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  Have to leave before you finish a mission?  You're replaying the whole mission.  As I understand it, this is because the game cannot save the current map state, which explains some of the linearity.  When you return to a location, you're actually loading a completely different map of the location with its own triggers, different versions of NPCs with dialogue appropriate to that point in the story, etc.  This means that the player can't affect any change in the game as every change or combination of changes to a location would require its own unique map, and I'm not even sure if the game is able to load different versions of the same map based on variables.\n\nI can't really speak to the user-generated content as I haven't used the editor or played any user-made campaigns yet, but from what I've heard from those who have, the editor is very, very limited in what it can do.  As a result, a lot of people who were planning on making content for the game have given up.\n\nMaybe the upcoming DLC will improve the editor, maybe (probably) it won't.  Either way, I wouldn't suggest paying more than about $5 for Shadowrun Returns.","November 30, 2013","false","7.8"," 334 of 535 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","334","535","0","9"

It has a strong story, involving murder investigations, corporate espionage and supernatural rituals. There are many interesting NPCs and good dialogue choices, although sadly no voice acting. The stats/skills level up system has some nice depth, and some stats can influence dialogue options. Combat is like Xcom, turn based with a squad of 4, with action points to spend on moving, firing guns or using items/magic. Some squad members are hired temporarily before each quest, have no dialogue, and you can't customise their stats/gear, so unfortunately they lack personality. Levels are small and the whole game is quite linear, with not much scope for exploration. But the campaign lasts around 11 hours so value for money is good. The music is fantastic and really adds to the atmosphere. Although some things could be improved, its still very enjoyable and well worth checking out.\n\nReview update: Dragonfall\n\nDragonfall takes the formula established in the original release, and improves on it in several ways. Its actually misleading to describe this as "DLC". These days, particularly in the RPG genre, that term conjures up thoughts of short quests and meaningless item packs. Dragonfall is more like the good old days of expansion packs, where you got a meaty chunk of gameplay to sink your teeth into.\n\nThe story is excellent, one of the best I've played through in any game for quite some time. The action has shifted to Berlin, where you've joined a crew of shadowrunners on a contract to extract some data from a vault. Predictably, the mission goes wrong, dragging you into another deep conspiracy full of twists and turns, that also helps to explain more of the world's lore.\n\nBecause your crew are fully fleshed out characters, instead of the original's mostly hired help, each character has much more depth to their personality. They have a past, they have feelings, and the story is given increased emotional weight through conversations with these characters.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics, tactical turn based combat, and level up system all remain intact, and we now have the ability to save anywhere, rather than being limited to the original's checkpoint only system. Quest structure is less linear than before. You have some control over which order to play certain quests, and most quests have optional objectives that, if completed, provide greater (or alternate) rewards. You'll also have some tough moral choices to consider which affect quest outcomes, and many areas allow for the use of non combat skills, including talking your way past guards or hacking computers to gain information.\n\nDragonfall took me 19 hours to complete, which is significantly longer than the original game, and represents excellent value for money at full price. I don't recall encountering any bugs at all.\n\nOverall Dragonfall is amazing, and I rate it as an absolute MUST BUY.","November 25, 2013","true","40.6"," 91 of 136 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","91","136","0","1"

I overlooked the fact that this game was pumped out by a minimal staff in a very short deadline, so I'm going to re-write my assessment.\n\nBoring, clunky, and linear.\n\nThis game has great concepts behind it, but is not executed well. The storyline might be a fascinating read, but does not engage the player at all. The best scripted fight, the last fight of the game about 8 hours in, is almost as fun as the prologue of Neverwinter Nights. Almost.\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the story, but the game has potential to give the community what they are thirsty for. I'm not overly impressed with the graphics, and I really wished I could have changed angles from the point of view on the field, but for the most part the combat and character navigation is easy enough to manage. The equipment is very simple, though not explained well (*cough cybernetics cough*), and you don't have to put much thought into micro-managing your character or your hire-by-mission squadmates. It's impossible to get attached to characters as they're just a portrait to represent the mathhammer you wield as the gamer.\n\nI did really like the etiquitte aspect to your character. The game gives you more conversation options if you have a higher Charisma stat, and with a higher Charisma you learn new jargon by which to speak with the appropriate factions (ie shadowrunners, security, corporate, or gang). Unfortunately, the dialogue is still linear and it only provides introductory ports for the equifinality of the storyline.\n\nPros: cheap, potential for community contribution, non-demanding of hardware, neat concepts.\nCons: easy, impersonal, clunky, and inconsequential.\n\n4/10","August 31, 2013","false","10.2"," 84 of 126 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","84","126","0","0"

No matter what I did, I died. I thought Shadowrun Returns might be as deadly as the original, but (thankfully) it wasn't.\n\nShadowrun Returns looks amazing, and from the first moment it makes you wonder just what lies ahead in this strange cyberpunk world. The inviting world teasing you to explore and uncover the truths behind the deadman who wants you to find his killer, however... it never really got there.\nDon't get me wrong - the various maps look amazing, but there's little to them other than being a very impressive backdrop. There's no real reward for exploring, and the various NPCs that litter the sidewalks aren't much more than fancy decoration on an already good looking cake. Perhaps I was asking too much for this to be a deeply engrossing world, yet in a way it is an engrossing world thanks to the storytelling.\n\nWhat you are going to get in Shadowrun Returns is a great story, and for some it might even be too text heavy (especially if English isn't your native language). However, I enjoyed it, the story is basically a detective novel as you try to uncover the mystery of who killed your friend. The catch being the client is the deadman himself, which is great and is a nice nod to the old film noir movies of old.\nIt's due to how well the story is written I can forgive it for being very linear with almost no plot trees or divergence due to your actions or selections that I noticed.\n\nIn fact, that seems to be the theme of the game. It's a very well presented world, with a very well written story, but just seems to lack a little spice. There's very little loot, there's very little to explore, the skill tree looks rather impressive, but doesn't seem grab you at all. The same with character creation.\nI don't want to come across as overly negative with the game, as I really did enjoy what was offered, yet I feel like it could have offered so much more. Again, perhaps I'm demanding too much from what is already a very well presented game.\nOn the plus side it has Steam Workshop intergration and there seems to be a host of community mods and projects underway, so a host of new content should just be around the corner. Likewise the developers have released DLC, which seemingly adds another layer to the game (perhaps that's what I'm looking for?).\n\nIn short, a very solid game and a welcome return for Shadowrun, but it's not as brutal as the original and perhaps lacks that little something extra to make it a true great.

You can complete the full campaign within hours, and there are no official post-game contents.\n\nThe battle system is turn-based, grid-like strategy fight. You control up to 4 players, and fight againts enemies either by using guns, melee weapons, or spells. The battle itself isn't hard to understand, but it is very challenging if you are playing harder difficulties with an unprepared party.\n\nThe main character is very customizable, it takes my first playthru a lot of times struggling on how to develop my character. However, after one playthru, I find the customization choice is pretty unnecessary, since you can always hire a full team of balanced shadowrunners to do all the work.\n\nThe story or dialogue choices make very little difference to the plot, most of the time they just affect the next NPC sentence and that's all.\n\nThe plot is interesting and fit in the game setting pretty well.\n\nGlitches still happens to me in this game, most of them forces me to restart the game and lose less than 20 minutes of playtime since the last checkpoint. But so far nothing game-breaking.\n\nI was a huge fan of the SEGA Genesis version. This game gives me some nostalgia because of the character and plot setting, but the gameplay itself is very disappointing. So I have a mixed feeling for this game.\n\nThe game on itself is pretty decent, but it kinda ruins the impression I have for the franchise. In my opinion, this game is pretty good for players who are new to this franchise, but it is a disappointment for old fans.\n\nI wish this game have achievements.\n\nMy Score: 6/10","August 17, 2015","true","11.2"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","27","35","3","1"

Shadowrun Returns excels at story telling, the game is rich with lore, well written dialogues that feel more conversational than what most games accomplish, and a structured story full of plot twists and interesting characters. Perhaps my favorite point about the story is that it starts out small-scale, you are on a simple mission to look into the death of a friend, but it slowly ramps up into something larger as the story progresses. To top it off the game is set in a beautiful futuristic game world and has solid tactical gameplay to boot.\n\nMore than anything this game to me was about an awesome sci-fi detective story. The mystery and intrigue suck you in, the stellar writing especially in regards to dialogue keeps you hooked. I'm not saying the game mimics what street talk may actually be like in the future, but it was great enough to get me immersed in the street life of futuristic Seattle. The characters within the game range from annoying (intentionally so), charming, grumpy, and likeable; chatting with the regulars throughout the story and going through the different chat options was something I enjoyed doing (shout out to Mr. Kluwe, you're the man, man!). The game's audio and visuals do justice to this story, bringing it to life with stunning hand drawn environments and appropriately mood setting music.\n\nThe game's combat also leaves little to be desired. Although I felt the large scale management of the game to be a little inconsistent...for example the money you earn throughout the story can go into temporary lulls, and if you need to do a mission when you aren't expecting it you may find you don't have enough money to buy a full team of mercs. The game runs similar to most other tactical RPG games, especially similar to the XCOM series. You use the terrain to your advantage and in a turn based fashion you move your team about and order them to attack or use utility items/spells. On hard the game isn't terribly difficult and you shouldn't have to think deeply each turn on how to best arrange your team and how to best utilize there action points (how many actions they can take per turn). The combat is a bit sparse at the beginning of the game but as you progress further you start to battle the baddies more often and that's when the fun starts.\n\nShadowrun Returns is a solid tactical RPG game, and with the addition of the Steam workshop can keep you playing well beyond the twelve hour campaign. The game's story is strong and the characters within are fun ones. It's nice to play a detective style game that isn't a point and click for a change. The game is quite gripping and just like any good detective novel it kept me at the edge of my seat until I got through to the end.","August 14, 2014","true","11.3"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","34","48","0","3"

One of them is the "hacker" role.  You go to a computer in a noncombat situation, and want to hack it.  You have no hack skill, but the hacker merc you hired has plenty of hacker skill level to break into the computer.\n\nBut the game doesn't let your use your hacker to open the computer - only YOUR character's hack skill is checked.  So, there is NO reason to hire a hacker, since they can't be used to hack in noncombat situations.\n\nUtterly stupid.  If you don't take the hacker role for your character, you literally have NO ability to hack outside of combat situations, since your hacker mercearies can only hack in combat.  Thus, hacker mercs are pretty terrible.\n\nThere's things like Strength checks too.  Like, your character is not strong enought to move a fridge, but the troll you hired has enough to move it.  But again, it's not combat, so your troll can't help you.  WTF.\n\nAND THERE'S SO MANY BUGS!

Especially if they are already dead.\nShadowrun Returns  is linear story-driven game with turn-based combat. You are a mercenary in a sci-fi world that also got few drops of magic and your goal is to find the murder of a friend of yours.\n\nStory and Writing\n\nThe story plot is generic: You are called by your friend who was recently murdered and you have to find his murder. On the way you gonna meet other runners and people that will show you that there is more than meet the eye.\n\nEven with the generic plot, the writing is solid and often you see that there are several approaches in a conversation that is based on your stats and etiquette. But dont worry if you cant talk your way out, few bullets can do the same or maybe a few slashes or fireballs.\n\nCombat\n\nThe combat in Shadowrun Returns is turn-based with Action Points and cover. If you played X-Com : Enemy Unknown , the combat will be old friend of yours if not then you will be in luck since combat is simple enough to learn but it can be hard to master.  First thing first : being melee you are allowed to walk and attack with 1 action point( more if the target is far away) while for range you cant run and gun. Instead  you will want to get in cover before you start spreading love/bullets/magic. If you arent fan of direct attacks you can instead use drones/spirit to do the dirty job.\n\nWe should not forget and the AoE skills mainly because there is friendly fire so you have to be careful when you use them. Especially if there is low hit chance because if it misses, the AoE will hit somewhere near the targeted zone.\n\nCover is mainly to reduce the chance to be hit but at times it may seem broken . Once I went behind a target that was in cover and my hit chance got reduced(in pointblank range) which was weird.\n\nOnce you are familiar with meat-world combat you will have to encounted and the Matrix which can be accessed only by deckers . Combat in the matrix is the same but you use different skills and death in the Matrix means disconnect and damage to your real self.\n\nEquipment\n\nThats one area which lacks content. While you have on your hands several kind of gear to use, you will find that there isnt much variety in it and you will just look for the higher numbers.\nFirst you have your outfit that provides armor and bonuses to different stats. Then you have your weapons melee/range/drones/ spells , Then you have slots for skills and last but not least you have consumables : medkit, revival kits,grenades , spirits.\nIf you arent fan of using spells/magic then you will be glad to upgrade yourself with cyberware. Cyberware provides you with improved stats at the cost of your essence(the ability to use spells) which is a fair trade if you count on melee or range weapons.\nBut still Equipment pool is lacking a lot.\n\nCharacter Customizatin\n\nHere we are with the best part of this game. I mean what is an RPG without a decent character customization , huh?\nWhile you can pick one of the 5 premade classes you are better off with making your own class and the customization deliver just that. There are 6 main stats : Body, Quickness(Agility), Strength , Intelligence , Willpower and Charisma. And each one of them got different branches that offer different skills(only Body doesnt have any those since its mainly to increase your HP).\n\nQuickness is important for your range gunners . It allows you to spend points on different gun types : Pistol,Shotgun, SMG and Rifle. It also let you increase your points in dodge which makes you harder to hit with physical attacks. It also allows you to specific actions in a conversation.\n\nStrength is important for your brawlers because it let you spend points on close combat : melee weapons or unarmed.In the same tree you will find and the throwable stats. And just like quickness, you can pick unique options during a dialogue.\n\nIntelligence is important for your techwizards: hackers or drone users. Hackers are useful when you are investigating because you will often find hackable objects that provides useful information. Also only Hackers(deckers) can enter the Matrix to provide you with extra information. Drone users on the other hand will be able to use higher level drones . On top of that Intelligence also contain the Biotech branch that increases the amount of HP you recover with medkits. And just like the other stats you are given unique dialogue options every now and then.\n\nWillpower is the main stats for mages. Increasing it will allow you to equip more and better spells. It also increases the chance to hit with them.\n\nCharisma is the main stats for spirit users and sweet talkers. Its most helpful if you try to talk your way out of a situation. It also allows you to have different etiquettes.\n\nIts worth noting that different races got different limit on some stats, And a friendly advice from me : Never try to be a Jack of all trades because there arent enough Karma points to let you do that. Instead focus on 2 stats and let other shadowrunners fill the weak spots(yes you can hire other runners on some missions).\n\nAll in all is a solid game if you want to play a decent RPG nowadays. Often there will be different roads in solving a problem so its worth exploring and see the one way that fits you","December 27, 2015","true","16.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","1"

The top-down isometic view, turn based combat and non-voiced dialogue of a traditional RPG are expertly blended in this fantastic indie title from publisher Harebrained Holdings. The story is divided into campaigns which can range from solving murders, battling corporate espionage to a number of other different situations and once you've finished the games main storyline you can download new user created campaigns from the Steam Workshop or the Nexus which further extends the replayability of this great game. Graphically the game looks terrific in full high definition with its futuristic cyberpunk setting. The character portraits presented during dialogue have a unique style that lends itself well to this title and I find the isometric backgrounds and set pieces delightful. One of my favorite things about these types of games are the small details in the world around you and this title is chock full of them and add to that some excellent sound effects and a terrific musical score and Shadowrun Returns delivers big time. The turn based combat system is quick and responsive and just a fun alternative to the combat of todays most popular roleplaying games. If you're a RPG fan looking for something a little different or just enjoy old-school or retro games then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Shadowrun Returns!!!","December 1, 2013","true","43.3"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","36","53","0","4"

The gameplay mechanics felt so-so when I started. I played for like 30 minutes , gave up, then picked it up again a month or two later. Strategy isn't my forte so I was hesitant to crank the difficulty up for a challenge, it already felt frustrating to miss shots and then have to wait for things to happen during enemy turns. I got used to it after a couple hours, as I learned the game more and generally got smarter about what to do. I upgraded my opinion of the game play to "yeah that seems alright then."\n\nThe class/karma point system is pretty interesting and I had fun toying with that. The decking/hacking bits were cool and I wish there were a lot more of those scenes/levels. Be wary if you go for a rigger build, there are a couple points in the game where glitches are possible to encounter, you'll have to unequip your drones to progress and it felt kinda sad considering that's the whole point of the build I wanted. The story is also very linear, I think there's only one optional mission you can do that diverges from the main plot.\n\nIt's a 2d isometric game, so if you're not into that sort of retro style you may not like it. I thought it was gorgeous, and along with story-telling and the slang it was really easy to feel immersed and taken away by the plot. There's no voice acting, only text with pre-written options (of varying personalities) of your character's reply. After a couple hours of playing I didn't want to stop because I wanted to see what would happen next. The story and atmosphere are A+ for me and I plan on buying the new game solely based on that.\n\nThere's a decently sized mod community as well. I haven't played any yet but I have a few user made campaigns to try out soon that seem worthwhile.","October 19, 2014","true","21.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/recommended/234650/","mysterd","MysterD "The Gaming Toaster"","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/","1429 products in account","Shadowrun Returns is a throwback to the days of old, which feels absolutely fresh in this modern era. This takes me back to the golden era of RPG's in the mid-to-late 1990's - which was back when RPG's were often isometric; turn-based; party-based; and used a mixture of both 2D + 3D environments + character models. If this sounds like something that would be up your alley - you likely have already have purchased SrR (Shadowrun Returns) or should buy this game ASAP. Shadowrun Returns is simply nothing short of fantastic.\n\nShadowrun Returns (base-game) comes equipped with "Dead Man's Switch" for its base-game's single-player campaign. You play a runner (whose class, if you want to pick one; race, class, skills, etc can be determined by you) whose friend recently died. Actually, he was murdered. Your job is to find who is responsible, why, and decide what to do about the matter. It seems that our friend is linked to a bunch of strange murders that have being happening in this futuristic mix of both a cyberpunk setting (futuristic world where corporations, computers, hacking + whatnot are all par for the course) + fantasy elements (elves + dwarves are here; and magic can all take place in this game-world here). And that's just the start of things - so, that I don't spoil everything.\n\nOne thing that absolutely sets SrR apart from many other modern-day games - there is just no voice-acting. It's not that this game needs voice-acting, either. This is one of the best written games I've seen in years, feeling like a throwback to the days of Planescape: Torment (late 90's). This game is not just a great game, but it also so happens to be a great book to read. You'll be doing plenty of reading here. The prose, dialogue & characters are absolutely excellent - littered with tons of description + is extremely verbose. If you've been missing games to be littered w/ tons of description when characters actually do things, since graphics do plenty of the talking these days - you're in for a treat here with SrR, since the writing here is excellent.\n\nWhile the graphical quality will certainly not top the technical aspect of the most recent hardware-pushing graphical show - the direction of the graphics are excellent. The artistic direction game is loaded with tons of style + substance - with its excellent 2D + 3D mixture of graphics. This feels like a modern-day revival of games from the Infinity Engine.\n\nCombat feels very similar to the classic Fallout 1 + 2. You have a limited number Action Points that you can use spend to do attacks or moves. The combat of this game is quite tactical + turn-based. It always feels great, sounds great, and is a lot of fun to take on. Some of the most interesting + fun battles take place when some of your party members are in the literal game-world, while other party members might be in the computer-world matrix - where you'll be balancing doing combat on two different fronts. Nothing short of awesome.\n\nMost of this game's campaign is a linear affair, where you also might have a few side-quests here and there on your way. This is not an open-world game, by any means. Not that it needs to be, either - as the game often stays very focused on its excellent story, game-world, settings, and characters. Here and there, you'll be given a few different ways to solve quests - which can be be done or result differently, all based on your stats, skills & whatnot.\n\nShadowrun Returns is a fantastic throwback to the 1990's era of RPG's, if it was just made with modern graphics + high-resolution support. Gamers that have been wanting a high-quality turn-based RPG where you control an entire party entirely - look no further. If you've wanted superb prose, dialogue, and writing - look no further than SrR. If having this great "Dead Man's Switch" campaign (which took me around 16 hours or so to finish) wasn't enough - this game has the Editor come with it. SrR is on the Steam WorkShop and there are a good deal of mods + campaigns made by gamers out there. Being given such a great campaign + an editor here - is there more that old-school RPG gamers can really ask for here?\n\nGrade = A.","July 15, 2014","true","16.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

On the one hand the game is not bad and on the other hand I can't recommend it to someone who expects an RPG. Many aspects of this game are good and are a solid foundation for an RPG but the campaign is way to limited for an recommendation\n\n+ The Charactersystem: It allows lots of different builds. Unfortunately they are not balanced and some skills won't be needed too much.\n\n+ The interface: It was created to also work on touchpads so it can feel a bit "clunky". However I did not have any problems navigating the menus.\n\n- The save system: The game only saves on the beginning of a map. This can be annoying but it is not the reason why I can't recommend the game to RPG gamers.\n\n- The story/campaign: This is the my main problem with the game. It is way too linear. Don't get me wrong the story is good in introducing the world too you but all the time when I played the game I thought: "Surely after the next mission I will have more freedom to explore the world, have some more banter with companions or get better gear" In my opinion the story ends to fast, dialogues with the few interesting NPCs is very limited, no decisions which could affect the story... well the important stuff besides a good character system.\n\n+ The graphics: I liked the graphics the only bad thing: The resolution-settings: define how far you can zoom into the game.\n\nLong story short: The base game itself is good but I can't recommend the game with the "dead mans switch"-campaign. I hope I can recommend the game after the release of the next (dlc) campaign because as I said the game is not entirely bad it just needs a good official campaign.","January 26, 2014","false","24.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","3"

I had a good time with it, and apparently the sequel buffs out some of the quirks. There's a few oddities. The inventory management and party system is non-standard, but you're a grown person - you'll figure it out. The art is great, and you want a closer look at it. I only wish the game didn't keep trying to force you to zoom out. A few other weird issues manifest, especially in the early game when you and the game are still getting to know each other. I get the impression of a solid foundation having been laid but then parts of the structure being abruptly canceled and quickly made to achieve a base level of functionality. You can specialize in a weapon but then there's only 3 weapons of that class you can ever buy sort of stuff. Probably a result of the tabletop system being implemented literally without followthrough in the game proper\n\nA few other areas assume a familiarity with the tabletop system and aren't explained especially well in the game, but they weren't gamebreakers for a 13-hour long RPG. You might make a bad decision and sort of de-optimize your build, but it's not a huge hassle. The game isn't very unforgiving. I played through on hard mode and only failed once in an early mission. For example, cybernetic upgrades aren't really explained very well in the game, and I purchased some cool robo-legs, and then later discovered that I was kind of stuck with them and there would never be any significant upgrades. I get the impression that the tabletop actually has lots more depth that they just sort of ran out of time to implement, and that these shortcomings (Just add more items to the shopping cart) could be easily addressed in fan made levels or whatnot.","November 22, 2014","true","14.8"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

Also there's absolutely no interaction with it accept for cover options and a few active objects.\n2) The autosave option is a pain... especially when you have to reload due to a bug.\n3) Numerous BUGS! "escaping" camera (occuring even in "locked" mode!), unselectable "active objects", weird interface lags.\n4) Original campaign storyline is linear. Don't expect many side quests or free content exploration becouse there is NO CONTENT, there's only a series of tactical missions.\n\nThe only hope for this game is fanmade content, but I'm dropping it untill the engine gets fixed (that might be forever).","December 9, 2013","false","11.8"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","0"

Brawler, weapon specialist, hacker, drone control, mage, shaman etc... Different stats determine how good you are in each ability.\n+ Fun combat. Its turn based so strategy is involved in how you develop your character but also your party members. Combat is also fast paced.\n+ Lots of spells, weapons and armor to further customize your characters\n+ Easy to learn game mechanics. At first I thought the game would be intimidating however a few minutes into the combat and I realized how simple it was\n+ Great graphics and art style. I really enjoy the cyberpunk setting mixed with all the crazy characters.\n+ Character portraits look really nice\n+ Very slick UI and HUD\n\n\nThe Bad\n- Can be frustrating when you character misses on enemies even with a high hit percentage.\n- Even after you kill all enemies, rather than the game exiting battle mode you have to control each party member to the exit to progress\n- minor bugs.\n\nConclusion\nIf you loved the original Fallout games or even Baldurs Gate, you need to play this game.

It's not a perfect game, but it's a very enjoyable take on the genre, with enough innovation to feel fresh.\n\nPROS:\n- the biggest pro is the writing; the story is excellent noir-ish cyberpunk fare, and the dialogue is very well written\n- combat (especially late game combat) can be thrilling\n- the environments are attractive\n- there are some small and pleasing genre innovations (for example, hiring a party on a mission-to-mission basis, inventory/stash management is well done, the stat/levelling system is very versatile and effective)\n- the hacking system can lead to some really great combat encounters with fighting happening simultaneously in the real world and the matrix, and consequences of each fight has limited spillover on to the other\n\nCONS:\n- the game is quite short with very little outside the main story path; I did every side mission and finished in under 9 hours\n- the combat music is repetitive\n- not enough weapons,  some balance issues,  some stats/classes basically worthless\n- the environments felt dead; few people in the environment, even fewer that will talk to you, and zero incentive to explore (not really any scavenging)\n- some of the lategame setpiece fights are too long and repetitive\n- the game was too easy overall (played on normal)\n\n\nanyway, I hear Dragonfall is better, so I'll be getting that too, but if this is on sale or something and Dragonfall isn't, it's still worth your money.","November 22, 2014","true","15.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

Riggers seem OP once you get some money under your belt riggers can be up to 3 individual characters (combat) and circumvent things with drones (vents).\n\n4. Adept felt on the whole kinda meh. i beat the game and the sequal as an adept first and the second one helps but you still have to activate your abilities wasting 1/3 or 1/2 of your turn just to do the same damage as other people when in the scource game (tabletop) adepts can be passive wrecking machines just as dangerous as any cybersam.\n\n5. a few targeting glitches very rare but not being able to shoot at certain enemies at certain times "just cause" is a little annoying.\n\n6. i would have liked to see more control over your crews loadout and even maybe talent growth especially in the second one as the characters are more integrated into the story as opposed to just coyote in the first one.\n\n----------------------------\nin closing all in all the stories are good for both this and its sequal, the gameplay is solid enough especially for a small dev. They both allow a lot of character options, and advancement strategies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/recommended/234650/","TeaSeeOh","TeaSeeOh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaSeeOh/","526 products in account","As someone who has never played the original Shadowrun game(s), and knew nothing about it, I found this to be pleasantly suprising. The atmosphere is definitely awesome. A fantasy-esque type Cyberpunk world, with trolls, orcs, elves, and dwarves? Very hard to dislike! It also does a good job building up the setting, with characters using unique slang equivalent to swear words of our own such as drek, fragging, etc. You really get immersed into the story. A good number of skills can be used even in dialogue, so I feel like no matter how you build your character you'll likely be hard pressed to not have a unique choice when chatting it up with NPCs.\n\nThat being said, however...the game is fairly linnear. Even though you have numerous unique dialogue choices, they almost always lead to the same end result(s), which is very disappointing. There is no branching in this game, it's all essentially from A to B, dialogue included. Granted, I only beat Dead Man's Switch, so maybe Dragonfall and the eventual Hong Kong campaign is different, but I really didn't feel like choices even mattered. It was a straight shot, a pure theme park ride. I see little point in replaying to attempt to get a different experience, as the story didn't really seem flexible by any means.\n\nSpeaking of story, my goodness was it ♥♥♥♥ing random as all get out.You start with hunting down a modern Jack the Ripper. He is taking different organs and body parts from various victims, your friend included. That's where you come in, just another slum dog shadow runner who promises justice to your dead friend, with a profit promised if you can bring his killer to justice. Sounds good so far....Except it eventually leads to uncovering a deeper plot that involves essentially saving the world from a cult who is trying to bring bugs from a different plane into our own existence/world? What the hell? Complete with a secret society who has prepared for this, who want you to lead the charge. So yeah, the story definitely takes a huge jump in direction mid-way through, and it wasn't really to my liking. It just feels like a thematic mess of things, with the writer trying to go into too many direction and add far too many twists for the sake of grandeur.\n\nThat aside, gameplay wise I enjoyed the heck out of this title. I attribute that mostly due to my love of tactical turn-based rpgs like XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts, etc. and this does a pretty serviceable job of being enjoyable( though it's fairly easy, in all honesty ). I tried making it difficult for myself by sending only my main, created character on a side-quest run, and honestly it was still a breeze due to I suppose how I built my character( Pistols, Quickness, Dodge primarily ). I would crit every other shot with my main character, on top of almost always having pretty much a 99% chance to hit.\n\nNow that I mention percentages, and chances to hit, this brings me to a frustrating piece toward the end-game when you're fighting a particular enemy. This one enemy requires you kill their physical form before killing their "ghost" or "ethereal" form. You have to hit them 3 times in that ghost form with a specific weapon, problem being however that you only get 2 attempts with that one weapon, and you only have 2 characters with this weapon. If you don't kill them in that round, they manifest themselves physically again, forcing you to kill them...again to get them to exit their body. So....you end up praying to RNGesus to finish off this enemy. Well, more accurately, enemIES. You fight up to 3-4 of these guys at once, and it just becomes a dice roll you have to boringly sit through for each and every guy. Numerous times I would have an 83% or 84% chance miss twice, only to rinse and repeat the process. Yeah, not fun.\n\nAnother problem this game faces, which I hope is a bug and not a design decision, is being stuck in a combat, turn-based state where while navigating an area or "dungeon" you have the movement tiles you're restricted to. You'll be forced to slowly progress your entire party, in a turn-based manner throughout an area, interacting with certain quest triggers, when there's no enemies in sight whatsoever. It ends up being such a chore if you see a lootable item across the room. I feel like my game's length was artificially extended due to this. What could have been a 10 minute segment turns into a 30 minute one just because of having to navigate an area in that turn-based manner. Lame.\n\nOther than those complaints, however, I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough. It's pretty short, but thankfully due to an editor there's a fair amount of custom content on the Steam workshop.","July 29, 2015","true","15.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

This is one of the most linear Rpg's of it's kind i've ever played. Like exploring an open world, picking up side missions, and finding gear? Shadow run has none of this. Instead your stuck in an incredibly tiny hub area (usually just a bar, which you can't leave, though sometimes you have access to the city), which you use to hop from one mission to next, as mentioned before only a couple of these which deviate from the main storyline.  There is no loot really, the only item progression you get is buying the slightly better piece of armor/weapon/decker interface from the hub store. The story was holding it's own, and was a fairly interesting murder mystery untill about halfway through when ***SPOILERS*** you suddenly have to fight a bunch of astral bugs from another dimension and save the world... somehow? It gets completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in other words. The combat is fairly good, but most of the time you're actually not even fighting anything so I can't reccomend the game based on the combat alone.

Combat mode is activated when you encounter aggressive NPCs. Combat options include using cover, summoning creatures to fight for you, healing and boosting your team, spells, melee weapons and gun play. You have direct control of your own team. Interaction with the world and team is highly limited when out of combat unfortunately.\n\nWhen you start a game, you pick your character's gender, race (human, elf, ork, dwarf or troll) and either pick a pre-designed class or build your own. The character creation and progression system is highly flexible, you are given points which you allocate to certain abilities, enhancing them or giving you more options. You earn more of these by progressing through the plot or doing side quests in game. Throughout the game, you can also learn new spells, buy new weapons or invest in implants (at the expense of your ability to cast spells).\n\nThe default campaign that comes with the game is short, linear, and filled with plenty of good and interesting characters that aren't fully fleshed out. Good plot, but missed opportunity. User generated campaigns are hit and miss, but some surpassing the default campaign.\n\nGraphics look beautiful, and really delivers the cyberpunk look and feel. Music and sound effects are good, but with only a limited selection, you end up hearing the same few tracks and sounds often.\n\nTL:DR: good for scratching that old-school isometric RPG itch, some good strategic choices to make in the game. The default campaign is fine, but limited, might want to check out the user made stuff, or DLC.","May 1, 2014","true","142.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I give it a  3/5 I do not see myself playing through this game again other than once every few years or something,it just lacks replay value to me.\n\n\nFull Review:\n\nThis game has probably one of the best tactical rpg A.I. in terms of difficulty I have seen in awhile.The combat system is pretty good and the % chance to hit works just fine. The locations you goto are very vibrant and colorful and fit the setting of the game quite well. The lack of the ability to rotate the map becomes a pain in the ♥♥♥ in a few instances but not anywhere near as much as one would think thanks to careful placement of obsticles. Skill tree wise, there are some aspects I do not like such as the fact a summon has to buy spirits to sommon.To aide with this though one can summon a spirit from a location on the map bt only some locations have them. I played my first playthrough on hard as a summoner with riffle skills and conjuring ability.\n\nThe Decker class (a cyber hacker ) is completely pointless because most of the missions where it matters to have on you get one for free or get recommended one for cheap that is pretty strong.Its a waste of time to even bother with the decker skill tree and there not many places you can hack which takes away from having a multiple way of doing things.I find this a bad flaw since this game is linear and there is hardly a choice of consequence. All the other skill tree classes are useful. Overall though the skill tree point allocation system some have problems with,but it seems balanced for how the game is so I had no problem with it. Pistols,shotguns,rifles,drones,gernades,elemental spirit summons,med kits,cybernetic implants,etc are your purchase choices.\n\nQuests in the game seem mostly geared toward the main story,I found there to be hardly any side quests.There are more optional objectives that you can do while on a main quest than there are side quests. This a let down since the optional quests in the main quest seem like they are naturally apart of the main quest anyway.\n\nCharacter creation is standard though limited.What character you pick decides what your starting stats will be.Now here is where some people might not like.In the skill tree races have a max stat they can reach for skills.For example in many lure Elvan are largely focused toward magic,nature and spirits so they tend to have high max stat allocation ability in areas related to it than other people. This sort of system in my opinion takes away from being able to make your character your own,however seems to convey a standard lure for the different races.Human,Elvan,Dwarf,Troll are your races to choose from.\n\nThe story for me was very passable.You will need to follow it because of having to pick different dialog tree's so you will need to know some of which was going on,but I found myself skimming through parts of the dialog exchange because it was not engaging enough to keep my interest. There are some interesting points to the main story but overall I feel the story hurts the game the most.I wont say its not an okay story, I just found it very uninteresting. Some of the ingame events that occurred were fun however short lived without much detail for some.\n\n\nOverall\n\nThe game is playable because of various locations,graphics, and a good tactical  battle system.However being an rpg there character classes hardly have much difference to them and the skill system is lackluster.The lack of consequence of choice and branching story/quest elements touted to be in makes the game suffer for it.The combat system saves it making the game playable considerably but the story is forgettable and I found myself not being engrossed into it. Since steam lacks any other option other than a thumbs up or down I have to give it a down for its weak presentation of rpg gameplay and story.","December 5, 2013","false","62.0"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

As a RPG fan, I really wanted to like Shadowrun Returns, but the game kept disappointing me on so many levels and I constantly failed to find RPG features that make me love RPG games.\n\nThe story is very weak. Just compare the plot with Fallout series, the story of Chosen One, or Planescape Torment, the story of nameless one who wakes up in a mortuary one day and tries to find his forgotten past. Imagine Baldur's Gate's story, Candlekeep attack, Gorion's death, and the hunt for Saverok. Not to mention Kotor. This story doesn't give you any excitement or mystery in the storyline, and I constantly felt like the whole thing was written in a few days after the artwork was designed, although I am sure it is not true.\n\nThere is no freedom of open world environment. The game dictates where we should go, what we should do to complete a quest. There are no random encounters, locations or rare items. The game doesn't reward you when you succesfully accomplish a mission besides karma points.There are certain areas where you can buy your supplies, have information on your investigations and you can't miss them. There is no puzzle that players can possibly struggle with.\n\nWe are very limited with NPC options as well. Instead of choosing among several NPCs who have different POVs on matters, we have to choose no-name mercenaries for each battle. Think about Might and Magic series, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, or Fallout and imagine how NPC choices were changing the gameplay, and how each character had different point of views on your actions.\n\nIf Shadowrun Returns hadn't described itself as an RPG game, I wouldn't write any of this, but I think this game does not even  deserve to be in the same category with all of the other RPG games. I would even go further and say that even GTA IV, or Diablo is more RPG than Shadowrun Returns because of all the reasons explained above. I think the game tried to accomplish a lot and failed miserably because of this, and I hope they won't make the same mistakes in the future titles.","February 9, 2014","false","18.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The main problem is that the battle system is incredibly shallow, it is not balanced and to be honest it feels like there wasn't any attempt to create it like a system. It just seems like they added stuff because they thought "well this is Shadowrun we need to have that". Decking for example is largely useless unless you are playing a deck heavy UGC, other than that just bring along a decker on your mission and you're good to go.\n\nThe guns don't feel much different from one another and spells that arnt bugged just seem bland, with again there appearing to be no thought put into the design and place of each mechanic. I think the main problem with the approach they took was that they were trying to develop it for tablet as well as PC and unfortunately it makes the PC version suffer through a general lack of options and customizability that you find in most PC titles.","February 2, 2014","false","63.7"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

It had orcs, elfs, humans, dwarfs, gnomes, giants and minotaurs. My little mind was blown away. I was so excited, I couldnt stop browsing.\n\nTime passed and memories faded.

Gameplay is fluent and fun. You have many races to choose from, and lot of interesting classes. My first playthrough Im using a rigger. You are basicly an engineer with 2 droids to use and control. Im using shotguns and most of my points are in intelligence, drone control and drone combat. Partysize is four, and you have tons of choices. You hire your party members to every missions. Im usually using me ( as a rigger) , a mage, ranged specialist, and a shaman. Enemies vary alot, and story line is amazing. Its so fun, and entertaining. You can create your own campaigns and upload them to Steam. There are many good custom campaigns to download. This game is gonna entertain you a long time.

You play a Shadowrunner (something like a private detective or a hired special agent) who's thrown into the investigation of an ex-colleague's murder only to find himself wrapped in a much greater plot...\n\nReview Details\nFor those not familiar: "Shadowrun is a science fantasy theme set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics,magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy fiction, horror and detective fiction." --Wikipedia. I would add the "Noir" keyword in that passage, as well.\n\nSRR is best played with a mouse and is entirely built into a third person isometric engine, just like the original Fallout games. The visuals (scenery, character portraits etc) are very well made and capture the atmosphere of the world, resonating in its depth and mystery. The music and SFX are just OK, and note that the game has no voice-over at all. The mechanics of the game are solid but they could use some more balancing and polishing. What annoyed me most is that the game tends to "lock" you in turn-based combat mode, even when all enemies are downed, until you reach a specific map location. Also, the stat-system (the so-called "Karma" points) is kinda inflated, not all skill-trees are well structured, and many of the items or skills you acquire become obsolete quite fast as you get better ones. The game is not very difficult: It took me 15 hours to complete on Normal difficulty and I only failed and had to reload a couple of times. You can quick-save/load anytime with F5/F9.\n\nThe plot itself is interesting and keeps you motivated to see what's next. Each time you think you're close to the ending, something more pops up, throwing you into a bigger plot! Role-playing is quite varied and there's usually multiple ways to progress in the story which, however, is fully linear. However, I played the game only once, so I am not sure if the consequences are really that different if you pick other dialogue options... Most of the characters are memorable and well developed but I think that the lack of voice-over kinda limits their profoundness. Finally, I like how the game borrows elements from classic books/games, e.g. Gibson's Neuromancer or the Fallout universe, and how it renders stereotype characters, e.g. the "corrupt cop", the "badass waitress", the "taciturn bouncer" etc. Well written!\n\nVerdict\nIn overall, SRR is a decent game, mostly recommend if you're into that theme (cyberpunk) and/or that game genre (story-rich RPG with tactical combat). There's not something really special about it, but it was surely worth my time! If I were to rate it, I'd put it around 70-80%. They say that the second game, Dragonfall, is much better than SRR, so I got high hopes for that one!","August 29, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","7"

Because of this, you might want to get it on sale.  The story-driven gameplay has a limited, if not non-existant, replay value... and you can't really stretch it out.  Well, you could make it longer by getting up from your keyboard between turns and spending that time with your family, but no one wants that.  Especially your family.\n\nThe skill trees don't seem very important to success.  I put every karma point I ever got in dodge and/or shotgun... only.  And, still I blindly walked through the game without any actually difficult combat - which you'd find odd if you compared my random clicking to any real strategy.  I even destroyed the turrets that you're supposed to have to hack, because my dodge was too high for them to hit me (and then the game forces you to hack them to proceed anyway).  Most items are also pretty pointless... you can just buy one really good weapon, a couple of medkits (or just put a healer on your team), and forget the rest.\n\nThe option of buying all that cyberware is confusing, because there doesn't seem to be a way to repeatedly take missions for money.  I can imagine some people making the game more difficult by blowing all their money on gear and then not being able to hire a proper team.  I only recall seeing one 'bonafide' side-mission, and the way I resolved it seemed to aggrevate the mission-giver at the Seamstress Union to the point where he quit talking to me - which I take it to mean that he wasn't intrinsic to the play mechanics and probably wouldn't have given me more missions even if he'd stayed.  It really seems like the player is stuck to the rails of the story and that there's no real economy in the game.\n\nAnother thing about the gear:  Some items like the leg options only seemed to be slottable on one side of my body, though there was no apparent indicator that they were either an upgrade (I already hade a cyber leg on that side of the body) or are somehow restricted to one side.  I'm thinking this is a bug, but the game's not long enough, nor are the gear upgrades important enough, for it to matter.\n\nOther than not properly supporting my native 2560x1080 resolution (1920x1080 was the max, and that gets stretched when in fullscreen mode), the game works really well under Linux.","November 2, 2014","true","13.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

As I am someone who plays for story and characters, I was absolutely smitten by the writing. It's not so much the plot, but the little things that make this title superb. Dialogue, descriptions, and the mechanics of their delivery. Some people may not enjoy this much text, but I delight in it. At this point I am 8.5 hours into the game, and I cannot get enough. In addition to the writing, combat is also enjoyable. I'm not a power-player so my builds may not be efficient, but I appreciate the game allowing me to develop my character the way I see fit in terms of role-playing, and still have fun fighting. Once I am done with the campaign, I will be sure to check out the authoring tools.

Charette Secrets of Power Shadowrun Novel series, you have a Sam Watts, instead of Sam Verner, heck you see one of Verner's buddies in there too, also with one of your runners named Coyote, somehow a connection to Sam Verner, however indirectly this time. Ultimately like that Novel series you are a man (or woman) on a hunt, in the Secrets of Power it was Sam Verner on the hunt for his sister, in here it was your Shadowrunner on the hunt for Sam Watts murderer, and in the end just like with the novel you end up dealing with some creepy spirits and it became the main issue to deal with at the end of the story. Frankly I am shocked nobody else saw how they merely copied various elements from the Secrets of Power novel series and recreated a cheaper story based on such elements but of far more mediocre result and with a far too cliché ending for the genre. So story wise the single module provided is a enormous let down.\n\nNow for the Gameplay, well its not too bad, but felt fairly limited, you have effectively a single Shadowrunner you can buid and equip, those you can hire are pre-made entirely and you can't even modify their gear, shouldn't you be able to buy weapons and stuff and loan it to them or something? It would make sense... rather you are stuck with whatever they want. Also they don't level up along with you, but as the game advance the entire list of potential runners is updated at a few spots in the storyline, also you only have two runners that have any connection to the storyline mostly, those two are involved in it and one of them is only available for a couple of missions, the other is only available after the first is not available anymore, which mean you never truly feel involved with your crew all too much and they are very much expandable assets. Also a problem is the bits of the story in the Matrix, unless you make your char a Decker, or at least update one to be a Decker on the side of anything else you want it, well you are going to have issues, the few spots where you have to deal with the Matrix would have to rely on pre-made chars that you don't have any choices over the build for, which can be a serious issue. They shouldn't have made the Matrix runs a necessity if you only have one custom char and that char might not be a Decker.\n\nAnother issue is the game sometimes bugs and those bugs can be dire, at one point I wasn't able to do anything anymore during a fight, I couldn't attack or anything, so I had to close the game and load my auto-save, only happened once, yet its still annoying.","August 10, 2015","false","10.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilbewarewehavewaffles/recommended/234650/","evilbewarewehavewaffles","Indigo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilbewarewehavewaffles/","95 products in account","Man, I really REALLY wanted to like this game...\nA big part of that is because I think the world of Shadowrun is an awesome setting for a game, I mean I've never played the tabletop game but I've heard loads about it (primarily from watching Counter Monkey) and I think the idea of mixing a Gibson-esque Cyberpunk setting with elements of more traditional western fantasy (Orks, Elves, Dragons, what have you) is a really cool concept. I'm one of those people who could never really get into games/movies/books about western medievil fantasy settings, they just always seemed kinda boring by design, seen one seen 'em all y'know? Skyrim is one of the only games with that sort of Tolkien-esque world that was able to hold my attention, and that was only because the Nordic stuff was able to overshadow it and make for a more interesting world (Snowy peaks > green fields, just sayin').\nBut Cyberpunk? I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE cyberpunk!\nI love the idea of speculating about  a darker future, how technology has changed us for better or for worse, the ethics and practicalities of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, it's just got so much more meat to it. And when you take all that AND THEN add magic and elves and ♥♥♥♥? You've got the potential for some really interesting ideas and stories, and I'd absolutely love to see a game do this setting justice... but this is just not it.\nFirst, I'd like to disclaim this by clarifying that I am not entirely versed in the Shadowrun lore, I don't know how true to the books this game is, so I won't judge it one way or another in that respect. I will however say that had I not known anything at all about Shadowrun prior to playing this game I don't think I'd have gotten much from it. Things like the Sixth World and the Great Awakening are referenced but nobody ever explicitly explains what they are or how the dynamics of this world work. Why did magic come back? Where did it go? Where did all the elves, orks, and trolls come from? Who are S.T.A.R.S? What's a Doc-Wagon? None of these things are addressed, and while I understand that this is a game made for and by longtime Shadowrun fans, and as such there's going to be references that only long-time fans will necessarily understand, I get that, but It's not a good sign when I feel like I need to crack a players guide for the tabletop game just to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and that's how I felt while playing much of this game.\nAlso, the writing in this game, or atleast the base campaign, is very... eh.\nI Mean it wasn't bad, it all makes sense, there were no glaring plot-holes or laughably bad exposition, but that's just the thing, it's very... okay. It's not what I'd call bad, but save a few stand out-moments it wasn't all that exceptional either. The idea of building a story around your dead friend hiring you to solve his murder from beyond the grave is an interesting idea but I've seen it done before, and far better. Also, while I definitely think that a noir-style crime drama would be the perfect framework to explore the world of Shadowrun, I just don't feel like the story presented lived up to the setting's potential. But again, this only refers to the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, I understand that many fan-made campaigns acted as a far better realizations of the Shadowrun setting, but I don't really think it's fair to include user-made content in a review like this.\nI think one of the major things that kills this game for me is the fact that it tries to be a throwback to old-school CRPGs, but it's completely linear, and doesn't give you the kind of freedom one would come to expect from a CRPG. There are very few optional missions or objectives to speak of, and while there are multiple ways to complete many of the objectives, much of the time it feels less like a choice, and more like a calculation (I recall one situation where a dialog choice asked me if I wanted to pay this guy 100 creds for what he knows or 50 creds. No speech check, no skills or disciplines involved, flat question of "would you like to pay more money or less for the same information?"). The Dialogue trees in general just feel pretty cut and dry to me, very "nice response/jerk response/witty response," much of the time, and it just comes off as boring to me. I do however think that going text only instead of recording some half-♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting was definitely the right thing to do, in my mind CRPGs have always been about replicating the experience of reading a good book in the context of an interactive environment, and when a game like this adds unnecessary voice acting it sometimes kills the experience, at least for me, and since quite a bit of the actual written dialogue is pretty damn good despite the plot in which it takes place, I am glad they went this route.\nThe turn-based combat is actually one aspect of this game that I thought was pretty good, I mean it's pretty much XCOM light but that's okay, it functions very well and doesn't feel out of place in the setting or genera. I do feel like melee weapons were made somewhat under-powered, which is disappointing to me as I decided to play a Street Samurai specializing in melee and shotguns. Also, this game seems to have some kind of percentage skewing problem in which you seemed to miss "70% chance" shots 80% of the time, but that might have just been my rotten luck. Other then that the combat seems to work just fine for what it is.\nAnother aspect of this game that I found a very mixed bag is the aesthetic, the backgrounds for one thing look fantastic, they're all hand-drawn in the classic CRPG style, and they do the seemingly impossible task of making the aesthetic of a grimy, neon soaked, cyberpunk world look beautiful (all-be-it with a little too much blue-saturation for my tastes). The in-game models on the other hand... not so much. I understand, this game was kick-started, they were on a budget, and as someone who doesn't have a very beefy PC I am rather grateful that they didn't emphasize graphical fidelity and turn the game into a performance hog, but that said, I do think they could have put a little more polish into making the in-game models match the backgrounds a little better, as it stands they just kinda clash and it creates a very odd contrast, it just doesn't look very good.\nI have other criticisms I'd like to level at this game, the character customization was a little lacking for my tastes (especially the outfit choices), some of the character portraits look better then others, and cyberware is drastically underplayed (which is one of my favorite aspects of the cyberpunk setting, so that's especially disappointing to me), but at this point I'm nearing the level of nit-picking so I think it's about time to wrap this up. I feel like a total jerk right now, because this is a kickstarted game I'm talking about here, it's a miracle this game was even made at all, and as a budding Shadowrun fan myself I am glad that it exists and is introducing the setting to other people. However at the end of the day the mark of a good game is whether or not I feel truly engaged in it, feel self-driven in playing and enjoying it, and look forward to playing it some more as soon as I power it down, and Shdaowrun Returns just didn't do it for me.\nI have been informed that Dragonfall fixed many of the problems I had with Returns however, so I do intend to give that a go when I can, and I really hope that turns out to be true because Shadowrun deserves a game to truly do it justice, and this just ain't it.","November 14, 2014","false","16.0"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","0"

And by this I'm referring to the fact I can't seem to play a game where I can say, in clear-cut manner "this is good or this is bad", but always have to keep a balancing scale in my head and actively weighing positives and negatives against each other. Well, in one more attempt to remain consistent such is the case with Shadowrun Returns so let's get down to it, chummer.\n\nFirst thing first – it's GREAT to see Shadowrun make a proper return to the world of video games following its less than stellar last entry. That does come with a caveat or two because Returns was funded thanks to a Kickstarter project and this fact seeps through almost every aspect of the game, but we'll get around to that in due time. If there is one major Achilles heel worth noting it's the fact the entire game feels like a very light venture into the world of Shadowrun, but also one that makes only a token effort in explaining inner workings and setting itself to the uninitiated. If you don't know much about Shadowrun you'll get a brief 101; only for parts pertinent to what you're dealing with and delivered to you at a snail's pace primarily through loading screen text. This goes beyond matters of fluff and extends to systems themselves  - it's a borderline RPG-lite experience compared to what many have come to expect these days, eschewing things like looting fallen bodies and any great interaction with the world that surrounds you aside from few mechanics-related interactable points. This goes hand-in-hand with very light-weight tutorials which you'll have to actively seek instead of them being naturally introduced to ease you into the game. This may or may not be a relevant sticking point depending on your level of familiarity no only with Shadowrun but also with RPGs in general, though.\n\nTo keep everything in perspective it is important to note this game was not made on a multi-million dollar budget and that should exempt it from some of the problems, even if things such as sometimes unresponsive functions and somewhat uninspired takes on certain elements like implementation of the Matrix remain annoying throughout the game. Speaking of which, as much as I love to see everything ranging from Adepts to Deckers presented not all Archetypes were created equal as far as unique selling points go and neither were Etiquettes aka your social "specializations" which unlock specific options in dialog. Game really could have used more of these options in general, but I guess it functions acceptably well with this overall linear structure of the game taking you from location to location as story demands and not letting you re-visit older ones, local quasi-hub notwithstanding.\n\nThat was enough nagging about the game, where's the good stuff? Returns is not a bad game and you may have noticed I gave it a thumb up recommending it despite my incessant complaining in paragraphs above. Why? Because it's a still a competent RPG with great flavor and decent character building options. It smartly offsets the fact you only customize the main character by letting you choose who to take with you on missions from a roster of contracts, quality ranging depending on how deep your pockets are. Even though it kinda takes a while to kick in, game's story certainly delivers on everything from standard Shadowrunner fare to more... out there revelations and twists you will probably not see coming, but which still have absolute basis in existing lore.  Relatively short by RPG standards, but succinctly to the point and with no filler to waste your time. Characters? They definitely take a backseat to events unfolding although I have no doubt you'll find favorites among them.\n\nLast advice, chummer – never EVER cut a deal with a dragon if you value your sorry existence.","August 30, 2015","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was a huge fan of Shadowrun in my youth during the 80's and enjoyed playing it table top. As a video game it is a really good immersive feel.

Scratch that, because it's nothing like XCOM. Sure there are some minor similarities in battle mechanics but that's where the similarities end. This game is good in it's own right. You've got a pretty interesting plot about finding your old friend's killer to make a couple of bucks. From there the story goes down a rabbit hole to uncover the culprit and turns into quite the adventure.\n\nThis game isn't necessarily about saving the world or some greater good. You're pretty low on cash and a lot of times I compromised my morals to make a couple bucks. Mercenaries don't come cheap in this run down futuristic, magic tech world and we've all gotta eat. That being said although this game is short, for an RPG you'll end up taking a lot of jobs and get to meet a few brothers in arms. There are many characters you'll encounter but aside from the handful you actually get to know a bit most are for fighting purposes.\n\nThere are numerous skills to customize your character with. When you complete missions or do good deals it rewards you with karma points pretty frequently to upgrade whatever you like. I suggest finding a particular specialty and sticking with it. When I started my I decided I'd be a decker with focus on melee skills. Decker was a good choice as there are a couple of situations later in the game that require that particular skill set. But I soon found that most enemies carry guns and you know what they say about bringing a knife to a gun fight. Charisma was an important skill as you can get more money by charming the pants off of people using your words. This also had a couple of layers to it as you learn new etiquette surprisingly it's the choices I don't expect that pop up in dialogue.\n\nLike most strategy RPGs having a diverse range of companions helps in all missions but you'll end up hiring the same people who complement your style. Battles require a bit of strategy as AI isn't stupid. If you cluster all your forces in one spot an enemy will likely bomb your group. That being said you'll have more of the "kill all foes" variety of missions. How you do it is up to you.\n\nThis game is good but I would have liked to see more locations or other town like places you could meet runners in between missions. There are conversations referencing other places in the Matrix but sadly you never get to experience them. There were also a couple of bugs that froze my game during missions. They were random and seemed to fix it self after a restart but saving often helps. Hopefully all these issues are resolved in the Dragonfall sequel but in itself it's an alright game and you should try it if you're into tactical, futuristic RPGs.","March 21","true","22.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is good... in potential.\nDead Man's Switch is fun, but feels kinda short, and that's really all you get at the onset. The real good of this game is the fact that it's a way to both tell your own stories, run campaigns with numbers attached for others, or enjoy those campaigns that people toss up on the workshop or otherwise.\n\nThe best part, to me, is the full ability customization. Rather than limiting you to the severity of most of the actual tabletops, this game does its own thing, more like the old console games back in the day, rather than duct taping itself to the tabletop rules like most tabletop video game adaptations. You wanna play an 'wared up ork street sammy and pick up a couple spells just for that special occasion? Go nuts. You wanna play a luddite mage and sneak in a few points to make yourself stupidly good with a sniper rifle? Have fun.\n\nHonestly, my only major complaint is that the availability of character customization options is incredibly limited. One face per race/gender combo, and your only real options are a selection of like 10 hairstyles and colors shared across all races, genders, and classes. And the troll looks like a spiky idiot at that. Top it off with the fact that armor only comes in one piece deals, and you're gonna be seeing a lot of a very blah character for a good long time.\nBut if you can get around looking like the same jackass with a bad picture for the whole game, then you pick this ♥♥♥♥ up and play the hell out of it.\n\n(Note: I havent played Dragonfall yet, so this review doesnt include that.

The complete lack of voice acting or animated cinematics even during critical portions of the story, such as, uh, the ending, lend to a bit of a low-budget feel.\nI also wish the game had gamepad support, or at least an option for larger text so I could have played it on my TV like the original back in the day; this is a complaint I could level at the majority of games on Steam, mind you. The game is really quite linear and though my time tracker shows over 25 hours played, much of that was spent on pause or idle, and the game feels kinda short overall. However, what's there is really good. I had lots of fun, and would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game, especially at a sale price.

There are good things about the game and then there are things that could be (way) better. Let's start with the good things first:\n\nIt certainly feels like a Shadowrun game. I've played the pen & paper RPG in the 90s and during the first minutes, the game gets the atmosphere right. It feels like the Seattle of 2050 that I had in my head (or at least very close to it). The artwork is well made and the soundtrack works nicely to support the setting.\n\nYou can choose how to play your character. While the decking part is a bit underwhelming, the choice between weapons or magic is there and quite well balanced. There's a good amount of freedom how to build your character and while it doesn't have a big influence on the outcome of the game, it still gives the game some depth.\n\nDepth... that's the real problem with the game. The story is well written and while it does have a quite large number of twists, in the end it works well. The game is too linear though. There is exactly one optional 'Mr Johnson' run and that's simply not enough in a Shadowrun game. The game feels too much 'on rails' and while you can grab a few optional items for additional creds, there's almost no content you can miss out on. That in turn means there's almost no replay value except if you want to check out magic instead of weapons (or vice versa).\n\nI still recommend the game, because it does give you a good amount of content and especially if you like Cyberpunk. 15 € is too much for it though, so grab it in a sale (they are frequent enough). I'm looking forward to play Dragonfall and see if they added a bit more flesh ;)","October 3, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has a healthy retro flair to it, both using a classic Shadowrun time period and an interface that would not be out of place in RPGs from the turn of the millenia.\n\nThe included base campaign "Dead Man’s Switch" makes for a good entry point for those new to Shadowrun.  The treatment of the Shadowrun setting is excellent and is one of the high-points of the game.  Classic Shadowrun character archetypes are represented, a few familiar faces from previous Shadowrun stories make appearances, and the cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world is generally a joy to explore.  The writing is fittingly hardboiled, if sometimes a bit campy, for the neo-noir plot.  The soundtrack compliments the setting well and there are some very clever musical references to the classic Shadowrun game on the Super Nintendo.\n\nRegrettably, "Dead Man’s Switch" is a rather linear experience.  The writing style is engaging, yet the plot feels somewhat stock.  Most unfortunate, however, is the lack of balance for all character types; certain builds are less useful than others.  Hackers in particular seem to be short changed, as they rarely have opportunities to use their specialities.  Lastly, the game is a bit on the easier side, great for folks either new to the genre or people who are interested only in following the story, but it does include a scaleable difficulty for those who would rather their time in the shadows to be lived on a razor’s edge.\n\nBeyond the included campaign "Dead Man’s Switch," Shadowrun Returns hosts a series of mod tools to allow for player created adventures and content.  As of this writing, there are already some very fun player created missions and campaigns available on the Steam Workshop.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Shadowrun Returns.  Though it has some shortcomings, I found them to be far outweighed by the games strengths.  It’s a game I can easily recommend, especially for fans of RPGs like Fallout, Neverwinter Nights, or the old Infinity Engine games.  And should you have an interest in discovering the world of Shadowrun this is a great place to start.","June 1, 2014","true","57.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I usually dislike WRPG combat but SR's combat was the right kind of difficulty on Normal and it never really threw bullcr*p at you.

In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population, where immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, mercenaries run the shadows to do everyone else’s dirty work with the use of guns, magic and technologies. They call themselves Shadowrunners. This reviews the game with added expansion set Dragonfall.\n\nPros: The first module, called Dead Man’s Switch, is a nice although straightforward introduction to players who aren’t familiar with the game and explores the Seattle setting. The second module, called Dragonfall, offers a lot more character development and additional flexibility and options to complete any given quest, all while exploring the anarchy-governed flux-state of Berlin. The game backgrounds are gorgeous hand-drawn stills, added with the techno-trance music gives the game an eerie atmosphere, each building and object seemingly having a story of its own to tell, while the music adjust to combat scenes before slowing down once you’re back from it. The game progression is straightforward, the skills are broken down into skill trees with a clear view of what you get from raising any attributes or skill. There is no set character class, although you have pre-generated archetypes you can start from.\n\nCons: The story is somewhat linear, most of all in Dead Man’s Switch, where choice will change the dialog but not the outcome of the story. General graphics aren’t on par with the AAA industry, so anyone looking for graphical realism will be sorely disappointed. There is no voice acting, so get ready to read a lot if you want to have any hopes of feeling involved in the story. The two modules which happen at the same time, aren’t related to each other, so there is no progression from one to the other, and are both somewhat quick to play through.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nLet’s judge the game for what it is: a crowdfunded indie game (the success story that put Kickstarter on the map for many people) meant to be used as an engine for the modding community, community that has been very active at creating new stories, new equipment, new world object for other modders, and is using the engine in new and create ways. As you play, you can feel the richness of the game’s tabletop RPG heritage, and you just wish you could learn more about that world. It is fun, it is well worth the money and time, and it’s definitively a game I recommend!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 27, 2014","true","73.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

[KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]\n\n...so the reviews will look the same!\nFinished in about 13 hours, so I will talk very consciously about it. I didn't know it was an indie kickstarted project developed for smartphones and tablets in mind and this explains a lot of cons.\n\nFirst, I would like to talk about the gameplay. Having experience with a lot of RPGs and turn-based games I have been disappointed: percentages to hit seem to be flawed, covering system is ridiculous, inventory is caotic, some combo are overpowered (you'll instakill with rifles and relative stats at 8+), experience points are given not by killing enemies, your party doesn't upgrade, AI always attacks first (resolved in S:HK) and it' also dumb (you can wait for them at corners and instakill with overwatch), you are not given so many possibilities of attacking, you can't use your items outside of combat, you are not given the option of using your teamates abilities in the quests, you have a limited choice of weapons and upgrades, etc.\n\nThen, the story: the first hours were nice (I felt like in sci-fi crime scene) but when things started to became interesting... game ended. This is not the only con: 1) Dialogues are scripted, the choices you'll make DO NOT alter the game 2) Skills are useless for dialogues: even when you are given the choice to use them, they just provide a couple of more rows of text to read or just a 20% more money 3) *someone die, so we have to find the culprit* bla bla *turns out all the city is in danger* bla bla  *gear up and go final attack*.\n\nGraphics: from the screenshots it seems to be very powerful... it's not. Just colourful.\n\nThe matrix puzzles are few and could be passed easily. Same as the envinroment puzzles: you just have to search a little around. There isn't enough attention to the gameplay.\n\nI enjoyed it? Yes and no. Yes because I like these type of games, no because X-Com, Civilizations, Fallout still stand on a higher level. I would call it a nice time waster. If you are looking for a solid game, you should look elsewhere. Dragonfall is better, but I hope they'll get even better in the next chapters.\n\nBest played with Keyboard & Mouse\nRecommended Buy Price < 10$\nScore 6,5/10","May 1","false","26.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Playing through this game was like playing through some of the classic SR adventures, with mysteries to solve, clues to follow, and all manner of unusual individuals to interact with. And firefights, of course. The noir atmosphere is great, and it's quite obvious from gameplay that the creators of the game were fans of the tabletop RPG: there are numerous references to characters and organizations from the gamebooks, some more relevant to the story than others. The music is great, the character creation was satisfyingly customizable: I was able to make a reasonable facsimile of my female Dwarf Decker from the tabletop game with the options present. And the fact that I've been able to play as a Decker and get through the first adventure on Normal difficulty is a testament to the fact that you can play any character type you like and do well. If you're a fan of the original tabletop RPG, I highly recommend "Shadowrun Returns."","November 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thealeks/recommended/234650/","thealeks","The Aleks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thealeks/","350 products in account","Until recently, I was somewhat reluctant to recommend this game. I enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, but, like many people, found it to be more of an interactive novel (with tactical interludes) than a role playing game. Playing around with the editor has been a blast, but I know that this isn't for everyone, and neither is playing through User Generated Content (though there's some excellent stuff out there).\n\nAfter the launch of Dragonfall, however, I can post the positive review with confidence. Aside from implementing the much needed save-anywhere system, Dragonfall is a much more engaging campaign on so many levels. It's what Dead Man's Switch should have been, but wasn't. While the main hub is relatively small, you really do feel like the leader of a team of Shadowrunners, and are able to take on a variety of jobs, and complete them in the order that you wish. The jobs themselves, more importantly, feel a great deal more open, with tough choices and multiple objectives, including optional points of interest. The literally two side quests you got in DMS felt like afterthoughts ("oh crap, we forgot to put side quests in and the game launches in a week!"). Here, everything feels lovingly attended to. This is, perhaps, a major advantage of text based story telling. If you're inclined to pick up the relatively robust editor that comes along with the base game, you'll not that your storytelling capacity is only limited by your writing ability and your imagination (the scripting and map building aren't that hard to learn). If you've got the desire and the ability to write, you can craft beautiful and interesting adventures, whether side quest or main, to your heart's content. And that's what HBS has done this time around.\n\nIn fact, the one thing that hasn't changed is the excellent writing. This isn't high end literature, but it's engaging and interesting all around. It draws you into the world and, in some cases, really captivates you. The charachters, especially your crew members, the fixer, and the occupants of your little slice of berlin, are memorable and interesting to a person.\n\nIt's unfortunate that this had to be released as DLC. The base campaign had the writing down, but it didn't have the wow factor or the, well, interactivity.

It's more of an adventure point'n'click game with occasional forced x-com battles. Most of the time you can click blindly through dialogues (choosing any option that is skill or etiquette granted), to have the best (non-lethal) outcome. Then you click at all interactive spots in the room to progress further - the Dead Man's Switch campaign is made from scripted stages from one room to another with no option of backtracking, exploration or even non-scripted ways to achieve your current goals.\nA plot and the dialogues in the DMS campaign are good, don't get me wrong, but this game would only benefit from converting into a legit point'n'click adventure, since the game mechanics (I know ♥♥♥♥ about Shadowrun so I think they're based on the paper version) - pulled of nicely itself - don't really matter. There's no real use of developing your character, since fights are not really challanging. I just maxed out my rifle skills and rammed through everything - the optional party members were just an obstacle since they only waste your time by often moving your team in a turn fight mode even if there are non enemies in sight. The fights are painfully dumbed down with an unlimited ammo feat.\n\nI would recommend this game if it had a real editor (or a real campaign that isn't just a demo of "look, we can write good dialogues with no real gameplay attached") - but even if the price tag is definitely too high for a "here, have an empty shell players will add content for free later". I didn't find any real fan-made expansion, since the editor allows only to create story-packs (and a fan-made story expansions are hazardous, since most of them are by definition a fruit of an obsessive mania for writing). You can't edit anything vital in the game mechanics, weapons, or anything, from what I can tell.\n\nIt's a nice deal for 1€, though. I could hardly pay more for what this game offers.","October 15, 2014","false","8.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Unfrotunatly, this did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThe game was too on the rails for me to enjoy. Shadowrun is an amazing world and you're not allowed to explore it.\n\nThe stash system makes no sense and is a poor design choice. As far back as SNES, games have allowed you to automatically equip a new item you've purchased and sell your old one or keep it to be stored. Why do my new weapons go automatically to my stash? I purchased it because it was better than what I had currently. There's no excuse for this design to still exist in modern games.\n\nThe only viable option for your character is Street Samurai as this game decided to keep the poor choices of old isometric games where the game is over if your character dies, even if there are ways to ressurect people. I chose Decker as my class and it was neutered from the awesome experience it should have been. I was squishy in combat and thus had to restart levels multiple times as the AI would target only me and end the fight quickly. I was not presented with an option to enter the matrix to hack things and it was relegated to an automatic dialogue option. I asked other and it doesn't get any better later in the game.\n\nI so badly wanted this game to be what Shadowrun deserves but I guess I have to keep waiting.","August 26, 2015","false","1.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The first campaign released was Dead Man's Swtich. The second campaign is Dragonfall. They are fully standalone campaigns and are really where you find the game of Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is not "DLC". It is, in fact, a more robust, more ambitious and (at least as I played it) twice-as-long campaign compared to its predecessor.\nThis is really important to recognize, especially if you haven't played through Dead Man's Switch, or maybe you didn't like it. It's like playing a roleplaying campaign under two different GMs with two different encounter design styles and stories to tell. You definitely don't have to play Dead Man's Switch at all to enjoy Dragonfall.\n\nSince I played Dead Man's Switch, many things have been improved / patched. For instance, scripting in the game's dialog has allowed you to often call on your teammates' skills to help interject in a hacking (decking!) or knowledge based problem. It's not perfect, but it's much, much better. The save system is also now fully featured, which was my biggest complaint about Shadowrun Returns (save when you want, OMG!).\nI don't really like how little influence you have over your party's inventory, but I kinda like the narrative implication that they are in charge of themselves, and you're fully in charge of what characters get to come with you on your runs.\n\nThe art style, the characters, the rules, the format, etc. they're all the same as you'd remember from Dead Man's Switch. Where Dragonfall shines uniquely is in providing an environment that is far more free than the campaign of its predecessor. I believe most computer roleplaying game fans will greatly prefer Dragonfall. There is a town hub where you are free to shop and pick up side quests, unlike the compact hideout in Dead Man's Switch. Many combat situations have multiple approaches compared to what Dead Man's Switch offered. The characters are more interesting, have more personality, are more plentiful (and more useful), and are better written than those in the prior campaign (reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2). The story also goes from the small criminal raids of a simple shadowrunning team to the gigantic world-changing epic story that RPGs are famous for.\nThat said, Dead Man's Switch is still a friendlier, smaller, and more digestible introduction to the Shadowrun world, so I really do recommend playing that campaign first if you're just diving in for the first time.\n\nI'd also like to add that in Dead Man's Switch I played a shotgun-toting, robot-driving hacker, which is basically my ideal cyberpunk character idea. I had a great time! I was originally a little underwhelmed with Dragonfall when I started as a melee fighter because it lacked the gimmicks of my prior loadout (but I'll be darned if I only play one archetype in an RPG). In fact, the lackluster start is what kept me from really even playing the game for 4 months. But in the end, I was really impressed with my troll, and he was just as important to my party as my prior character.\n\nSo yes! If you like RPGs and good writing, play Dragonfall. DO IT!\n\n--ORIGINAL REVIEW--\nThis is only the second Kickstarter game I've played. I'm pretty impressed with it, and it really is the kind of game that most publishers would never fund, so I'm excited to have had the opportunity to play it.  I've so far only finished the Dead Man's Switch campaign, so the following points are regarding that campaign only.\n\nHere's some bullet points:\n* The visuals are adequate but not compelling. The high-res handpainted isometric art is impressive for the skill required to execute it. It's retro without being pixillated or limited in palette. VFX are adequate.\n\n* Really cool music, though not enough of it. Never became obnoxious but I was blown away in the first couple hours, but heard basically the same music for the rest of the game. Adequate sound, but no voice acting, which would've pushed the reception of the game's narrative over the edge!\n\n* The story was really cool with some great twists, though it is linear. It's a lot like a great pen-and-paper campaign. You normally wouldn't replay something like that, so a surface-level appearance of choice and nonlinearity is enough, and as a result I found myself happy with the game. However, if you're looking for the story to change dramatically as a result of your choices, you will be disappointed. There are a few dialog options that will change based on your choices, but they are for flavor only. That's OK with me.\n\n* The gameplay is fun. I love turn-based RPG tactics, I just do. I love the positioning and the AOE attacks and managing action points. I like buffs and line-of-sight and overwatch. The game is fully featured in terms of the amount of relevant (and effecitve) skills and choices you have available. You are not locked into a class. Where the gameplay falls short is the dice rolling (like most direct tabletop RPG-to-videogame translations). I hate it when I have an 83% chance to hit a guy and miss twice in a row. Further, I hate when an enemy has a 21% chance to hit me, and it lands. I want my performance to be more predictable and tactical and less dependent on luck. Usually things play out like you'd expect, and so it's okay, but every time the odds are in your favor and you fail, you feel cheated. I hate that.\n\nI would be very comfortable recommending Shadowrun Returns except one thing: The abysmal save system. This game will only autosave when you go from one area to another. There is no other way to save than autosaving. Further, as the story and quests are linear, you can't just abuse the auto-save system by going back and forth between locations. The result is that whenever the designer decides that you'll be in one area for a really long time, it means you can't save that whole time. This is remarkably, and frequently, inconvenient. That said, as the game is turn based, most of the time you take are decisions you mull over. Your progress is the result of choices, not usually execution. So losing progress isn't so bad when you die, as you'll quickly be able to repeat your choices that you've already thought through. Still though, in this day and age in gaming, it's a pretty egregious oversight.\n\nThat said, I would still recommend Shadowrun Returns if only for the wonderful and rare cyberpunk videogame setting, choice driven character systems, and tactical RPG combat.","May 27, 2014","true","66.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I think the game lives up to the hype. I am a passionate fan of the Super Nintendo Shadowrun game (which I've been playing for over twenty years!) and playing Shadowrun Returns feels like a homecoming. It is very reminiscent of the SNES game, but very contemporary and modern, of course.\n\nThe combat and puzzles are of medium challenge (just right for me when I played on the game's easy level of difficulty) and the storytelling is good. The visual design and music are extremely well done. There is a well-balanced blend of exploring and fighting. I finished the game in about twenty-four hours of playing time, with only a couple of mission "do overs." A quicker and more skilled player might take about twenty hours to finish. I’d like the game to be longer, but that is hardly a legitimate complaint, merely a fond wish and a desire for more of a good thing. I noticed no flaws in the game other than a rash of minor typos about halfway through, mostly in dialogue windows. The only real problem I had was some serious lag in combat scenarios featuring about eight or more characters on screen, but my system, while of good quality, is not a gaming rig, and I'm running only the minimum 2GB of RAM the game recommends. The turn-based system employed in Shadowrun Returns made the lag easily tolerable.\n\nIn my first play-through I found that playing my character with thoughtfulness and manners gained me lots of karma. The option to be a hardcore, coldblooded merc is always there, but I can't say how taking that tack affects the gameplay. My key to success in combat was always being smart with in-combat strategy. No matter what mistakes I made with equipping or tactics, or how my luck went when the fighting began, I was always able to overcome by making good strategic decisions.\n\nThanks to everyone involved in making the game.

Everything Shadowrun's original campaign does, Dragonfall does it three times better. This is a case where you should buy the game, just for the dlc. Your party members (which you don't have in the original shadowrun campaign, thanks) all have a plethora of fascinating backstories and dialogue choices. The game takes place in Berlin which uses a completely unique politcal structure for government combined with beautiful enviroments that just make the game feel real, even though it's such a stylized version of a mystical future.\n\nThe decsions you make later in the game are excruciatingly hard. Dragonfall doesn't treat you like an omnipotent god that makes all the right choices. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ world with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices to make and if you mess up too bad, everyone suffers for it. There was one choice in particular I had to stop playing for about 20 minutes to decide what I should even do. The gameplay is exactly the same as the original campaign or Xcom unknown so no real changes there. This is a game you need to play if your into old RPGs, well constructed plotlines and characters, and if your a fan of sci fi or cyberpunk, no exceptions if you meet any of these guide lines -Enjoy","June 26, 2014","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not all the way finished with the main quest yet but have been immensely enjoying this game, both for the way the plot falls out (if a little predictably) and for the nostalgia of character building and the fun of the universe. I'm not really sold on the tactical combat -- it's never been my thing -- and even on easy mode I've had more than a few wipes. I also get a little frustrated when hiring runners because I'd like more control over the party and party skills (though it's possible that might come later? I hope?).

While many of the major technical and design flaws have been excised, the base campaign is still plagued by level and story design that feels like it's just stringing you along from one too-long fight to the next. It doesn't help that your words, skills, and actions also have very little effect on either the conversation or the campaign level. It's not bad per-say, but I didn't feel terribly invested in the story or characters.\n\nThe DLC expansion "Dragonfall" however is excellent and is everything that the base campaign should have been. It's significantly better designed, with far stronger writing, level design, and campaign structure. In the first hour, I had a far better sense of who my character was, where I was in the world, and was invested in narrative. The world feels much more vibrant and dynamic (even though there's quite a bit of illusion of false choice as is typical of the genre) than the base game.\n\nI very highly reccomend that you purchase dragonfall along with the base game. In my opinion, the $30 price of entry for both is a better value than $15 for just the base game. The difference in quality between the two campaigns is stark, and it's very likely you'll bore yourself about a third of the way through the base game and never think to pick up the DLC if you don't buy both and you'd miss out on a great RPG.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game has workshop support and is very friendly for creating user-made content including adventures and campaigns ala the original Neverwinter Nights. While I have not tried any of these yet, the content available looks quite promising.","May 6, 2014","true","35.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/recommended/234650/","mistersneak","mistersneak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mistersneak/","667 products in account","--UPDATED REVIEW--\nNo doubt about it, Shadowrun Returns is a Shadowrun roleplaying game engine (built on Unity), not a game. The first campaign released was Dead Man's Swtich. The second campaign is Dragonfall. They are fully standalone campaigns and are really where you find the game of Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is not "DLC". It is, in fact, a more robust, more ambitious and (at least as I played it) twice-as-long campaign compared to its predecessor.\nThis is really important to recognize, especially if you haven't played through Dead Man's Switch, or maybe you didn't like it. It's like playing a roleplaying campaign under two different GMs with two different encounter design styles and stories to tell. You definitely don't have to play Dead Man's Switch at all to enjoy Dragonfall.\n\nSince I played Dead Man's Switch, many things have been improved / patched. For instance, scripting in the game's dialog has allowed you to often call on your teammates' skills to help interject in a hacking (decking!) or knowledge based problem. It's not perfect, but it's much, much better. The save system is also now fully featured, which was my biggest complaint about Shadowrun Returns (save when you want, OMG!).\nI don't really like how little influence you have over your party's inventory, but I kinda like the narrative implication that they are in charge of themselves, and you're fully in charge of what characters get to come with you on your runs.\n\nThe art style, the characters, the rules, the format, etc. they're all the same as you'd remember from Dead Man's Switch. Where Dragonfall shines uniquely is in providing an environment that is far more free than the campaign of its predecessor. I believe most computer roleplaying game fans will greatly prefer Dragonfall. There is a town hub where you are free to shop and pick up side quests, unlike the compact hideout in Dead Man's Switch. Many combat situations have multiple approaches compared to what Dead Man's Switch offered. The characters are more interesting, have more personality, are more plentiful (and more useful), and are better written than those in the prior campaign (reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 2). The story also goes from the small criminal raids of a simple shadowrunning team to the gigantic world-changing epic story that RPGs are famous for.\nThat said, Dead Man's Switch is still a friendlier, smaller, and more digestible introduction to the Shadowrun world, so I really do recommend playing that campaign first if you're just diving in for the first time.\n\nI'd also like to add that in Dead Man's Switch I played a shotgun-toting, robot-driving hacker, which is basically my ideal cyberpunk character idea. I had a great time! I was originally a little underwhelmed with Dragonfall when I started as a melee fighter because it lacked the gimmicks of my prior loadout (but I'll be darned if I only play one archetype in an RPG). In fact, the lackluster start is what kept me from really even playing the game for 4 months. But in the end, I was really impressed with my troll, and he was just as important to my party as my prior character.\n\nSo yes! If you like RPGs and good writing, play Dragonfall. DO IT!\n\n--ORIGINAL REVIEW--\nThis is only the second Kickstarter game I've played. I'm pretty impressed with it, and it really is the kind of game that most publishers would never fund, so I'm excited to have had the opportunity to play it.  I've so far only finished the Dead Man's Switch campaign, so the following points are regarding that campaign only.\n\nHere's some bullet points:\n* The visuals are adequate but not compelling. The high-res handpainted isometric art is impressive for the skill required to execute it. It's retro without being pixillated or limited in palette. VFX are adequate.\n\n* Really cool music, though not enough of it. Never became obnoxious but I was blown away in the first couple hours, but heard basically the same music for the rest of the game. Adequate sound, but no voice acting, which would've pushed the reception of the game's narrative over the edge!\n\n* The story was really cool with some great twists, though it is linear. It's a lot like a great pen-and-paper campaign. You normally wouldn't replay something like that, so a surface-level appearance of choice and nonlinearity is enough, and as a result I found myself happy with the game. However, if you're looking for the story to change dramatically as a result of your choices, you will be disappointed. There are a few dialog options that will change based on your choices, but they are for flavor only. That's OK with me.\n\n* The gameplay is fun. I love turn-based RPG tactics, I just do. I love the positioning and the AOE attacks and managing action points. I like buffs and line-of-sight and overwatch. The game is fully featured in terms of the amount of relevant (and effecitve) skills and choices you have available. You are not locked into a class. Where the gameplay falls short is the dice rolling (like most direct tabletop RPG-to-videogame translations). I hate it when I have an 83% chance to hit a guy and miss twice in a row. Further, I hate when an enemy has a 21% chance to hit me, and it lands. I want my performance to be more predictable and tactical and less dependent on luck. Usually things play out like you'd expect, and so it's okay, but every time the odds are in your favor and you fail, you feel cheated. I hate that.\n\nI would be very comfortable recommending Shadowrun Returns except one thing: The abysmal save system. This game will only autosave when you go from one area to another. There is no other way to save than autosaving. Further, as the story and quests are linear, you can't just abuse the auto-save system by going back and forth between locations. The result is that whenever the designer decides that you'll be in one area for a really long time, it means you can't save that whole time. This is remarkably, and frequently, inconvenient. That said, as the game is turn based, most of the time you take are decisions you mull over. Your progress is the result of choices, not usually execution.

The world of Shadowrun (a classic console title) returns in this updated crowdfunded version, and gives you two absolutely good reasons to slap down the nuyen for it.\n\nThe first campaign that the game is packaged is Dead Man's Switch, a noir tale where you investigate a friend's demise, taking you from across an alternate Seattle as you uncover an intricate web of conspiracies. For good or ill, the game streamlines your progression, segmenting maps into pseudo-chapters, where you explore and investigate an area as much as you like, and then leave it completely, moving on to the next area. This is to the game's benefit as it does away with tedious backtracking and nook/cranny-exploration, keeping you in the thick of the plot.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the genre of RPGs like Shadowrun, then know that this is not a loot-oriented game. Item/equipment acquisition is never random, always deliberate and often simply purchases from store NPCs. Instead, it is focuses on the (well-told) and the character, The primary method your character grows is through the development of skills. These skills are cheap to start (1 skillpoint for first blip), but become expensive to master (10 skillpoints for the 10th blip), so beginning players have plenty of room to experiment.\n\nHowever, there may be aspects you will dislike. Respecs are not available (unless you mess with the game code itself) so you may wind up getting skills that become obsolete or boring to you. Also, because this is a fixed campaign with no random encounters, certain types of skills will become more useful than others, so you may feel cheated in that department. In a sense, this is oldschool RPGing, before game devs were compelled to streamline and optimize the player experience. Also also, this being a fixed largely-linear campaign, playing through Dead Man's Switch around twice should show you everything it has to offer.\n\nThe campaign itself is enjoyable and most certainly a worthy purchase, despite what I've listed previously. Mind you, all the compliments that I've paid to Shadowrun Returns so far? I count them all as Reason 1.\n\nReason 2: This game is supported by the Steam Workshop, which means user-created content can multiply the amount of time and enjoyment you get out of Shadowrun Returns significantly. This does mean that the level of quality may diminish, but hell, now you could even make your own Shadowrun adventures if you have the time and stamina for it!\n\nI heartily recommend Shadowrun Returns for those players who enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay, strong storylines, and noir settings. And if you like the game as well, definitely consider looking at Shadowrun: Dragonfall, a second campaign currently offered as purchasable DLC!","May 31, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I never played the SNES Shadowrun game, and I definitely didn't know until recently that Shadowrun started out as a Dungeon and Dragons style table top game in the late 80's/early 90's.  Only a few minutes into the game, I could tell that this is a well developed universe, one that could be better appreciated by those who have been involved in the Shadowrun lore for years.  Not to say I'm not impressed.  Like I said, I'm completely new to this world.  But that's what makes this game immediately addicting.  It has it's own world and immediately pulls you right into it.  Yes, you can feel like a foreigner at first, but not for long.  The game starts when you receive a message from an old friend, Sam Watts, who pre-informs you of his death through a video message which is sent to you upon his death.  Your mission is to investigate who killed him and find out who this "Ripper" character is.  As you investigate Sam Watts murder, you get pulled more and more into the underground world of Shadowrun, discovering more of the secrets of Sam Watts, as well as the other characters you meet.\n\nFor me, I enjoy a good RPG.  Typically, I have trouble getting into turn based RPGs anymore.  Despite that this game is turn based, there is a strategy element that gives it more depth.  You're not just attacking, healing, and casting magic.  You have to anticipate the movements of your enemies and use your surroundings to your advantage.  There is also a bit of a puzzle element, too, as you must search your surroundings and use items to get past certain areas.\n\nShadowrun is a nice blend of fantasy with cyberpunk.  I wish I could have emersed myself in this universe before, but I feel fortunate that I can experience it for the first time.  So even if you are not already familiar with Shadowrun, I suggest downloading this game.  It will definitely keep you hooked for hours.","May 12, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What happened to the rest of the world?  The original shadowrun games (I'm talking console not tabletop) had open worlds, free run of the cities, and clues you had to collect.  This is more of a Turn-based 3d scroller.  I felt led the entire time.  I want an open world to explore, shadowruns to do, cyberspace to hack, and random goons/lone star to take out for weapons armor and money.  The thing I loved most about shadowrun was the freedom to just turn it on and try to break into the nearest building and loot it, or mine some data in cyberspace for cash.  This point A to point B style was disappointing.  I don't want to be constantly following the storyline in order to do anything in the game.  I want the freedom to be a shadowrunner.

A $2 million Kickstarter campaign (which worked out to about $1.2 mil after Amazon and Kickstarter's cuts, which then also had to cover the physical rewards for the backers as well as the game) doesn't mean AAA quality - it means a shoestring budget.  Keep that in mind, and this is a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the Shadowrun universe.\n\nSet in the dystopian, cyberpunk future of 2050, in a world where magic and the races of fantasy have returned.  Unlike the last two good Shadowrun games (the FPS should only be considered a Shadowrun game in the context of how NOT to make a Shadowrun game) back on the SNES and Genesis, Returns hews more closely to the turn-based nature and feel of the original pen-and-paper game.  It doesn't exactly port over the ruleset - merely uses a whole new one inspired by the rulesets used by the PnP game's 2nd and 3rd editions.  It's a classless system, meaning you can spend your Karma (what the game calls XP) on whatever aspect of your character you want.  Think your AK-97-totting ork needs some skill with a blade for when the enemy gets up-close and personal?  No problem - just drop the Karma into the relevant stat when you have the chance.  What if you feel your chi-wielding Physical Adept needs a bit of extra ranged oomph but you don't want to spend the money on guns?  Sink some Karma into spellcasting and you can add some fireballs and lightning bolts to the mix.\n\nThe game does provide a set of Archetypes to pick from during character creation, each one fitting one of six roles in the SR universe - the Street Samurai, who follows a code of honour but mostly focuses on combat and augmenting himself with a lot of cyberware; the Mage, who lashes out with powerful spells; the Decker, who uses his cyberdeck to hack into the Matrix (the internet's successor... no, no relation to the films; Shadowrun was using the term way back in the late '80s); the Shaman, who manipulates the energies of the natural world to aid his companions as well as calling up spirits to fight alongside them; the Rigger, who remote-controls a series of combat drones and the Physical Adept, who focuses his magic inward and make strikes with his fists or a blade more devastating.\n\nThe Archetypes spend most of your starting Karma for you and (in the included campaign, Dead Man's Switch) set your starting gear.  If you want to spend all that starting Karma yourself, be prepared to start the game with a few guns (I think a pistol, an SMG and an assault rifle) and no spells/drones/cyberdeck/etc.  In addition to the archetypes, you also have five races, or metatypes as the game calls them, to choose from.  In the 2050s, humanity is now metahumanity and consists of humans, elves, dwarves, orks and trolls.\n\nMost of them are pretty much what you'd expect - elves are agile and smart, dwarves and tough and stubborn, orks can snap you in two like a dry twig, etc.  Trolls, though, can basically be seen as orks on steroids (an analogy that doesn't quite work as well when there could literally be orks taking steroids) - they're even bigger, even stronger and have bony growths on their skin that act like armour.  Each metatype's drawback is limits on how high certain stats can go - most can raise them to about 10 or 11, but trolls, for example, can't raise their Charisma above six.\n\nThe combat has something of an XCOM feel to it, save that you can't rotate the camera.  HBS took some of the elements from XCOM Enemy Unknown that worked - the assumption that your team brought more than enough ammo for the job (infinite ammo, but needing to reload) and the high-low-cover system (though flanking doesn't give a bonus to critical hits, just makes them easier to hit).\n\nI'll get the negatives out of the way now - at the time I'm writing this, there is no manual save feature.  It only auto-saves on loading screens and there will be times when those are spaced far enough apart to be a pain.  Good news on this front - they're working on a manual save system that should be done at the same time as the first expansion, Dragonfall, but will be applied to the base game and campaign without you having to buy that.  That won't be til about January, though.  Secondly, the included campaign is rather short - tops out at about 12 hours or thereabouts and is rather linear.  Don't go into it expecting the freedom most other RPGs have; Dead Man's Switch is a very story-driven campaign and the events in it only cover a few days.  This next one I don't see as a problem, but there were a lot of people raging about it on the Steam forums after launch - the game has zero voice acting.  They couldn't afford it.  Yes, sadly; this means that you will have to read.  But for the added freedom this gave them in NPC dialogue, I have no problem with that.  There is also very little to actually interact with in the environments (or at least in Dead Man's Switch, this may not be the case in Dragonfall or some user-generated content) so they can feel rather empty at times.\n\nThe graphics have an interesting, stylised look to them.  It was a big jarring for me at first (I'd binged a bit on the various 4th edition books during the Kickstarter campaign where most of the art's a bit more realistic) but eventually I came to enjoy it.  The character models aren't exactly high-grade, but the camera never really gets close enough for it to be annoying.  You'll be getting a better feel for a character's look from their portrait.  The overall character designs fit the SR universe, though; Detective McKluskly is a good example of this - they've taken an almost stereotypical design of a corrupt detective and turned him into an ork and it works.  Even with the lower-quality of the character models, they still found ways to add little details to them.  Jump over to Google and do a quick image search with "Shadowrun Returns McKlusky" and find an image of his character model.  You might notice a tattoo on one forearm.  It's never mentioned anywhere in the game, but that's a tattoo from the UCAS Marines - he's ex-military.\n\nThis game does come with a full editor that is, relatively, user-friendly.  I say 'relatively' because any editor that involves more than placing terrain and hostile NPCs is going to be complex, no matter how you slice it.  But the coding side of this one is a lot simpler than any other I've seen - using If/Else statements and the like.  It takes some getting used to, but there are tutorials for it on the HBS youtube channel and there's bound to be plenty of fan-made tutorials out there by now.  Most of this game's life will come from the campaigns published on the Workshop, but like any game driven by fan-made content (ARMA, Elder Scrolls, even ol' Neverwinter Nights) it will be at least a year before that side of the game comes into its own.\n\nI'd say more about Dead Man's Switch itself, but most of the negatives I feel players could be warned about (or at least worth mentioning here) come with some serious spoilers.  These aren't massive ones, really just mention on why one NPC isn't as tough as the PnP game's books suggested.  What I will say is that it has some phenomenal writing that pulls you into the setting.  There are perhaps some things mentioned that may not mean anything to someone new to the setting, but HBS has a Shadowrun Primer on their website for free download that should help in that respect.  Regardless, they made great use of Shadowrun's iconic slang and the various setting elements (although that does mean anyone familiar with the setting may know what's coming once you start having to deal with the Universal Brotherhood).","November 30, 2013","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You might be familiar with the world of Shadowrun. I wasn't before playing this. It's one of the coolest and most well realised fictions I've seen in a while. The writing here is impeccable and will likely make you wish there were more games set in this universe. There's no voice acting, so get ready to read, but I found the world so engaging it wasn't an issue.\n\nThe combat has taken some ideas from old-school games and some from modern ones like XCOM. It works very well and has deep character trees and customisation options. With the exception of a massive difficulty ramp on the last mission, the combat is quite intriguing.\n\nThe real strength of this game will likely be in whatever the modding community decides to do with it. The whole thing is just a module launcher similar to Neverwinter Nights.

It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today.\n\nFor those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age.\n\nYou play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great.\n\nBut Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago.\n\nBut it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own.\n\nNow they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be.\n\nIt's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal.\n\nBut most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling.\n\nSo, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice.\n\nBut is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed). For those who don't know anything about Shadowrun, and are willing to put up with the weaker (but still good) story, starting with the first game's story might still be better as it is probly friendler to those who are going in blind.\n\ntldr: Shadowrun Returns is a good game, but Dragonfall is even better, doubly so for anyone who knows the setting or has played the tabletop game. If you were on the fence before, Dragonfall makes it a good bet.","February 28, 2014","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall, I really did enjoy the game and it is well worth the money.  I bought the expansion as well.  It is better.  It has better writing and many quests have morally ambiguous choices to make at the end.  The combat is still weak, but enjoyable.  I recommend it.

The game is fairly short (~10h), but just the right length to not overstay its welcome.\n\nThe gameplay elements are fairly simple as far as Tactical RPGs go, and those looking for challenging and meaningful systems should look elsewhere. It is still entertaining though, and perfect for those looking for a more casual experience.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the story, the setup and the writing. The plot is of a noir detective style with conspirations and social commentaries mixed in, well written, served by beautifully hand painted 2D graphics.\n\nThe only complaint would be that such an interesting universe: a blend between Blade Runner and D&D, deserved a more traditional, long lasting, content rich RPG. As it is the game is highly enjoyable as a little tread, but it's missing momentum, exploration and more involving combat. Well worth on a Steam sale though.","February 12","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was my first tabletop rpg, and it helped foster a love of the happy that is going strong today.\n\nFor those who don't know, Shadowrun is a setting that takes place in a dystopian cyberpunk future. Corporations are more powerful than governments, and most people are either wretchedly poor or corperate wage slaves with no freedom. But there is a twist. As this dystopia began to develop, magic returned to the world, bringing with it Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls... and Dragons. Think Bladerunner meets Dragon Age.\n\nYou play as shadowrunners, mercenary criminals who live off the grid and do jobs that are too dirty or difficult for the corporations. You are a theif, assasin, or bodygraud on any given day, operating in the shadows and outside the law. I've always thought that this would make a great setting for a video game, but Shadowrun hasn't had too many adaptations: and the ones we did get weren't great.\n\nBut Harebrained Schemes thought they could deliver, and took to Kickstarter. And deliver they did. I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns, and the end product was worth the investment. It was a good turn base strategy rpg, along the lines of, say, Fallout, though the setting conjures up comparasions to Arcanum: of steamworks and magick obscura (also recomended). The combat was fun, the graphics looked excellent, and importantly to someone like me, the developers clearly understood Shadowrun, a sense that could not be gained from the poorly received X-box shooter of some years ago.\n\nBut it was good game, if there were several issues that kept it from being great. A save system that didn't work well, and a story that was a little too linear and static for Shadowrun's traditional style. These issues were tempered by a promise of mission packs and expansions, and a robust editor for the community to create missions of their own.\n\nNow they've released the first of those mission packs, Dragonfall, and playing it convinced me to write this reveiw. Because where the original game faltered, Dragonfall soars. A rational save system is finally in, and there is more variety to the weapons, cyberware, and other combat options to make things a little more interesting. And, most importantly, the new campaign is exactly what shadowun should be.\n\nIt's got interesting characters to talk to, both in your team and in the hub where you go in between missions. It's supports player agency, from the runs you choose to go on to the way you solve those runs. Runs themselves are interesting and often dynamic. Each one has signifigant choices, and I had to think hard about seveal of them. While I could have seen more room to roleplay, for the most part I never felt that my character wasnt' represented in the dialouge choices. And while I like the story of the main game, the story in Dragonfall is much better. It made me care about the characters and the situation far more than the orignal.\n\nBut most of all, it feels like Shadowun. The runs played exactly like runs I might have written myself for the tabletop game, far more so than the first game. And the balence between story based missions and those just for case works much better than the previous as well. All in all, playing Dragonfall felt just like playing a real Shadowrun game. That is what I wanted when I kickstarted, and I will buy whatever DLC they release as long as they maintain that feeling.\n\nSo, I heartily recomend Shadowrun Returns, but strongly recomend you buy Dragonfall too- in fact, you should probably start with it over the original games campaign, espeically if you are familier with the setting, but thats a personal choice.\n\nBut is it right for those who don't know Shadowrun? I still think so. The setting is interesting enough to draw people in, and no previous knoweldge is needed for the actual gameplay, which is entertaining even without feeding into that Shadowrun feedback loop I have. That said, the Berlin Free State setting of the game might be a little bit bewildering, as the game doesn't explain all that much (That said, most shadowrun players probably don't know much about Berlin either - Me included- but at least with the background its easier to get up to speed). For those who don't know anything about Shadowrun, and are willing to put up with the weaker (but still good) story, starting with the first game's story might still be better as it is probly friendler to those who are going in blind.\n\ntldr: Shadowrun Returns is a good game, but Dragonfall is even better, doubly so for anyone who knows the setting or has played the tabletop game. If you were on the fence before, Dragonfall makes it a good bet.","February 28, 2014","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world of Shadowrun (a classic console title) returns in this updated crowdfunded version, and gives you two absolutely good reasons to slap down the nuyen for it.\n\nThe first campaign that the game is packaged is Dead Man's Switch, a noir tale where you investigate a friend's demise, taking you from across an alternate Seattle as you uncover an intricate web of conspiracies. For good or ill, the game streamlines your progression, segmenting maps into pseudo-chapters, where you explore and investigate an area as much as you like, and then leave it completely, moving on to the next area. This is to the game's benefit as it does away with tedious backtracking and nook/cranny-exploration, keeping you in the thick of the plot.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the genre of RPGs like Shadowrun, then know that this is not a loot-oriented game. Item/equipment acquisition is never random, always deliberate and often simply purchases from store NPCs. Instead, it is focuses on the (well-told) and the character, The primary method your character grows is through the development of skills. These skills are cheap to start (1 skillpoint for first blip), but become expensive to master (10 skillpoints for the 10th blip), so beginning players have plenty of room to experiment.\n\nHowever, there may be aspects you will dislike. Respecs are not available (unless you mess with the game code itself) so you may wind up getting skills that become obsolete or boring to you. Also, because this is a fixed campaign with no random encounters, certain types of skills will become more useful than others, so you may feel cheated in that department. In a sense, this is oldschool RPGing, before game devs were compelled to streamline and optimize the player experience. Also also, this being a fixed largely-linear campaign, playing through Dead Man's Switch around twice should show you everything it has to offer.\n\nThe campaign itself is enjoyable and most certainly a worthy purchase, despite what I've listed previously. Mind you, all the compliments that I've paid to Shadowrun Returns so far? I count them all as Reason 1.\n\nReason 2: This game is supported by the Steam Workshop, which means user-created content can multiply the amount of time and enjoyment you get out of Shadowrun Returns significantly. This does mean that the level of quality may diminish, but hell, now you could even make your own Shadowrun adventures if you have the time and stamina for it!\n\nI heartily recommend Shadowrun Returns for those players who enjoy tactical turn-based gameplay, strong storylines, and noir settings. And if you like the game as well, definitely consider looking at Shadowrun: Dragonfall, a second campaign currently offered as purchasable DLC!","May 31, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/recommended/234650/","camuserenity","camux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/","359 products in account","I played Shadowrun in the early 90's.  I played the pen and paper RPG religously.  I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period.  The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.\n\nSo I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it:  I bought it because it is Shadowrun.  In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration.  Why?  Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs.  Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live.  The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons:  A "matrix" to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world.  Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, "random" enemy encounters and a handful of bosses.  Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers.  The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&D.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games.  That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends.  We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming.  We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could "talk shop" with us because all the conventions considered "normal" in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun.  Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&D looked like Candyland.  There was no comparison.  The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.\n\nI am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  I have not enjoyed it.  None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game.  I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh.  I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein.  I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game.  I'm sorry.\n\nMaybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes.  I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel.  This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time.  Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it.  If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours.\n\n","July 21, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved playing the tabletop game in the 90s but it took me a long time to buy this since the last LAST Shadowrun game was so horrible (okay, it wasn't bad as FPS go but that completely defeated the purpose of setting it in the Shadowrun Universe). I'm not all the way finished with the main quest yet but have been immensely enjoying this game, both for the way the plot falls out (if a little predictably) and for the nostalgia of character building and the fun of the universe. I'm not really sold on the tactical combat -- it's never been my thing -- and even on easy mode I've had more than a few wipes. I also get a little frustrated when hiring runners because I'd like more control over the party and party skills (though it's possible that might come later? I hope?).

THe biggest plus point for me was the story. It's well written and had enough depth to keep me keen to discover more.  Combat is straight forward enough and after a few fights you should have the basics mastered even if you have never used this type of turned based fighting before. You willl most often engage in combat as part of a group. Unlike tradidtionl RPG's where you meet characters and they tag along for as long as you need them Shadowrun returns takes a different approach. Most of the characters you encounter will not stick around for more than a quest ot two. They all have thier own agenda's and will not follow meekly in line behind you and your cause. To build up a "party" you hire companions from a list. This was a slight drawback for me, party characters did not feel like characters.

Oh yeah, this thing will also run well on most potatoes. If you like Baulder's Gate, the first two Fallouts, or like RPG or strategy games at all, try it out.\n\n\nI knew nothing about Shadowrun before playing this game other than it was a cyberpunk universe of some sort, and this game got me interested in the universe pretty quickly. It pulls classic fantasy stuff, like magicy fireballs, standard fantasy races, and even dragons and puts them into a cyberpunk setting in the near-future. While that sounds like a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥, it actually works really well.\n\nThe game leaves you with a pretty open opportunity to make any sort of character that'll fit into the setting that you want. The only thing that is established is that you are/were a Shadowrunner (which are off-the-grid mercenaries, basically.) and you had like one guy you usd to run with that's at all relevent to the rest of the story. It makes me think of Fallout: New Vegas, and that's a good thing to be reminded of.\n\nWhen the first fight happens there's a page where you can read through all the rules of combat, and while that may seems overwhelming at first, you can honestly just read about Action Points, where everything is in the UI, and cover. Cover is important. From there, anyone who has decent cognitive function and has played a videogame before can figure it out as they go, because the game isn't going to punish you early for not quite knowing what you're doing yet.\n\nThe greatest thing about the game is the story and writing. It's a well put together mystery that starts out seeming pretty simple, but get deeper and deeper as you go further into the rabbit hole. As for the writing, I continually noticed how good it was throughout the whole thing. Each loading screen, while they can take a long time at certain parts, has a well-written set of paragraphs to set the mood of the place you're about to go to. Each character is believable, many are likeable (my personal favorite is Mr. Kluwe), and all are well-written.\n\nThe game is linear as opposed to open-world, but it works. It's structured like a tabletop RPG campaign, because that's what Shadowrun is/was. While I figured that out a ways in, it didn't feel restrictive like some linear stories are. That could just be a personal thing, but hey, this is about my experience with the game.\n\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the game is that the main campaign is short, especially for a cRPG, which are usually quite long and expansive games. Shadowrun: Returns is meant to be, at least as far as I can tell, to be an engine from which to run your own campaigns, like how DMs in tabletops like D&D do, because, again,  that's what Shadowrun is/was. However, I have personnally yet to find a campaign from the workshop that I really like. After playing through Dead Man's Switch (the main campaign that comes with the game) all the community produced campaigns feels sub-par or mediocre. I suppose that should be expected when comparing something made by a professional development team to something made by one guy and is for free. Still, it does impact the staying power of the game.\n\nI got this on sale for 5 bucks a while back. As of this writing, it's like 80% off, at 3 dollars or something. It is definately worth that price. Overall, this is one of the most satisfying video game purchases I've made in a while. If you want an arbitrary number out of number rating, I'll give it a solid 8/10.","November 27, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is primarily about two things: First you get a pretty decent campaign and the ability to create all the major Shadowrun character types, it's very story focused and is interlaced with combat sections. It's far more lightweight than most games. The other thing you get is a hell of a powerful editor and the strong likelyhood of an ever expanding pile of 'shadowruns' to go on as people make them. This isn't a game about extreme tactics and strategy, it's fairly deep but the combat isn't the main focus, it's all about the stories. If you liked the SNES version, this is very much like that, if you don't, you might stay away, at least see where folks take this game.","July 26, 2013","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/recommended/234650/","camuserenity","camux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camuserenity/","359 products in account","I played Shadowrun in the early 90's.  I played the pen and paper RPG religously.  I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period.  The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.\n\nSo I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it:  I bought it because it is Shadowrun.  In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration.  Why?  Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs.  Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live.  The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons:  A "matrix" to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world.  Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, "random" enemy encounters and a handful of bosses.  Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers.  The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&D.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games.  That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends.  We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming.  We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could "talk shop" with us because all the conventions considered "normal" in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun.  Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&D looked like Candyland.  There was no comparison.  The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.\n\nI am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  I have not enjoyed it.  None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game.  I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh.  I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein.  I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game.  I'm sorry.\n\nMaybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes.  I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel.  This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time.  Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it.  If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours.\n\n","July 21, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I expected going 'backward' from Dragonfall would miss out on some UI improvements and such but I was shocked at how short, basic and uninteresting Shadowrun Returns storyline was. The story was poor to say the least; I won't spoil it but I genuinely thought I was in the prologue or something until the 'final boss'... I completed this game in 11 hours, despite seeking all little side quests (it feels like there were none) and talking to everyone possible (much less than Dragonfall).\n\nI do not recommend buying this game today but STRONGLY recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which despite being a "small standalone story" is infinitely better, more interesting and took me over twice as long to complete.

You start by building your character and the process on its own is so much fun. There are 5 archetypes to choose from and if I am correct, depending on which archetype you are playing, the story ends slightly differently. Once you start the game, you are almost immediately thrown into a battle which will give you a taste of what will come ahead. You have optional and mandatory challenges to finish. I suggest finishing them all.

For example, there are these ley lines things on the ground, that somehow improve magical abilities. However, the game does not explain this to you, and nor does it say HOW your magic is improved. This is just an example, because you have to pretty much figure everything out by yourself here.\n- The NPCs don't cover every role/class possible (like in games such as Dragon Age). This is actually not a big deal, but I started the game as a Shaman (summoner/support mage), only to find that the game already provides you with one, but not with a damage-oriented mage. You can hire some mercenaries to fill those roles by paying cash, but I don't think this solves the problem.\n- The items/spells systems are not clear and have some pretty big flaws, and as I stated before, nothing is explained to you.\nTwo examples: 1) You can by spells/armor for yourself, but not for your companions, but no one tells you that. At the same time, you can buy consumables for them. 2) If you equip an ally with a consumable before a mission, the item will be lost after the quest, even if you didn't used it.\n\nEven if its flaws, I must reccommend this game for anyone who's fond of turn-based strategy games (it plays a bit similar to XCOM) or who likes a game with great story. Just be sure to read a guide or something before playing.","May 11, 2014","true","43.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Do you know Shadowrun? ... I'm not a nerdified loremaster, and certainly not qualified to make absolute statements, but from what I know Shadowrun is one of the largest RPG-Fiction-Universes ever created. It started out as  a Pen & Paper roll playing game with a nice, not overly-complicated mechanic and, which is the important thing, a really really cool setting. The whole Shadowrun universe is awesomely extensive, there exist around 50 or such novels about it aswell. To put it short: it's kind of a combination of William Gibson's Cyberpunk (Neuromancer, Biochips, Cyberspace, Mona Lisa Overdrive ...) and J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings). So, it's some moderate Sci-Fi (no laser guns or energy shields) intermingled with magic fantasy (Elves, Dwarves, Orcs... and pretty much every other creature you can think of).\n\nNow, about the game... It's a turn based tactical combat game. The gameplay system is easy to grasp and usually doesn't eat as much time as other games with a similar gameplay concept sometimes do (the new X-Com for example). Graphics aren't breath-taking but entirely sufficient since most of the game really happens in the text based storytelling and interaction. Which get's me to the interesting part, the game's main story is really quite awesome, it's really been a while since I've seen a story as awesome as this one. The writing is entirely perfect, extremely immersive and complex, everything fits your characters race and gender, which in many other games is sadly neglected, and I've found like two typos in the whole game.\nThe game's atmosphere is rather dark, slums, gang-criminality, ruthless megacorporations and political apathy give a perfect backdrop for the story.\n\nThe game features an editor for custom campaign creation (there's a steam Workshop for it), which adds theoretically infinite replayability to it. Options for importing characters from campaign to campaign enable players to create characters with all-maxed out stats, if they so desire.\n\nOptions for equipment progression are quite limited -> 'at-the-moment' <-. A pretty extensive add-on for the game (Shadowrun-Returns: Dragonfall) has been announced and is due to be released in early 2014.\n\nThere is also an MMO Shadowrun game (Shadowrun-Online) in the tube, which I would recommend to check out aswell.\n\n\n(PS: If anyone is interested in reading any of the above mentioned novels by William Gibson and/or J.R.R. Tolkien I explicitly recommend getting original english language prints, as the translations I've read for books of both authors really missed out on a lot of things.)","December 28, 2013","true","185.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Theres a second section that covers Dead Man's Switch.\n\nDragonfall\nTo start, it's a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.\n\nWhat do I mean by "both a good an a bad way"? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game is also buggy, but not so much that it's game breaking.\n\nWhen speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords.\n\nIn terms of the bugs well, here's a few examples. At one point in the game I had a set of side objecties. Those objectives disappeared from my mission log, which from my expericne, shouldn't happen, but fortunately that did not prevent me from completing those side objectives and getting the payout from them. At another point in the game, a character I was talking to repeated dialogue from earlier on in the game when I spoke to her. It seemed clear that that piece of dialogue should not have been spoken, as it completely went against the more recent gdialogue I had just had with her (as in, literally seconds before). Also, not really a bug, but movement can be finickey if you want to move a charater to a tile behind another character, since the game will generally select the other character rather than move the one you wanted to move.\n\nWriting is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes  in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of superficial choices, in that you can't actually alter the course of the story, but it will still give you feedback about the effects of your decisions in terms of the world around you, so while it doesn't change the storyline, it still feels like it has an impact. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.\n\nIn any case, I bought the game on sale, so betwen the original title plus the Dragonfall DLC, I ended up spending around 15 USD, and it was most certainly worth that and more. That said, $30 might be a little steep if you're only interested in Dragonfall, as it's not actually all that long (longer than the original campaign from what I'm told, and just better all around), but then again, it might not be, because it really is good.\n\nI'll add to this review after running Dead Man's Switch I suppose, but bottom line is: Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's well worth paying for and playing.\n\nDead Man's Switch\nI might as well start by saying that yeah, it's pretty much worse than Dragonfall in every way possible, but still decent.\n\nThe writing is Dead Man's Switch is far less compelling to be frank. The characters aren't as interesting, they never really appear to gorw, and you don't really interact with them, or even the world very much. It's a very much guided experience that sort of just shuffles you from level to level as the story unfolds. I feel that my most major problem with the storyline is that I find it pretty much impossible to make a connection to any of the characters since you don't really get to interact with them much.\n\nHonestly, I'd say that if you're going to get Shadowrun Returns, get it for Dragonfall and think of Dead Man's Switch as an extra campaign despite the fact that Dragonfall is DLC which you'll have to pay for. Dead Man's Switch is nothing to really write home about, so if you get the game, you should really get the DLC. If you're more interested in the user-generated content or the combat system, the base game still has that going for it of course.","May 5, 2014","true","55.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Do you know Shadowrun? ... I'm not a nerdified loremaster, and certainly not qualified to make absolute statements, but from what I know Shadowrun is one of the largest RPG-Fiction-Universes ever created. It started out as  a Pen & Paper roll playing game with a nice, not overly-complicated mechanic and, which is the important thing, a really really cool setting. The whole Shadowrun universe is awesomely extensive, there exist around 50 or such novels about it aswell. To put it short: it's kind of a combination of William Gibson's Cyberpunk (Neuromancer, Biochips, Cyberspace, Mona Lisa Overdrive ...) and J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings). So, it's some moderate Sci-Fi (no laser guns or energy shields) intermingled with magic fantasy (Elves, Dwarves, Orcs... and pretty much every other creature you can think of).\n\nNow, about the game... It's a turn based tactical combat game. The gameplay system is easy to grasp and usually doesn't eat as much time as other games with a similar gameplay concept sometimes do (the new X-Com for example). Graphics aren't breath-taking but entirely sufficient since most of the game really happens in the text based storytelling and interaction. Which get's me to the interesting part, the game's main story is really quite awesome, it's really been a while since I've seen a story as awesome as this one. The writing is entirely perfect, extremely immersive and complex, everything fits your characters race and gender, which in many other games is sadly neglected, and I've found like two typos in the whole game.\nThe game's atmosphere is rather dark, slums, gang-criminality, ruthless megacorporations and political apathy give a perfect backdrop for the story.\n\nThe game features an editor for custom campaign creation (there's a steam Workshop for it), which adds theoretically infinite replayability to it. Options for importing characters from campaign to campaign enable players to create characters with all-maxed out stats, if they so desire.\n\nOptions for equipment progression are quite limited -> 'at-the-moment' <-. A pretty extensive add-on for the game (Shadowrun-Returns: Dragonfall) has been announced and is due to be released in early 2014.\n\nThere is also an MMO Shadowrun game (Shadowrun-Online) in the tube, which I would recommend to check out aswell.\n\n\n(PS: If anyone is interested in reading any of the above mentioned novels by William Gibson and/or J.R.R. Tolkien I explicitly recommend getting original english language prints, as the translations I've read for books of both authors really missed out on a lot of things.)","December 28, 2013","true","185.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Dead Man's Switch is good (even better now that save anywhere was added), but Dragonfall really captures that classic CRPG vibe with a great story and variety in playing methods and choices.\n\nAs it stands right now, Dragonfall is the best game I've played this year. The characters will make a William Gibson fan weep with joy. Berlin and the politics and npc's that inhabit it make for a far more compelling locale than Seattle.\n\nBUY.","December 23, 2013","true","47.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Before now, Shadowrun has been a very popular tabletop game, an action RPG on the Sega Genesis and even a team-based multiplayer FPS.\n\nThanks to Kickstarter, Shadowrun has returned as a traditional isometric-style RPG that plays very similar to the old Fallout games, with combat that feels like it’s out of the XCOM games.\n\nCharacter creation involves choosing your class and race, in the Shadowrun universe you can be a Human, Elf, Troll, Orc or Dwarf, each of which have their own unique restrictions and perks associated with them, for example, Trolls and Orcs tend to make terrible Deckers or Riggers because of the high intelligence required, however they start with more HP and are better at strength-based abilities.\n\nYour class choice has a huge impact on how you will be playing the game in combat situations. The classes include;\n\n- Street Samurai, master of weapons, both melee and ranged.\n- Mage, master of magic and magical support.\n- Decker, master of the matrix (cyberspace).\n- Shaman, master of the spirits, summoning and magical support.\n- Rigger, master of mechanical drones and engineering.\n- Physical Adept, master of unarmed and chi magic.\n\nRegardless of which class you choose at the start of the game, you can always later specialize in a different field of skills, your class mostly just affects your starting stats and gear.\n\nGameplay outside of combat is in real time, you control your character by clicking where you want to move or what you want to interact with, if you have companions they will automatically follow you.\n\nDuring combat, the game becomes turn based. Each character in the fight has a certain number of action points they can use during their turn. For example if you have 3 AP you could choose to run to cover, fire a burst of bullets with your SMG and then cast a heal spell on one of your friends.\n\nRather than having a leveling and experience points system, Shadowrun Returns simply rewards players with karma points for completing tasks which they can spend on leveling up their skills.\n\nAlthough Shadowrun Returns is an RPG, it doesn’t quite incorporate all of the elements of freedom that most RPGs have. For example, you cannot go back to areas you have already been or choose what order to do certain tasks in. The main campaign follows quite closely to the story with very few side missions.\n\nWhile on an actual mission you are given a fair amount of freedom in regards to how you accomplish your tasks… will you open the door by jacking into the matrix, battling security programs and finding the door controls, will you fight your way in meatspace to the door switch, leaving a trail of destruction in your wake… or will you simply get your break down the door because you’re a giant troll with ridiculous strength?\n\nThe game has a lovely soundtrack with a real cyberpunk feel to it. There is no voice acting though, so if you aren’t a big fan of reading dialogue you may find that off-putting.\n\nI found the story to be absolutely amazing! It was probably the best story I’ve experienced in an RPG thus far. My only issue is that it ended after 10 hours of gameplay and I felt like I had not fully developed my character yet and that there was still a lot of things I wanted to try. But I suppose 10 hours of gameplay isn’t bad considering the game comes with a built in module/map editor and there are loads of modules on the Steam Workshop.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more freedom-based experience with this game, I recommend getting the module ‘Shadowrun Unlimited’ from the Workshop.\n\nOverall, I really liked this game, it has just about everything I look for in an RPG. It lacks a bit of freedom in the main campaign, but makes up for it with modding tools and DLCs.","March 18, 2014","true","25.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This review is based on core game [no modes] and two playthourghs. For a tl;dr go to the overall score for a summary.\n\nThe gameplay is the normal turn based stargery with your charater and three others [Unless you want to go alone], choosing a class in the charater creation gives you a basic setup and you can stick to it or mix and match so you could get a mage who is good at punching or a shaman who can hack. There are also some puzzles that can be tackled depending on if you are a certain class, for example I was able to open a door as a shaman by summoning a spirt to spook a person out of the room.\n\nThe game is not open world but linear which is perfectly ok as it suits the story and theme well.\n\nStorywise the games starts out well and is well written. Not to spoil it goes along like this, you are tracking down the killer of a friend who you find out was a serial killer, following a trail you find it who it was and why  but then the plot goes a little iffy for my taste  goes from street merc to Saver of the world.\n\nReplailty wise you can play different class or try different ways of sloving a puzzle but everythings the same all dialogue queal to the same thing, nothing changes and the final choice is pretty much the same but different wording.\n\nOverall rating I give it 6/10. The game is short as people do say and while everything is the same no matter what  it is worth a buy on sale. While I have not played any of the mods  they would add more to the game.\n\n","July 11, 2014","true","23.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I have really enjoyed my whole 10~15 hours of Shadowrun.\n\nThe art and music are good and true to the cyberpunk universe. The fighting is simple yet quite tactical and enjoyable, and while you will miss your 93% hit chance suspiciously too often, it's not too frustrating (definitely not as much as X-com) even in hard mode.\n\nThe storyline is the big star of the show, with a rivetting plot that you cannot miss or forget, simply because there is only one straight line throughout the game.\n\nThis is possibly the most linear RPG I've ever played, so if you are looking for open world or side quests, stay away from this. There is literally just one side quest in the entire game, and it doesn't seem to change anything.\n\nThere is however a lot of freedom on how to spec your character and its class, but this is also where it builds up excitement to leave you wanting at the end. There are so many options to choose from, which seemingly open many doors... most of which never become of use. If you want an example, you get rewarded a whopping 15 skill points after defeating the last boss, after which..... credit roll !\n\nAll of this feels like a prologue to something greater, like the devs just lay the bare foundations of the game and then vanished hoping the community would build up on it.\n\n...and they have! The game has an editor and there are lots of community levels to choose from, finally offering you a way to use those interesting mechanics  which were underexploited in the main campaign, like the matrix hacking.\n\nWhether you call it a cheeky dev serving you a teaser, a greedy dev letting the community do the work, or a wishful dev trying to unleash the public's imagination in true table top RPG fashion, the end result is still, a very well rounded game which will keep you entertained without overstaying its welcome.\n","September 21, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynoidwren/recommended/234650/","gynoidwren","GynoidWren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynoidwren/","78 products in account","Okay, so I understand this game is based on a tabletop roleplaying module, which I think is critical to understanding what it is and isn't. The biggest successes of this game are when it adheres to those origins and carries them into the video game world, whereas its biggest failures are in the different limitations of those two things.\n\nThe best thing about this game, by far, is the world/setting. It's unique, interesting, and just damn cool. For this reason, the game sort of gradually improves as you play through it and get to see more and more of the Powers That Be within the gameworld. If you find yourself an hour in and interested but not completely hooked, keep going. The ending is pretty cool because it raises so many other questions and hints at grander goings-on behind the curtain of the one story you're shown. I think more than anything this game was never intended as a standalone thing but rather as a platform for the creation of more campaigns, a digital version of the tabletop format. It works pretty well in that respect. I especially loved how the class system played into and reinforced the character of the setting. This may be the only Steam game I've played where I think I will definitely go try out some player-created content, as well.\n\nSome practical aspects of the game mechanics definitely need work, though. As a first time player, I rolled a Decker character, and this turned out to be a terrible mistake. There is absolutely no benefit to being a Decker: you only get to use your special abilities at all from halfway through the campaign, and even then there's always another Decker given to you whether you want/need them or not whenever you would have any opportunity to use that class's skills. Choosing which dialect your character is versed in also has minimal benefit unless you happen to choose the one that gives you more money.\n\nBy far the biggest downfall of this game was its crippling linearity and limited choice. You cannot affect the story in any meaningful way or even dramatically change the way individual characters treat you. This would not be half as noticeable a flaw if the game wasn't rooted in the tabletop style, as I said before. Tabletop RPGs are entirely based on letting you do whatever you want and just collaboratively creating the story as you go along. A system in which a static, linear story is told with only minor superficial player choices is a really questionable design decision in that context.\n\nSo, is the game worth it? I would definitely say yes. I liked it more the more I played it, and the end of each act kept expanding the scope of the conflict in a satisfying way. I thought the story was pretty good and served to highlight the setting in the right ways. I will probably play the sequel/expansion/DLC/whatever once I have nonzero moneydollars. You should just know what you're in for, I think.","October 8, 2014","true","12.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Dead man's switch is a pretty cool campaign, and has a lot of nostalgic throwbacks to the SNES game. It's very Shadowrun Seattle (Megacorps, historic figures, gang control), and a bit short and linear, but still cool. I would give it a 8/10 or so.\n\nThe Berlin expansion is the most hooked I've been by an RPG in a really long time. The writing is fantastic, the characters are cool, and the world is really fun. The combat isn't quite as polished as say, XCOM, but it's passable and doesn't detract in any way. The flux state (prior to the invasion and second Berlin wall going up) is well depicted, and you become very invested in the stories of everyone living in your block of the anarchists haven.\n\nThere's much more freedom to approach things differently in the Berlin expansion, and you can take on side missions from the Berlin hub in the order you want, or even skip one or two if you want. It's also a bit longer than Dead man's switch, and features some new weapons. I would give Dragonfall a 9/10, easily.","March 5, 2014","true","43.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamaneviltaco/recommended/234650/","iamaneviltaco","iamaneviltaco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamaneviltaco/","40 products in account","Edit: Updated for the newest patch.\n\nShadowrun returns tries *really hard* to be a great game. It's got a great history in tabletop roleplay, and the super nintendo shadowrun might be the most overlooked RPG of all time. The framework is definitely laid to make this one of the best retro gaming experiences of the last few years. Sadly, a lack of attention to detail often holds it back. Simple things, like healing kits in the store before the last fight, have been flat out overlooked or left out. It may be intentional, however there are enough times that it happens that it really feels like the game was slightly rushed. Another great example of this is the decking system. Decking itself is fun, if a bit tedious at times. However, there are 3 missions in the entire game that actually allow you to deck. And the times there are decking quests? One requires you to take an npc along as a sidekick (not bad, all things considered). The next decking mission? The npc *has to* do it, you don't even help. I realize there may be plot reasons, but where it ends up is that there's an entire skill tree that they literally only let you use twice. My first run was a decker, and I got through 3/4ths of the game before I got to actually use the skills I built for. Frustrating doesn't describe it. Another issue is how healing magic only heals the last attack to hit you. Mobs love throwing a big hit, then pinging you for 1 damage. This wouldn't even be an issue, except for the fact that you have limited medkits, and can't force your helpers to pick em up on the fly. Either you get them, or they go to your stash. This isn't an issue in combat mode, but you can't toggle combat mode manually, so if you're out of a fight? Hope you're the medic, because you're the one getting the health packs. Movement can be equally tricky, especially when it starts getting crowded. Misclicks, clicks in wrong places, moving instead of attacking (the worst of the bunch, as it's pretty easy to die if you're not behind cover) are commonplace if you're not careful. Add the ability to manually enter combat mode at any time (so npcs can pick stuff up), or inventory management on the fly, mixed with a bit of an easier way to move to a specific location in a crowd? A lot of my problems would immediately go away.\n\nShadowrun combat is fun and engaging. There's a deep variety of skills and abilities that all influence the battle field in different ways. Mage-based spellcasting feels powerful, especially if you beef yourself up to be able to take a hit (you'll have to) and stand on a ley line. Rigging is a *blast*, if a bit frustrating as they only allow one of each drone type per tier. This means, if you want 2 attack drones? One's gonna suck a bit. Summoning, similarly, is a ton of fun and feels really powerful. They put quite a few free summoning points in the game, it's one of the few ways you can use the environment against your enemy. As for Adepts? They are a bit under-utilized, IMO. Right now they're heavily melee focused, and take a lot of finesse to get full use out of, because you're so skill-thin. Body for HP, Quickness because Dodge, Strength for melee attacks and the attack focus skill, Will for Chi Casting. Late bloomer doesn't describe them, even the supposedly super-awesome npc you pick up near the end isn't all that impressive. And, without spoilers, he's one of the strongest characters in the entire Shadowrun canon.\n\nThe campaign's difficulty is incredibly well balanced. I was thrilled when even my biggest indestructible troll still had to take cover from time to time, because becoming fully immortal is impossible when your enemies have fully automatic machine guns. Some of the UGC (actually, most of it I've played to this point) doesn't have the same light touch, though, making swapping from the official campaign a pretty steep learning curve. The only real issue with the main campaign is length. It's incredibly short, especially for this style of game. Lots of people lament the fact that it's a fairly linear experience, but I personally enjoyed that. Not every game needs to be a sandbox, and Shadowrun Returns has a very distinct story to tell. Some may feel shoehorned, but I just enjoyed going along for the ride. The writing in the main campaign is *fantastic* and easily the strongest thing about it. They paid a lot of attention to detail, and really worked a lot of the flavor of the shadowrun world into their story. I *love* the big bad, as well. They definitely swung for the fences with the nemesis in dead man's switch. This is a great touch, since I know a lot of us pnp shadowrun players have fond memories of them. As well, major and well known players in the shadowrun universe make cameos, and some may even join your team. There's a great early nod to the snes shadowrun game that really set a great tone. This game pays obvious respect to what came before it. The fact that Jordan Weisman was responsible for this is very apparent in the plot and tone. Also, for those wanting a sandbox style adventure? Dragonfall is very much along those lines.\n\nThe graphics, as well, are spot on. The game feels fun, and cartoony, and really captures the essence of the shadowrun universe. Hyperkinetic neon and chrome, with a touch of Tolkien fantasy, blend together oddly well. None of it feels out of place. My only qualms about the background art boil down to there not being enough of them, which becomes a problem with UGC as it all starts to look exactly the same. The sprites are also well designed, if a bit generic at times (I'm looking at you, every troll in the game), and the game wouldn't hurt for the option of using different faces/body types. The sound? Meh. The soundtrack is fun at first, but quickly gets repetitive. I tend to turn off the music and put on some industrial while I play, or other music suitable for shadowrun. After the first playthrough, or even the first few hours? You probably will too.\n\nUGC... It's the elephant in the room. UGC is a great idea in theory, and supposedly a high selling point for the game. The ability to create your own worlds, and play the worlds other people create, is *fantastic* on paper. And sometimes, it even works in execution. This is seeming to be the exception to the rule. UGC suffers from the same thing it does in most other games that feature it. It's uneven, balance is often lacking, the plots are frequently very weak, and... Well... It was made by the community, with all of the lack of polish that entails. There are a few *strong* exceptions to this rule, but it seems overall like the ones with the great plot lack any semblance of combat balance. As well, and as mentioned, the art assets get rather repetitive. A lot of the UGC just looks cut-and-paste, which is probably because they are. On the upside, sourcebooks from the original pen and paper game being fully converted into the game, and heavily fine tuned. Some of the creators have done a lot of work adding even more customization options, which is *amazing*. The major downfall to UGC is already becoming apparent post-Dragonfall, however. A few of the people responsible for large conversion kits or well known adventures have walked away, because the expansion completely broke their work. It's the same problem the UGC community of the first Neverwinter Nights faced, with every new expansion comes 10-20 hours of work to put your mods back together again.\n\nOverall, this game is fantastic. It's got some quirks, but Dragonfall cleaned up a lot of bugs or issues that were once holding it back. This is solid retro gaming.\n\n8/10","December 10, 2013","true","99.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Like in true old-school fashion there's no voice acting, which when it comes down to it, is an afterthought anyway. Good voice acting & Bad voice acting can certainly affect the playability of the story, but If voice acting is a most then you'll find none of it here.

The story it has justifies the linearity of the game's design as it's pretty much like reading an interactive book (like some of the older RPGs of the 90s). The game is practically friendly to almost any PC considering that it relies on the cyberpunk aesthetics to make the game look pretty. In terms of combat, it's basically a simplified version of Xcom: Enemy Unknown and if you like that game, you are going to be fairly familiar with how the game works. And even if you are done with the main campaign, there's still more to offer from the community itself through UGCs which can be downloaded through Steam directly or through the Shadowrun Nexus (especially if you own the DRM-free version on GOG) And by the time of this review (which is the same time as when the DLC Dragonfall first came out) you can actually save without relying on the autosave feature.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nDue to the fact that the replayability of this game past Dead Man's Switch (and Dragonfall) is dependent on the UGC of the community, you will probably have to take your time to look for custom campaigns that are actually complete, let alone any good. Most of the complete ones are usually the shortest or the simplest of campaigns. In addition, the Dead Man's Switch campaign doesn't seem to give much options to have a players who want to play a Face or a Decker as they are either very few instances to begin with or doesn't truly payoff. I don't like the fact that I have to actually rely on hiring more runners for a particular mission and they feel restrictive in which you cannot give them suitable gear or even have them hold on to an medkit if your inventory is full. Also, there are certain dialog choices that are greyed out if you don't meet the required stats to qualify. I'd rather have them hidden to keep me surprised. On top of that, I know that the idea behind this game is to make the player the main protagonist, but the problem with that is that this is Shadowrun, and the reason you have a variety of runner archetypes in a team is because you can take advantage of what they are capable of inside and outside of combat. Instead, that variety is only restricted to combat and combat alone save of you being able to appoint a hired/companion decker to hack into the Matrix for you in case you are incapable of such a task.\n\n\nOverall: Shadowrun Returns has it's flaws but I like what Harebrained as treated it so far. It's not an amazing game and it's hardly going to be the "best RPG EVAR!!!11!" but if you appreciate a good cyberpunk story with a touch of magic with a potential for more to come whether by the devs themselves through DLC or by the Shadowrun community, then I'd say this is a very safe purchase.","February 27, 2014","true","155.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","5"

My friend suggested I just pirate it because the game wouldn't be worth 15 euro. How wrong he was! I've just come off finishing this entire game in one sitting, and the reason for that is because the game is that good.\n\nThe game comes with one campaign which is called 'dead man's switch'. This is the campaign the developpers made and is a very good showcase of what you can do in Shadowrun returns. The story sucks you in and the entire realistic atmosphere gives off a gritty blade runner feeling. You actually feel the grime that exists in the world and the parallels to our world are scarily frequent.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a blast, you play the game using a self constructed avatar which you assign a 'class'. Which can be broken down into a fighter, monk, mage, summoner, hacker and trapper. The game then divides the points into the needed categories and from there you are free to specialise your character how you see fit. This gives you an insane amount of customisation as far as your character is concerned. Besides yourself you can hire help to go along on the runs (missions), you can preview their stats and items before picking them and during the mission you are free to control them as you see fit.\n\nThe game also contains a lot of dialogue which helps to flesh out the living and breathing world. You sometimes get choices which you feel will have some impact later on along the line, sadly you generally don't see any effect from your choices besides alternate ways of attack something or something being worth more or being more expensive.\n\nI suggest anyone to atleast give shadowrun a try, the game is really fun, able to pull you into it's world and the challenge it provides is just right in my opinion. Despite in the last mission the two 'superior' characters being weaker then my own dwarf.\n\n"Reality can be found in the shadows"","February 9, 2014","true","32.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

As such, the lore is well established and will certainly please many cyberpunk fans. When you purchase Shadowrun Returns, don't expect to be satisfied with "Dead Man's Switch", the campaign that comes pre-installed with it. No, you are buying this game in order to run user generated campaigns set in the world of Shadowrun. In my opinion, "Dead Man's Switch" is merely a way for the developers to show the capabilities of the game engine and how much you can do with the campaign editor. With that said, "Dead Man's Switch" is around 6 hours long and features a rather linear but interesting story. In this campaign, a fellow shadowrunner that you knew hires you to avenge him for a hundred thousand nuyen, through the use of a dead man's switch. You travel to Seattle in order to find the killer and get paid, but as luck would have it, it involves plenty of jumping through hoops. Once you complete the campaign, you'll find yourself wanting more and that can be easily solved through a quick browse in the Steam workshop.","December 5, 2013","true","46.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Both are very well made and entertaining, but where the game truly excells is the story. At first I was put off by the lack of voice in the game. Why are the pretty and detailed avatars with excessive and rich language representing the dialogue, entirely silent? I dig around options looking for volume slider, but there was none. Some minutes of gaming later I realized the person who wrote the story, descriptions, and dialogue lines is a pure genious. Reading your way into the world of Shadowrun is like reading a truly well written novel. I really really hope the person behind these texts continues the work in the next Shadowrun game.\n\nThus, the game world is immersive, colourful, rich. There is zero point in spoiling the story, but it should suffice to say that it is very good and that ♥♥♥♥ goes down in unexpected extremely well written ways. The world of the game is not so big, but the way it is presented and through the richness of details you get a sense that it is huge, living, and real, and that there are so many more interesting "♥♥♥♥ going down" kind of things going on besides your own story.\n\nSahdowrun's RPG elements are not very deep but fun and engaging enough to encourage even several playthroughs.\n\nI would suggest Shadowrun Returns to anyone interested in a truly good story or immersive world, or those who like tactical combat.

It's Fallout / Fallout II light for the casuals... it's linear, it's mind numbingly boring and just not fun.\n\nFor those of you that want a more in depth look as to why this is a polished turd, read on...\n\nIt takes a whole lot of reading and engrossing yourself in this universe to really enjoy it. The entire game is played with a single button... yes, the left mouse button... so talk about a snooze fest. I found myself  controlling the camera movement with the W, A, S ,D, keys just to  break the monotony of only using the mouse to play.\n\nThe game proceeds like this: You go through a metric ♥♥♥♥ tonne of dialog, learn some things, more plot holes are formed and you proceed clicking around walking (ever so slowly) around some linear rundown areas of a city. You talk to some more NPC's and choose some more inconsequential dialog options... Then you proceed to get in to a "tactical" fight... there's usually only one of these per chapter.\n\nI was interested in the game because it looked like a fun tactical RPG game and had stat / profession / skill selections like the original Fallout games but that's about where the similarities die... The dialog to combat ratio is just abysmal. Fallout found that perfect balance of never giving you too much unnecessary dialog / information... It was always just the right amount and then it was off to go shoot some people, even still, Fallout has much richer dialog, you almost crave more of it sometimes. Shadow Run is just the polar opposite... 90% of every chapter is all dialog with a single battle / boss encounter that lasts about 5 minutes, tops.\n\nThe cyberpunk thing doesn't really do it for me either, a lot of the classes are rather convoluted and redundant... Highly unnecessary and only viable for small portions of the game to perhapes skip a few needless fights that end about as quickly as they start. The best all around class is the Street Samurai... so like you're a street thug with honor... kay... talk about a contradiction. :/\n\nI was never in to the Shadow Run lore so that might be why I'm not enjoying this as much, it all seems very familiar and boring. It's just another rip off of the Fantasy / Sci-Fi genre with a Cyberpunk coat of paint over the top... So you have your Trolls, Orcs, Humans, Dwarfs and Elves but they're all dressed in late 90's, pleather ridden esque garbs talking about jacking in to matrix's and carrying uzi's. *puke*\n\nIf you find it on sale, go for it I guess... but be warned, it's incredibly drab over all... not very stimulating. As a word of advice, don't try to specalize in more than a couple traits because being a jack of all trades / well rounded toon is going to get you killed in the late game.","December 31, 2015","false","15.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","8","14","5","0"

Last year Kickstarter exploded with projects promising to revive classic gaming franchises and bring new releases that embrace classic gaming conventions. Shadowrun Returns is one of the first major kickstarter releases to come to market and it's success or failure to impress will inevitably shape gamers trust of the kickstarter. Based on a pen and paper RPG, two completely different Shadowrun titles were released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The shadowrun universe is a unique combination of high fantasy races like elves and dwarfs and a cyberpunk world. Shadowrun Returns offers an original campaign, turn based tactical combat and a robust editor that allows players to create their own campaign.\n\nYour created character has struggled after a shadowrun gone bad and is contacted by one of your old crew members from that run named Sam Watts. The catch is that Sam has been murdered and his message is pre recorded, in it, he offers you 100,00 nuyen if you are able to bring the person who killed him to justice. As it turns out, Sam has been slain by a notorious serial killer, the Emerald City Ripper. The quest to identify the ripper takes you through drug dens, shadowrunner bars, the National Transportation Safety Board, a mental hospital, a cult's worship center and into mega corp territory. The narrative is very noir inspired with its femme fatals, seedy locations and nihilistic denizens. The script is peppered with slang that is simultaneously ridiculous and enriching. This is especially important since Shadowrun Returns features no voice acting. The regulars of the Seamstress Union, your quest hub for much of the game, are usually up for a little chat and even the merchants are on the loquacious side, sharing their personal stories before hocking their wares. Oddly enough, most of the shadowrunners that accompany your character on missions are mute. There are a handful of optional tasks and even fewer optional missions to pad your coffers. It's ultimately a refreshing experience since your character and the supporting cast are fueled solely by their own personal gains and vendettas instead of high-minded, self aggrandizing world saving exploits.\n\nTackling your missions involves navigating isometric maps, extracting information from the locals and of course engaging in turn based tactical combat. Exploring the sections of Seattle that host your missions isn't often rewarding. On occasion you will run across a grenade or a med kit for taking the trouble to look around before chatting with the next NPC that points your party in direction of the critical path. Fortunately, Shadowrun Returns often makes finding the way to your next objective engaging by asking you to so some puzzle solving, detective work and smooth talking. When the need to fight arises, combat starts immediately without any transition screens and props that litter the environment becomes all important cover. The turn based combat will have you analyzing the positioning of your units, managing action points and deciding which skills and spells to use. There are also elements in the environment to take advantage of, Riggers can send their drones through vents and Deckers can enter the Matrix to hack turrets, security cameras and swipe information to fence for funds. Turns in Shadowrun Returns are not governed by stats; there is simply a player phase and an enemy phase which makes streamlines planning. A large emphasis is on ranged combat since firearms are generally more powerful though melee attacks provide secondary effects like taking away a target's action points in addition to health. A wide range of buffs and debuffs can also swing the conditions on the battlefield in your favor.\n\nWhere much of the difficulty in Shadowrun comes in is through the use of overwhelming numbers. Often enemy encounters are lopsided and several missions have you face down endless waves of enemies until a given task is complete. Careful planning and making use of the environment makes these missions more than manageable. In fact, on the whole, Shadowrun is a bit on the easy side if you build an offense based class. Instead of gaining levels, completing actions earns your character karma. Karma can be spent on stat increases that progressively become more expensive as they increase. In addition there are base stats that must be leveled to level a subset of stats that are associated with that particular stat. All of the other shadowrunners that your character hires are not customizable in any way. While this fits into the lore of Shadowrun, it can make the game more difficult if you choose to play as a specialized support character.\n\nThe futuristic Seattle rendered in Shadowrun Returns is quintessential cyberpunk with hand painted interiors and cityscapes. The hand-painted aesthetic is very attractive and distinct and most of your surroundings are packed with details.  Most everything not associated with the Mega corporations are dingy and filthy and bathes in neon light. Unfortunately, some of the miliue can feel lifeless since there are few animated assets present. A few particle effects would have gone a long way toward making the streets of Seattle much less static. Characters are very minimalistic and their animations are modest. Detailed character portraits make up for this and do a commendable job communicating some personality. The music is handled by the composers of the original soundtracks for the Genesis and SNES games and as one would expect it has a large electronic influence. It's a catchy soundtrack that pays homage to it predecessor while properly aiding the tone of Returns.\n\nShadowrun Returns is one of several games that has to shoulder the heavy burden of gamers expectations from Kickstarter funded games and it has held up it's part of those expectations admirably. Harebrained Schemes has delivered several balancing patches and has offered excellent support for Shadowrun Returns and it's quality is quite exceptional. It's cyberpunk noir narrative is highly enjoyable with it's cast of characters motivated by very personal circumstances rather than the need for glory and heroism. Combat is simple but flexible, offering an appreciable degree of options for taking down foes. It's also a bit easy, linear and has a modest presentation but all of this is easily forgiven since it's price is a third of a tiple A game. Shadowrun Returns is an excellent example of what made classic RPGs special while reminding us how far the genre has come. Now, let's hope that Wasteland 2 and Broken Age also impress.","November 25, 2013","true","21.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Absolutely worth every cent.\n\nNovember 2013:\nThe campaign is about 10 hours and pretty well written. More engaging than I expected but absolutely linear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mag0ca/recommended/234650/","mag0ca","mag0ca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mag0ca/","692 products in account","Let me start out by saying that this is the first Shadowrun game that I have ever actually played. Yes I have tried the 1993 Shadowrun for the Super Nintendo but I could never get into it due to it's... Interesting controls (read point and click with a controller). But the game concept and the universe intrigued me, Over the years I forgot the name of it several times but would bring it up every few years and try to find the name of it and feel that they should remake it for the pc where it ultimately belonged. Well a few months ago was one such time that It popped into my head, I did a quick search for it and what did I find but a new Shadowrun being made for its proper platform (psst its the PC). I instantly fell in love with the style and everything I say was just the best thing I have ever seen.\n\n\nFlash forward to now where I have been given the ability to write this review and I am just stoked to be able to finally play a Shadowrun game without being hindered by a D-pad. Well I wasn't home when I got the Beta code but I had a 2 hour drive till I got home and then I had to download it and set it up. This just ate at me up inside but I managed to do it and when I first started it up I felt a chill as the dark and music (composed by Marshall Parker and Sam Powell from the 1993 SNES Shadowrun) started to play and the menu appeared.\n\n\nWhen you start a new game your greeted with a fairly standard character creation menu. You can select your gender, race and choose between several preconfigured or a custom skill sets for your character as well as select from one of several portraits and player models. The models look nice but are lacking the level of detail that you see with other games though this low detail level just feels right in the world, fitting in with the 2D environments. Each race has specific traits that are more prominent then others, these usually have higher starting values and higher max values. After choosing a character model and skill set you get to pick traits and spend your skill points on your starting stats. As soon as you are done creating your character you start in a modest apartment. After looking around the apartment for a while you get a call from an old friend and are sent into a flashback where you learn more about yourself and your friend but more importantly you get to experience the combat system for the first time.\n\n\nShadowrun Returns is broken up into missions and uses an auto save feature that saves at the beginning of a mission. It uses a tactical combat system where you have your squad and each member has action points. Each action your characters take use action points and once they're gone then that character can't do anything till the next turn.\nThis is customary for tactical games like this and even new people to this style of play should get used to it rather quickly. The combat system uses cover and line of site as a tactic and shows you how good the cover is and to what side you have cover on. This system isn't perfect as it doesn't always show that you're in cover and at times it's hard to tell if your line of site is broken simply due to the layout of the room and the camera angle.\n\n\nShadowrun Returns comes with a full scenario editor that allows users to create whole new missions and stories and share them with the community. The editor has been out for many of the kickstarter backers for a while now so there is going to be plenty of user made content available. Someone is currently working on recreating the old SNES Shadowrun into Shadowrun Returns using the editor available here http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaigns/snes-shadowrun/maps\n\n\nOverall I feel that the 2D backgrounds and the 3D character models mesh very well together and unlike in some games they feel right together. The story is excellent and you don't feel like it's being force fed down your gullet so you can play the game for the story or the game play or both. The main story is quite linier and it tends to feel like there's some handholding going on but you can choose to help someone or leave them to their own devices and save your own skin. I am not a master of table top RPG's but this feels like how I would imagine a table top RPG should be on a PC.\n\nCheck out my video review on YouTube @ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QygJskRB4w","December 19, 2013","true","42.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/recommended/234650/","razoleg","Cunning Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoleg/","664 products in account","I'm reviewing "Shadowrun Returns" as is, without any modules or steam workshop content.\n\nWell, here are my two cents.\n\nI've never really liked the idea of a game that relies too much on the community to create most of the gameplay, I think this is kind of cheap of developers to do so, especially seeing that, in my opinion, this game was made with much less capital input than was raised at its kickstarter profile, and it shows.\n\nSo, basically it is a top-down Vampire: The Masquerade meets Fallout meets Deus Ex meets Syndicate. The idea to merge Cyberpunk and Fantasy isn't new, and it is something I would have done a long time ago, frankly I am surprised why as of now only few settings with magic-meets-guns exist.\n\nAnyway, the graphics, sound, animation and presentation are on the level, maybe not something I would expect for a game priced thusly, but they are just enough to represent the basics of every action and/or event in the game world. Nothing too shabby. The only three-dimensional objects are characters, albeit with low quality detail and rendering. The backgrounds are well drawn, but it isn't something an average photoshop-skilled designer can't do overnight. I honestly don't see how this game could cost over $100,000 to make.\n\nThe first part of the story is very well done in terms of dialogue and logic, but the narrative quality as well as story progression and any kind of common sense just gets trashed by the mid-game. One second you are a cool cybermancer dude with glowing neon weapons, cruising through the streets of Seattle mesmerised by the night lights, fighting street scum with cunning speech choices and awesome magic spells, and in the next you are dwelling dungeons in a grind, shooting spectral fauna in a quest and narrative that would belong in a poorly made C-class sci-fi/occult thriller movie whilst choosing dialogue options that make your character seem either very high on something or extremely immature.\n\nEither way, the game delivers some entertainment value for the 10-12 hours it takes to beat it, but I do see how it was meant to be more of a construction kit, rather than just a full game. Your character does not even approach a fraction of his/her potential by the time you see the end credits. I'm just not make-your-own-adventure type of gamer, but I do recommend it for those that are into "Bladur's Gate" or any other kind of party based isometric cRPGs.\n\nP.S. For those that believe this is as close as you'd get to cyberpunk and that it honours work of W. Gibson, this is what he himself said of Shadowrun in general:\n\n"…when I see things like Shadowrun, the only negative thing I feel about it is that initial extreme revulsion at seeing my literary DNA mixed with elves. Somewhere somebody's sitting and saying 'I've got it! We're gonna do William Gibson and Tolkien!' Over my dead body! But I don't have to bear any aesthetic responsibility for it. I've never earned a nickel, but I wouldn't sue them. It's a fair cop. I'm sure there are people who could sue me, if they were so inclined, for messing with their stuff. So it's just kind of amusing."\n\nP.P.S. Thanks to Talint for gifting me this game :)).","January 6, 2014","true","21.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","20"

There are some real problems with it, but, despite that, I'd still recommend it to anyone who's thinking of giving it a chance.\n\nGameplay is linear and there are some inherent flaws in the design, for instance the tendency of attacks to roll Missed despite your actual stats. If I did a count, I'm fairly sure the number of times the characters missed surpass the times they actually land a hit. It got ridiculous to the point that I'd get misses 3 times in a row at point blank range. This makes for very frustrating play especially at the endgame portion. There's also an impression of unbalanced design considering that certain builds came off more useful than others. Party members builds seem to have no impact either outside of battles and a certain plot mission. I could have a decker in my party but not be able to do any side decking other than what was neccesary to move the game forward, it made party build up rather pointless and lackluster.\n\nOn the upside, it's rather well-written and the characters in-game are rather engaging and interesting. I'm not too familiar with the Shadowrun tabletop but I am a fan of the setting. You can see much effort has gone into the game and the end result is rather polished. The game is, overall, a good effort from an indie developer and while not great, is a decent experience and has lots of potential for the future.","October 21, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Were it not for the story I would have given it up long ago.\n\nThere are also some bugs, such as not being able to select a character to move during the battle.

But I like Shadowrun lore and ambiance, so I gave it a shot. I played Shadowrun when it came out for SNES.\n\nNow: I would cathegorize this game as an "interaction novel". Most of the players wanted a sandbox or at least some freedom, but this is no game for that. This game tells a story where you are involved in. There are some RPG aspects like leveling and building your character, but that is not the core of the game (I think).\n\nIf you are looking for a short sci-fi story you can play, then go ahead, I recommend this game. If you are a Shadowrun stories fan, then you should give it a try too.\n\nIf you are looking for an action game, a sandbox or a game where you can choose where to go, then this is not a game for you.\n\nIt has click adventure parts, it has tactical turn-based parts, but the core is the story. Some player have said the story is sh$%#". For me it is working, so far.\n\nCheers\n\nEdit: If you are looking for turn based strategy game or you are not into Shadowrun lore, go for XCOM: enemy unknown and within","June 25, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Checkpoint system bugged many, and I thought it would get on my nerves when I first read of it but in the end it didnt bother me at all.\nThe game has a variety of bugs but after I beat it last week they've already patched many of them.\n\nThe music was made by the guy that made the music for the SNES game aswell as the guy that made the music for the Genesis/Megadrive game set in the Shadowrun world so they know their stuff.\nThe graphics are Both beautiful but in terms of animations on the characters, sort of stiff.\nSo the battles tend to look abit worse than when youre just walking around the world in awe of the neon glory that is the Shadowrun world.\n\nThe battle system is very close to the one in the 2012 Xcom remake so all is good there.\nWhere the game really shines is it's storytelling and characters. The writers did a damn good job and created a world that really pulled me in. I'm usually not one to play games just for its story, but if you are then this is a great one.\n\nThe game is definately flawed but hopefully those flaws are worked out over time, and even if they aint, none of them ever really took me out of the experience.

I think this campaign had a lot of what Shadowrun players used to love, with a strong storytelling, beautiful sets and 2D artwork, and enough of the cyberpunk world to fit a story of this length (not too much, not too few).\n\nAnd for the weakest points, I've missed looting bodies after a shooting, and that kind of stuff, but I guess it's just a balance factor to get rid of and simplify the system.

I recommend to anyone that has played the genre before to play on the hardest difficulties.\n*Could use more weapons/armor/configuration. I kept feeling like there should be another drop or weapon coming soon... and it never does.\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nFun game, looks nice, but it's very short and could use more content and story. I am about 5-6 hours in (2 did not get recorded by Steam), and I would say according to the chapter list on most websites I'm about 75% through the game. I am looking forward to trying the expansion however, and I will update my review when I get the chance. Many reviews for the expansion title seem to point out that it's a bit more complete and a touch longer than the core campaign.\n\nI would purchase this game again, since I bought it on sale... but I don't think I would pay full price for it. This is a good pickup if you catch it on sale, and if so I would grab the expansion to go with it, otherwise the game may feel a bit incomplete.","July 23, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a platform that supports the creation and play of Adventures, both developer and community created. "Dead Man's Switch" is the initial campaign that you get at purchase and is a well constructed adventure. It has almost all the things you might expect to see and hear in a shadow run adventure. The combat is a xcom esque entertaining and at times very challenging. The characters are interested and likeable. The leveling system is more or less an intuitive waterfall setup. Attributes unlock skills, and skills unlock specializations i.e. Quickness[1] -> marksmen[1] -> rifles[1]. Though the game could do better on conveyance in general. Most important though is the adventure is fun and the game mechanics are solid.\n\nI do have minor grips with some of the unanswered mechanics issues and other game play short comings. But before that I can safely say that if you are a fan of shadowrun or have ever enjoyed playing the paper and pen or older SENS games you will enjoy this one.\n\n** My final recommendation: If you like Shadowrun you will like Shadowrun Returns - Dead Man's Switch **\n\n\nNow If you are interested in an runners ranting here are some of my misgivings about the game.\n\n\n-Characters should be persisten between adventures. Starting a new character every adventure is a little disheartening. (This being between Dead Man's Switch and dragonfall)\n\n-Send to stash: sending things to your stash doesn't seem to send said items to your stash.\n\n-Hit Chance: a legendary marksmen shouldn't consistently miss from half a room away just because the target is behind a half cover desk.\n\n-The lack of stealth is a real bummer, coupled with that is the lack of ability to use your etiquettes to aid in undercover stealth sections.\n\n-The absence of a local net on runs to disarm alarms, disrupt communication, shut off lights, lock doors, est. Mostly the disarming alarms before they go off bit.\n\n-Magic is also very spartan in comparison to the physical combat skills and interactions. You can summon spirits at predetermined locations\n\n-Having to run into an enemy or ambush to trigger combat mode is very disconcerting. The ability to freely toggle combat mode would have been greatly appreciated.\n\n-Riggers: Not being able to pilot drones outside of combat is a bit of a disservice to the rigger characters. As setup is a key part to the rigger play style.\n","July 24, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

[EDIT: Now that Dragonfall can be purchased standalone, this game has no reasl reason to exist] Without it, you're doomed to a story-on-rails campaign built to satisfy gun-monkeys and leave less combat-oriented classes in the dust, to say nothing of an inferior save system.\n\nBasically, Dead Man's Switch should be considered bonus content. Dragonfall is the real game.\n\nAnd what a game it is. Characters feel real, like they've been lived in for a while, not just plopped all one-dimensional and tabula rasa into the story. They have motivations, interesting origins, disagreements, and so on. They feel like actual people. And those people breathe life into the story -- a conspiracy yarn full of magic, intrigue, and high-tech low-lives. Choices are difficult. There's often a clear division between the morally right and wrong choices, but the consequences muddy it up. Is it better to spare some schlub for the sake of conscience if missing a payday means you can't stop far greater evil down the line?\n\nCombat is kind of a stripped-down X-Com affair with turnbased isometric squad stuff.

I take my time during battles, deciding my next move, and sometimes starting over. I don't like to rush. It's not very often I get excited over these games but when I do, it turns into my favorite game and a classic for me at least.\n\nI am not very good at recommending games. I play what I like.

After an extended prologue, though, the game blossoms into a story that pulls from classic noir fiction like Raymond Chandler's Marlowe stories and Polanski's Chinatown coupled with the richly detailed background fiction of the Shadowrun universe. "Cyberpunk and magic" is a concept that should, by all accounts, collapse into utter silliness, but somehow SR manages to keep finding interesting (and sometimes amusing) twists on both of these themes.\n\nWhile the art style is clean and the interface generally functional (inventory management is a sore spot), be aware that this is a game that really only gives as much as you're willing to bring to it -- there are no 3D environments, voiced dialog, or cut scenes, but the game manages to be immersive in the same way that dreamily browsing through a gamebook and conjuring adventures can be. Some reviews have faulted the plot for being overly linear, and while I always appreciate more player agency, it really wasn't an issue for me here.\n\nMy main complaint is the way the game paces itself in doling out the fun skills and cool toys. Early on it's hard to understand why I'd want to invest in particular skill sets when there's little explanation of how they function or game scenarios that take advantage of them. It's not until the midpoint of the game that distinctive SR features like rigs, decks, and chroming really even come into play which makes it frustrating to define your character without knowing what kind of build you're even shooting for. While I have no problem holding back some surprises, I would have rather seen the advanced stuff up on the shelf early on so I had a better idea of what I could aspire to be. In the worst case, you can never go wrong with shooting something with a gun or throwing a fireball at it, though a lot of the fun in SR comes from mixing and matching all the different combinations available.\n\nBut the story and characters are well drawn, the dialog full of personality, and once events pick up steam I felt compelled to chase down the conclusion. By the end I'd developed a lot of affection for both my character and the friends she'd made along the way; I was sorry to see them go (and that there are currently no plans to continue their story) but based on the strength of this initial foray I'll definitely be checking out the sequel, Dragonfall. Definitely recommended.","August 30, 2014","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've always been fond of the old crpgs the like of Baldur's Gate, Icewind dale, Fallout 1 & 2 and Arcanum so this game sort of struck a chord for me. It certainly had the nostalgic vibes I was looking for and decent writing to carry you through the experience (if you dislike reading a lot of text then this game might not be for you). Character progression seemed generously free to manipulate as you wish and that was certainly refreshing. Combat feels a little shallow at times and the different skills didn't really stand up usually there being only 1-2 max 3 good options to use. Also the saving system is a complete dork. There's no manual saving so you're depending on an autosave system which might make you restart the level as your main hero dies after dying 20 minutes into the level. Frustrating to say the least. But all in all positives here outweigh the negatives. Relatively cheap rpg for you story and dialogue hungry people to sink your brains into.\n\nNot to forget that there's a possibility to create your own campaigns and play community created content as well which add greatly to the game length.

Shadowrun returns is a average cyberpunk and magic theme RPG. The main defect in the game is the vacuity of the gameworld comprised of the different interconnected areas. The game basically gives you only plot items to interact and the city locations are small.\n\nTrue to the "pocket world" RPG approach the plot is your average RPG pipeline stuff. Shadowrun Returns also lacks the intricate background stories for NPCs that most RPGs have, but this aspect of team interaction is added in the Dragonfall DLC. Dragonfall also does everything a little bit better, passing of as a relatively good RPG. It takes maybe 15-18 hours to complete Dragonfall if you're a completionist and about 20h for the main game.\n\nSince there's lots of combat, which is not that great, the game in my opinion is somwhat lacking in replay value. Though the end game of Dragonfall does play differently depending on few key choices, you're not inclined to mow through the same combat laden missions again.","March 27, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Time is around 2057 but due to the Awakening, the world is filled with science fiction high tech and fantasy elements alike. You have genetic modification, cyberplants and hacking warfare along with elves, orcs, dwarfes and trolls hurling magic bolts. A rich and fascinating universe.\n\n… you have to work trough yourself. The game can be summed up by the phrase “too less”. At first there is too less background for the setting, the story. You just start off creating a character, like an orc, with cybernetic implants. Yep, no explanation to this. If you want to find out more about the Shadowrun world you have to look elsewhere but not the game.\n\nThen there is too less RPG. Seldom you find something useful to pick up and equip. Also stats and skills are presented in a very sober way in a plain matrix. No introduction, no nothing. All at once, on page. Also you likely will spend points on attributes and skills you don’t need in future. Sorry, there is no turning back.\n\nThen there is too less adventure. The story is nice, but you got not real decisions to make. The storyline is very linear. There are some side-quests, but guess: too less.\n\nThen there is too less of a challenge. At the first two thirds of the game. I pimped my elf with quickness and assault rifles and the game was no real match at “normal” level. Strategic fighting is nice and … easy. Yeah, the games picks up some pace in the last third and starts to get harder. This is were the fun really sets in. But up to then it is playing a nice story …\n\nAnd someone always has the idea of something missing. Something’s missing at the RPG, at the adventure, at the combat game, at the grafics, animations.\n\nE.g. Harlequin is one of the coolest elves I’ve come along in playing games, but when he wields his sword he is animated as if someone had stiffed a broomstick right along his “back”. The in-game representation is missing the charisma and style this elf has in dialogues.\n\nFinally the save game mechanics are just bonkers. Actually you just can save at the start of a level, better: the game (hopefully) autosaves at this stage. Making a wrong decision at the end of a level requires to replay to whole level again.\n\nThe pro: once you’ve delved into the universe the plot is great to play and the dialogs are really nice written, the combat is fun after all. It remains a nice game.

Another thing this game is like is Mass Effect because it wants to combine the traditional fantasy RPG style of magic with a more modern/futuristic style of technology and and it does it pretty well.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it isnt a fully voiced game and I sometimes get tired of reading a lot of text when I'm interviewing someone for information, only a small portion of the dialogue is voiced which would make the game more immersive for me.","August 6, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've read Neuromancer; and loved it, if you've spent countless hours playing Baldur's Gate or older Fallout titles; and couldn't tear yourself away from them, this is a game for you.\n\nAnd once you're done with original campaign, quality user generated content awaits you on Steam Workshop and 3rd party sites like Shadowrun Nexus. Modders are so ambitious that they are recreating whole Shadowrun sourcebooks. So, come on, join us in the shadows, chummer.\n\nShadowrun Dragonfall: I know they are marketing this as merely DLC, but DLC this is not. It is a full blown, old fashioned expansion pack. Dragonfall packs a bigger campaign, set in the anarchy ridden Berlin of 2054, otherwise known as the Flux State.\n\nHBS has listened to fans and addressed all the major issues from the original game. Saving your game anywhere? Check! More interesting companions with actual personalities and backstory? Yes, sir! Side missions? Of course! This time around you are not led by the hand. You get a hub, certain Berlin neighborhood, where you can choose your missions, even reject them if Mr. Johnson offering it isn't on the level. You can chat with the (meta)humans living there. Solve their problems. Learn of their past, and they all have some very shady skeletons in the closet. Let's face it, only people running from something come to the F-State...and corporations. But the latter are a different story altogether.\n\nRuns themselves have been improved considerably. There are multiple solutions to every problem and some tough choices to be made in practically every one. Enemy encounters have been improved. Combat is more enjoyable, overall. Non-combat skills feature more prominently. Skills and etiquette checks are very frequent. You can go in guns, fists, blades and magic blazing. But you can also do things covertly. It's all up to you.\n\nWriting in this game is great. Story takes hold of you, is full of twist and turns, and won't let you go 'till the end. By that time, you'll crave more. Speaking of length, you'll get at least twenty hours out of the game. Even more, if you play on harder difficulties, want to speak to everyone and see everything.\n\nDragonfall is the definitive reason to pick up the original game. If you're into old school RPGs, cyberpunk, and value a good story, you won't be disappointed with this game.","August 13, 2013","true","89.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I only narrowly gave this thumbs up, because of the fact that most of the game's potential comes from user-generated content, which is made by people who will not not be seeing any of the money you pay. The engine itself is clumsy because it takes a lot of fiddling to make it immersive; doors cannot be closed again once open, by default; you have to set each one up to do so, etc. Places that look navigable are sometimes not. There is a lack of cover in places where there sems like there should be.\n\nIn short the product feels rushed, and most of the potential comes from people that are willing to work (for free)/adapt the tools released, rather than from the developers.

You like strategy games? You like Sci-Fi? Ever wanted to mash 'em together into a delicous nerd smoothie?  Then do we have a product for you.\n\nIf you're an XCOM fan, the mechanics are pretty straightforward to you.  Honestly, Shadowrun Returns as simply a game is good, but not great.  The Karma system for leveling allows you to customize your character however you like with no limitations on class, though you'll want to specialize as you approach endgame.\n\nHowever, Shadowrun Returns -- Shadowrun as a whole -- is so much more than a game.  It's a living, breathing world; a technologically heightened and magic-infused setting for stories of any kind.  Plots might hinge on the epic and esoteric (dangerous research into blood magic by a ruthless, profit-hungry megacorp) or the throwback noir with a twist (being hired by a dead man to find his murderer).  Sure, most of the RP of this RPG happens via old-school plain text, but you know what they call plain text in most places? Books. It ain't broke, so don't fix it!\n\nCharacter creation remains fun to me, even after a few playthroughs.  It's pretty neat to tell your friends about your human shaman/street samurai who packs enough heat to take on a militia even before summoning his elemental spirits.  Or about your pink-haired elvish techno-wiz equally at home jacking into corporate Matrix blocks or rigging into her homemade combat drones with her very mind.  Moreover, the skills your character chooses will assist them outside of combat, unlocking alternate routes, hidden passages with loot, chances to solve a problem diplomatically (with added EXP!), and more.\n\nThe campaign that ships with the game, Dead Man's Switch, is a bit short but satisfying nonetheless.  It's an excellent introduction to the Shadowrun world, and veterans of the series will even see a few familiar faces.  Dragonfall, the DLC whose remastered version will drop tomorrow, is just plain phenomenal.  And that's not even touching the free Steamworks fan-made campaigns, some of which are truly brilliant.  Harebrained Schemes, the devs of Shadowrun Returns, have reminded us that a great game doesn't need 60 fps or 360-noscopes. You just need solid mechanics, a fascinating setting, and some hardcore writing chops.\n\nBe sure to check out the pen-and-paper Shadowrun RPG, too!","September 17, 2014","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not because i wanted to, but because I am so tired right now. This game is in one word: awesome! If you played the pen and paper rpg you will recognize that the rulesystem is quite different to it. Its more dumbed down. But this is not bad. Actually its a question of gamedesign. And works quite good. This game lacks so many things. No voice acting no thrilling graphic style (all graphics are handdrawn). But this game has one thing i have missed in so many games the last couple of months. The just another mission effect. I couldn't stop playing.\nThe story is great. The writting is compelling (and there is a lot of text since there is no voice acting what so ever). It inherits the spirit of the first 2 Shadowrun rulesets. Version 1 and 2 maybe 3 with all its coolness and glory.

Character classes include shamans (clerics), street samurai (fighters, melee or gun-based), mages, adepts (magical martial arts fighters), deckers (computer hackers) and riggers (who control drone robots). Player character races include humans, orcs, trolls (extra large orcs), elves and dwarves.\n\nThe world includes lots of fantasy monsters from spirits and giant scorpions to great dragons, and also plenty of security personnel itching to die at your hands.\n\nDecking (computer hacking), and the way computers and the Internet work in general, doesn't make any sense at all. But this is totally consistent with the Cyberpunk genre, which was generally written by people with no real computer knowledge. Inside Cyberspace, you battle ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures) and even Black ICE (ICE that can kill you in real life).\n\nI've played through the original plot of Shadowrun Returns (Deadman's Switch) and also Dragonfall. I thought that both games had really engaging stories, and were generally well-paced, had good dialogue and interesting characters. The scenes and themes fit well with a cyberpunk "high tech, low life" motif.\n\nDead Man's Switch was very linear, with little more than dialog choices (nice answer, neutral answer, mean answer). Playing it is a lot like reading a good book that has interactive fight scenes and some inventory management.\n\nDragonfall was less linear, with some limited ability for the player to make world-changing choices. The important decisions are all made more toward the end of the game, though. This may annoy you, or you may like it because it gives you the chance to load your game and try a different ending with only 5 minutes more investment. Also, Dragonfall has much more lively NPCs, which makes for a game that feels a bit more social and less isolating.\n\nThat having been said, it's great that the stories are good, but 90% of your time in the game will be spent in fights. Almost all of the skills that you increase with experience (which Shadowrun calls "karma") are combat skills, although they have some limited utility in conversation (especially Charisma). All the equipment is combat or quest related.\n\nIn Shadowrun, the fighting is turn-based, with each character on a side getting a turn (with 2 or 3 Action Points) before the next side gets to act. The huge array of options can be overwhelming, especially at first. Fighting takes place in a large variety of locales and against a wide variety of foes. Sometimes your opponents get a surprise turn against you, which can be very annoying if your main character is squishy (has few HPs), as you see the entire enemy team attack your character (who is not under cover) before you get to act. I was once killed outright this way without even having a chance to react. Fortunately, I had an item that automatically resuscitated me.\n\nThe fighting in Shadowrun Returns can get pretty repetitive fairly quickly, though. Once I figured out the ideal strategy (see next paragraph), it was just a question of repeating the same operations every fight. The same strategy works every fight. The only variation is a bit of difference in tactical positioning depending on how the enemy is approaching you and the layout of cover. Take cover, buff your main damage dealers, and kill your opponents. If your opponents bunch up use grenades and area effect spells against them. Rince and repeat.\n\nSPOILER WARNING the best strategy is to take a mage and buy spells that do area effect damage or reduce AP. In a 1v1 duel you can easily steal all of your opponent's AP and just damage them every turn without ever being hurt. Other viable options include a rifle/shotgun specialist or a high-Intelligence decker/rigger. The melee characters are particularly underpowered. Use shamans as support to boost your main damage dealers with AP, HP and accuracy. SPOILER WARNING END\n\nThe game is a bit buggy. I frequently have trouble with character equipment, where items will switch in or out of my backpack spontaneously, or I'll see different items when in combat or out of combat. I've had rare situations where I click on a HUD button and my character moves on the map instead--wasting a turn. I encountered no critical bugs that crashed the game or prevented story completion, however.\n\nThere are some usability issues. There doesn't seem to be any way to manage drone equipment. It can be awkward to manage objects found in the world, since only the character accessing the container can pick up the item, and outside of combat you only have control over your main character. The game often requires extra unecessary clicks, like when using abilities that can only be used on yourself, you're still forced to click on your sprite to self-select.\n\nOverall, I consider this game worth buying and playing, especially if you're a fan of computer role-playing games.","June 5, 2014","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Picture the gameplay of XCOM: Enemies Unknown mixed with a book roleplaying game. AKA Shadowrun. I've roleplayed a lot, although never Shadowrun. But it feels like a nice little adventure. I'd say the game lasts about 12-15 hours. It gets a little slow paced though, it's very text heavy. If it was voice acted I think that would add a lot to it, but I don't fault it for that.\n\nWhen you do get into combat, it plays almost exactly like XCOM. You get action points, 2 to begin with and you can either move or do an action like fight with those points during your turn. It's all turn based strategy on a grid. Overall I didn't find the combat to be very difficult, you hire a team before each mission to go with you but I played a Street Samurai and I was basically bread for combat.\n\nThat leads me to the character creation, I picked a Street Samurai as I mentioned, but you can pick from quite a variety of characters to begin with and tweak them as you play with Karma points. Like leveling up in the book RPG's. These various character choices lead to different dialogue choices and even options on the battlefield. So there is definitely variety and replayability here.\n\nSpeaking on replayability, this game also opens itself up to player stories and mods. You can download and create your own or others stories/adventures. So the game really has no end. It is certainly worth full price, but even better if you get it on sale. I would definitely recommend this game to any Cyberpunk style enthusiasts. If you liked XCOM you will like this combat system. Only gripe is all the reading. It makes me sleepy, but I pressed on and finished the main campaign and really enjoyed it.","July 15, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway. Good times, definitely worth picking up if you enjoyed the old SNES game or the trailer to this one appeals to you.","July 15, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A little short and straightforward, but well done in spite of this.  Worth the price.\n\n\n* The charisma system in game works by giving you various "etiquettes" which will open up conversation options if you know them.

Nevertheless I didn’t enjoy recent RPGs like I used to. Yes, they might have great graphics, good gameplay mechanics or a well-crafted skill system, but the one aspect I find them lacking is the storytelling. Shadowrun Returns is an exception.\nBefore I start getting into the details, I have to say I watched several gameplay and review videos before I picked it up. To be honest – I wasn’t impressed. Even though the hand-crafted 2D environments are gorgeous and vivid, the character models as well as the visual effects are far from impressive. Nevertheless, I gave it a shot and I wasn’t disappointed.\n\nThe Shadowrun universe combines Cyberpunk aspects with the return of magic and metahumans in a futuristic world. The player slips into the role of a shadowrunner, an operative who will steal, infiltrate, hack and kidnap for the right price. The protagonist has to deal with powerful corporations, corruption, mythical creatures and fellow shadowrunners to survive.\nWhen it comes to creating a character that is your own, Shadowrun excels. You can choose between five races you might find in a fantasy RPG (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll), which feel quite fresh in this unfamiliar setting. Your character can choose from six pre-made classes:\n-	Street Samurai: become a gun-wielding or close-range killing machine\n-	Mage: Fireballs, buffs and Debuffs. The familiar choice.\n-	Decker: jack into the Matrix to fight security systems with your programs\n-	Rigger: use small drones to support your team or deal damage\n-	Shaman: use totems or summon spirits to defeat your enemies\n-	Adept: use magic to enhance your own abilities, making yourself a weapon\n\nFurthermore you can also start from scratch and spend Karma points and create your own experience. Technoshaman? Combat Decker? Everything is possible, as long as you don’t spread the Karma points too thin. Skill checks are quite common in dialogue options and spending some points in Charisma or Intelligence can be worthwhile.\nThe inventory system is quite rudimentary. Characters wear an outfit and can carry up to three weapons. Everyone can carry up to six consumables and Magic users as well as Deckers have a spellbook with up to six slots. To further improve skills or stats, cyberware can be implanted. However this results in increased cooldowns for spells.\nThe gameplay revolves around a team of up to 4 shadowrunners. During the majority of the game you can hire a team and choose them depending on your group dynamics. Or your cash on hand, since shadowrunners don’t work for free. The combat system is round-based and reminds of Fallout 1 & 2. Action points have to be spend wisely to move, attack or use consumables like medkits and grenades.\n\nYou have to read! Where many games try to tell their stories with cutscenes and voice acting, Shadowrun Returns presents the story with superb writing. Whenever you travel to a new location or meet a character the situation is beautifully described before you have to worry about combat or dialogue choices. Combined with vibrant character portraits, the characters you encounter feel alive.\n\nThe different races and classes offer replayability. My first playthrough (normal, Human Decker) took 9+ hours. Due to the familiarity with enemy placement and linear storyline, my second run (very hard, Dwarf Mage) took a little over five hours. I can see myself coming back to try out different classes, however for now I’m enjoying the Dragonfall DLC (very hard, Troll Adept).\n\nI would highly recommend this game to players who enjoy round-based RPGs, which concentrate on storytelling.","July 9, 2014","true","28.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Tabletop, PC/Console games etc.)\n\nStory/Setting: The game overall is pretty solid and good fun. It has a decent story with twists and turns and an amusing ending. You encounter likeable characters and the world is a great representation of Cyberpunk, with it's own take on things with the addition of magic.\n\nCharacter Customisation:You get to make your own runner at the start of the game and there is a lot to work with from melee characters, armed characters, Deckers (hackers), Riggers (drones), Mages (spells, traps, heal), Shamans (Similar to mages, can also raise spirits, creatures and demons). However where this game shines is you really have the power to go all out with one type of class or mix any of them and make a unique build of your own. (I think I got all the classes correct there. Or near enough!)\n\nI'd say this game has great potential for replay value as you could try out all the different classes avaliable, however it wouldn't be something you'd jump straight back into after compleing in my opion, as the story and levels are fairly linear.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay:Everything works as it should in this game and I encountered no issues at all. However I would say the game is a little lacking in RPG elements in my opinion. Let's call it CRPG-Lite! (That was terrible)\n\nA couple of areas that came to mind;\n\nIn conversations you do have the ability to convice, bribe and use etiquettes to persuade and win people over to your side which you would expect with an RPG, but, what I feel was lacking was that you can't really ♥♥♥♥ someone off in dialogue or make them hate you and never talk to you again like you can in some RPGs, ultimately conversations (It would appear) all have the same conclusion, you just have little things you can do here and there if you spec'd in charisma, you bribe them or have the correct etiquette.\n\nI think this is because the levels and story are fairly linear for an RPG that it can't really give you that freedom. There are oppourtunities that you can miss out on if you give the wrong responses, but in an RPG I want it to be truly diverse in the sense that I can ♥♥♥♥ up an oppurtunity and then I have to go out of my way find another way to achieve my goal/quest. This game ultimately always seems to come to the same conclusion regardless.\n\nThe other major area that felt a little lacking was the combat, it has the average top down, turn based combat mechanics but I wish it was more like Wasteland 2's. You can get behind cover, but some you can't shoot around, your character literally can't step out with one foot and shoot around a doorway or down a corridor. Just a bit more control over combat and the ability to make better stratergies would have made the combat near-perfect!\n\nOther little issues I had were things like not being able to examine the environments other than what the devs wanted you to see. Lack of dialogue/text box like in most RPGs, that displays examine text, Character thoughts and NPC dialogue etc.\n\nOverall:Overall this is a really fun game, I played it through in a few days and was pretty glued to it. At first I was a little disappointed with the lack of RPG elements I'm used to, but I quickly accepted that Shadowrun is it's own thing and does it a little differently.\n\nI'm really impressed with Harebrained Schemes and that they've successfully brought back Shadowrun. Now I have Dragonfall and Hong Kong to play, and from what I hear they've been improved a lot from this game!","November 27, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Humans, dwarves, elves and other metahuman races walk the planet, while corporations rule the world. The setting is definitely solid, and has a lot of background knowledge, that makes for a rich world.\n\nGameplay consists of navigating your characters across an isometric map, interacting with people and objects, and fighting. Combat is turn-based and relies very much on cover, although there are playstyles that do not.\n\nCharacter is freeform, but starts with a certain archetype, which you can then customize as you gain Karma, the resource used to develop your character.\n\nThe story is good, but the greatest charm of the game has got to be writing, and the various side quests and dialogues, that make up the universe. However, none of it voice-acted, so if you do not like reading, don't buy the game.\n\nAll in all, its definitely worth the price as intro to the series, but I will not be held responsible if you get addicted.","August 28, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I left the game on a few different nights, so chalk up 16-30 hours of Steam's "recorded play time" being from that.\n\nMediocre turn based strategy that really didn't bring anything new to the genre.  The setting for the game is neat, it takes place in Seattle/Berlin and there has been a resurgence of magic use, different sub types of humans(Orcs, Elves, etc.), all blended with future technologies.  The stories are fun but mostly but are mostly predictable, leaving you with no real sense of wonder.  The dialog tried it's best, but it probably reads as poorly as this review, hah.\n\nThe combat isn't anything to get too excited about either, as it's basically dice rolling for accuracy of success and damage. Even at the highest difficulty setting, I didn't find myself all that challenged, which may be a blessing to those who just want to breeze through the game.  The inability to customize characters outside your main character is pretty lame and rather off putting at times.

I didn't have a single character die, or even get close to death in the campaign and I don't think this is because I played particularly well.

Indeed it has... this intriguing isometric RPG is a great combat system wrapped in a rollicking mystery that although has a few stumbling points, it is very much worth your time. Returns comes with a built-in campaign that will last you 10-12 hours if you take your time, and with plenty of mods in the community to keep it fresh.\n\nGameplay\nShadowrun Returns has a basic isometric movement system, just click where you want to go/interact with. It's when you get into the easy-to-learn combat system that the game really opens up. You can create your Runner to be a Sorcerer, a Drone-using mastermind, or just a guy with a shotgun that shoots people in the face. The RPG system is good, not overly complicated, and has good conversation trees that can be affected with different levels of Charisma. You can even role-play what type of things your character is knowledgable in. Overall, the gameplay of Shadowrun Returns is slick and stellar.\n\nStory\nShadowrun Returns has a story that doesn't quite work on the empathy stakes... there's no reason really to care for any of the characters you meet, and some of the Runners you can hire are simply generic. If they die, it's just a *shrug* and leave them behind. However, the actual mystery behind the game and what's going on I found to be motivating enough... although it starts off slow, you want to meet the 'Ripper' until you actually stop playing the game- though after you've met him, things really start to get interesting...\n\nGraphics, Atmosphere, and Sound\nThe graphics of Shadowrun are servicable; sure, they won't dazzle you, but they aren't bad either. It has a nice art-style to make the world come to life, and the character portraits help give you first impressions of the characters, as well as the information that comes through text-wise.\nThe atmosphere is great, with dank hotels and rain-drenched streets beckoning your Runner on. The characters are as fleshed out as you can get in a 'short' campaign as the Dead Man's Switch, but personally, I won't miss any of them.\nThe music quality in this game is impeccable. If you are a fan of electronic music, you won't regret listening to the tracks that are on offer here. 'Double Cross' is my personal favorite track. The additional sounds of guns and sorcery that permeate the air whilst fighting adds to the atmosphere.\n\nConclusion\nShadowrun Returns, A Dead Man's Switch, is a joy to play, and although the story has a few hiccups and the companion system leaves a lot to be desired, the game is overall a solid reccomendation. Worth your time indeed. Ready to deck into the system?","September 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And I mean this is actual, proper SR too, not like some of the dribble that's carried the SR name in the past.  It's made by some of the folks who created SR in the first place, and it definitely shows by how deeply entwined with the actual lore it is.  If you like - or, like me, love - SR, you owe it to yourself to get this game.\n\nBut that's not all!  The writing is top notch, with great characters and a great story with lots of neat twists and turns.  The art is beautiful, making the game look like a painting come to life.  And the turn-based tactical combat - while not exactly original - is very well-executed and fun to play.\n\nFurther, it's set up so you can make your own campaigns, which is pretty dang cool in my book.\n\nThe Bad\nThough I understood pretty much everything that was going on in the story, understanding almost every reference and technical term that came flying my way, I'm not entirely certain it would be nearly as accessible for anyone who doesn't already know the SR rulebooks forwards and backwards or is at least somewhat familiar with the setting.  This may be a foundless fear, but I figure I should mention it just in case.\n\nCharacter stats were greatly simplified from the original systems, and even compared to at least one of the previous SR video games, which I do understand to a degree.  But I feel they may have simplified a little bit too much, and would have welcomed a little more depth.  That may be just me being a rules lawyer, tho'.\n\nOverall\nIf my comments above don't speak plainly enough for themselves, I don't really have much bad to say about this game, but I fully realize that that might simply be my own pro-Shadowrun bias.  The game does have its faults, and I do wish it had a bit more depth than it does, but overall I feel that its pros far outweigh its cons, so I feel very confident in recommending it to folks.  And if you can, play the SNES and Genesis games first!","September 27, 2013","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shadowrun: Returns plays something like a simplified version of tabletop rules that never actually existed.\n\nI liked the plot, combat, and music.\n\nOpinions on the plot vary widely.  If you have an aversion to reading, this game is not for you.  Almost all of the plot is delivered via screens of text upon entering an area, or text dialogs.  There is no voiceover.  Some people complain of purple prose, or that it seems to have been written by someone that is immature, but the writing is superior to that in most video games, including most other RPGs.  I personally do not perceive any of these problems, and have never seen examples cited.\n\nScreenshots do not do the combat system justice.  Some of the interface is only displayed when it is relevant.  For example, the action point cost of movement, and the effectiveness of cover, only appear when you prepare to move, and when cover exists in the area you mouseover.  The combat system is relatively simple (which is reflected in the user interface), but like Chess, can be quite difficult.  The difficulty is selectable at character creation, so if you find the game too easy or hard you can adjust it.  Since almost all RPGs are combat-heavy, it's important that it not be mindless and repetitive.\n\nThe music is hard to describe.  It is not ambient.  You will notice it.  I especially like the theme on the title screen.\n\nI didn't like some things about Shadowrun: Returns.\n\nIt is very linear, and most decisions will not affect the ending.\n\nThe gameplay in the matrix is very similar to meatspace.  It's not so much that the gameplay in the matrix is bad as it doesn't feel different enough.\n\nThe game only saves on area transition.  If you have to stop playing, or die, unexpectedly, you can lose quite a bit of progress.","November 13, 2015","true","81.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fix for save files has been working fine for me with some flaws, but you will decide for yourself if this suits you fine or you might get DRM-free version that appearantly doesn't have these problems... I've used several different solutions and my own experiments to come up with the fix that works.\n\nSo, this is my story with Shadowrun.\n\nI saw a few promotional posters here and there. Nothing more. Then one day, a good buddy of mine gifts me Shadowrun Returns and Shadowun Dragonfall. I didn't touch any of these in a long time because my reviewing and gaming queue was really choke full.\n\nBut one fateful night I decide to check out the playing order of Shadowrun games and I install this one. After creating my character, I've found myself in my smelly apartment wiith a dead friend asking for help. And I immediately fall in love. TOTALLY.\n\nShadowrun universe is one of the best I've encountered in a long time. This clash of tech and fantasy was something I even dreamt of writing about myself (until I've realized it's been done before and better). When I've figured out there are BOOKS out there about Shadowrun world... I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants and figured out I'll die happy. You will be entering the strange cyberpunk retrofuturistic world filled with noir style crime mysteries, corporate thrillers and technology ruling the flesh.\n\nThe storyline and game itself is fairly linear, but it made me care more about roleplaying - there's never a dull moment and nobody asks you to milk the cow (read: nonsensical sidequests) when you're in the middle of exciting main mission. That way you truly feel like you're doing something important.\n\nBattle system is similar to that one seen in XCom games (turn based combat), and RPG system is decent and effective, making you care how you distribute your Karma points.\n\nThe only true problem I had with Shadowrun Returns on Steam is the fact that at certain point I've started having major problems with save files - to cut the story short, game stops recognizing your saves. By doing this, you will be able to play the game, but Steam time tracking will not work. If you're into tracking your time (as much as I am), you can always run a Steam edition of the game beside second one.\n\nI am playing on Windows 7 64bit. I am not responsible for any accidents or nuclear meltdowns caused by copying and pasting. BACK EVERYTHING UP.\n\nIf you all of a sudden get greyed out CONTINUE button and you are not able to load your game, try this.\n\n1. Go to C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Harebrained Schemes\Shadowrun Returns\Saves and copy all the files. These are your save files. COPY THEM.\n2. Go to your Steam folder. There, find the following folders \userdata\YOURPERSONALNR\234650 . Inside 234650 folder you will see two folders, one named Local, the other named remote. Back those up, just in case. You're bound to find some save files in these folders, but sometimes it's not the case. Now, paste AppData/Local... save files to both of these folders. If system asks you to overwrite, overwrite.\n3. Now, most people say you need to restart Steam and start it in admin mode. This may help you once, just as it helped me, but then you'll encounter greyed out buttons again. The way I made my saves work is that I ran my game directly by clicking Shadowrun.exe from \Steam\steamapps\common\Shadowrun Returns.\n\nPros: your save games work.\nCons: no Steam overlay, no time tracking.\n\nI would usually not lose this much time to figure things out, but Shadowrun is SO GOOD and when I heard Dragonfall and Hong Kong are even better... oh, happy times!!!","September 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

That is to say, the one that strictly caters to my sensibilities as a player. I discovered them well after their golden age, and since this wave of kickstarted CRPGs began I've been eagerly awaiting their results.\n\nAs the first one out of the gate from this batch, Shadowrun Returns does not disappoint. If you're like me and you've been aching for a deep and immersive roleplaying experience and actual agency when it comes to solving problems, this game is a steal at $20. Excellent writing, beautiful environments, and a fantastic soundtrack all tied together with engaging combat and character progression.\n\nThe campaign will take you about 15 hours to run through, and there's sadly little in the way of extended diversions, and the game is rather linear in how it progresses.

If you've read Neuromancer; and loved it, if you've spent countless hours playing Baldur's Gate or older Fallout titles; and couldn't tear yourself away from them, this is a game for you.\n\nAnd once you're done with original campaign, quality user generated content awaits you on Steam Workshop and 3rd party sites like Shadowrun Nexus. Modders are so ambitious that they are recreating whole Shadowrun sourcebooks. So, come on, join us in the shadows, chummer.\n\nShadowrun Dragonfall: I know they are marketing this as merely DLC, but DLC this is not. It is a full blown, old fashioned expansion pack. Dragonfall packs a bigger campaign, set in the anarchy ridden Berlin of 2054, otherwise known as the Flux State.\n\nHBS has listened to fans and addressed all the major issues from the original game. Saving your game anywhere? Check! More interesting companions with actual personalities and backstory? Yes, sir! Side missions? Of course! This time around you are not led by the hand. You get a hub, certain Berlin neighborhood, where you can choose your missions, even reject them if Mr. Johnson offering it isn't on the level. You can chat with the (meta)humans living there. Solve their problems. Learn of their past, and they all have some very shady skeletons in the closet. Let's face it, only people running from something come to the F-State...and corporations. But the latter are a different story altogether.\n\nRuns themselves have been improved considerably. There are multiple solutions to every problem and some tough choices to be made in practically every one. Enemy encounters have been improved. Combat is more enjoyable, overall. Non-combat skills feature more prominently. Skills and etiquette checks are very frequent. You can go in guns, fists, blades and magic blazing. But you can also do things covertly. It's all up to you.\n\nWriting in this game is great. Story takes hold of you, is full of twist and turns, and won't let you go 'till the end. By that time, you'll crave more. Speaking of length, you'll get at least twenty hours out of the game. Even more, if you play on harder difficulties, want to speak to everyone and see everything.\n\nDragonfall is the definitive reason to pick up the original game. If you're into old school RPGs, cyberpunk, and value a good story, you won't be disappointed with this game.","August 13, 2013","true","89.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its fun to make your character however you'd like them, and the skills are laid out in a straightforward way. Spell variety leaves a little bit left to be desired, and I personally wouldve liked greater variety for implants, but is all in all very solid.\n\nStoryline for the default game, called "The Deadman's Switch" is boring and linear, and you dont spend a long enough amount of downtime to talk to and connect with your party members. Also playing a decker is a waste of time as theres very few times you actually get to enter the Matrix. Hold your hand too much and feels shallow because of it\n\nThe DLC, Dragonfall, fixes the above problems. It starts a bit linear just like before, but theres multiple ways to clear any area, as well as plenty of time between missions to talk with your fellow Shadowrunners. The plot is much more interesting and there are more ways to use your character's skills, both in the field, and in dialogue choices. The game opens up and you get to start taking missions of your own accord, with each having a small storyline within its own mission.\n\nTheres also a metric crapton of great workshop content out for the game, which I think will add tremendously to the games longevity.\n\nBottomline, buy this game, and buy it with the DLC.","June 28, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The responses for your character in dialogue are varied enough to make it feel like you can actually roleplay a little (which is what a real RPG is, a game you can roleplay). It flows nicely and really makes me think back to all those Pen and Paper sessions.\n\nI honestly didn't experience much in the way of bugs. And now that saving anywhere has been added it is pretty close to Shadowrun Perfection.\n\nI've only had a chance to play Dead Man's Switch so far and I found the story and characters interesting and engaging.

I was pleased with the amount of time I got to spend in the Matrix and the way it was integrated into the gameplay so that it didn't detract from the game for the folks in the real world.

When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.\n\nLet's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.\n\nWhere the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.\n\nThe combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.\n\nThe game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.","May 10, 2014","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spent $10, and would gladly spend $20+ on it. Granted, I am a long-time shadowrun fan, but it's a great game for rpg fans.\n\nWhile the graphics may not be the greatest, and the original story was pretty good at best (the Dragonfall DLC definitely makes up for it, it's another game in itself), what really makes up for it is all the user generated content that is coming out.\n\nA reboot of the snes title was the first project I saw pop up, and have been following since.\nShadowrun Unlimited, is more of a non-linear style of game. I'm only a couple of hours into it, but there is so much more to it than the original game (more cyberware, more programs to be used in cyberspace, etc.), and it has much more replayability (random missions) than the original game.\nThat's just a couple of mods that I've been keeping an eye on, and there's plenty more where those came from.\nIf you like turn-based strategy, with both mystical (magic, dwarves, elves, etc.) and futuristic elements, it's most definitely worth picking up.","May 10, 2014","true","41.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Picture the gameplay of XCOM: Enemies Unknown mixed with a book roleplaying game. AKA Shadowrun. I've roleplayed a lot, although never Shadowrun. But it feels like a nice little adventure. I'd say the game lasts about 12-15 hours. It gets a little slow paced though, it's very text heavy. If it was voice acted I think that would add a lot to it, but I don't fault it for that.\n\nWhen you do get into combat, it plays almost exactly like XCOM. You get action points, 2 to begin with and you can either move or do an action like fight with those points during your turn. It's all turn based strategy on a grid. Overall I didn't find the combat to be very difficult, you hire a team before each mission to go with you but I played a Street Samurai and I was basically bread for combat.\n\nThat leads me to the character creation, I picked a Street Samurai as I mentioned, but you can pick from quite a variety of characters to begin with and tweak them as you play with Karma points. Like leveling up in the book RPG's. These various character choices lead to different dialogue choices and even options on the battlefield. So there is definitely variety and replayability here.\n\nSpeaking on replayability, this game also opens itself up to player stories and mods. You can download and create your own or others stories/adventures. So the game really has no end. It is certainly worth full price, but even better if you get it on sale. I would definitely recommend this game to any Cyberpunk style enthusiasts. If you liked XCOM you will like this combat system. Only gripe is all the reading. It makes me sleepy, but I pressed on and finished the main campaign and really enjoyed it.","July 15, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat in both the real world and while dekking is intuitive and easy to grasp. There are a number of skill tree options to monkey with, but not so many as to require a spreadsheet. Overall I found the game to be a satisfying experience, not terribly difficult, but that's not what I was looking for here anyway.

It is a platform that supports the creation and play of Adventures, both developer and community created. "Dead Man's Switch" is the initial campaign that you get at purchase and is a well constructed adventure. It has almost all the things you might expect to see and hear in a shadow run adventure. The combat is a xcom esque entertaining and at times very challenging. The characters are interested and likeable. The leveling system is more or less an intuitive waterfall setup. Attributes unlock skills, and skills unlock specializations i.e. Quickness[1] -> marksmen[1] -> rifles[1]. Though the game could do better on conveyance in general. Most important though is the adventure is fun and the game mechanics are solid.\n\nI do have minor grips with some of the unanswered mechanics issues and other game play short comings. But before that I can safely say that if you are a fan of shadowrun or have ever enjoyed playing the paper and pen or older SENS games you will enjoy this one.\n\n** My final recommendation: If you like Shadowrun you will like Shadowrun Returns - Dead Man's Switch **\n\n\nNow If you are interested in an runners ranting here are some of my misgivings about the game.\n\n\n-Characters should be persisten between adventures. Starting a new character every adventure is a little disheartening. (This being between Dead Man's Switch and dragonfall)\n\n-Send to stash: sending things to your stash doesn't seem to send said items to your stash.\n\n-Hit Chance: a legendary marksmen shouldn't consistently miss from half a room away just because the target is behind a half cover desk.\n\n-The lack of stealth is a real bummer, coupled with that is the lack of ability to use your etiquettes to aid in undercover stealth sections.\n\n-The absence of a local net on runs to disarm alarms, disrupt communication, shut off lights, lock doors, est. Mostly the disarming alarms before they go off bit.\n\n-Magic is also very spartan in comparison to the physical combat skills and interactions. You can summon spirits at predetermined locations\n\n-Having to run into an enemy or ambush to trigger combat mode is very disconcerting. The ability to freely toggle combat mode would have been greatly appreciated.\n\n-Riggers: Not being able to pilot drones outside of combat is a bit of a disservice to the rigger characters. As setup is a key part to the rigger play style.\n","July 24, 2014","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which is better than feeling like it's one trudge, but you still wish for more.\nThe user created levels and junk you can download are okay, but don't really match up to the same quality as the main campaign. That's just my opinion though. And it may not be quite that replayable, or at least not as much as you'd want it to be. Say you decide to be a Street Samurai. This means you probably wont be decking any computers. And while you'll come across a few situations where it'll help, all it really does is save you some time. Same for speech options. They're rare, and don't really offer any change in the conversation.\n\nBut in the end, I'd still reccomend it. It still has a great short story to tell and a rich atmosphere. I'd say plan on buying the DLC rather than relying on the user created content to get your additional fix, though.

They fight, charm or oustsmart their way around the many dangers of this world with guns, cybertech and magic. The general setting is vibrant and offers a great potential for many stories.\n\nThe official first campaign is good, but the excellency comes from the User Generated Contents, some of which are better than the original game. Shadowrun's online community offers a lot of different storylines that make this game virtually immortal : play as an elf shaman, a troll bruiser, a dwarven mage, an ork street samurai or a human cyber pirate (or any combination of them, or a character of your own design), assemble your team of runners and advance through the myriad of high-quality mods. Each character has its advantages and drawbacks, so a balanced team is often the best option, though sometimes brute force, magic or technological capacity can make the difference.\n\nOn the gameplay, it is rather intuitive : 50% RPG, 50% turn-by-turn tactical fighting (à la X-Com) with varyinng proportions depending on the mod.\n\nSome "classes" are better suited to some roles than others but the progression system allows you to create your own build : do you want your shaman to have proficiency in firearms ?  Do you prefer him to be a pure spellcaster and go mage/shaman ? Do you want him to be extra-tough ? Do prefer to concentrate on invocations and shamanic support spells ? Do you want to sacrifice some of your spellcasting capabilities in favour of cyberware ? All builds are possible and all of them work, with various advantages and drawbacks !\n\nThe different races help for the feel of the game but have ultimately little impact gameplay-wise apart at the very begining or at the very end of a campaign. Choosing to be a tough troll or a gracefull elf will give you some minor changes in starting stats and a different ultimate potential, but for most of the game the different races don't really matter.\n\nOverall, this great game is made awesome thanks to the online community (most of which is here on Steam).","July 25, 2014","true","217.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entire game is rich and full of atmosphere, really setting the mood for the setting it is placed in. The game had me firmly in its grasp the entire time I played it and not once did it let me go, never breaking character or form in a way that jarred me out of the experience.\n\nThe game's character creation is really straight forward and easy to understand and especially flexible, so if you find yourself dislikeing the path you set yourself on but happen to like another class as long as you do so early enough you can more or less cross class and still be rather effective!\n\nThe game is turn based so if that's your stick hop right on in! It's challenging, but not in the punishing way.  I've never had something in the game bad happen to me that was anything less than poor performance on my part. It's never made me feel like I've been cheated out of a win or into a death. Only that I made a stupid move and ended up dead or lossing the battle becuase I failed a requirement.\n\nEvery character I ran into was full of life and unique in their own right, I've never met someone in the game I've even actively disliked! Well, save some of the villians and that was only in the sense of. "Jeez, what a ♥♥♥♥!" Rather than the usual, "Ugh what a cliched loser." The only real complaint I have in the area is that you dont really get to associate much with the some of the npcs. By that I mean become real tight friends with them.

While it's acknowledged that I've done right for him verbally, they dont really give you any discounts or anything.\n\nHeck other than really asking them about their past and getting to be chummy with them you don't really get to interact with them much outside of that, save with the exception of like: Coyote. None of the npcs really give you any discounts and the like. Though if your playing the game right you wont really need the money to be honest.\n\nThough I suppose in the end its only really a minor set back if even one at all, considering that they were very three-d and interactive characters. It was a significant step up from all the two-d card board characters that you get for npcs a lot lately. I could actually feel and even would go so far as to say, loved going back to talk to them on a regular basis.\n\nAnother thing I loved was the fact that I had all sorts of ways to solve any problem I ran into, each class had its own unique way to solve or deal with things that they ran into. Especially out of combat and I rarely ran into a problem that I couldn't solve in muliple ways myself.\n\nI'm going to stop here because I'm more or less fan girl rambling at this point, but seriously if you've got the spare cash to shell out for this game. Do it, it is well worth the price, I've frankly had significantly less fun on sixty dollar games. For fourteen ninty nine this game is a total steal. I can't believe I how lucky I got on the flash sale back with this, I almost feel half  guilty for getting it as low as I did.\n\nBut long story short, the game is great, damn great if you wanna get down to it. I only hope that they pump out more dlc for this. All the content I've played so far is a massive explosion of awesome. Any of you guys still on the edge for trying it just give in. Trust me its worth that price and that much more if you can afford it.","July 25, 2014","true","74.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me it wasn't a big problem since English is not my native language but i think many native-English gamers will find it annoying .\nThe gameplay machanics are good but have small problems that can be annoying at times .Some of them are technical (like when you set the character to overwatch a certain enemy/area and then it goes out of the previously set range and waste a bullet and an AP point) and some of them are design flaws (like being forced to traverse a whole floor in battle mode even if there is no enemy left) .\nFor the game design in general i really wished that the developers have reused the previously visted locations for side-missions to increase the game time and value because in the end this is an RPG game and not COD .\n\nThis game have its flaws but i was able to look past them and enjoy it .That's why i'm recommending it .","July 4, 2014","true","51.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that the game focused on being highly expandable and customizable made me more forgiving of the campaign's shortcomings.\n\nThat being said, the game's pretty good, but still lacking. Some of it in terms of interface, some in terms of design (gameplay). Please note, I played on normal difficulty. The storyline is quaint, the visuals are detailed, and flow overall is smooth and enjoyable.\n\n1) With all the awesome artwork, the protagonist visuals were extremely boring, whatever look I had in mind for my hero was nowhere to be found in the portrait collection. I just gave up in the end and went with a whatever-approach.\n2) The chapter oriented campaign moves the story along nicely, but the linearity(sp?) of the game was disappointing, if you didn't manage your resources well, it's gone. This includes karma (xp).\n3) Moving around when there's no (immediate) combat in combat mode is a chore.\n4) Too many illusionary dialogue choices. Great, but acknowledging it was also an acknowledgement of it's extremely linear gameplay design (like combat, progression, resource allocation and game balance).\n\nUltimately, I think if they fixed a few things, this title would have a been a true A+, and fans would be clamoring for a sequel like crazy. Unfortunately, in it's current state, it's a great experiment to the throwback that is the shadowrun RPG, but that's all.\n\nMaybe some mods would've helped, but the online presence for the game wasn't really there like other games neither. Hopefully they'll come out with some improvements in due time, if not a sequel.","July 5, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gritty, dark, futuristic fantasy setting is portrayed quite well in the game in terms of its art style, environmental design and the text based descriptions of your encounters. By itself the default campaign can seem quite restricted. As though its trying to give you the illusion that your decisions impacts everything differently when its more than likely going to play out the same way. However I was still compelled to go on because I found the story somewhat interesting and simply enjoyed getting engrossed in the world Shadowrun Returns puts you in.  The combat itself is simple but it doesn't seem like it would get repetitive fast for me.\n\nWhat makes this game worth it for me though would be the wide array of user made content I see int he Steam workshop.

Base game introduces you to all the game mechanics and is a good if not particularly deep game. The DLC on the other hand has a great plot that lends credibilty to the various runs your crew goes on, some great twists and turns, er, and also has some battles that are (potentially) cruelly unfair, awful, and frustrating.\n\nI just had trouble with the one battle, but I read that others had trouble with one or two others. I expect that it depends on play style and the party you bring. The battles often have some sort of interesting twist or surprise that makes them really interesting, but depending on your party and playstyle the same twist can make it very frustrating instead. Maybe the occasional rage quit is the price you pay for the cool surprises. :)\n\nIn summary:\na) strongly recommended, worth buying just to play the DLC, and\nb) AUGH. AUGH AUGH AUGH. AUGH MMMWAAAH!

The content is well written and fits the universe it's set in.  The combat is fun, if a bit less than challenging and less common then you'd hope.\n\nThe game does feel a bit "on rails", however, especially when compared to the games it harkens back to.  This isn't the utter gigantism of something like Baldur's Gate.  The game is pretty small, the party options are limited (you only get to allocate stats and alter the inventory of the main character, for example).\n\nI bought SRR during the steam summer sale.

It's a little old, and if you're looking for graphics and cosmetics, go elsewhere, cause those are things you won't find here.  But it has everything else.  Lots of interactivity, like you just don't find:  a lot of the decisions you make for how you say things are just your own flair, don't make a difference, but decisions you make in game impact things early on and forward.  Some of these decisions, naturally, Shadowrun being a logical universe, require you to be able to do it-- so if you don't have the skill in question high enough, it's not an option-- but not to worry, there are more than two ways to skin a cat sometimes, and there's pretty much always going to be more than one.  Sometimes, that involves creativity- like buying coffee if you figure out a solution for a street junkie who wants more money than you (may) have, even if you talk him down in price (though you might have enough) but is too out of it to be able to get down to the cafe for himself, so, insert errand, you pay less than you would have doing it straightforwardly-- though it's the future, and real coffee is still pretty pricey (for coffee).\n\nYou get money multiple ways for different things, including of course selling loot-- but so far in my playing the game there's more of an emphasis on selling mission items, specifically software you stole, and by completing jobs and/or tasks.\n\nTasks:  this is also how you level up.  In this game, trust me from the start, you *really* want to explore the world around you.  There are people to interact with you, and as often as not, the things they want from you can give you a karma point.  You don't know what will give you karma points, but it's not hard enough to figure out looking around and seeing things you can help people with helps.  Karma would seem an odd name for the resource for levelling, but it's actually not, because you can do things like get a junkie help-- which you hear more about later if you do.  Again, you can pick how you go about getting her to get help, too:   do you play it higher-than-thou, at least that's how I see it, do you talk logic to her, do you scare her-- you might have to do two of those at least, actually, but I only played through once.  Just on the earlier point.\n\nBut back to karma.  You get karma for beating mission objectives, which again do not just come up without chatting, looking into things and such, clicking on things to figure out what's going on in the world around you-- if interactivity does not appeal to you, this is not the game for you; it is not simply fighting.  If it does, it's more complicated than I make it sound in experience, because there are so many different things to interact with... it would be hard to categorize.  *Ahem!*  You explore, you complete tasks, you get karma....\n\n... and you level up!!  Leveling up takes up a lot of karma, and there's a whole lot to level up, so you have to pick and choose, but a lot of it you're just going to forget about anyway, because your character isn't specialized in hacking- oh you included that?  S/he is a super crappy fighter then, at least as far as I've gotten, but okay, that's what you get when you want to hack computers instead of being a gunslinger.\n\nI kinda didn't like the extensive use of spell-like systems in this game to start with, but now that I've gotten more used to it, I just want to go all out when I have the credits and buy like everything and use it all.   The spell-systems are different, though they don't all get called that (there are three of them) and they're not as out of place as you may be thinking.  If you read about the game, bear in mind, there are guns and computers and hackers, but there are also trolls and ogres and dragons.  Just sayin'.\n\nOh.... the dragons are bad*** and you literally don't mess with them.  Taking down a dragon takes an army, not a small unit, generally speaking, and in this futuristic society the dragons wiped out large bodies of people before getting taken out... not all of them have been.   All of this is in the lifetime-recent past of the living, some of it having started *it's true* since after the game came out, presumably, but at any rate also before 2014, which is when I'm writing this.\n\nMan, I've spent a fortune it seems on MMOs that I got sick of.... this game cost me under $5 while on sale and I can't get enough of it so far.  I'll get tired of it, too, but I'm definitely looking for another game for nothing again when I get tired of it... graphics aren't bad for being old and cheap budget, and I like reading the text better than listening, but oh, there is a lot of reading, did I say that?  lol... you have to read the conversations, no voice acting... it's all low-budget... just straight-up good creativity is what makes it such an awesome game.  Modding community too, though I haven't tried their work yet, no reason-- still playing through my first campaign.\n\nSo I highly recommend this game.... it should run on your computer if it's not a fossil, though I could be wrong, and I apologize if so.... this is the first review I've written for Steam, and the game definitely deserved some "credits."\n\nUniverse is scifi, if you missed that part, looks a lot cheesier than it is.  Lots of effects and ways to acheive them, grenades for instance that do different things, robots that do different things-- you have seriously limitied inventory, but you've got a killer size stash, so the limit is on missions (you can keep as much as you like, there's nothing there specifiying an inventory limit on your stash.)\n\nTo tell the truth, there are still things I haven't figured out how to do in game yet, or if there's a way to do them (I'm pretty sure I level my own team too, but I don't know how-- or even how to switch out their gear) but there's a help me section I've been having way too much of a blast to wade through lmao.... I don't have the credits right now to buy Igger a new gun anyway lol.\n\nYou have time after every mission involving fighting to wander around town and do more missives that are just interaction and figuring stuff out (nothing requiring a high IQ, don't worry-- just be curious, that'll get you more than far enough), during which time you can stock up on supplies, sell stuff, tip a dancer, that kind of thing... have a cup of soykaf!  Woo-hoo! lololol....\n\nWorld:  Well-drawn.  It's like reading a good book, really.  There's stuff happening, nothing boring, lots, and I mean lots, of drama, nevermind you're a cold-hearted professional cutthroat, you care about sentiment because everybody does in reality and so therefore do you.  You may be bad***, and your team too, but you all care.... I'm only a little way in but I play this game for interacting with a world in more ways than one, with real results (albeit it's a game xD), and not so much so for adrenaline rushes or combat.  Gear is great-- not just armor and weapons, but lots of other stuff too.  You can replace limbs with robotic parts, use different-purpose grenades (including shrapnel xD), use medkits and trauma kits (the latter bring you back to life from a near-death encounter, but you don't have much inventory-- just 7 slots-- so it's not like this makes everything peachy.).. lots else\n\nAnyway, the characters are all different, it's not like your team consists of the same 5 people, per se, though your party expands in time- they all have personalities, and they don't all feel exactly the same toward you, and while most of them follow your leadership as far as I've gotten, there are differences that come up-- after something adverse, one of them wants to share alcohol with you (which gives you a choice-- do I drink in this game?  there are more than just two answers).  Naturally there are limits to how much impact you have on storlyine six times in a single conversation, don't get me wrong-- but usually, if I think about it, so's life.  -noroom","June 29, 2014","true","237.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite aspect was just the atmosphere. I'm into that techy almost post-apocalyptic feel. Everything was edgy and I really felt I had to rely on my wits and street knowledge. However I was really confused about the classes and karma upgrades. I felt like I needed to take some time to sit down and go through each section to understand what upgrades were good to get or worthless for my character. Another issue was probably the fact that you'd have a big advantage being a decker. A bunch of quests had only special decker options. Since I wasn't playing as a decker, I could almost never take those options. In general a lot of character development felt a bit off and weighed to one or two specific classes. I might try some of the workshop stories and see how those go, but all in all, I had a lot of fun, but it just stopped abruptly.","June 29, 2014","true","61.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Isometric RPGs have been rapidly winning my heart back even since ME 3 and this one was a fresh change from the normal recipe.\n\nThe skill system is nicely portrayed, gameplay is fun and with a lot of choices and the story brilliant enough to keep you invested ( don't expect crazy or unexpected plot twists here )\n\nMy two major cons here are the general linearity of the game , which doesn't allow much on the exploration department and the lack of plentiful side quests (which probably goes side by side with my first complain) This game CRIES for side questing and the characters it introduces are SO WELL portrayed that it's arguably a crime that there is no further development with them or some involving quests to further enjoy them in action (Coyote's quest for example should have been done for more characters!) There is your occasional side quest , but they are SOOO few that it makes you feel sad moving on to the next chapter like this. Finally i was REALLY bummed by the length of the main campaign .. I mean okay i understand that you guys were betting on the UGC (user generated content) to maximize replayability but really that short ??? You could have made an at least +20 hours on the Dead man's switch . Oh well..\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful Skill system\n+ Fun Gameplay\n+ Enjoyable story\n\nCons:\n- Too Linear (for an RPG)\n- Very few side quests\n- Main campaign TOO BLOODY SHORT!\n\nAll in all did i fully enjoy this game?

The visuals and art-style look very nice and I love the cyberpunk themed setting. Combat mechanics are very simplistic and work similar to xcom games, but its rpg elements are very in-depth and enough to compensate for its simplistic combat gameplay.\n\nThe highlight of this game for me is its story-telling.

The combat was refreshing and very fun.  It had fleeting little story but I was intrigued by it nonetheless.\n\nIt's funny how much of a 180 this game is compared to the spinoff.\n\nThe combat is an ersatz XCOM and not really satisfying.  I played on normal so of course I wasn't playing the game to its full potential.  The combat was pretty boring and felt like an afterthought.\n\nBUT WAIT!  This game doesn't suck!  In huge contrast to the only other Shadowrun game I have played this game has a story!  And what a story it is.  The plot is positively enthralling (hehe).  Sorry you'll get it when you buy this magnificent game.    The plot is split into two acts, of which the first I believe is stronger.  The first act is a pretty standard whodunit and the second is... I don't know if I missed out on some backstory from the tabletop game, but it's a lot to take in.  But sometimes it's nice to be overwhelmed by a story, you know?  The characters, dialogue and text descriptions (setting, items, etc.) is really where the game shines.  The characters are interesting (I found myself talking to every single one at every opportunity) and feel real.  Their personalities don't feel fake and nobody does a complete character change halfway through as an excuse for a plot twist which is common in games.  The dialogue is witty and enjoyable.  Sadly there are no voice actors, but it doesn't take away too much from the immersion.\n\nThere's just something special about the written word and its power to completely immerse you in a story.  The writers for this game are truly skilled, as the settings described are so much more than what I could ever gain from just seeing it.  There's such a huge emphasis on graphics these days that I think people get caught up in it and forget that sight is only one of many senses.  The written word describes all of them.  Sight, smell, sound, touch, you name it and it can be described.  I hope this game succeeds and more developers join this niche of text-based RPG, as there is truly no better way to immerse the player than to write down what you want them to know.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 but it is really a must buy for me.  The story itself makes the game well worth the price when it's on sale.","June 27, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in an alternative history future where magic has returned to the world, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orks live side by side with humans in dense urban cities, and corporations are a law unto themselves; the game centers around the segment of humanity who makes their living in the shadows, the runners. Hacker, mercenary, detective, sorcerer, where there is a job that needs doing, there will be someone willing to get paid to do it.\n\nThe game itself is a single player, turn-based strategy RPG, utilizing 3/4 isometric perspective with 3D character models set against sprite based backgrounds. The sprite backgrounds are static and well done, while the character designs are somewhat poorly textured with resolution below that which the majority of modern systems could easily handle; belying the limited budget the company had to work with. Gameplay takes the form of point and click interaction with the world map and carries over directly into combat, utilizing the same environments. Combat is somewhat klunky, as there are problems with the interaction of the courser and corners of the movement field.\n\nThe game itself is, however, merely a platform. It is in reality intended for players to build and share their own Shadowrun campaigns, and the full game editor comes included with the base game as well as a professionally developed campaign. Thanks to Steam Works, player campaigns are free, though professionally developed campaigns will be sold as DLC as they become available. Sadly there is no multiplayer option what-so-ever, crippling one of the intregral elements of the pen-and-paper game.\n\nOverall, the game's campaign will run you around 12 hours, and is a good buy if you can get it on sale, for any enthusiast of turn-based strategy RPGs.","July 1, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just wish there was a way to respecc. Maybe there is later in the game.\nI love the tactical, turn-based combat.\nCons The single angle of the camera gets a little annoying in combat; e.g. if you've got an ally standing directly beneath/infront of an enemy, you can accidentally target your ally because their hitbox overlaps the enemy's. If I could rotate the camera to a different angle, that'd solve my biggest gripe with the game\nThe first campaign (Dead Man's Switch) is interesting, but rather slow-paced. Haven't tried the expansion campgain or any of the user generated content yet.\nAll in all, it's a fun tactical, turn-based, text-driven RPG. The character creation options are pretty robust -- not so much in terms of appearances, but in terms of class selection and creation. It's easy to start out with one of the game's premade archetypes and expand out into other disciplines as you get the feel for the game, or to just stick with a single discipline. I don't know how well either works comparatively because I haven't played long enough. The story of the first campaign moves a little slow; they do a good job of tying the tutorial stuff into the story without breaking immersion, but that's kind of what slows it down.","July 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although it lacks in the free roaming aspect that many RPG’s do well in the story is extremely immersive and the characters are interesting and at times frustrating. The old-school isometric view lends itself well to Shadowrun and the lighting when in urban areas sets a great tone for the dark cyber punk world the game is set in.  The character creation isn’t quite deep enough in regards to ascetics but more than makes up for this in the skill tree and I found myself fiddling with the skills for ages whilst envisioning what kind of cyber punk badass I was going to be. The combat is turn based which I found very refreshing, as I am a massive fan of turn based strategy games, and I found the whole process of finding cover and blasting the enemy very entertaining.\nTo sum up if you’re not a fan of deep story driven games with lots of text and long spells between the action then this game isn’t for you, although I would recommend anyone to embark on this story……you won’t be sorry.\n","July 7, 2014","true","41.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals and art-style look very nice and I love the cyberpunk themed setting. Combat mechanics are very simplistic and work similar to xcom games, but its rpg elements are very in-depth and enough to compensate for its simplistic combat gameplay.\n\nThe highlight of this game for me is its story-telling. If you don't mind reading (there are no voice actors) and enjoy a good sci-fi conspiracy story (think deus ex) you will enjoy this!","June 27, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat was refreshing and very fun.  It had fleeting little story but I was intrigued by it nonetheless.\n\nIt's funny how much of a 180 this game is compared to the spinoff.\n\nThe combat is an ersatz XCOM and not really satisfying.  I played on normal so of course I wasn't playing the game to its full potential.  The combat was pretty boring and felt like an afterthought.\n\nBUT WAIT!  This game doesn't suck!  In huge contrast to the only other Shadowrun game I have played this game has a story!  And what a story it is.  The plot is positively enthralling (hehe).  Sorry you'll get it when you buy this magnificent game.    The plot is split into two acts, of which the first I believe is stronger.  The first act is a pretty standard whodunit and the second is... I don't know if I missed out on some backstory from the tabletop game, but it's a lot to take in.  But sometimes it's nice to be overwhelmed by a story, you know?  The characters, dialogue and text descriptions (setting, items, etc.) is really where the game shines.  The characters are interesting (I found myself talking to every single one at every opportunity) and feel real.  Their personalities don't feel fake and nobody does a complete character change halfway through as an excuse for a plot twist which is common in games.  The dialogue is witty and enjoyable.  Sadly there are no voice actors, but it doesn't take away too much from the immersion.\n\nThere's just something special about the written word and its power to completely immerse you in a story.  The writers for this game are truly skilled, as the settings described are so much more than what I could ever gain from just seeing it.  There's such a huge emphasis on graphics these days that I think people get caught up in it and forget that sight is only one of many senses.  The written word describes all of them.  Sight, smell, sound, touch, you name it and it can be described.  I hope this game succeeds and more developers join this niche of text-based RPG, as there is truly no better way to immerse the player than to write down what you want them to know.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 but it is really a must buy for me.  The story itself makes the game well worth the price when it's on sale.","June 27, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can make whatever kind of character you want. My character used nothing but his fists and knuckle weapons and he ended up being a badass knocking security bots out with a single punch. The combat itself is awesome, fast paced and controls really well. One thing that I noticed though was I feel like the percentages are a little off for the accuracy ratings, I feel like I've rarely hit anything lower than 60 percent.\n\nStory - 4.5/5\n\nThis is a review of the Dragonfall story. You follow a group of shadowrunners led by your character, and the game really makes you familiar with everyone. All species of sentient beings have their own ways of speaking and there are very little stereotypical characters. Strong female leads, strong male leads, and all around strong side characters. Dead Man's Switch overplayed the in world slang a little bit too much, but Dragonfall made it very easy to get what certain words mean.\n\nOverall: 4/5","June 23, 2014","true","59.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, I give it a massive yes. If you enjoy tabletop RPGs, cyberpunk, or science-fantasy... get this. It's not without it's flaws however.\n\nShadowrun Returns - The game engine is a powerful story creation tool, and it's simple to use as far as these things go. However, there are some interface issues during gameplay, as I made accidental moves on more than one occasion. But overall, it's a solid game engine that will provide many dozens of hours of fun with custom stories and the steam workshop.\n\nDead Man's Switch - Let me start by saying that it's not very interactive. The world is well built through text and visuals, but you can't really do much with it. Any actual role playing comes in with your dialog options, rather than your behaviour in the world or choices in the story progression. If you don't mind a very scripted RPG experience then this story is really good. In fact, it's better than good, the writing is just amazing. It was like an interactive novel in some ways, with well written dialog, a "page turner" of a story, and great world building. I knew little about the Shadowrun universe before this game, and now I feel like I've just paid a visit to it.\n\nAs a whole, Shadowrun Returns is an excellent bargain purchase for the price that will please tabletop, Shadowrun, and story rich RPG fans.\nWhat the frag are you waiting for!?

Did you guys play some new XCOM recently? can you imagine a decker across the street in another bulding maybe with a sniper and a squad fighting their way up to be in a cross fire another runner team on another mission. will it be enemy of my enemy or just another target.","June 18, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first think I noticed was that without going into the settings, movement of my mouse from the game to my desktop was seamless.  As I went on, I noticed other little things that I normally needed to tweak, I didn't.  They just worked.  But more importantly, as I went on, I was transported to a time many years ago in the story, in the environment, in the game play.  If you loved Shadowrun on the SNES, you'll love this.  And if you didn't know about it, you'll find a new love.  The best Kickstarter I've backed, and one of the best games that I've played.

It serves as an introduction to the mechanics and, to a much lesser extent, the setting of Shadowrun.  The DLC/expansion Dragonfall, however, is absolutely fantastic, and is completely unrelated to the core campaign.  It's one of the better written RPGs I've ever played.  The characters are great, the story is interesting, the decisions are difficult, and although the "epilogue" is a little weak, the overall ending was solid.

I knew that it was based off a classic sci-fi tabletop RPG, but that was about it.\n\nThe first campaign, The Deadman's Switch, draws you into the world of Shadowrun very well, introduces you to some characters, and generally how the game works and feels. It's a nice introduction to the game, but it does have a few things that annoyed and irked me. Especially the linearity of it all. It was one story the whole way through, with not many different ways to approach things, or side quests to take up your time.\n\nThat's why I recommend getting the Dragonfall expansion with it. I've played the expansion for three or four hours at this point, and all of my problems with the original game have been taken care of, as far as I can tell. There are a lot more things put in place to sidetrack you, and I really like that.\n\nBut, there's also the horde of player created content that the game allows access to, and that could provide a lot more gameplay than the original campaign allows for, therefore not necessarily making the Dragonfall expansion worth it, but I recommend it none-the-less.","June 28, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.\n\nThe heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than "pretty good."\n\nBut where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.\n\nWhere Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film.

There are some real problems with it, but, despite that, I'd still recommend it to anyone who's thinking of giving it a chance.\n\nGameplay is linear and there are some inherent flaws in the design, for instance the tendency of attacks to roll Missed despite your actual stats. If I did a count, I'm fairly sure the number of times the characters missed surpass the times they actually land a hit. It got ridiculous to the point that I'd get misses 3 times in a row at point blank range. This makes for very frustrating play especially at the endgame portion. There's also an impression of unbalanced design considering that certain builds came off more useful than others. Party members builds seem to have no impact either outside of battles and a certain plot mission. I could have a decker in my party but not be able to do any side decking other than what was neccesary to move the game forward, it made party build up rather pointless and lackluster.\n\nOn the upside, it's rather well-written and the characters in-game are rather engaging and interesting. I'm not too familiar with the Shadowrun tabletop but I am a fan of the setting. You can see much effort has gone into the game and the end result is rather polished. The game is, overall, a good effort from an indie developer and while not great, is a decent experience and has lots of potential for the future.","October 21, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I like Shadowrun lore and ambiance, so I gave it a shot. I played Shadowrun when it came out for SNES.\n\nNow: I would cathegorize this game as an "interaction novel". Most of the players wanted a sandbox or at least some freedom, but this is no game for that. This game tells a story where you are involved in. There are some RPG aspects like leveling and building your character, but that is not the core of the game (I think).\n\nIf you are looking for a short sci-fi story you can play, then go ahead, I recommend this game. If you are a Shadowrun stories fan, then you should give it a try too.\n\nIf you are looking for an action game, a sandbox or a game where you can choose where to go, then this is not a game for you.\n\nIt has click adventure parts, it has tactical turn-based parts, but the core is the story. Some player have said the story is sh$%#".

The Checkpoint system bugged many, and I thought it would get on my nerves when I first read of it but in the end it didnt bother me at all.\nThe game has a variety of bugs but after I beat it last week they've already patched many of them.\n\nThe music was made by the guy that made the music for the SNES game aswell as the guy that made the music for the Genesis/Megadrive game set in the Shadowrun world so they know their stuff.\nThe graphics are Both beautiful but in terms of animations on the characters, sort of stiff.\nSo the battles tend to look abit worse than when youre just walking around the world in awe of the neon glory that is the Shadowrun world.\n\nThe battle system is very close to the one in the 2012 Xcom remake so all is good there.\nWhere the game really shines is it's storytelling and characters. The writers did a damn good job and created a world that really pulled me in. I'm usually not one to play games just for its story, but if you are then this is a great one.\n\nThe game is definately flawed but hopefully those flaws are worked out over time, and even if they aint, none of them ever really took me out of the experience.

The combat was refreshing and very fun.  It had fleeting little story but I was intrigued by it nonetheless.\n\nIt's funny how much of a 180 this game is compared to the spinoff.\n\nThe combat is an ersatz XCOM and not really satisfying.  I played on normal so of course I wasn't playing the game to its full potential.  The combat was pretty boring and felt like an afterthought.\n\nBUT WAIT!  This game doesn't suck!  In huge contrast to the only other Shadowrun game I have played this game has a story!  And what a story it is.  The plot is positively enthralling (hehe).  Sorry you'll get it when you buy this magnificent game.    The plot is split into two acts, of which the first I believe is stronger.  The first act is a pretty standard whodunit and the second is... I don't know if I missed out on some backstory from the tabletop game, but it's a lot to take in.  But sometimes it's nice to be overwhelmed by a story, you know?  The characters, dialogue and text descriptions (setting, items, etc.) is really where the game shines.  The characters are interesting (I found myself talking to every single one at every opportunity) and feel real.  Their personalities don't feel fake and nobody does a complete character change halfway through as an excuse for a plot twist which is common in games.  The dialogue is witty and enjoyable.  Sadly there are no voice actors, but it doesn't take away too much from the immersion.\n\nThere's just something special about the written word and its power to completely immerse you in a story.  The writers for this game are truly skilled, as the settings described are so much more than what I could ever gain from just seeing it.  There's such a huge emphasis on graphics these days that I think people get caught up in it and forget that sight is only one of many senses.  The written word describes all of them.  Sight, smell, sound, touch, you name it and it can be described.  I hope this game succeeds and more developers join this niche of text-based RPG, as there is truly no better way to immerse the player than to write down what you want them to know.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 but it is really a must buy for me.  The story itself makes the game well worth the price when it's on sale.","June 27, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat system flows great, it really keeps your interest. The writing is amazing, it feels like I am reading a good novel at times.

And while the character development is solid for most of the characters that are a part of the story, I really wish I could interact more with the runners I hire, a one sentence description of the character does not do them justice.\n\nBecause of this game I am looking into playing the Pen and Paper Shadowrun as well.

Its fun to make your character however you'd like them, and the skills are laid out in a straightforward way. Spell variety leaves a little bit left to be desired, and I personally wouldve liked greater variety for implants, but is all in all very solid.\n\nStoryline for the default game, called "The Deadman's Switch" is boring and linear, and you dont spend a long enough amount of downtime to talk to and connect with your party members. Also playing a decker is a waste of time as theres very few times you actually get to enter the Matrix. Hold your hand too much and feels shallow because of it\n\nThe DLC, Dragonfall, fixes the above problems. It starts a bit linear just like before, but theres multiple ways to clear any area, as well as plenty of time between missions to talk with your fellow Shadowrunners. The plot is much more interesting and there are more ways to use your character's skills, both in the field, and in dialogue choices. The game opens up and you get to start taking missions of your own accord, with each having a small storyline within its own mission.\n\nTheres also a metric crapton of great workshop content out for the game, which I think will add tremendously to the games longevity.\n\nBottomline, buy this game, and buy it with the DLC.","June 28, 2014","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the setting and I think that for the most part they did a great job creating the world. However while it looks great it often feels like a set rather than a living city. Every place you go plays out more or less the same. Click the 2 or 3 people with talk symbols over their head, look for the 1 or 2 items that you can click on the map somewhere, fight a few guys, leave area. I like the world, I want to be able to go around and explore it and have a reason to do so. Even if it is just flavor text like "You see a grimy computer terminal, you can tell it has been well used" for example. I want to be able to go around and look at everything and just explore.\n\nThe world graphics are great for the most part. There are a few things that really take me out of it like the quick loop of papers blowing in the wind over and over. The birds that fly off when you walk by are great though. My biggest gripe with the graphics is that the characters rarely look anything like their super awesome avatar pictures. I see a big orc character and when I walk up to him his avatar picture is of a skinny orc. The avatar picture I made for my guy is very thin but his character model is chunky with a way different head. Just pulls me out of the story.\n\nI like the story and I like the characters. It was well written and kept me interested. Even the loading screen text telling me about the place I was heading was great. I do wish that there was less travel here travel there though. I just get interested in an area and nope off to the next place. Maybe if rather than quick traveling everywhere there were inbetween areas with optional side stuff to do then all the traveling around would feel more cohesive.\n\nI have not played the official DLC mission yet so maybe they fixed some of my problems with it. Despite the problems, I do recommend the game if for nothing else other than the story and great setting. I really hope we get something more expansive in this universe someday though.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll start by saying the developers really did the Shadowrun name a lot of justice with this release. Basically a party-based tactical RPG set in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. It really nails that futuristic, dystopian vibe I look for in this type of story. The gameplay is very enjoyable and you'll have a lot of fun leveling up your character in the main campaign. The options for character development and customization are pretty solid.\n\nMy only complaint is - the main campaign is too short. Sure, you can get Dragonfall (the expansion) for another $15, and that is much bigger than the original campaign... but the stock capaign just sort of disappointed me. I also felt like it was a bit too linear. I was expecting a LOT more side-missions and stuff like that to help me develop my character before the endgame. I wouldn't let that deter you from buying the game, but I would set aside a little extra money for that expansion - first.\n\nSome would argue that the Workshop has player-made campaigns in case you get bored with the one that comes with the game, but I find it tedious sifting through mountains of crap to find a decent player-made campaign. Most of them suffer from the "Oh here's part 1....part 2.... part 3... And you have to download them all seperately.. oh but im not done with part 4, and I quit working on it cause I got bored.." It's just annoying. Same thing as most any game that comes with a toolkit... most of the player developed content is half-arsed.\n\nAnyway, I don't want the review to sound too negative because I actually did really enjoy the 20+ hours I've spent with Shadowrun Returns, and I'd recommend it to my friends - As long as they can afford to buy Dragonfall with it.","July 11, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat has enough tactical depth to keep you on your toes, but the real strength to this game is the story. The dialogue between characters is both interesting and meaningful, often making use of slang specific to the Shadowrun universe which aids immersion. The game does feel quite linear at times and conversational options are often inconsequential, but it doesn't detract from the experience thanks to engaging storyline. I'm genuinely surprised at the quality of the game, especially when consideration is given to the asking price.

However, I would find myself playing Dragonfall again.\n\nSo what I did not like was the lack of cyberware and game options, but the campaign was great.

This new game not only is a worthy follow-up, but a true sequel!  Shadowrun Returns improves on all the shortcomings SNES players had to tolerate, as well as bringing the game into the modern age.  For a budget game especially, everything about this game is well balanced.  The hand-drawn graphics are slick and the lighting is pretty and immersive.  Character development is satisfying and the story is truly interesting and perfect for the world of Shadowrun.\n\nThe only aspects of this game that reveal its price tag are the limited sound effects, character art and voice dialogue.

Besides, the core of the game is true and enjoyable, the limited art is beautiul and detailed, and the action is as polished as the latest X-Com game (which is also a treat.)

And let's not forget how well Berlin lends itself to cyberpunk !\nIf you're hesitating on getting the game or the Berlin DLC, I say go for it.","June 25, 2014","true","69.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is what a modern traditional RPG plays like and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nGoing out on a limb here, but if there ever was an MMO of Shadowrun, I think I would play it forever.

If that's not you cup of tea, go find a game where the protagonist has three love intrests he doesn't even notice in between beating up spiders and panther bear robots in his quest to slay god.

Dragonfall Campaign is REALLY good by the by. This editor is just maddening with the amount of stuff you can put into it. Completely free to write whatever, answers the players can choose from, map, tile, and prop placement. You can get damn creative with it.

I've never reviewed one before, but I think this a real hidden gem. The graphics are lush and immersive, player creation is simple but very detailed. The abilities, classes, and combat are very true to the paper and pencil Shadowrun RPG (which is great). NPC dialog and dialog response options are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. They really went all out with this one, even more impressive because it was made by a realtively small developer (I'm going to look for more games from Harbrained after playing this).\nBest feature of all though, great TURN-BASED rpg combat. Reminiscent of some of the best rpgs ever made, but with gorgeous graphics thrown in. I would recommend the Dragonfall scenario too, just because this game is so good, one story isn't enough!\nAlso, I got the core game on sale for just $5, literally best five dollars I've ever spent!\nThe dev team really hit it out of the park on this one, I'll be looking for more of your games and any future kickstarters you do, please keep up the amazing work!","May 5, 2014","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trnbutcher/recommended/234650/","trnbutcher","trn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trnbutcher/","90 products in account","Picked this up on offer this Bank Holiday weekend and have really enjoyed it. I have yet to explore the additional content (which looks really good) so this refers only to the main campaign 'Dead Man's Switch'. I enjoyed the Shadowrun universe, the characters were almost consistently interesting, the dialogue options fun and there was enough variety on offer to warrant two or three play-throughs (well, almost three, more on that later). In fact, this game has inspired me to learn more about Shadowrun - a marketing success, for sure!\n\nCharacter creation allows for a lot of customisation, either from one of the standard templates or free-form (the latter allows some creative combinations once you've got the hang of the gameplay mechancis). While there is a lot of replayability in character classes (you'll have a different experience as an Adept than as a Decker, for instance) it struck me that my playthrough as a decker (who can hack into the 'Matrix' and fight additional combat scenarios within computer programmes) allowed greater access to content and secrets. A shame as I did feel the game was sort of pushing me to play as a decker, and while this is an interesting and challenging character class, it limits your access to combat and magic specialisations.\n\nMy main criticisms are that even a year after release I kept encountering bugs - including a major game-breaking bug that meant I could not finish a level. In short, it simply would not end combat or allow me to initiate dialogue at one point, even when the combat was over and dialogue bubbles were above people's heads. This was a pain and recurred again even after a level restart. Other criticisms were niggling and broke the immersion rather than the game - playing as a troll, for instance, didn't change dialogue options to a playthrough as a human or as an elf - which was a shame (bar one person calling me a racist name) and I'd loved to have used the in-game mechanic of building your own gang to go on more than just main plot missions. A couple of side missions could have helped me diversify my character build, get some better equipment and feel more prepared to take on the end of game boss on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe game itself is focused on a single short story (took me about 8 hours the first time, 5-6 after that) which felt more like an introduction to the universe than a standalone game, which is an odd design decision, but it did mean I finished the game eager for more - rather than with a 'more traditional rpg' like Baldur's Gate where I tend to get fed up well before the finale. While this focus meant a satisfying resolution to the compelling storyline, it also meant there were no side missions, no additional content and limited opportunities for exploration. While additional content looks to rectify this, most involve creating new characters, so those I created for Dead Man's Switch won't be coming with me.\n\ntl;dr - Great, immersive, colourful and engaging game that I'd rate 3.5-4/5. This score would be higher if the game was longer, featured greater variety outside combat, had opportunities for exploration and a few more side missions and didn't have game breaking bugs this long after release!","May 5, 2014","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
