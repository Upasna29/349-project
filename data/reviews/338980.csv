"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/338980/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","MOAI is another Time Management game from the guys over at Alawar. This time your character is stranded on an uncharted island and must work with a tribe of natives to restore their island and make your way back home.  It's a fun premise which is enhanced by storytelling sequences between each level and a simple narrative that adds some meat to an already enjoyable game.\n\nAs with other titles in the genre, the gameplay is pretty standard and consists of multi-tasking activites as efficiently as possible while managing resources to complete specific tasks (build, gather, etc.).  Coming up with the best strategy to complete the objectives in record time can be quite challenging, but not impossible once you determine your strategy and execute it well. If Gold (3 coins) is a little too stressful for you and you're wanting to go more casual, Silver is easily doable on most levels, and snagging Bronze a cinch.  I don't think you can fail a level without actively trying to fail it, so there's not a ton of pressure if you just want to play through for the story and artwork.\n\nAnd the artwork is indeed a reason to play through the game.  MOAI's presentation is REALLY well done.  The art has a nice hand painted look to it with high quality story CG's that are both colorful and creative.  The story narration is also full English voiced and the narrator nicely acted.  While the story itself seems a bit random at times, often being just enough to link each stage together, the writing is polished and even quite humorous.  Music-wise, I found the Disney-esque orchestral soundtrack a highlight, enough so that I wish there were a DLC or music tracks included as an extras, but I'll just have to live with listening to it while I play.\n\nWith full Steam integration including 53 Steam achievements, Trading Cards and Cloud Support, if you're a fan of the genre you really can't go wrong here. These things add a ton of value to any game on the platform, but for casual titles they're almost a must and are a very welcome addition.  MOAI is definitely one of the better Time Management games I've played and has handily exceeded my expectations. I will be sure to 100% this gem and enjoy every moment of it.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for those who enjoy strategic, time-based gameplay, but will also appeal to more casual players with its storytelling and high level of polish.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.","February 26, 2015","true","20.7"," 138 of 171 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","138","171","6","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/338980/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4610 products in account","Nice time management / casual building and strategy game. It follows a formula along the lines of other such game but does a bit better job at mixing things up and constantly adding new game play elements than some other similar games.\n\nThere are 64 levels that have three different time goals to meet each giving progressively lower score, which in turn will effect how quickly you can meet several of the achievements.\n\nSpeaking of which, there 53 achievements in this game fully integrated into Steam which is more than most casual games tend to have. Achievement hunts will definitely appreciate that. I found that the achievements motivated me to keep going and to replay levels with different play styles that I might not have otherwise done.\n\nThough it's not required, meeting the quickest time goal and getting all three coins for a level can be quite challenging and required a bit of planning and strategy. You'll probably have to replay a level multiple times to do that as you really need to run through each level at least once to get a feel for what works and what doesn't, particularly once you've dived in past some of the earlier levels.\n\nVisuals are all really well done and look great in 1080p on a monitor. There's a story that's told between levels with narrated still cut scenes and also in text boxes by various island companions who are helping you on your journey. It's a nice touch be really the main thrust of the game is resource management and building and then optionally managing your time should you choose to challenge yourself or want to go for the achievements.\n\nOverall I was pleased with MOAI and found good entry in the casual time management and building genre. If that's your cup of tea or you're looking for a lighter, low stress game to take a break MOAI would be a good choice.","February 28, 2015","true","7.6"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","29","40","2","1"

You play as a westerner who is stuck on a tropical island, and have to guide them through building huts, gathering resources etc..\nThe game is narrated by a relaxed male voice who guides you through the simple story. As you proceed the challenge becomes higher, starting with simple tasks like 'gather 200 food' but later on introducing obstacles like bandits and ghosts. The story makes it all fit in the world though.\n\nMOAI has a nice art style with vibrant colours that make each level nice to look at, without hiding the various clickable spots from view. The soundtrack is relaxing and never gets in the way.\n\nAlawar has a lot of time management games out and it's obvious they've mastered the genre by now. MOAI is another example, design-wise it is perfectly balanced.\n\nIt has Steam achievements, trading cards, and Steam cloud support for saves.\n\nThe only real negative remark I have, and it's a tiny one, is that I can't get it to run maximized on a single 1920x1080 window, instead I either have to play it full-screen with other monitors blanked; or windowed at what seems to be 1440x900.\n\nDefinitely earns a positive recommendation.","July 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The story itself is okay even though it isn't one of those stories that tends stick with you.\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are no actual difficulty choice selection but each of the levels has their own difficulty.\n\nThis is a time/resource management game. So there's a timer presence throughout the entire game. The time on game's timer is generous for the most parts. The levels can be finished before the time has completely run out on the timer. It's advisable to plan ahead before starting the level.\n\nThe character's rank is updated after earning certain amount of points from playing the game.\n\nThere are five statues in the valley. Four statues are connected to four tribes and the center statue is connected to the four statues. All levels must be completed in gold in order to full upgrade the four statues. Completing each of the four statues will upgrade the statue in the center. The process of upgrading the statues is a long one.\n\nThe minor setback is that all levels must be completed within gold time. This is a long process to fully complete. Multiple replays for some of the levels maybe required.\n\nThere are sixteen different locations with sixty-four levels in total. Each of these levels has certain objective that's needed to be carried out.\n\nThe resources that building structures generates has to be manually collected by the players themselves.\n\nThere a few different temporarily power ups to help producing more resources and completing task much quicker. These power ups are available later in the game for most of the levels.\n\nThere are fifty-three different achievement to be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be obtained.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I felt that this game is good, even though the story would've been better. As for the game's replay value it's low. If you're into time management game then I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","January 24","true","33.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

I became interested in this game because I've played a couple of other Alawar/Buka titles (The Promised Land and The Happy Hereafter), this game had a very similar look and what I thought was going to be somewhat similar gameplay.  However after the first level/stage it becomes clear that although the art is similar, the actual gameplay is quite different.  So if you like The Promised Land or The Happy Hereafter and you want more the same, this may not be what you are looking for, however there is some similarity so it still might be worth checking out.\n\nThis game is level driven.  You move from area to area with each area having a dozen or so levels and each of those areas have a theme attached to them.  Some of theses themes, are drought, fog or freezing and those have to be managed in order to clear the stage.  Levels start off with you having a certain number of resources and those resources are used to create buildings, clear debris or trade with NPCs.  After building/clearing/trading you collect more resources to achieve the various goals that you are tasked with completing.\n\nI was impressed with the depth and amount of story in the game.  I didn't follow the story to closely so I don't remember how good the story was, but after each level/stage/area there was a good deal of dialogue and story progression.  I was impressed, in a smaller puzzle type game there usually isn't near this much dialogue or story elements throughout.\n\nGraphics are not the greatest but they are passable and are clear enough that it's pretty easy to discern what is going on in the levels.  There is some nice art during some of the dialogue/conversations.\n\nThe game isn't overly long, but you can go back to challenge yourself to get 3 stars in each level which will make the experience longer.  But the 14 hours I put in is about the time it will take to move through all the puzzles at least once, though if you pay a little more attention to the story it will add an hour or so.\n\nThe game is not overly challenging for a puzzle game.  I only went through each level once and was playing pretty casually and I was pretty close to three staring most levels.  If I got a two star level I would have only missed three stars by 10-20 seconds usually.\n\nOverall, this wasn't the game I was looking for from Alawar/Buka as I wanted more gameplay like The Promised Land.  But this game was still fun overall and I would recommend it as a short and easy but fun puzzle game.  If you are looking for a lot more challenge this may not be the game you are looking for, it is a lot more of a casual puzzler.","October 14, 2015","true","13.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Resource and time management.  It's a fun game, the dialogue is sometimes funny, the gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get 3 stars on every level.\n\nEach level you have a goal to meet.  If you do so in a certain amount of time you get either a 1, 2, or 3 gold circle thingys (the equivalent of 3 stars in other games, so that's what I'm gonna call them).  You start out with 2 or 3 villagers to run around doing your bidding.  They build a field which produces food.  Or a stone quarry to produce stone.  Later on there is a sandalwood tree grove to build, and a statue to protect you from ghost attacks.  There is also a merchant which will convert any of your goods into wood (sandalwood and regular wood are different, which can be confusing at first).  And you build a temple where a priest will convert sandalwood into purple blob things (mana).\n\nThere are also special people you need to talk to and exchange stuff like 100 wood for 200 mana or something like that.  Sometimes they are a bandit guarding a villager that you need to rescue.  I found it difficult, at first, to distinguish those people from my regular worker dudes because if you're waiting for stuff to be produced and  the workers aren;t doing anything they just sit or laying around.  So I thought they were them until I moused over one of them and saw that they will exchange stuff.\n\nSo if you want to get the best time you have to plan ahead what you need and what to build.  Later on your buildings can get upgrades to 3 level to produce more stuff.\n\nSometimes ghosts will attack and destroy your farms and other buildings.  You can attack them yourself with a spear (just put your mouse over a ghost and it changes into a spear) or build giant statues that zap the ghosts with lightning.   The ghosts can really get annoying, especially later on when they get faster and stronger.\n\nAbout halfway through is a neat concept that I haven't seen before: a mist that covers most of the screen so that you don't know what's there until you get enough mana to light a fire pole to burn away the mist.\n\nI really like the music, it sets a good tone for the game.  And the voices when they are exchanging stuff is nice.  It's just nonsense sounds and grunts but it adds a nice verisimilitude to the game. (there's your word for the day, look it up!)\n\nThere are achievements but don't think this will be an easy one for 100%.  I don't think I will be able to myself, since you have to get 3 stars on every level and some of them just seem really difficult to do that.","December 7, 2015","true","28.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I can assure you, you will be disappointed. This little gem of a game has a lot in common with the big builder titles, but its main feature is what makes this game so very different: levels.\n\nAs the player you are stranded and meet the inhabitants who quickly ask you for help, defending their island and freeing the princess. At the beginning of each level, you have time to look at your setting - what you have to achieve (i.e.: trade 500 pieces of wood, talk to a foreigner,...) and how many resources you have. After your first click, the clock starts ticking and you have a few minutes to achieve your goal. I personally like this system because there are several possibilities for each level, and it sometimes takes me 4 tries to finish just one level with the highest amount of points.\n\nYou are probably thinking that this game has still a lot in common with other games, and yes, that's true, with the very big exception that there's no free mode. You are not supposed to build your own island and live happily ever after, you are supposed to fight your way through all the levels, get a grade A for each one and save the entire island by defeating the very last level. In addition, players are asked to perform multiple tasks at once and organising is a big issue: harvesting crops, gathering stones, and trying to get the very best out of your little workers.\n\nIf that sounds good to you, go ahead. If you have some free time at hand and don't know what to do, buy this little game. It's nice to play every day, maybe 2 levels, and you'll have a lot of fun for the next weeks.","July 23, 2015","true","20.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Moai is very similar in game play to Promised Land, but is slightly less complex but more demanding on reflexes and quick puzzle solving.\n\nThe game runs in 1920 x 1080p full HD in full screen mode.  The art style is cute and would be at home in any children's story book.  The sounds are cute and atmospheric and the music is pleasant easy listening and unobtrusive.\n\nGame play is smooth and intuitive with helpful tool tips and a quest status tracker on the lower right of the screen.\n\nThe interface is well laid out and uncluttered.  Stages are well designed and start out simple progressing in complexity as the player gets deeper into the game.\n\nBefore each stage there is a scenario-setting dialogue providing a story driven element.  Between stages there are storyboard pictures with good quality voice reading out the story text.\n\nMoai sets the scene with your hero having an unfortunate hot air disaster at sea and washing up on the island.  The chief rescues your hero and tasks him with solving the myriads of problems plaguing the island community in return for a promise to help the hero find his way back home.\n\nCompleting quests before the timer runs out will earn the player gold ranging from 3 gold for perfect score down to no gold for late completion.  Fortunately players can select to re-play any previously completed level via an easy to use map which tracks game progress.  Games are automatically saved for each registered player and can be resumed at any time.\n\nMoai: Build Your Dream is only 100Mb in size and will not hog valuable hard drive space.  The game is fun to play and will provide several hours of enjoyment.  Moai will appeal to casual gamers of all ages and is especially suitable as a family game for younger children.  Children unable to read will need adult assistance as there is a need to read mission text.\n\nOverall this is a great budget game offering family friendly casual gaming and will provide lots of fun and enjoyment.  Looking for something similar with more complexity look at Promised Land.\n\nRating 8 / 10","May 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is similar but this is more time-management heavy. You are against the clock on every level here, whereas in the Promised Land it was pretty laid back and you could progress at your own pace, and just enjoy watching the little town tick over.\n\nI thought I'd not like this when I discovered the ever-present clock, I typically hate time-pressured levels in game. However to my surprise, I really like this...more than the Promised Land! Repeating a level till you get 3 stars (by doing it quickly) is unexpectedly fun and addictive. At first you will simply figure out how to do the level, then you will repeat it, fine tuning your build order every attempt, etc till victory (3 star rating).\n\nThe only thing that's a little annoying is the game has a slight arcadey aspect in that some levels include ghosts which attack stuff you build and can destroy it, causing a major setback. You need to zap these ghost with your cursor as they wander about, and they serve as an on-going distraction to your build efforts. I *think* I'd prefer the game did not have those as they add a fair bit of stress to procedings, as if the pressure of the clock was not enough. It certainly makes for a far more edge-of-the-seat game than the Promised Land, as you always feel under pressure and distracted by ghosts. So in that respect, despite several similarities, it has a very different *VIBE* to the first game. The Promised Land is a chill out and watch your beautiful little town expand kind of experience, where this game is one short level after another (each only a screen in size and unrelated to the previous), time attack centric, tests your strategy and reactions, rather hectic puzzle game kind of buzz.\n\nThe other main difference is in this game you have no direct control or interaction with your workers. You just click on the thing you want built, collected, fixed or otherwise interacted with (eg one building is a shop and you can trade reasource types at it), and your little guys rush around independently, getting to your queued tasks in in the order you clicked them. In that regard it controls a lot more simply and quickly than the Promised Land, which allows it to stress the player out more and makes for a more exciting game.\n\nI find - unexpectedly - I prefer this game.","March 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Totally worth it.. it kills the "inbetween" time. I Do not review a lot of games, especially not the "big" ones, since they all got the same value. This one tho' deserves a review, it's worth the money... I'm currently at level 50, and will buy the 2nd part of the game, if it's only to support the developers of this game. It has this "something". This something that is unable review, it could be just personal taste. It takes time, but feels satisfying.\n\n\nConclusion;\n\nif you have a couple of hours to spend, maybe just a couple of minutes each day ( a level only takes 10 minutes). It's worth the money... Support the developers, among all the indie developers, it's worth it!\n\n","September 14, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lots of clicking & no thinking. Just click where it tells you to and keep doing that and you win. If you can click you can play. If you get weary of clicking, sigh oh well.\n\nWhat did I expect? Well the title is Moai: Build Your Dream! so I expected to be able to build stuff. You can & do build stuff, what you are told where you are told and when you are told to, then you can build. Time management, if you don't click fast enough you run out of time, after 2-3 times you know what order to click what to win.\n\n1.4 hours and I'm done.
