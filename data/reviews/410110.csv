I was a little worn out from my CS:GO regime and decided to switch things up. This game literally came out today so I thought hey why not.\n\nPROS: deceptively challenging. It looks easy, however I definitely got frustrated at a few spots. Cool soundtrack, it is a bit repetitive after awhile but still enjoyable. Story line is.. weird? But in a good way. Multiple guns as well as reload mechanics make for some tricky engagements. Fun game. Also found a bug and they patched it within a couple hours.\n\nCONS: Short :/ I read mid-high skill levels would be 4-6 hours and I beat it in 2. Perhaps I'm a badass? Granted I didn't kick over every single stone.. But I shot every guy that I saw and read the subtitles.\n\nSummary: Was it worth $9? Yeah. Will I play it again? Probably not. I was hoping to have a HARD difficulty unlocked once  I beat it on medium but that was not the case. I like to think some indie guys made this game and this supports them in making more awesome games, and for all the money I waste on big titles it was a nice change of pace. They're right.. 12 is better than 6.","November 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 142 of 167 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","142","167","12","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/410110/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","12 is Better Than 6 is a western-themed top-down shooter that is commonly compared to Hotline Miami.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:Long version: you are a Mexican who fights for freedom. He achieves that by shooting the bad guys and helping out the good guys. While doing that, he also earns some dollars (you can spend those on different powerups etc.)\nShort version: you are a Mexican who kills the bad guys.\n\nPros:    Appearance of the Game | This game looks absolutely amazing. You will be seeing a top-down black & white environment that is fully hand-drawn. Because of the simplistic colour scheme you might feel a bit confused at first and enemy movements might surprise you a bit more than they should, but you will get adjusted to it very quickly and the enjoyment will come sooner or later.\nWeapons & Shooting | There are quite a few weapons in this game, including revolvers, shotguns, bows and arrows and others. You also have the ability to throw dynamite sticks (if you have previously collected them). I was struggling at first because I couldn't figure out how to load a weapon, but that's a thing of the past now.\nThe Soundtrack | The excellent gameplay is accompanied by an awesome western-sounding soundtrack. You know what I mean. In case you want to buy it, there is a DLC available on this address.\nEncouragement of Different playstyles | As the Store page for this game says, you can go onto the battlefield "all guns blazing" or just choose a stealthier approach if you prefer. You will also find certain stages easier with an aggressive playstyle while some levels require a certain degree of planning and fail-and-improve approach (similar to Hotline Miami).\nUpgrade System | Across the story, you will find opportunities to acquire upgrades that will allow you to hold more bullets, avoid a certain percentage of them and so on. The unique part is that you can't get them by simply leveling up or clicking the store button at any time but instead you will have to collect enough money and wait for the opportunity to obtain the upgrade.\nThe Story | You can find out what the story is about at the beginning of this review, but here I'm gonna focus more on its quality and things that are special. So, there is no voice acting, but you do get well-written dialogues on the screen accompanied by the speaker's sketch. The story is pretty good for a game that is orientated on shooting and I find it really enjoyable. Just in case you wanted to know, it's divided into four acts. Also, there are a few enjoyable jokey embedded into the dialogues.\nEndless Arena | This is one of the latest additions to the game and it's great for those who have completed the story already and want to have more fun with shooting the bad guys. This way, they won't have to replay the story but just choose this mode from the main menu. This update also came with Steam Leaderboard, which is a really nice addition as well.\nSteam and OS integration | You can kill bad people on both Windows and SteamOS. For being successful, you will also earn Achievements and get Trading Cards for shooting long enough.\nCons:    Lack of Multiplayer Mode | I don't include this often, but this game would be super fun to play against a friend (or soon-to-be enemy). I'm really hoping to see this in the next updates.\nManual Aiming | When you shoot with a weapon, you have to manually aim first (right click) and shoot while holding the aim button. Once you fire, you have to release the aim button and hold it again\nAchievement Colours | This is a very minor disadvantage: Obtained and unobtained achievements have the same colour so the page where you can compare yourself to global achievement stats is pretty much useless.\nThe final verdict:If you liked Hotline Miami but you are now looking for a less colourful version of it, this is the game for you. I find it much more enjoyable than Hotline Miami as it has really good hand-drawn graphics, awesome western music and a nice story. Endless Arena is a very nice functionality for those who like the gameplay and want to have more of it.\nI would highly recommend this game, especially since its price is very low for a game like this. It's also a nice change from all of the colourful games we see today.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Taking place in 1873, 12 is Better Than 6 is a story about a Mexican gunslinger who has no recollection of what’s happened to him. As you travel across the Wild West you’ll find people who can help you, people who want to kill you and people who are just begging to be killed.\n\nPresentation\n12iBT6’s appearance is a rather unique one, to my knowledge at least, and it looks great. Predominantly blackish-blue and white with a splash of red for blood, 12iBT6’s hand drawn art style is bright and pretty good to look at. When things get a tad frantic on screen it can be a little bit difficult to look at but it fits the game as a whole very well. All of the models in the game look great, they all manage to look high quality while retaining the hand drawn appearance. The UI is very simple and stays out of your way for the most part, no complaints here.\n\nGameplay\n12iBT6’s gameplay is effectively your standard top-down shooter’s gameplay with one major difference, your weapons have to be cocked before you can fire off a shot. While this can be difficult to get used to, once you’ve gotten the hang of this mechanic it’s not only a lot of fun but it also gives the game’s combat a sense of realism in a game that leans towards the arcade end of the spectrum for the most part.\n\nThe missions you find yourself doing in order to get your memories back will take you to several different locations in the Wild West including Houston and Albuquerque. These missions generally involve you moving through different areas killing a load of enemies from one of the game’s factions. While these missions are quite fun early on, they can become repetitive later on though there are a few variations on the formula which I found helped me to push on through to the end. The combat itself is quite challenging, mainly due to the shooting mechanics but also because, as stated on the store page, the AI don’t think twice and they rarely miss. One shot kills in 12iBT6, making combat even more challenging.\n\nAs you fight your way past these enemies you’ll find yourself making use of several different weapons including revolvers, rifles and sticks of dynamite. While there are only a handful of different weapons in the game they’re different enough to each other to keep things interesting while you’re using them, though the revolver is the most common weapon. In some of the cities you’ll come across people who will sell you upgrades if you wish to purchase them with the money you find throughout the game. These upgrades are incredibly helpful, for example one of them doubles the amount of ammo you can carry for any given weapon, incredibly helpful in later missions.\n\nAs well as the game’s main missions there are some side missions in the game with more on the way according to the developers in the Steam forums. Currently, the side missions take two forms. Firstly, you get little side missions while you’re travelling from one location to another where you’ll stumble across a group of bandits and you’ll have to kill them all to carry on with your journey. The other kind of side missions can be found in cities where people will ask you to kill a group of bandits somewhere around the city in return for some money.\n\nMiscellaneous The game’s soundtrack is great and gives the game a real western feel.\nI noticed quite a few spelling mistakes in some of the in-game text.\nThe game’s pretty short. It took me 3.7 hours to beat the game but I had to replay some sections several times before I could get past them so it can probably be beaten in around 2 hours.\nAs of writing this review the game does not have controller support nor does it have re-bindable keys or AZERTY keyboard support. I did try using Controller Companion for this game but due to the way aiming is done with the mouse, using a controller is far more difficult than using a keyboard and mouse.\nWhile the story is nothing amazing it’s interesting enough to make you want to see it to the end.\nIn some missions the checkpoints are few and far between, this can be rather frustrating if there are a lot of enemies and you get killed a few times.\nThe game world is well designed and definitely has the Wild West feel.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing\n\n12 is Better Than 6 is a challenging, top-down Western shooter with some interesting shooting mechanics and a well-designed world. If you’re a fan of other top-down shooters such as Hotline Miami you’re going to enjoy this one, even if it is over a little too quickly.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","November 23, 2015","true","6.2"," 80 of 103 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","80","103","3","1"

A Hotilne Miami-like game set in wild west, and with a unique visual style. Amazing, right? In the right hands it would have been.\n\nTheir KS page stated a March 2016 release date. And They made £15,013($22483) on Kickstarter, which ended on October 10th. And all the demos up to that point were branded as pre-alpha. Then suddenly the game got released on November 20th, supposedly finished. And while they sent us the steam codes for the game itself, they never sent out any codes for the soundtrack, despite many of us paying an extra to have it. All the attempts to contanct them via kickstarter have failed.\n\nThe game itself has many promising aspects, but definitely needed a much longer development period, and some serious polishing. The clumsy writing leaves much to be desired, and the gameplay itself gets stale and repetitive real fast.\n\nI believe this is a prime example of taking a huge opportunity and turning it into a wet fart. They ruined their own reputation, screwed the people who supported them, and released an inferior game which pretty soon is going to be in the $1 tier of some obscure no-name bundles out there.\n\n\nUpdate: The dev finally sent the soundtrack keys to the Kickstarter backers(on March 21st). For the soundtrack that's been up on steam since forever... Way to go, making your KS backers wait a few more month for something that the other people could get whenever they wanted if they were to buy the game on steam. Oh, and for some reason the steam music player can't see it, so I had to browse the game's directory to be able to listen to it.

It is an admirable, but ultimately flawed attempt at trying to translate the top-down shooter to the Wild West. It is uncomitted to anything more than the base mechanic of reloading, which while interesting and potentially nailbiting once you get the hang of it, isn't enough to get you excited for what in store.\n\nThe game itself has many interesting ideas throughout, such as reloading and priming your weapon manualy as opposed to just slamming down on LMB. While this makes some firefights pretty tense, more often than not, it makes ducking in a corner and waiting all too viable of an option. Stealth is also flawed at times, given that you default knife has the "potential" to not kill enemies in one hit once alerted. Melee, while limited to one or two section in the game, is also, a bit of a gamble, with you hoping to hit your opponent before he retaliates. Thankfully, your survivability is a tad higher here than in HM (Even more so with an upgrade.) and like said game, continues are unlimited, but the time between resets is so disconnecting that it can be a little disorienting. Combos exist, but the only reward for getting them is hearing the main character spout the same lines over and over. There's literally no motivation for slaughtering multiple enemies barring your desire to read an obscuring text bubble over and over.\n\nThe story is also borderline nonsensical, with you taking control of a Mexican with a bad attitude in search of his lost memories. What starts out as as a stereotypical introduction turns into a jumbled mess of plots, where you fight no less than five factions due to your actions. Motivations are never established and unlike, "you know what", the underlying gameplay and is lacking that pizzaz and allure that would carry the convoluted story through to the end. Also of note, various flavor dialog is untranslated, minor spelling and gramatical erros abound. I normally wouldn't be so peevish if everything else was well executed, but as you could assume, it isn't.\n\nThe art at times, while an interesting stylistic choice, fails to convey much of what your doing while in action and often looks like you stumbled upon an eight grader's Western fan-fic. Despite this, the it's probably the games biggest strength due to the immediate contrast a la "Madworld".\n\nI admire the developers for being so adamant and dilligent with fixing various game breaking bugs, especially running this on a Linux system. I sincerely hope that the developers are able to refine their craft in the future, because 12 is Better Than 6 definately has something about it that screams wanting to be good and at ever fleeting moments, achieves it. Nevertheless, at ten dollars with little to no replay value, I can't recommend it without some serious caveats or discounts. There are worse games out there for sure, and it's not a malignantly bad title, but at the current price point, it is nothing more than a mildly interesting curio.","December 1, 2015","false","4.2"," 60 of 86 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","60","86","4","2"

The gameplay is very similar to Hotline Miami series but this one has a stealth element as well. Setting takes place in the late 1800’s. Your main character is a slave who has escaped and is trying to reach Texas.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game looks absolutely gorgeous, it’s art style is amazing. The game is hand drawn which gives it a very unique and interesting art style. The backgrounds are white in the whole game with the objects and characters drawn just like pen and paper. When you kill someone you get the blood which is in red color sort of like Hatred. In between the acts you get these visualization pictures of the current scenes. One such as seen below. I have to say the graphics and art style are very impressive\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682275037.\n\nWhen you start the game from Steam you get a couple of options. You can start game in low resolution or high resolution. Both of these work fine but the high resolution is the one I used and I didn’t encounter any problems. The game ran very smooth as is required for such fast action shooters.\n\nSound:\n\nEvery single western themed game I've played has the most amazing sound track. This game has one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard. I can listen to the music all day long. The shooting and stabbing sounds are nice too. The shooting sound especially packs a good punch.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis game is much more tactical compared to Hotline Miami where you have so little time to shoot and the gameplay is much faster and unforgiving. This game however is still fast paced but you can get away with missing a shot. There are two ways you can approach your target, you can go all bang bang and shoot everyone in sight or you can stealth kill or even get past enemies to reach your goal. I think this makes the game very unique and tactical. You can view past your vision by holding shift so you have a better idea of where the enemies are.\n\nThis game features a unique shooting and reloading feature. To shoot you have to ♥♥♥♥ y our revolver or rifle, you do that with the right click of the mouse and every time you have to shoot you have to ♥♥♥♥ your weapon again. This can be tricky as every single shooter whether top-down, FPS, third person I have ever played you just press the mouse button to shoot. So I took a few failed tries for me to get used to that mechanic. The reloading mechanic is also different as you load every bullet individually. You have to keep pressing the reload key (in this case ‘R’ key) to reload all the bullets. Other than your regular weapons you have the knife which you can select with the ‘Q’ key and you can stealth kill enemies with it. I found that knife Is your best weapon in this game, it’s much better to go with a stealth approach as you won’t have 5 enemies running towards you and shooting you. You die if you get hit one times (though I could’ve sworn there were a few times I got shot and lived, just the screen would have that blood filter like those FPS shooters. Maybe you don’t die immediately when you’re not shot right at the center of your hit box). Game also has TNT bombs which you can shoot by pressing ‘F’ key. These will land where ever your cursor is. Later in the game you also get a bow and arrow.\n\nMost of the missions have you going to a certain place in the map which is marked by an skeleton arrow marker on your screen. You don’t have to kill everyone, you just have to get there so you can basically do most missions with just stealth. The enemy AI Is pretty clever, sleeping enemies will come to the aid of their friends. When someone finds a dead body they will look for you and they will try to bum-rush you with guns and knives if they spot you. Sometimes that can be a good thing though if they run at you in a line as you can get more than one kill in a shot. Especially the rifle you can get multiple kills with one shot. The dialog can be hilarious and racist (it was the 1800’s what do you expect). The game’s story was not the greatest but it was funny. Some gameplay footage can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682275752\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is hilarious and very fun to play. On top it looks and sounds absolutely awesome. I would highly recommend this game. The story is not the greatest but dialog is hilarious.","May 10","true","7.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","6"

The look of the game could be replicated with a pencil, a white paper, and more talent when it comes to drawing than I'll ever have. The only additional colour is, as often is the case, red, used to highlight character names and of course for blood. I personally find this look very pleasing, though some might find it a bit straining on the eyes with all the white.\n\nSound\nThe music does not always feel spot on, but it's never bad, and it never feels like it's getting in the way. Overall, it's not outstanding, but it does the job well, and had it not been there, it would be missed. A game like this needs background music.\nMost of the sound effects have a good weight to them. The weapons feel satisfying to use, in particular the rifle. Apart from gun sounds, there are not many other sound effects that you'll notice.\n\nPlot\nThe plot is never given center stage in the game, it's just there to give your actions some context. You're an escaped slave, suffering from amnesia, and you need to find out what happened. It works for a game like this, but it's not one you'll remember months after having played through the game.\n\nGameplay\nThis is where the game shines. The game is a top-down action game, where you use the mouse to aim, and WASD to move. Both mouse buttons are being used, one for shooting, and the other for cocking the hammer of your six-shooter. The controls do a good job conveying the limitations of the weapons of the era, and helps give the gameplay some more personality.\nThe game also has a surprisingly competent stealth system. Using silent weapons (like a melee weapon, or a bow) won't alert nearby enemies, unless they see you or the body, and combat can sometimes be avoided entirely by staying out of line of sight. The system is not good enough to carry the game by itself, but it gives the game some more variety.\n\nFinal verdict\n12 is better than 6 turned out to be a surprisingly good game. It's not a particularly lengthy game (3,3h for me), but what's in there is fun. I don't think I'll be talking about this game 2 years down the line, but it was well worth a playthrough.\nSo what does 12 is better than 6 actually mean? Basically that a jury of 12 is less likely to make a mistake than a jury of 6 (Gelfand and Solomon, 1973).  Or that 6 six-shooters is better than 1 six-shooter. Take your pick.","November 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","31","44","2","0"

But in same time at yourself you can keep only one. You also can use a knife and dynamite. Also you can buy upgrades for yourself. The graphics is hand drawn and looks are very nice, the music is also is very good, its ad for game very enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+nice hand drawn graphics\n+nice music\n+good western atmosphere\n+interesting shooting mechanism\n+good gameplay\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-don't have too much dynamic in gameplay\n\nSo this game is looks is very nice, have a nice graphics style and good music which create really enjoyable atmosphere.

Who are you? Are you a gunslinger? A Mexican gunslinger? Bien, you are!\n12 is better than 6 is a top-down shooter set in the Western era. You are playing an escaped slave who can’t recall what happened to him - he suffers from a severe loss of memory.\n\nArmed with a cool sombrero (an awesome weapon, lol) and a conventional Smith and Wesson Schofield .44 caliber gun, you will go through an epic four-Act story.  One of the essential aspects of this game is the shooting mechanisms, where you have to ♥♥♥♥ before you shoot.  It can be tricky at times when you have several cowboys coming at you at once, Yeehah! As you go through each level, either you eliminate all enemies or you can use stealth which will allow you to save ammunition. Also, make sure to search cabinets in each room as you will probably find a bag of dollars or some well-needed ammunition.\n\nAs you play in 1873, you will have a limited arsenal of weapons: a knife which is very helpful to sneak up on your enemies to get rid of them swiftly and silently, a revolver, the Winchester rifle (one of my favourite weapons), a double barrel shotgun, a bow and arrow and the dynamite RAT!!  You will able to use other weapons such as the Gatling guns and canons - that is, when you can come across them in a level.\n\nI really like the simple artwork; it’s like a hand-drawn cartoon. It feels like it is a B series type of movie with a twist! Let’s call it a bloodthirsty black and white game! I like this analogy.\n\nIf you like top-down shooter, you will be in for a treat.

Its not hard, its frustrating. You can skip dialogues and side missions / upgrades without having any idea that you did, because there is no clear indication what will trigger the next mission and what wont. Walking near an npc automatically triggers any dialogue that he has, so if you stray to near them you can suddenly find yourself in the next area.\n\nWeapons are fun - the rifle, the pistol and the shotgun all feel nice to use, but since the rifle has the largest clip size off the bat and the best accuracy/ range, all other weapons feel lacklustre. Melee weapons... don’t go there. Its not clear what will be a kill and what wont, and the missions where you are forced to use melee weapons are just annoying. You also have dynamite, which is so inconsequential and useless that you’ll use it once or twice and then just stop. You CAN use a knife at any point, and you can silently take down enemies, but what’s the fun of that? Finally, the cocking mechanic. Instead of just hitting LMB to fire, you first have to hit RMB. Thats the gimmick. Just that. Its doesn’t really add much to the game-play, and while it can make some sections more tense, having enemies that arnt dumb would work just as well.\n\nEnemy Ai is... weak. basicaly they walk towards you. so sit around a corner and just stand there moving down anything that walks past. Alternativly you can use the rifle, stand waaaay back and just pick them off while they stand there like ducks.\n\nArt style looks nice for a while, but gets old VERY quickly, and while the music is easily one of the best things about this game, it just doesnt work well enough to be of any real importance. You might get a kick out of the music and the story, but if your looking for any replayability or a good top down shooter, this game has 0 depth.\n\nDO NOT pay the 10 euro for this game - you can find better ones for free on newgrounds for crying out loud.","December 3, 2015","false","6.1"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","21","31","0","0"

The knives make no sense, sometimes an enemy goes down after being stabbed once, sometimes they take 4 hits to the face and don't die. The art style is cool, but because all you can ever see of an enemy is their hat, which stays in the same position when they die, you can't easily tell who is alive and who is dead. Not to mention, you can't tell what enemies can and can't shoot over very easily. Sad, I loved Hotline Miami 1 and 2 and heard that this was basically Western Hotline Miami with a different art style.\n\nYeah, its western Hotline Miami, with an awful and not well explained reloading system, enemies who sometimes die in one hit and sometimes don't, and hats that make it impossible to tell if someone is alive or dead.","December 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","28","45","0","0"

Still, 12 is Better Than 6 somehow manages to better its paragon is some aspects.\n\nThis top-down, kill everyone and everything shooter has somehow unexpectedly landed on-top of my desk the other day and I’m still having trouble letting it go, despite finishing the campaign several times.\n\nAddictive and distinguished, 12 is Better Then 6 (or as I like to call it ‘Hotline Texas’) provokes that perfect mix of having fun while constantly trying to better yourself throughout its surprisingly short campaign but hugely rewarding campaign. With no health bar you will die from one well placed bullet most of the time. So get ready to die a lot. That makes room for planning two, three and sometime even four or more steps ahead in order to finish a single level.\n\nFinishing any level feels like a reward but at the same time levels are designed with such care and precision that it shouldn’t take more than a couple of retries to compleat any of them. And it never ever feels unfair. There are over 100 levels in total spanned throughout four acts, each about a couple of minutes long if you know your way around it.\n\nCombat revolves around quick reflexes and tight aim, complemented with unique „♥♥♥♥“ mechanics. Basically it works like a real gun does, you have to „♥♥♥♥“ (the upper trigger) your bullet inside the barrel to take the shot, repeating the action every time you take a shot. I found that mechanic to be a breath of fresh air in the shooter genre in general and hope to see that gameplay mechanic being implemented in more games.\n\nGraphically hand drawn in exclusively black & white tone, with only the blood being red, I see why some players might find this game to be repulsive, or even jump to a wrong conclusion of lacking the in-game depth. I myself enjoyed the simplistic overhead presentation as it allowed me to sharpen my senses to the fullest and just get on with what the game wanted me to do.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","March 25","true","4.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I just looked at the trailer and the review-average and spontaneously picked it up, because it looked like a nice take on the Hotline Miami formula, which I really liked. And after a few minutes to get used to the controls I was literally blown away...\nDamn, this game is good! Even better than Hotline Miami, or at least better than HM2 (which was also good, but not THAT satisfying at all).\n\nThe gameplay is very much the same as in HM, but with a really amazing western-gunplay. Hell, the gunplay is so amazing, it really feels like you are shooting an old revolver - you need to ♥♥♥♥ the revolver (or other weapons too) before you can shoot it, so if you wanna shoot quick you need to hold down the right mouse button and hit on the left one to fire a bullet in your enemy. Usually a shot attracts more gringos around and sometimes you want to keep firing, while lurking behind a corner (like in HM^^) blasting away everyone who's coming around. It just feels absolutely amazing.\n\nSometimes you get a cooldown from the intense killing-sprees in a hideout or a town, where you usually can stock up your ammunition and stuff. There are even some side-objectives here and there and in the town you can earn more cash by clearing some repeatable levels. Oh, did I mention there is also a small perk-system where you can spend your cash on?\nEven the story can get you hooked, but the real strength of this game is the absolutely amazing game- and gunplay.\nIt never felt better to fire a gun and kill some gringos (or doing it all stealthy).^^\n\nIf you liked Hotline Miami this should be a Must-Play!","February 26","true","8.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The art style sometimes hides enemies who kill you.

That’s not to say there isn’t an incredibly satisfying amount of shooting people on sight, but your intent isn’t to massacre every living thing in the area. Or is it?\n\nIn this dangerous world you will find yourself coming across friends, foes, blue and red ink and guns, which will fail to help you if you don’t have fast reflexes. Your best friend in the Wild West is your reflexes. If you turn a corner you will need to have your gun cocked and be ready to pull the trigger or lunge your knife into your opponent, because wait half a second and your enemies will chop your limbs off and make a nice stew out of them.\n\nThe game has unique shooting mechanics, where you press a button to ♥♥♥♥ your gun and press another to pull the trigger. Sometimes it can be tedious, like when you are trying to take out a large group of enemies but makes you feel better about managing to kill them all in the end.\n\nSomething I believe is great is the ability to choose whether to go in guns blazing or be stealthy, which this game executes in a perfect style. The first option can be dangerous but is very possible, and the second option is all about timing and waiting for your opponents to walk in a certain direction, allowing you to sneak up and take them out from behind or sneak past them altogether.\n\nThe basic story is that you are a Mexican prisoner in the late 19th century fighting for freedom, ultimately making your way through the dangers of that time to get from Mexico to Texas. If you choose to pay close attention the story can be quite interesting, but if you aren’t patient or decide not to delve deep into it you can just skip most of it.\n\nThe visual side of the game is a stunning hand drawn masterpiece and, through killing lots of enemies, quickly becomes very bloody. The game is based around this graphics style created by talented artists almost entirely and, without it, would probably be ‘just another shooter.’\n\nIt has a great soundtrack too that can go from calm piano tunes to ‘LET’S KILL SOME PEOPLE’ in the space of three seconds. It makes the adrenaline rush through you as you hide behind the cover of a table, popping your head out while your enemies aren’t shooting and shooting them back.\n\nOverall the game is lots of fun and I recommend you buy it if you enjoyed Hotline Miami and other top-down shooters. You’ll have a blast!\n\nI rate this awesome western shooter 9/10 hand drawn sombreros.","May 14","true","2.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

The devs are still working on it so perhaps I'll be changing this to a positive review soon.\n\nLet's start with the good points :\n\nThe game has got a great soundtrack\nHotline Miami like gameplay\nThe whole cocking the gun thing is weird at first but pretty immersive after a few tries, you feel like a real cowboy pistolero.\nNice graphic (even if sometimes they will get you killed because the black and white can make ennemies hard to spot)\nSo to sum up it's a fun game. I would actually recommand it, except I wanted people to know what's not great about the game, to be warned. As I was saying it's fun BUT let's get to the bad points :\n\nMelee fight : you have no range, and you don't OS unlike HM if you don't aim perfectly so sometimes stealth is a real pain in the butt\nWhen you die to reset the level you have to click, and there's a short lag so some people like me will spam the click, and when they spawn shoot, destroying stealth, getting caught and killed, and strting again, being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and clicking even more, etc...\nThe story (I mean you're a racist mexican killing people to find back your memory, I've seen better)\nLast thing there's a cool feature that allows you to chose among several hats, which is fun BUT the games put your sombrero back at each level so you have to pause, go in the menu and put back the hat that you like.

The game looks great and plays great, for the most part. The game took me 6 hours to complete, which I feel is good for its price and amount of content. I just have a couple of small issues:\n\n- No Controller Support: There doesn't seem to be any controller support. Keyboard and mouse work well, but it's still the style of game I'd prefer to play with a controller.\n- Locked Frame Rate: The game is locked to 40FPS for some reason. Don't know if 60FPS would make a huge difference, but the fact it was locked with no option to change is disappointing.\n- Forgettable Story: I didn't care much about the story. I didn't find the protagonist very likeable (or any other characters), the amnesia angle wasn't very interesting, and overall I just couldn't get into it.\n- Per Weapon Control Schemes: Each weapon has its own control scheme required to fire it. I liked this, as it made each gun feel different, but when getting used to the game, and while in the heat of battle, it was frustrating to hit the fire button only to realise I needed to do something first to make the gun shoot.\n- Method of Picking Up Ammo: I wasn't paying attention when the game told me how to pick up ammo, so this could be wrong, but it seems you need to empty your current weapon and pick up another weapon of the same type with ammo already in it. This means it's extremely dangerous to pick up more ammo during a fight.\n- Difficulty Picking Out Enemies: I died a few times because I had failed to pick an enemy our of the environment, because everything in the game is white with blue lines. It would have been good if enemies were decorated with different colours, or had bolder outlines, or something. Thankfully most of the time you can spot them with ease, though.\n- Melee Weapons Suck: The start of chapter 4 sucked! You start with a shovel that hits things beside you rather than in front of you, you have dogs that you can't sneak up on (thankfully their barks don't alert enemies), and you have no chance of killing an armed enemy face-to-face, so the first level of that chapter is frustrating until you finally get a gun again (and hopefully don't die before moving onto the next level.) Thankfully I don't think melee weapons had to be used outside of that level. (This excludes stealth kills, which are generally one hit kills, although sometimes it can be difficult to line up a melee hit properly.)","December 24, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The actual gameplay is very similar as well. You point, you click, you die, you try again, you progress a little, you die again. The one major change is managing the firearms available. Since you are dealing with weapons as a constat and not as an exception, it is imperative that the mechanics are solid. And in this case they truly are perfect for the purpose. Each weapon handles in a different way. The revolvers must be cocked with RMB, for example, and this addition of something minor and simple can make a massive difference to the gameplay. It can be frustrating to know that you died because you forgot to ♥♥♥♥ your revolver, but you know that it was your own fault. This also makes the eventual successes that much more meaningful, because you've actually had to improve as a player to get there.\n\nIn short, the game is a very good top-down shooter with a pleasing aesthetic, and pleasingly tricky gameplay. Also, you can rule over dynamite-rats who do your bidding. What is there not to like?","December 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is a really amazing game with top-down black & white art along with awesome western-sounding soundtrack and responsive keyboard/mouse control, although at times it may hinder your ablity to find enemy that blends in with the black-white enviroment if they are not moving and you are not accustomed to enemy's hat shape.  There are bunch weapons, including knife, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, bows with ability to throw dynamite sticks.  The cocking of the gun before shoting part you will get to use to, and I find it is not difficult after initial learning curve, plays like second nature now.  Sometimes it is better use knife to silently take down enemies, but sometimes due to the top-down nature of the game, you may get disoriented and stabs  air due to wrong facing and knife's short range.  There is also a endless arena in the latest update in case you can't get enough of shooting the bad guys.","December 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/410110/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","This is another one of those games, where i am not completely sure what to really think of it. One part of me likes the Artstyle and the gunplay, the other really dislikes the story and the technical stuff.\n\n12 is Better Than 6 gathered my interest because it's a twin stick shooter, and as a big fan of Hotline Miami, i was not only intrigued by the gameplay, but also because of the artstyle.  That you need to reload the guns and, for example, cocking the revolvers i didn't know before going into the game, so it took me a bit by suprise and took a bit of learning until i got completely the hang of it. Mastering it though, feels extremely satisfying, and blasting away a bunch of enemies at once with a few shots is a really cool feeling.\n\nAt certain moments in the game, you are also able to purchase different perks by your hard earned (stolen) cash. These perks are pretty usefull, i especially enjoyed the one with the rat and the dynamit, which functions like a homing bomb on enemies.\n\nThe gameplay is definitly the stronger point about this game, which kinda makes the lackluster story and the sometimes downright goofy writing worthwhile. I get that it is text only, but i don't see the point of typing out actions of the characters. Or rather, would not like them to talk in an almost roleplaying like way. <he drinks>, <he spits>, <he looks scared>, etc. These are a few examples, which you probably find throughout the entire game. I am really against this sort of narrative, as it ruins not only immersion, but any serious tone to it aswell. I would have much preferred it to let the protagonist explain the actions of characters, or add more sound effects that give off the hints on what the character is doing.\n\nThe story itself isn't really all too interesting either. A mexican rambo basically kills everything he doesn't like. I would like to compare this western tale to Red Dead Redemption, but considering that both games are hugely different presentation and budget wise, i think it would be a pretty unfair comparison. Still, i was kind of let down actually to see the game not really going anywhere with its story. Also the ending was downright bad, there is no jumping around here, it's just suddenly over and anti climatic as hell.\n\n\nMy biggest dislike however was this game on a technical level. Random crashes after clearing a mission (in the transission to the next mission it usually happened), enemies often didn't die after getting shot, selecting hats only worked for the certain level then always switched back, enemies downright teleported somewhere else (especially noticable with the guard dogs), got the dialogue skipping achievement for finishing every dialogue normally, some of the speechbubbles of characters you pass by were suddenly in russian, the melee weapons work very strange, and so on. At large times, the game felt really rough around the edges, what made it a bit unpleasent to play through at parts.\n\nBut i have to give credit to the very nice soundtrack, which may just contain a few songs and they are repeated throughout the entire game, but they never really get on your nerves and serve the atmosphere well.\n\nOverall, i can recommend this game to everyone who already likes Hotline Miami or twin stick shooters in general, but doesn't expect something of the same caliber as of the former. Everyone else i wouldn't recommend this really as there\nfirst twin stick shooter or even western game at that, there are way better alternatives out there, but as for cheap, i don't think you can make anything really wrong here. It's still fun, even when a bit unpolished.","December 30, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I made it through almost the entirety of the first three acts (only at Act 3 now) with only the knife because it was far easier to stealthily kill everyone. Working out which way a person is facing is a bit of a pain because the shadows don't give away their FOV. Running in a circle around a shotgun wielder while stabbing him to death is amazing.\n\nCocking the pistol after every shot was weird, as was the rifle. The bow can only be drawn when an enemy is on screen which was also weird. Recovering arrows is a nice feature and the long-distance stealth is great. Shotgun blasts are extremely effective until you get the double-shot perk and realize you've just blown both barrels at once.\n\nReloading and gathering ammo is a weird mechanic. Current ammo is on the left, max capacity on the right. Hold reload to empty your gun, swap guns to pickup a full gun and the emptied bullets are added to your current capacity. I had trouble figuring that out at first, even with the tutorial. I ended up spending most of the time emptying my revolver and swapping it out or knifing everyone as a result.\n\nPros:    Stealth combat - Knife and Bow\nFast combat - Guns go dry in seconds when you get comfortable\nMedium Learning curve\nMultiple paths on most levels\nDeath comes easy and fast - single shot kills\nGatling guns and mortars!\nDynamite deaths aplenty, though it seems to be limited to 4 kills at once\nOnly 1 gun can be equipped at a time\nBow and arrow is very limited - strategic usage required\nCons:    Very limited graphic options\nExit level to access options\nNo resolution options\nSlow rotation of Gatling gun makes it useless in some maps\nBarber is terrible at defending the back\nAwkward "pause" interface\nWeak Story - stopped caring around Act 2\nClicking skips the dialogue still being displayed rather than displays it all at once, missed some story because of this feature/lack of a feature\nSometimes spawning straight into kill zones (repetition quests)","December 27, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is tense, creative and offers a good challenge which you can approach in many different ways.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible soundtrack. It is excellent, fits the game perfectly and gets you going all the time.\n- Manual bolting and reloads add so much depth to gunplay thus makes the game rise above the other topdown shooters.\n- Story. It does not have so much depth and certainly not a piece of high literature but it shows that developers have analyzed the tropes of western genre thoroughly and executed the story with a good sense of humor.\n- All the weapons feel unique and your weapon of choice impacts your gameplay greatly, which makes more than one playthrough a viable option. Especially bow and shovel work quite unexpectedly well which is a nice change from the usual guns (revolver, rifle, shotgun)\n- Upgrades are well thought of and they all serve a good purpose, unlike filler upgrades in many other shooters.\n- I am not an expert on topdown shooters but stealth being a viable option most of the time is pretty good.\n- When talking about stealth of this game, I have to mention the knife. The way they designed the knife is amazing. If the enemy is unaware of you, you will kill him with one knife hit if you are close enough to the head and two hits if you are a bit far. If the enemy noticed you, you have to get behind his back and it will take four hits to kill while front hits won't do any damage. Simple details like this greatly increases production value of the game\n- You have to manage your ammo and know when to reload.\n\nCons:\n- A few minor bugs which usually causes you to get stuck in a place, but it is nothing to worry about.\n- Tutorial part is not very good, while it teaches you most of the basics, I did not understand how to reload and ammo count for a while.\n- A few random chatboxes were not translated into English and were in Russian but I have encountered this for twice, so it's ignorable.\n- Game has enough content for its price, but a co-op mode and workshop support for user made levels (which should be easy enough I'd guess as the dev made levels seem to have include a small amount of assets) could have increased the longevity of the game.\n\nI think 12 is Better Than 6 is a must play for everyone in its current state, therefore I shall give a final score of 8/10.","February 27","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Ending is a bit too sudden\n\nThe Ugly-Im not the only one who "Runs out of Memory" or gets somekind of code error, this is acutally the only thing that pisses me off the most in this game, hope it gets fixed in the future (not a big deal in the story mode, but in survival...)\n\n\nAll in all its a great game with a great soundtrack","February 29","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very fast-paced and in open areas the field of view is so tight that you'll get shot before you know there's anybody there. The RMB->LMB mechanic, particularly for the revolver, is finnicky and often failed for me. I was taught that if you hold R you can pick up the ammo from a weapon, but it seems like that never actually works.\n\nThe story is adequate but the motivations of the bad-guys are confusing. After you fake your death (spoilers?) why does everybody still shoot at you? And why do you still go around shooting people? It seems like that should be the end of the narrative.\n\nWhen the game is in towns with lots of buildings and cover the game is a blast, but there are quite a few frustrating bits.

But it's the graphics that makes the game a unique game, the graphics are simple but great. The game is a top down shooter with alot in common with Hotline Miami. It's a fast paced experience with alot of dying. The weapon system is great, with old school revolver you have to ♥♥♥♥ by pressing right mouse button, before you can shoot one shot. That took me awhile to learn, but it makes the game and levels feel a little more as something where you litteraly fight you way through, but with a handicap. It takes a little more time for each shot to fire and you only have six, then you have to reload. So every level you take your time, learn where the guards are and patrol. And then figure out how to beat the level, because if you want to go all guns blazing, you will click restart ALOT. Unfortunately the game suffers from a little bad programming. My game crashed for different reasons alot. With no fix that worked, that took away the flow of the gameplay and some of the fun.

This game satisfied it well. This game is in essence anotrher Hotline Miami in all but name and music. The unique selling point here is that you have to make sure weapons are cocked before using them (seeing as this game is set in the wild west) which can be somewhat annoying, but you'll get used to it eventually.

I uninstalled it and went onto other games.\n\nI came back to it later and like it quite a bit. I discovered being stealthy and using my knife, especially on sleeping folks, makes the game a lot more fun. It's hard, and you don't have a health bar. You get shot, and you'll be done for in most cases. Sometimes you get winged and can continue until you eat another bullet, but don't count on it.\n\nThe protagonist isn't likeable-no one is. The whole game is birds-eye view and done in simple black and white excluding blood. There is currently no controller support, but I've learned that keyboard/mouse works great anyway. The art style, spaghetti western mood and setting, and gameplay are refreshing.\n\nI recommend picking this one up, particularly if you like killing gringos (who doesn't).\n\n","April 2","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it's the graphics that makes the game a unique game, the graphics are simple but great. The game is a top down shooter with alot in common with Hotline Miami. It's a fast paced experience with alot of dying. The weapon system is great, with old school revolver you have to ♥♥♥♥ by pressing right mouse button, before you can shoot one shot. That took me awhile to learn, but it makes the game and levels feel a little more as something where you litteraly fight you way through, but with a handicap. It takes a little more time for each shot to fire and you only have six, then you have to reload. So every level you take your time, learn where the guards are and patrol. And then figure out how to beat the level, because if you want to go all guns blazing, you will click restart ALOT. Unfortunately the game suffers from a little bad programming. My game crashed for different reasons alot. With no fix that worked, that took away the flow of the gameplay and some of the fun. With better programming this would have gotten a higher grade. 6.7/10","March 13","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game satisfied it well. This game is in essence anotrher Hotline Miami in all but name and music. The unique selling point here is that you have to make sure weapons are cocked before using them (seeing as this game is set in the wild west) which can be somewhat annoying, but you'll get used to it eventually. The sound strack is great and for the asking price I'd say it's worth it, just don't expect the same amount of polish with the HM series.","March 13","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/recommended/410110/","silentzero1","SilentZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/","21 products in account","Introduction:\n12 is Better Than 6 is a top-down (bird's eye view) wild west-style shooter set in Mexico and Texas in the mid-late 1800's.  Many players make a comparison to Hotline Miami, but I haven't played it (yet) so I'm unable comment on that.  What I can do, however, is give you a rundown of the good, the bad and the ugly that I've experienced in this game.\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n++ Music\n++ Artwork\n+ Attention to Detail\n+ Gameplay/Controls\n\n- Storyline/Plot\n- Potential Rage-Inducing Repetitive-ness\n\n= Very fun and definitely worth a try, just don't expect it to have a very deep story!\n\nReview:\nPROS: The first thing that comes to mind is, by far, the music.  Non-stop throughout the game I simply could not get over how great the soundtrack was.  It's even possible that I performed one of the best mariachi air guitar solos ever while watching my brother play for a bit, just sayin'.\n\nNext up is the artwork and, as a bonus, the attention to detail.  Everything is hand-drawn with pen and paper and the effect is pretty amazing, in my opinion, especially when combined with the sharp contrast of all the bright red blood that is spilled in epic western shoot-em-up mayhem.  Plus, it's the little things, the tiny details added that catch your eye occasionally, that make it all the more special.  I can't tell you how surprised I was when I saw my character spit on the ground (patooie!) for the first time.  I mean, who would think to add that?  Awesome people, that's who.\n\nAs for the gameplay, while the controls can be a bit tricky initally, the difference in shooting mechanics between shooting a revolver versus a rifle versus a bow and arrow, etc, is actually quite cool and adds to the fun.  Not to mention how very smooth it plays and how fast it reacts makes for a great gaming experience.\n\nCONS:  Sadly, the story leaves something to be desired.  Sometimes I didn't even understand what was going on, and by the end I still had more questions than answers.  Maybe this is intentional -- upcoming sequel or prequel?? -- but I kind of doubt it.  It was okay, but I certainly wouldn't have minded more text and/or cutscenes (or even a longer game) if it pulled me deeper into the story and made me feel more invested in what was going on.\n\nFinally, I should add that 12 is Better Than 6 contains a healthy dose of challenging gameplay where bullets are deadly and the enemy rarely misses.  Most of the time this is fantastic and makes the game very enjoyable, but on occasion it can be very frustrating to repeat a level over and over and over because you keep getting killed at every turn.  Some people thrive in moments like this, and others simply do not.  Personally, I don't find this as much of a "con", but I watched my brother curse and rage in a couple levels, so I thought I would add it here.\n\nOVERALL:  12 is Better Than 6 might be a bit on the short side and lack a little in the story department, but there's no doubt about it: the game is a whole basket of fun and mayhem!!  I'm quite impressed and definitely recommend it for its entertainment value, just don't expect it to be incredibly deep story-wise.","February 28","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/410110/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","The best way of describing the game in a sentence is Hotline Miami meets Red Dead Redemption… Hotline Mexico if you will.\n\nVisually the game has a strong monochrome with red aesthetic that really makes it a distinctive game to look at and play.\n\nWhile Hotline Miami requires tactics to beat its levels most of them can be completed by tearing through guns a’ blazin. This is not however possible in 12 is better than 6. The first thing to up the difficulty is that the enemies never miss. If they shoot… they hit. Secondly unlike Hotline Miami you need to reload your gun and ♥♥♥♥ it after each fire… which in the hectic heat of battle is hard frigging work.\n\nTherefore each level must be meticulously planned to perfection in order to see through. Sometimes things seemed a little unfair but I always wanted to have another go. Make no two minds about it though this is a brutal game that isn’t going to let you have an easy ride.\n\nWeapons are varied and fit the setting nicely and the general gameplay is fun. There is plenty to like here but I can’t help but feel something is just not quite right. Firstly the previous mentioned reload mechanic is clunky and really took away from the fluidity of the game.\n\nI also found a fair amount of bugs when playing that meant NPCs often did not follow their set scripted pathways making the level either much harder or much easier to complete and sometimes required a restart.\n\nOverall the game is a fun distraction but it isn’t quite what I hoped it would be… looks lovely though.\n\nTHE GAME WAS REVEIWED USING A COPY OF THE GAME PROVIDED BY THE DWEVELOPER MY THOUGHT AND OPINIONS ARE HOWEVER 100% MY OWN\n\nFor a video review please look us up here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/151202_game-tutor-grades-12-better-6","December 1, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I certainly wouldn't say clone, enough effort has gone in, it's just in the same genre. If you can pick it up cheap I would - it's challenging, but when you die it's your fault not the controls. One downside is that it feels like "wild west hat simulator" sometimes - you can't tell the difference between a live guy and a dead guy because they both just look like hats.They should proabably change the colour on dead enemies. I'd like an option to zoom out slightly, almost like an FOV slider, without breaking the game. You can press a button but sometimes you'll get killed by a hat that's barely on screen and therefore 12 feet in front of you.\n\nMusic is good (not exactly thematic but still) and art style is interesting if nothing else. A little colour wouldn't hurt! As I said it's challenging, I haven't even completed the first act (of 3 I believe) in an hour so I'm happy with the pricing. If there's ever an update then some voice acting would go a long way for immersion too.\n\nI've said a lot negative, but I'd buy it again having played it.

The story elements are sparse and only vaguely interesting, but I was intrigued enough to see the Mexican's quest through to the end. Gameplay is mostly comprised of "get to point A alive" levels with a small handful of hub-like areas that offer upgrades between missions. You may have read it already, but the comparison is worth repeating: the shooting aspects of this game are very similar to Hotline Miami. Enemies are lethal, aggressive, and high in number. To survive, you'll need to be quick, stealthy, and smart about positioning for engaging your foes. I particularly loved that you have to manually ♥♥♥♥ your gun (via right clicking) before firing again; not only does this add an extra element to gunplay, but you'll feel like a true gunslinger fanning your hammer between shots.\n\nMy one complaint is that the game will occasionally require melee combat. Certain areas give you a pickaxe or shovel and force you to engage in a handful of melee encounters, which involve little more than backing up while clicking madly and hoping that your blow connects before the enemy's. For a game with such satisfying gunplay, it felt almost criminal to abandon it.\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed my few hours with 12/6 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a watered-down but nevertheless satisfying desperado version of Hotline Miami.","November 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unlike every other Western themed game I've ever played, your main weapon is a single-action revolver that (like in real life) you have to manually ♥♥♥♥ the gun's hammer after each shot which is "realistic" but also a HUGE nuisance (especially without clear visual or vibration feedback to confirm that your gun is ready to fire), and your enemies all unrealistically have perfect aim and kill you instantly with one shot. Manually cocking a revolver's hammer might be a fun way to add tension to a prolonged gunfight in a slower paced Western game like Secret Ponchos, but NOT in a game like this that's all about lightning reactions, and trying to figure out how the devs intended you to beat the mission. Oh, and did I mention you also have to mess around with manually emptying the bullets out of your dead enemies' revolvers? Because you do. And it's annoying. Sure, by all means make things more realistic than letting me suck the rounds out of guns on the floor by getting my magic bullet-absorbing boots near them like in most games, but don't add such annoying busywork to your game!","February 24","false","1.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you want a game that does this style of quick shooting well, get Hotline Miami. The levels here are extremely short and very boring. I bought this on sale and actually felt ripped off and ended up returning it, and it wasn't even entirely due to the mediocre gameplay. The absolute worst part of this game is the writing, something the devs claim is immersive and engaging. It's actually so garbled that it's hard to tell what's actually being said. I don't expect historically accurate dialog but I could barely figure out what people were even saying to each other. The English is such a complete mess that it feels like the game was run through Google translate about a dozen times. It wasn't just nonsensical (even the tutorial misrepresented the controls the English is so bad) it was really, really weird. I get they were trying to make the bad guys really racist and homophobic, but modern slurs in a cowboy game were more jarring and weird than anything else. It didn't develop anyone's character, it didn't add to the atmosphere, it didn't even make me want to shoot the bad guys, it just made me pause and wonder how old the developer is.\n\nVerdict:  It actually felt worse than an Armor Games flash game. Don't even buy on sale. It's just a hot mess. Get Hotline Miami instead. The only reason to buy this thing is to laugh at some of the worst writing you'll ever come across, outside of some dumb teen's creepy Sonic fanfic. It's just so weird and bad. It's so bad.\n\nI feel really bad for the people who buy this thing at full price. It's not even worth a dollar.

Tbh it plays kinda like Hotline Miama, but with some wierd alerations and so far at least I dont feel like the story is as engaging or well written.  As for gameplay, some things I dont like is the whole hold right click then hit left click to shoot.  It just feels wierd and makes combat feel clunky at first.  Also the reloading is like hit r,r,r,r,r,r,r to reload your revolver.  Cant say I'm a huge fan of that either.  And lastly the biggest issue to me is that the enemy AI is really really bad.  A lot of parts where Im just left thinking "wtf are they doing?"  But aside from those things, the gameplay at its core is fun, and some parts of the game are semi funny.

I was banned from the forum because I said that you should buy this when it's cheaper and that they were lazy because they don't have controller support at launch.\n\n\nPro's -\n\nGraphics.\nGameplay (feels more or less like Hotline Miami)\nWESTERN! Perfect settings for the game.\n\nCon's -\n\nAwkward reloading.\n♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack that plays over and over again (Had to turn it off).\nTo much story... A game like this is all about the slaughter, and the story that isn't even good takes away from the experiance.\nYou can't throw weapons like in HM.\nNO CONTROLLER SUPPORT?! WTF?! It's being planed that it will be in the game early december, but to not have a thing like that in the game on release is just lazy... (They could have waited a few days a week to add that).\nCapped at 30 FPS, 2015 and it's capped at 30... fps...\nA.I. shoots you from places you can't see sometimes.\n\nI really enjoy games like this one, but I just felt that I wanted it to be over, that being said I would rather play HM 1-2 one more time than give this another try.\n\nDON'T SUPPORT THESE ♥♥♥♥ING DEVELOPERS!","November 27, 2015","false","5.8"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","8","23","3","0"

The camera is terrible, you can't see anything. The controls are pretty poor (control pad). It's really racist. The music and repetative.

The shooting system is new, and it looks pretty nice, but the gameplay gets repetitive pretty quickly, and the writing is cringe worthy.  The AI is a little buggy, and you don't need to do what the protaganist says ( I got by the stealth portion of the first act guns blazing). This isn't neccisarrily a bad game, but It isn't that great.","November 20, 2015","false","0.6"," 36 of 129 people (28%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","28","36","129","6","0"

The game doesn't play very fluidly, and the way the guns are controlled is very strange. I like the artstyle, but maybe not for a western game. This trend of games that would have been high quality newgrounds fare 5 years ago being put on Steam for 10 dollars annoys me, and this game plays just like one of those. I will give the developers props for trying to make a western themed game, and I hope more follow suit. Just maybe not like this.","November 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 34 of 129 people (26%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","26","34","129","6","1"
