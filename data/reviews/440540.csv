It's a craft product from amateurs doing their best not to be amateurs, and with time, Ara Fell, and their future endeavors, should be excellent retro-esque experiences. There are slight, unaggressive bugs, and currently (if ever) there are no key-rebindings or complete controller support, but focusing exclusively on the content, I'd praise the effort. Ultimately this is a five-dollar game, and anything else you pay is a tip of encouragement.\n\nShun not the Makers of RPGs. True, the lazy hobbyists have oversaturated Steam with their rough-draft attempts (a certain prolific publisher will come to the minds of Makers and Maker-players), but the men and women behind Ara Fell are on the righteous path: the try-hard path.\n\nAn addendum: In my first 20 minutes into the game, I encountered a small bug. I sent a message to developer Stephen Anthony, and he acknowledged it. A couple of hours later, I noticed that the game had an update. Curious, I played again from the start, trying to recreate the bug, but found it had been fixed. Whether or not this resulted from my message doesn't matter; this is proof that the developer cares. To you, the prospective consumer, I give this anecdote as a reassurance that you'd be buying a product that comes from loving hands. To Stephen Anthony, thank you very much.","June 2","true","6.3"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","38","48","3","4"

But I gave this one a shot and so far I'm glad I did.\n\nQuick pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\nCombat is fun and the first couple of bosses have had twists that make them interesting (also if you die you can choose to skip the cutscene before the boss).\nThe dialogue is witty and well written, with characters having personalities rather than just being tropes.\nThe world is worth exploring, with interesting and useful rewards for ambling around and spotting hidden paths.\nReally nice art.\nThe mana regeneration system in combat keeps it flowing nicely and lets you actually use your skills rather than conserve resources.\nMetroidvania style world discovery, where you gain new skills to access more areas.\nCons:\n\nController support is minimal, requiring you to still use keyboard buttons to make small jumps and crawl (why not just make these automatic/tied to the action button? They're just little animations and have no skill involved).\nThe stats seem to require you to become a jack of all trades to survive. It's not interesting to customise a character's stats each level if I have to pick all of them. To clarify stats never raise automatically, so unless you raise your mana stat you'll have 10 mana for the entire game (enough to use the basic skills once), same goes for your health.\nWhile I'm on the topic why do all stats start at 10 except for agility, which starts at 100 for all characters?\nSmall niggles aside I'm having a great time. So to sum up this isn't just a good RPG maker project, but a good game overall and I'm looking forward to playing more.","June 3","true","1.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

Likewise, the animations have enough frames for most actions to appear smooth, which is something I tend to find lacking in many rpgs these days.  As a pixel artist who works on games, I definitely approve.\n\nThe story is amusing, cute, and interesting enough to keep me playing.  In all honesty I keep expecting the game to be over for the small price point I paid, and yet there's still more for me to do.  Lita is a sweet, if stereotypical, female protagonist and her companions all prove to round out the gameplay.  Speaking of gameplay...\n\nIt's just fun to play.  The fights have this weird mix of Lufia and Final Fantasy going and I like it.  There's active time combat, characters pop around the screen to do their attacks, and the enemies array themselves in different patterns.  Overall it's enjoyable and I rarely feel like I'm grinding because most of the encounters can be avoided if you wish.\n\nI do think the game is a bit too hand-holdy even with the tutorials disabled, but other than that it is an extremely fun and worthwhile addition to my library -- and hopefully -- yours.","June 3","true","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm not gonna lie, I am a sucker for RPGmaker games, especially well crafted ones. Ara Fell is probably one of the best examples of how to make an excellent RPGmaker game (even more awesome it uses the 2003 edition).  Music is great and compliments the various places and parts of the story throughout the game. Graphically, the game has a very similar style to 16bit era rpgs, specifically the ones that came out later/towards the end of SNES years. Think Secret of Mana 2 (Seiken Densetsu 3), but even this comparison doesn't really do it justice. The attention to detail is beyond excellent, little things like birds flying, animals scurrying about, lots of custom sprites\graphics. To put it another way, if someday down the road this game gets put in the humble 'RPGmaker' bundle with others similar to it, hope that this one gets played last cuz it will be a tough act to follow if its goes first.","June 2","true","5.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You can just open it up, load your save, and drop so convincingly, so painlessly back into the world and characters. The whole time you're playing, you're not paying attention to the game itself or how it was made - the graphics, script, character designs, etc. You're simply absorbed into the plot like you do when reading a good book, because that's what you've found: a good story.\n\nFew games, whether made by indie developers or big console companies, have been able to succeed at this, but Ara Fell is one of the exceptions - and it's made with RPG Maker 2003, no less! The developers of Ara Fell make creating a JRPG seem like a piece of cake, but only when you look closer, do you realize that a phenomenal amount of skill, time, and creative energy was put into making something valuable. And it IS valuable. Besides the story, there's just the right amount of challenge, puzzles, exploration, tactics, and side-objectives to make a nearly perfect JRPG.\n\nMy only 2 qualms are that 1) the map can be confusing and a little frustrating when you're trying to reach a quest point, but I've eventually been able to figure the paths out given enough time, and 2) I wish there were time stamps on your saves so you could load from the correct save slot easier. But once again, these are minor problems, especially when the game as a whole is just amazing. I can't even begin to describe how impressed I am.","June 4","true","17.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

I could have rounded it out to 20 but I skipped some side quests towards the end because I was so into the story I needed to know how it ended.\n\n\nAra Fell is a solid classic jRPG with good characters, good combat, a good story, and a great world. I'm not going to go in depth in this review, but I'll highlight my favorite parts of this game:\n\n1) Some of the boss fights in this game are very interesting. I can't say I expected actual boss mechanics from this game but man were they sick. Nothing super crazy but it definetly required some thought and planning to take some of them down.\n\n2) The world is really fun to explore. You'll be exploring caverns, jumping, climbing, swimming, etc. When you're exploring the towns and larger buildings there are extra rooms and NPCs that are seemingly useless. While they have no function they add to the world to make it seem more complete and real. Add gorgeous pixel graphics and we got a nice package.\n\n3) The story is interesting. Its a big gray area almost the entire time, twists around every corner, and things aren't really that predictable. Even within the last hour of the game I wasn't sure how it was going to end.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in just the story there is a 'story mode' where monsters die in one hit. A useful feature for maybe younger players or..well if you just care about the story. I wish there was a hard mode for some extra challenge, but I can't knock it for that.\n\n\nAdd some awesome developers that almost instantlly responded to my bug report and had it fixed and a patch uploaded to steam within an hour.

Even though a lot of the chipsets are the default, the game looks great. The maps have so much detail and there's so much to explore. There's tons of wildlife running around, people are walking around the villages. Especially compared to other RPGMaker games, Ara Fell just feels so much more vibrant and alive. And the soundtrack is so good. I hope they release a soundtrack eventually! I have bad sense of direction, and sometimes I find myself getting lost though and have to reference the map. One time I wandered into a den of wasps and got killed, which wasn't super fun.\n\nSTORY - You play a young heroine who has to save the world, though more out of dumb luck than destiny. Not super innovative, but it definitely tells the story it wants to tell, and it's very well-written. You root for the heroes. The bad guys are compelling and multi-dimensional, and there's way more going on than at first glance.\n\nMECHANICS - As a RPG, your main mechanics are combat and levelling up. Normally I don't like turn-based combat systems, but Arafell does some stuff that makes it fun. Your magic regens during combat, so you can keep using your skills rather than saving them, and HP regens out of combat. I really like that system. Also the bosses are pretty cool and require some thought to beat, which I liked. Levelling up is cool too because you get to make decisions where to put attribute points, though I'm still figuring out if I'm making a solid build or not for each hero. The dungeons aren't just fighting. Since the enemies are persistent, you can avoid them if you want (though you might be underleveled for a boss battle), and you also have to solve puzzles to progress. Ara Fell has a crafting system which I like but haven't played around too much with (I mostly make healing potions), and a quest-tracking system which is really helpful for keeping on track!\n\nOverall, I like Ara Fell a lot! It has beautiful visuals, music, and writing. It tells a compelling story, and the game mechanics don't get in the way of that and are actually pretty fun! For an RPG, that's definitely what I want to get out of it. <3","June 2","true","8.7"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","17","29","2","0"

The world of Ara Fell is simply gorgeous, and the music is so wonderful to listen to that it fits perfectly (my fave track so far has to be what plays inside the mines in the Quarry). The battles are pretty fun, and I haven't felt the need to grind too much so far (and I'm not all that skilled at turn-based battle systems; I'm better at hack & slash).\nAll that aside though, I think the true star of this game is the writing. So much of the dialogue either had me laughing or intrigued. I love Lita, the girl who ends up having to save the world because of some dumb luck, and Doren, the bard who mysteriously seems to know more about what's going than he should. And I get chills whenever a certain spirit appears :)","June 3","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I usually got bored with them due to boring stories and repetitive combat.  This was the first one I've ever completed and the only one I'd recommend.\n\nSTORY\n\n8/10\n\nOverall, I found the story to be pretty good.  All of the characters had backstories and motivations independent of "just group together to save the world!"  The game also didn't boil down to just good vs evil, as there were multiple factions with goals and allegiences that might coincide for part of the game or put them at odds for other parts.  I was interested in a lot of characters - not just the main party and the story was interesting enough to get me through to the end.  I wanted to see how it would all end and the closure and ending were satisfying.\n\nUltimately it was sort of a "beat the bad guy to save the world" kind of story, but it was an inspired take at that old rpg story archetype and given how much of a love letter the game was to rpgs of the past, I'd say it was intentional and well-executed.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\n\n8/10\n\nThe level design was impeccable not just for an rpgmaker game, but for rpgs in general.  For most of the game, you are put in the larger world of Ara Fell - an open world.  You have a map to show you the entire continent and where everything is, and you can navigate the world map to go almost everywhere.  Generally, the main story has you going to dungeons on the main map, with a few smaller side areas to explore as part of side quests or extra encounters.\n\nThe dungeons themselves were very well designed.  The puzzles are not so complex that seasoned puzzle game players will be challenged, but they were difficult enough to satisfy the typical rpg player.  Dungeons themselves would require the solving of multiple puzzles to progress, sometimes in a non-linear fashion through the dungeon.  I thought the dungeon design was one of the strongest points of the game and figuring out exactly where to go next in the dungeon was something I enjoyed doing.\n\nThe one complaint I have is there wasn't quite enough "meaty" side-content.  In the old rpgs of yore there were often larger end-game dungeons hidden in the game with an "ultimate boss" sort of enemy at the end, often stronger than the final boss.  There was no side-content that large in scale in this game, and I would have enjoyed it if there were more dungeons overall.\n\n\nCOMBAT AND ENCOUNTER DESIGN\n\n9/10\n\nThe combat and encounter design were the strongest points of this game for me.  Usually, the combat was the weakpoint of rpgmaker games I tried in the past, where it was so reptitive I would get bored and stop.  In poorly designed rpg combat, the player quickly discovers a "dominant strategy" - a way of playing out combat that can be used to win any combat, against any enemy in the game.  Limit break spam in Final Fantasy 8 would be an example of that.  That ruins combat by making it really boring.  This game did not have that weakness.\n\nThere are no random encounters in this game - you have to walk into an enemy on the map in order to get into a turn-based rpg battle.  For these encounters against non-boss enemies there generally are dominant strategies to just easily win in 1-2 turns every single time [multishot spam + elemental burst deal with trash very quickly].  If combat against "trash" mobs was more interesting I would have probably given the game a 10 in this category.\n\nWhere the game truly stands out is the "boss" battles.  The dominant strategies generally do not work in these, and they are sufficiently difficult.  I wiped several times this game on bosses, learning the mechanics.  Not only that, but the attacks of bosses varied enough that your defensive strategy [when to heal, when to use items, etc.] will differ based on boss encounter.  Also, there were a lot of boss battles in this game and it was obvious thought went into each of them.\n\nI'd also like to note that it is definitely possible to grind in this game, though I never had to.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game.  It took me about 16 hours to clear, the game had strong level design and combat.  It also had an interesting-enough cast of characters and story to keep me engaged and wanting to know what came next.  The game also had lots of clever quality-of-life additions that all rpgs should have: saving at any time, asking you to save before boss fights, asking if you'd like to skip cutscenes before a boss, auto-combat, an option to play the game without any combat [story mode], and an option to check what the next step in the main quest is and where to go to do it.\n\nI did encounter a few bugs throughout my playthrough that would require me to reload an old save once, and others that prevented completion of a couple sidequests.  I also encountered a bug that prevented completion of the main quest.  I made a thread on the discussion thread about the main story bug and the developer responded within minutes and a few minutes after that a patch was out that fixed it.\n\nI hope the developer creates another rpg, I really enjoyed this one.","June 5","true","16.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started this game without knowing what it was about, only have seen the trailer for a little bit, but I enjoyed the ride! Overall it is a great game and I definitely recommend other people to play this. If you want to hear my opinion about the game (spoiler free) Continue reading.\n\nStory:\n\nSo in short, the story is about a floating island that is doomed to fall out of the sky and the girl needs to stop it. It's a pretty good story and enjoyable. When I started the game, the story was well introduced. It explained itself pretty well, so I didn't feel like I jumped without knowing anything. You could read all the stories about the island on the bookshelf's pretty soon in the game. There weren't any plot holes that I could find.\n\nArt/design:\n\nThe art is really good in this game. It is a japanese style kind of game. Everything was designed pretty well and you really felt like you were exploring (This is why I bought this game, because it looked really good). Everything looked finished and done.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is really good, the ost's were really rememberable! Would love to buy the soundtrack and all.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThis was probably the major turndown for me which I can call annoying for some people. The humour need's to be your cup of tea. How the characters react to certain kind of things in the game was in my opinion a bit mehh. I see where they were trying to do with the humour, but that made it seem like the characters were not real at all. I never got a emotionally attached to the characters, because they seemed fake. From time to time the girl was serious about things and the other time she was completely joking about it, she didn't even seem bothered by all the dead bodies in the game which they also joked about. This was part of the humour though, which again you have to like.\n\nPve:\n\nI don't play alot of turn based games, but I enjoyed this one! It could have been a bit more difficult, because I actually didn't have a hard time killing things. I never died on my run, only a few times when I tried to kill stuff that was waaay above my lvl. The mechanics were decent, it could have been a bit more various. Overall it was great though and I haven't really encountered anything, which I can call bad. Although I loved the lvling up system you could really have a big impact on your characters, if you wanted to have more defense you could choose that, or if you wanted more damage. Mana actually gave every character a purpose, everyone had to use it and everyone had different abilities. You could even lvl up spells which I think is a great mechanic.\n\nBug's/things:\n\nThere are some slight bugs here and there that you are going to encounter, but it's thankfully not game-breaking. One more thing I would like to mention that some mechanic later in the game can be a bit annoying, not the pve but for the main quest which I hated alot. Ofcourse I can't say what, because that would be a spoiler;)\n\nOverall thoughts:\nI did enjoy this game really much, because the gameplay was amazing, loved the exploring, doing all the sidequests. Prepare yourself in no-lifing these 26 hours of playtime like I did, because it gets addicting. The ending was pretty satisfying and again the art was amazing and certainly well done. So I definitely recommend this game to anyone ;)","June 5","true","26.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Took me about 40 minutes to finish, and i gotta say i loved every bit of it. Was fun, exciting and kept me hooked until the end. But.. like mentioned up there, i haven't finished the game. That was just the intro, and i'm just here to tell you what i got from it. Sure the game delivers some tasty stuff, going from actually interesting dialogue and some pretty neat looking dungeons to lovable characters (especially the clumsy gal you are playing as).. But.. there's also the negative stuff to the juicy juice if ya catch my meaning.\n\nLet's first bring you a list of stuff i disliked:\nCombat. (This will stay here until i have gotten further into the game, right now i kind of dislike it.)\nWeird Controlls.\nLack of functional shortcut keys (ex. f12=screenshot, alt+tab=steam overlay etc..)\nUI. (It's all over the place, feels really uncomfortable to go through, like having a wank to some goat.. or something.. yeah let's move the ♥♥♥♥ on..)\nThe things i had mixed feelings about:\nMusic. (Mainly has to do with personal preferences)\nSeems like the game is running on an older engine? (Not really a bad thing, but not good either.)\nLack of visual effects. (Then again this is a jrpg, not a tripple A title, but some effects couldn't hurt..)\nPrice tag. (I guess this is a mixed feeling as well, don't feel like the game is worth £9.99 but i still haven't finished the game so this will stay in the "mixed" tag until i've finished it)\nThings i liked:\nDialogue. (Has some humor mixed in with the seriousness of the game.)\nLovable characters. (Makes you feel immersed into the universe)\nBeautifully writen. (The story flows really well, and doesn't feel out of place.)\nArt Style. (Gives you a good touch in the willie)\nDungeons. (You usually get some copy pasted ♥♥♥♥, considering this was made by Indie devs i'm impressed.\nThe "Like, dislike or mixed" lists will get updated as i progress through the game, for now this is all i have. I liked the game, but it definitely has flaws. The Steam summer sale is coming up soon, i would pick it up then. For now i can't really say wether i recommend it or not, too little game time to make a proper judgement. So if you have the spare coin, buy it. If you don't, you shouldn't be here in the first place.

I was constantly taken by surprise by how subtle and believable the dialogue was. Everyone reads like real people reacting to real situations. The world is huge and beautiful and a blast to explore and the story, while it seems cliche at first, really digs into its own tropes. There's a self-aware aspect to this game's story and it plays on itself sometimes. It's really clever.\n\nAnyway, I love this game. It reminds me of a cross between Chrono Trigger and Zelda with better writing. Highly recommended.","June 2","true","99.0"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","15","31","3","0"

The world is rich of npcs and feels like its living and the scenery is just beautiful.\n\nCONS\nthe battles are slow, if you want to grind for high lvls it will be very time consuming.\nI was stuck finding places that the main quest required me to complete. for example go to the hunting ranger, no other information was given as to where it was.\nAlso, after that there was another quest where we have to find a character home which is in stone quarry. it's very annoying to not being told that you have to go inside the quarry system to get to his house.\n\nAll in all there is story mode option that lets you kill monsters instantly if you want to go through the adventure and make it less a little less irritating adventure\n","June 5","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is an excellent game with a well thought out story (although a little bumpy in places), and some interesting dungeons/areas filled with puzzles to figure out and things to find.\n\nOne big thing I loved about Ara Fell is the aestetics, and the continuous world. This game took the floating island concept to the extreme. Every part of the world feels lived-in and has its own subtly different identity. Instead of using an overworld, it's more open-worldy in that you there's a lot of maps, sidequests and things to check out between objective A and objective B, and as you traverse around Ara Fell, you see those subtlies take shape. Thankfully, there's also fast-travel to quickly get from one place to another, if that's the way you'd rather play.\n\nAnyway, give it a gander! I hope people enjoy this game as much as I did, and that it inspires others to finish their RPG Maker 2003 projects and take them to the edge! I hope more turn up on steam!","June 2","true","15.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There's so many side quests you could do and every npc has a meaningful dialog.\n\nThe scenary, music and everything is so beautiful.\n\nEarly on, you learn to swim, jump over gaps, and crawl under beds and into tunnels. Soon after that, you receive bombs that you can use to blow open blocked passages, and later, you’ll even learn to fly.\n\nThe main character herself is colorful and entertaining; There's plenty of puzzles to solve and even a "Story Mode" that lets you instant k.o. mobs if you feel like playing this game for the story and puzzles.\n\nThis game definitly stands out among rpgmaker games.","June 2","true","15.4"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","7","20","2","0"

The main character constantly monologues to herself - a hallmark of poor writing and story design.  And the first boss requires you to *grind* just to get through - I guess I should have turned on the mode where you autokill everything?  But that's silly, too.  Just design the game for even leveling.  I feel like there wasn't enough playtesting performed.  Especially obnoxious is the "level check" that tells you what you need to beat a dungeon, but the information is dead wrong - the boss was way overpowered for my party even though I met - and exceeded! - the requirements.\n\nThe art and music are beautiful, and not all of the writing is bad.  The story is intriguing, but it is delivered with too much fourth wall breaking and immature sarcasm.\n\nOverall this is much better than many of the RPG-Maker games that are on Steam.  But it is still that, an RPG Maker game.","June 5","false","1.6"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","7","2","0"
