Unfortunately, it seems to be VERY light, with hardly any features at all. You'll see everything the game has to offer in one hour or so. And what there is isn't very interesting.\n\nThe basics of the game is that you construct buildings, assign a number of workers to those buildings, and they will produce resources for you. Everything is more or less automated and once you assign workers and hire some carriers/porters you can leave the building alone. There are 5 main resources (food, water, gold, wood and stone), along with ostrich feathers which as far as I can tell doesn't seem to do anything. You pretty much only need one building for each resource, which you can setup in a few minutes. There's also a market you can build which sells all resources for extremely low prices, making most production buildings obsolete once you have one up and running.\n\nThere are some support buildings and units, but they are fairly costly and generally doesn't seem to do anything except boost resource production which you probably won't need more of at that point in the game. It's easier just to hire more workers or use the market for everything. The support buildings seems to mainly be there as requirements for the various campaign stages. Unfortunately the campaign very frequently asks you to start over from scratch, making you construct the same very small settlement over and over.\n\nThe game graphics, sound and interface seems designed for mobile phones, making the game very easy to control. You do everything with the mouse cursor. The game is also fairly slow paced making it easy to learn. No experience from city builders is needed and the game is usually very user friendly. There is one big exeption to this, which is that the translation to English is very poor and inconsistent, sometimes using the wrong word for key gameplay terms. For example, when starting an endless mode game the text asks you to pick between Normal and Casual, but the buttons are labeled Normal and Relaxed. You can usually figure out what to do by just looking at the pictures, though.\n\nI have unfortunately had the game crash on me during the campaign, forcing me to replay a part of the game. Combined with the very short length and overall very shallow gameplay this means the game definitely isn't worth the price. It's much cheaper on Android phones and the gold version only seem to offer higher graphics resolution and not much more.","May 13, 2015","false","2.9"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","32","35","2","0"

After planning a path for a road you need assign a worker to every single tile. The annoying part is that they have to return to the main building before you can assign them to another tile, giving the game the pace of a browser game like OGame or Farmerama. Basically you need to sit there and wait for your guys to return during the first minutes of the game, not able to do anything else.\nThe explorer you need to locate new areas cannot be sent into unknown territory and sticks to the tiles, which slows him down alot as well.\nSo overall this game bores you before it even actually started to show you some and adds way too much micro management for a handful of buildings. Plus the english localization appears to be scrappy (missing words etc).","May 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"
