Units have their own skill/spell tree, different combat interactions like parrying counterattacks dodging riposte, many atrributes and active or passive effects you have to all take into account throughout battle. Lots more classes/units planned as far as I saw on their wiki. Recommend to turn-based/strategy fans. It is not pay-to-win, since you get matched based on your army level - have a stronger army, then you face stronger armies. Don't have many criticisms, its already pretty complex and its only in closed beta stage.\n\nEDIT (02/06/14): Now that it is in open beta, they have changed a few things. Some positives, like more missions/training modes, balancing buffs/nerfs, unit customization such as color and naming.\nHowever, there are a lot of negative changes they have made. Particularly in regards to making the grind for in-game currency much, much slower. They've made missions restore only after 24hrs, and reduced success rate. They allow higher-leveled units to be only purchasable by real money, other than having to level them up manually. Experience gain is slower, and they increased prices for units. All in all, it isn't pay to win, but its very much free-to-grind. Like they say, you pay real money to be able to advance easier without as much grind. But the grind is very slow in this game.\n\nWill update review if they make any major changes to the gameplay/grind. Everything in-game is still unlockable through in-game currency, you can play entirely free. It is exactly how F2P models should be, but much slower grind. You have been warned, its still very fun :-) GL HF","December 8, 2013","true","88.1"," 347 of 399 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","347","399","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makerrcat/recommended/219700/","Makerrcat","Makerrcat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Makerrcat/","318 products in account","Well lets look at the negatives:\n\n#Firstly: WHY ISN'T THIS GAME ON EARLY ACCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n&:Something I feel you must be aware of when getting this game is that it is STILL in beta. For a long time however this game was only in closed beta, and despite being officially "released" on Steam it is still only in open beta. They really need to clarify this!\n\n#This isn't the only game of it's type on the market.\n&:Other games such as Kings Bounty and Blackguards perform similar functions and are arguably better.\n\n#This is not an OMG DAT GRAPHICS kind of game\n&: I only include this detail as I'm aware there are those who prefer all their textures to be uber high              res and have some absurdly high polygon count.\n\n#I used to have there being no PvE mode here, however they have added a more than adequate one since I started playing..\n\n#I have yet to see 2v2, 3v3, etc. modes.\n&:Arguably a matter of preference I feel being able to fight along side or against multiple players would make the game a lot more interesting.\n\n#Unless you wanna drop some cash your going to have to spend a lot of time playing to get higher level units\n\n\nAnd now for the positives:\n\n#Nice, well implemented art style\n&:Dogs of War uses a very dark and dirty fantasy style that may not be for everyone. I personally find it to be well executed.\n\n#Interesting Lore\n&:A crucial part of any game is context. Games of this type are always far more interesting when the player can connect to the characters they control, and Dogs of War does a good job of presenting an intriguing set up that will leave you curious and wanting to find out more about the characters and the world they're in.\n\n#Solid well paced gameplay\n&:The game is turn based so if you're a hard core RTS fan then this might not be for you.\n&:The game has a time limit on turns so you don't have to worry about the other player stopping to eat, file their taxes, and maybe go on vacation before making the next move.\n&:Also the gameplay itself allows for little in the way of a dull moment.\n\n#The game is balanced\n&:The game uses an "Army Points" system. Basically each unit is rated based on how much they can contribute in game. This helps in match making as a player with a bunch of uber powerful units wont get paired against a nube with a bunch of starters.\n\n#Not a pay-to-win\n&:Everything attributing to how effective you are in game thus far appears to be accessible to anyone playing the game without having to spend money. Not to say spending money wouldn't let you get some epic stuff, just that if you got said epic stuff you'll then be paired with other people who also have epic stuff, regardless of whether or not you are fully aware of how to use aforementioned epic stuff. So you're not paying to become more powerful then everyone else, just to skip the time it would have taken to build up the necessary in-game currency. (And perhaps get yourself nube stomped)\n\n#Lots of interesting mechanics\n&:Injury system, Leveling system, Charge attacks, Cover, Race mechanics, Stances, just to name a few.\n\n#Plenty of potential\n&:Looking at the wiki's and even some of the menus game mechanics is enough to tell you that Cyanide is no where near adding all the content they want to have in this game. Which is awesome considering how much they already have. Multiple game types, lots of different units, and even ways to customize them all look to be things players will have to look forward to in the near distant future.\n\n#A dev team that's DEDICAITED to quality\n&:Something I just felt deserved to be mentioned. This dev team didn't just rush their release. This game was set to go into open beta some time fall 2013, yet got pushed back because the devs didn't feel it was ready. And it's not like it's impossible to play right now, getting into the closed beta is rather simple, and they seam to still have a few keys left so I recommend you check out their facebook. These guys aren't rushing this, and seeing as they've now set a more solid release date (January if you didn't notice...) it's not because they're lazy. Otherwise they would have pushed it back like half a year or something... No it's because they're willing to take there time to make sure they get it right. And I for one appreciate that.\n\n#I personally find it fun and have no problems with playing my game to get more stuff to have more fun playing the game\n\nSo yeah... Also it's free, so why the hell not? At least give it a shot, or if you're not into strategy then look up some gameplay vids when it comes out. If you are into strategy then what's stopping you?\n\nThat's all for now, please pardon my bad grammar, and thanks for reading. I really hope this helped.\n\nP.S. Seeing as this has a good chance of being one of the few reviews people see before they decide to download this game I want to do my best to make it as informative as possible. So please feel free to leave comments on how I might make it better.","December 12, 2013","true","6.9"," 333 of 401 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","333","401","0","10"

Unfortunately, its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness... it's based on Confrontation (not a board game, a miniatures game).  Confrontation is, unfortunately, very unbalanced.  Or was.  It ended up getting more or less run into the ground by a string of bad decisions by the owner... who knew how to make a great game, but didn't very much understand how to sell it, and how product development generally needs to bend to the whims of the market (i.e. your release schedule shouldn't overly cater to your favorite factions, and you shouldn't have models that are years behind schedule while you're releasing whole new factions of the game).\n\nAnyway, back off of my soap box... Dogs of War is also somewhat unbalanced.  Like confrontation, it's a game of super units.  And the people who *have* those super units tend to do very well vs. people who don't.  Matchmaking should, ideally, prevent this, but it's a point based system... so if I sink my points into a high level wizard and some light familiars and light-cannon you from halfway across the board, well... that's the game.  There are counters to it, such as playing Wolfen in general (because they're fast), but against undead I'm gonna win nearly every time.\n\nLike any competitive game, people that know the "good combos" are going to win.  Like any level-based game, people that have the high level stuff are going to win.  You can beat them... but it's not easy to do so.  Having a match-making system that worked off of player rank in addition to points would be nice, but then again, part of the issue is that there are limited numbers of people to play against... so if you only played against new players, you'd be waiting a very, very long time for a game.\n\nThe bottom lin is: this game could be good.  But for it to be good, advancement can't be 100% tied to multiplayer (because the multiplayer scene is dying off).  I still have high hopes for this game, mostly because I still want to see the other Confrontation factions... but it looks like that may not be happening, and may not ever happen.  And, unfortunately, they may have tainted the name enough that if I got the money together to try and make a better, more balanced version, people wouldn't buy it due to the stigma of the previous games.  So... unfortunately, I can't recommend this game, because while it has good promises, those promises may go unfulfilled, leaving it currently unplayable.","March 28, 2015","false","29.8"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","50","63","0","0"

Building your troop learning the different skills sets and factions was great fun add that with what was when I played a helpful fun community and it’s a no brainer.\nBut unfortunately the game quickly takes a turn for the worse were you will start to see people using the same units and strategy over and over on the same few maps and the battles tend to play out the same way every game.\n\nAt this point you will have to throw some money at the game to be able to contend with the more powerful costly units and troop meta. And I am ok with spending money on a good product but I just didn’t see the Varity of maps units and the ability to change up your troop composition I was looking for.\n\nOn the positive side the graphics, interface, unit movement and skills were all done well and its for sure a game I will keep my eye on and perhaps come back to if they add  more content.","May 16, 2014","false","18.1"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","0"

Cyanide studios themselves are a French developer based in Paris France and are some what of a hit or miss company in my opinion. While they have developed great games like blood bowl, confrontation and the highly underrated of Orcs and Men. They are also the ones responsible for the terrible game of thrones game. Please note a the time of making this review, the game although mostly complete is in open BETA and as such there are quite the few bugs and glitches to be had.\n\nDogs of war is heavily inspired by the confrontation boardgame by Rackham, as was their previous confrontation game. The game is set in the world of Aarklash which as you can imagine is in a state of war. Three factions vie for power, the forces of light, darkness and destiny. Seeing this as a grand opportunity mercenary companies have started to spring up and as you can imagine your going to set of these companies up.\n\nEach of your units has a number of attributes such as attack, damage and parry as well as a AP value. AP stands for Army points, the way that battles work in Dogs of war is similar to popular table top games. Each battle has an AP limit value for example a death match battle with a limit of 200 AP. This means you can you'll only be able to deploy units that match or go under that score collectively. For example I can deploy my predator of blood, a Wolfen crossbowmen and a lone wolf-man unit which adds up to 167, however I cannot deploy my fang warrior as adding him to the selection goes over the 200 AP limit\n\nSo lets get down to the main focus of the game which is its combat. There are currently three types of player vs player game mode available. You have your straight up death match mode, Elimination VIP which is where you are given a unit to protect while trying to kill the enemies VIP and last is king of the hill, where you need to place units in a selected area and hold it until the timer runs out. When your not killing real peoples mercenaries, you have the option of training missions. These training missions have varying difficulties and place you against an AI.\n\nThe combat itself is your very traditional turn based strategy, the movement grid is a hexed grid and  the game shows you your movement options clearly. The green area around a unit is where you can move and still do actions like attack, you also have the option to move further by going into the orange highlighted area at the expense of any form of attacking action.\n\nAttacking works on a basic formula, your units accuracy versus the enemies parry. Should you succeed damage is then worked out by your units damage versus the enemies toughness rating. There are a variety of factors governing your units attributes in a battle, things like terrain, cover, injuries, and other status' can affect the rolls.\n\nSpeaking of terrain and cover, the maps are beautifully crafted. You can make use of walls, hedges and more to take cover from ranged enemies or shoot from hedges thus making your character covered while attacking. There are also blocks of terrain that have rubble on them, these areas are classed as heavy terrain and units standing on them incur defensive penalties.\n\nTwo really useful mechanics in combat are the charge and pursuit movement mechanics. Charge is exactly as it sounds, your unit can charge an enemy. A successful charge will not only engage the enemy in close combat but also inflict a stun state which incurs a -1 to all their attributes. Pursuit movement occurs when a unit defeats an enemy, your able to take another action be it movement or attack another close enemy.\n\nYou also have orders at your disposal in combat, orders are essentially consumable abilities that you can use on any of your units. Some orders are faction specific for example as you can see I play as the Wolfen, their faction specific order is natural selection which gives a +2 to damage to the unit for the rest of the turn. Orders are crucial to victory in Dogs of war and can be the difference between a win or a loss.\n\nAny fan of turn based strategy will be straight at home with dogs of war, even newcomers to the genre will pick up the mechanics of the game quickly and without much pain. The games tutorial explains everything nicely by actually letting you play the mechanics rather than just show you.\n\nDogs of war is no where near perfect, Cyanide still have a lot of work to do to not only bug fix but to also ensure the correct balancing for the units as some currently do feel over powered. Combat is solid and it is a good framework for cyanide to build on as the game progresses, luckily it is a completely self published title and cyanide own the IP meaning they can tweak to their hearts content. If your a big turn based strategy fan, you'll find real enjoyment here as I did. It is also a good place for newcomers to the genre to find their bearings as the game is not too difficult and you can just play with friends until you feel ready for more challenging foes.\n\nAs free to play games go, Dogs of war is by no means pay to win, though progression solely through ducats is slow and sometimes tedious, its easily done. While its a definite work in progress, there is certainly potential to build upon and I'd have no qualms about recommending this to anyone looking to play a turn based strategy.","February 7, 2014","true","10.4"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","42","56","0","0"

It's quite a neat game with halfway good graphics and a certain rulesetting, similar to some D&D-Features (Roll a dice for succes, f.ex.). It is made smart but not smart enough. I can only agree with people saying 'Unbalanced game' or 'highs farming lows'\n\nSeveral examples:\n1.) Playing the unholy/undead faction has seriously no major benefit at all (Immunity to toxin. Yeah.). At that, they're the kind of trash-troops - Cheap but many. However 'Zerg'ing the enemys down, like undeads usually would, won't work due to the limitations of summons for necromancers. Njét. Whereas wolve-troops posses a double-attack feature. Or healing powers when playing with holy-factioned troops.\n-> 2.) Troops themselves have pretty balanced stats. Which is the next problem: Wolves passively having 'twice' the dmg-output than any other troop? I could faceplant to this. Some nice Knight being healed throughout the match? No problem.\nI believe that ye fine programmers hate the undead.\n3.) Matchmaking is based on so called Armypoints: The stronger the unit - The more AP you have. Thus, anyone can meet anyone, depending on troops ofcourse. Which is certainly a grave mistake: Experienced players can and will easily outplay any newcomer.\n4.) One either must buy troops via real money or grind to get them. Which takes alot of time. Fortunately there's a limit for each troop in every platoon. (No zergings yo undeads.)\n\nI'd claim: Give the game more time to evolve. It's good, but not good enough - for now.","February 9, 2014","false","4.6"," 69 of 104 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","69","104","0","1"

Perhaps they might consider making it open source or finding someone to take the reigns and continue development if they've moved on. As it stands now, I cannot recommend it.

There is a great focus on strategy, and the composition of your army is based on points, so you're always against an army of roughly the same army value.\n\nMissions in the game, however, runs in realtime. I chose a mission a sent a unit out to complete it (I only started with 2 units in my army), which resulted in me not being able to do any actual playing before my other unit would complete the mission 15 minutes later.\n\nThe inability to play with/against friends at will is also dragging it down.","February 7, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It puts the player in the role of a mercenary leader, who can have multiple bands of mercenaries at his command. The game is currently in beta and at this stage offers little in the way of single player. There are 3 tutorial missions and training versus bots but then it is into the lobbies to test your skills and mercenaries against other players.\nI have never played the table-top game but have spent many hours playing similar games. The mechanics or 'rules' of this game are very solid and make for a more realistic and exciting game than any other I have played on computer, the kitchen table or elsewhere.\n\nDo not listen to people saying the game is P2W or a grind. The game is 100% free to play, no disadvantage, no grinding and if you manage to win 5 ranked matches a week you get from 3 to 50 cyans (The store bought premium currency). What people call grinding in this is actually just a pretty fast paced progression system.\n\nThere are currently 3 armies with many more to follow: The dark path field Undead, the Light path field Humans, and the neutral or destiny path field Wolfmen. You will hear many people talk about some factions and/or specific units being imba or OP. In fact I have heard almost every single unit in the game referred to as imba or OP and all factions are described as OP daily. People cry imba/OP when they are beaten and refuse to look at how it happened. The sheer amount of different opinions on what is OP speaks volumes about the balance of the game. I personally have never felt beaten by better units, usually better play, my mistakes or simply a lack of knowledge about some units in the game.\n\nI strongly recommend this if you liked X-Com, but the focus on multiplay makes it much more rewarding. This game is turn based tactics at its finest and it is PvP. The 3 currently availiable armies offer very different play styles. After choosing some starter mercenaries you are free to customize your team build and also the builds of the individual units in your team.\n\nThe only gripe I have had so far is people playing 1 or 2 games and wanting to have everything straight away then blaming their lack of skills on the games balance. On the developers side of things parts of the UI are a bit clunky and the servers seem a little wonky, at least for me anyway. (note: it would not be a Cyanide game without a clunky UI, it is like their trademark.) Another trap for new players who may be unfamiliar with the genre is that when a mercenary gets a level his/her/its cost will increase and may mean you can no longer include it in low team rating matches. Basically don't level your units until you are sure you understand the game. There is currently no way to respec levels so choices are permanent. There is no reason to pay real $'s in this so maybe respec would be a good cash only option for the devs.\n\n\nIf you really like CoD, then this may not be for you. If you like X-Com or any other turn based tactics game then this is a must see and its free! So do yourself a favour and download Dogs of War Online today.","February 24, 2014","true","365.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Like most table top games it has units that are over powering unless countered with the same type of units. Trouble is unlike table top games this game has no concept of mass combat (one unit fighting multipe units at once). There seems to be bonuses to units if you surround them but either they are way to small or don't actually work.\nThe different factions are seriously unbalanced. Wolves get double attacks and triple counters but still have etremely high health compared to other factions. Holy factions get strong heals and improved accuracy. Undead get debuffs that take three turns to power up and unit costs as high as the other so there is no way to offset their poor accuarcy by fielding more units than the enemy.\nAll in all the game shows promise but balancing issues must be addressed before they even think of getting out of beta.","February 11, 2014","false","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last update has been horendous... theres no balance currently as 1 faction has been completly over powered. This faction is called wolfen, there melee monsters and get 2 strikes at an enemy with 1 not even being countered...thats not all whilst they are the most powerful melee monsters they are apparently expert magicians and archers.... they can use magic move and attack twice for 3 attacks with there mages making them the most powerful or they can play harassment and move, use magic and then move again. Not only that there crossbows do the same and are incredibly cheap.\n\nlatest patch = No recommendation\n\nThey also need more factions for more variety as army compositions become samey. Release more factions and try and find balance after because no doubt each time they release a new faction it will as op as wolfen are right now. Warmachine tactics is releasing with all there factions why cant cyanide.\n\nAll an all its a beta but as a beta i dont recommend. if they sort out a full game then there will be lots of potential but even then they will be missing one of the main factions,,,, the cynwall elves.\n","February 25, 2014","false","110.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes a moment to get used to if you've never played a turn based game before. Each que for a match is divided into a difficulty, each unit has it's own level of danger. This amount is used to determine how many active units you can have in your army at any time. Choose alot of weak units, or few strong units. The less you choose the more skill it takes to come out ontop. In addition to actual matches you can also send units out on timed missions if you have extra. When you start off you have to choose a faction to use, but don't let that deter you because you can have up to three factions, or armies, at your disposal. All in All I give the game an 8/10 overall score, there are different playstyles that keep the game fresh match after match, as well as different types of units for each army, each unit with their own special features and skills.

As you play with your units, you gain experience with them and they can learn new skills and passives, making them more useful in certain situations or banes VS certain factions. You can play long amounts of time to fill in your forces or pay real money for units and experience boosts, making it unfair VS players. Since you can get everything using the game currency, it isn't as bad as it sounds. But there is most certainly some unfair advantages online for new players and players who haven't built up a formidible force yet.\n\nThe game can become a little complex for its type, making you learn the different ways units interact with each other, examples being (Bravery, Fear, Pursuit, Attacks of Opportunity and many more) that decide whether you lose or win.\n\nAs a turn based game war game I am not a huge fan, but I gave it a try as it looked pretty interesting. I was not disappointed, it was certainly fun to try it out and learn exactly how the games plays, but I don't like the slow pace at which you earn currency, it would take hours and hours to build up a decent army and really get into the fun games with other people.\n\nThe races are also unbalanced and one of the three are very good early game, so much so that new players have a hard time keeping up with the early game power. It evens out when you reach the higher level brackets. DoW is still in beta, so take that into consideration.\n\nIt's free, its simple but complex and its interesting! Give it a try, see if its for you and if it isn't, send the file into your computers void to be lost forever.\n\nPersonal Rating: 3/5","April 22, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a wonderful tactical strategy game. This game reminds me of when I use to play those old strategy board-games like RISK, and Axis and Allies. This game has beautiful graphics, cool factions, and a overall awesome game. Each faction has a has a race to play. There are only 1 race/hero to select at first which then gives you the choice of starting units. There are 3 different starting unit variations. There is 1 varation that is good for beginners and up, while the other 2 are for more strategic players who want a challenge. Though you may start off on average 2-3 units you can always get more once you’ve leveled up. Also to note that the 3 factions units have their own pros and cons. This makes it that much more indepth when making an army. This also makes it so you learn units are good at what.\nThough this game can be very hard or frustrating at times due to you can fight a person who you think will be easy, and yet loose horrible or by the a little.  This game makes you really think about how much hp my unit has, his damage, dodge, etc. The unit stats are very important to know. The worst thing you could do in a match is to not look at the enemy units in the placement time. Also I recommend watching carefully on matches to look for certain tactics that others may use.  Other than all the in-depth stuff the game is great. It’s free for now, but I’d defiantly play $5-10 USD for it. In my opinion it should be rated 6 or 7 out of 10. I hope to see it excel in the steam community.","February 8, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'll be sure to update this review once I get a little deeper into the game, but I wanted to post one to raise awareness for it, early on.\n\nThis game feels wonderful.  I love the artstyle, I love the game-play.  The music is decent, too.  I've come to expect a lot from "early release" or beta phase games, and this one really impresses me, especially as a free-to-play.  The battles feel pretty balanced, and it really takes me back to my table-top miniatures days (Think D&D Mini's, Warhammer, Heroclix).\n\nThe game isn't pay to win (it's inherent design makes it so that it cannot be, because you are always matched against someone with an army ranked closely to yours).  I see where it could be pay-to-save-time, but hey, I enjoy playing the game so much I don't feel the need to "save time".\n\nThe one problem I experienced was with the confirmation email, which I am sure they will fix shortly.  Usual launch day errors, and all.  Sad that we have come to expect them, but alas, it didn't take long to figure out.\n\nLike I said, I haven't been in the game for a short while so far, but I have a strong feeling that I will be playing it for a long, long time.  I intend to update this review once my opinion hardens with time.\n\nEarly Impressions: 10/10  You should definitely give this game a shot.","February 5, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are some balancing issues still going on and as with most new games its in "Open Beta" but I have come across no real bugs so far.\n\nFirstly DoWO is a f2p turn based strat game focused mainly around 1v1 pvp. There are solo and training missions to help you out at the start also. Currently you can chose from 3 player races basically the good, the bad and the ugly. (Humans, undead and wolfmen). This is set to grow to 9 player races. Each race has unique skills/ magic/ traits made with a far degree of imagination. You build up and manage your guild of mercenarys by leveling them up through experience earned during matches. Each match is at either 250 AP (army power), 400 AP (ranked level) or 800 AP (big crazy army power). There are 3 modes currently; Deathmatch (14 rounds at 60 seconds each round total but they dont normaly last this long), Elimination (basically a head hunter mission to take out a marked taget on the enemy team) and King of the Hill (fight for a point on the map).\n\nThe game IS completely free to play as you can buy EVERYTHING with ingame money - even the ingame shop money you can earn through the ranked matches - and I do like to see a real f2p game from time to time.\n\nOverall if you like turnbased strategy games with a competitive pvp feel I recommend you try this one out\n\n","March 24, 2014","true","39.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game still lacks polish but if the current state is any indication of how it'll look in the future you should be very excited.\n\nComplaints about the Wolfen should be mostly disregarded.  Predator of Blood is overpowered but manageable.  Everything else is strong but balanced for its price.  The 200 AP bracket isn't well-balanced and if you plan to stay there (not recommended, 300+ is much more fun) it's a good idea to specialize to take down the ubiquitous dogs.  Necromancer, Skull Warrior, and two Skeleton Swordsman will make short work of most wolfen with good tactics.  Play defensively.  Keep your swordsmen up front and when the dogs engage surround them with morbid puppets (don't put puppets up front, they'll get one-shotted and allow a pursuit attack) and bring in the skull warrior to put them down.\n\nPast 200AP the game is much more balanced. Wolfen are still strong but soon become heavily outnumbered with their high AP costs and encirclement negates most of their stat advantages.  When you add in the "dogs are op" popular opinion and the kinds of players that brings in, wolfen are no big deal.  Most players can't play them to their strengths and will just get them bogged down and killed.\n\nWith any game like this the first question is always "Is it p2w?"  Thankfully in this case it's definitely not.  Almost everything in the game is available for in-game money at a decent price.  The AP system means that wallet warriors end up stuck in 800AP with other wallet warriors.\n\nGood game!

It's still in beta, so we'll see how balance turns out and if it's pay to win or not, but I find this game to be promising. Besides, the price to give a try is $0.\n\nAs of now(2/17/14), all units are buyable by in game currency that you can grind or with real money. There's no need to spend any real money, but I guess it would get you units faster.

The graphics are choppy, yet the movement and attack animations take an enormously large amount of time to execute.  I'd be okay with this if there were some sort of "Skip movement/animation" option, but alas there isn't.  The result is pvp battles that could put a 10 year old on coffee to sleep, and PVE battles so lengthy that you'll wonder why you don't get any reward for them.\n\nAll of this aside, where this game really lacks is its balancing and enormous range of luck that's involved in matches.  I won 12 out of the 18 matches I played, and every time I felt no sense of victory.  It wasn't because of my tactics that I won, but the blind luck of parrying and dealing multiple hits, and that isn't what I like to see in my tactics games.\n\nIn conclusion, I give Dogs of War Online a 5/10.  If you can afford literally any other tactics game, then I strongly suggest you play that instead.","February 25, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

There are quest, where u send a soldier for 24 hours to get some silver. the single player figths are prett easy, but not awarding anything.\n\nPvp is quite fun, but it take so much time, to get silver for better units. units get xp to get better skills. the balance system is good, cause each unit has points and their are limits in a few steps. so u can build an army close to an limit and u will be fine.\n\nbut the figths are luck based. a good tatctic can help u to win, but u learn it fast. so it is again luck based if u win.\n\nwhy i not recommend this game:\nit is pay to win, u can try to get same with investment of lots of hours and days. So u have to start the game once a day to send ur troops to quests, and do a couple of pvp till u win, so u get all bonus silver available each day. but the progress is very slow, the pvp figths are boring and the quest are stupid.","March 7, 2014","false","15.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I played about 10 matches with each starting faction. Won 1. lost MANY. It had nothing to do with strategy. It was the fact that I got parried or dodged. Then took massive damage from my opponents time and time again. I actualy laughed out loud so hard the whole house heard me and thought I was watching OJ running from the cops on youtube. And in losing so badly.. I got injuries. which to most dont seem too bad. but mine wanted me to have 9 cards to remove them? holy crap.. that's a lot of in game money for a beginner. So I deleted my company and made a new one... same thing kept happening. To the point where I'm scared to even buy a new unit. He'll just get injured and I'll have to get rid of him. So I'm stuck playing with the same starter army and no upgrades in sight. I think the game just hates me. If you're a strategy expert.. this might be for you and it might be great for you since it's such a pain. But if you're not a total copmlete badass.. you'll need real money to make it anywhere sadly. Which is why I have to give a thumbs down. I really wanted to like this game because there's not many out there like it. :(","February 4, 2014","false","5.7"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","4"

The game revolves around a lot of luck, races are highly imbalanced, and this is a P2W game. Don't let the good reviews deceive you, as you play your army will get injured and it's very expensive to heal their injuries. Eventually you'll go broke using your in-game currency to heal those injuries, meaning you'll have to go into battle with an injured army, making you lose more frequently which ends up giving you even more injuries. It's just a little scheme for them to force you to pay for their game. Good luck trying to recruit a more powerful army with this horrible mechanic.\n\nThe tutorial is also horrendous and the way that they word the tooltips for abilities is so overly complicated. In the game there are also missions, which are equivalent to growing crops in Farmville. Yet unlike Farmville, going on a mission is pretty expensive and there is even a possibility that you can fail. You'd think that waiting a day, disabling a soldier during that period, and losing your money was bad enough, they even give your soldier a chance of obtaining an injury! I do not recommend this game, let it die off like the rest of the P2W games.","February 9, 2014","false","14.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Next turn u can either go stand next to him and not get an atk by using sprint and losing your atk phase to only get ♥♥♥♥♥ in the face the next turn or u can retreat. so u retreat. he then stands +2 movement away from u again. eventually he gets to move 6 and atks u twice. ur then engaged. u can use an abilty to run and not atk or u can fight. so u fight cause u been running all game. his next move happens hits another units twice. its on half health. if he was lucky enough to atk the same unit its dead and he gets another atk phase with the unit that just killed your unit. so in total he gets 6 atks with 2 movement phases 2x2atk and +2 atk from one atk of oppertunity vs ur 2x1atks (which for all of u that cant count is = too 2) from your basic melee class.\n\nit takes roughly 4 atks to kill a unit. which he does in 2 movement phases.\nu need 4 movment phases to kill a unit. but after ur 1st movement phase one of your units is already dead because he always gets to engage u 1st. then he atks u again. this has a compounding effect as on his 3rd turn he will get 4 atks (another dead unit with another atk of oppertunity for him).\n\n\nits one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance issues i have ever seen. if u give a unit +2 movment its strong point is reaching the engagment and stoping archers/casters from doing there stuff. so why the hell would he give them and extra atk in a game when u kill a unit u get to go again... i had fun but your game is broken... when i asked what the hell was up with this... people in the lobby were rude and not helpfull..\n\ngame had some potential but u cant do stupid stuff like this... or ur games gonna fail in the ♥♥♥!","April 25, 2014","false","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Uses a point based system to build armies much like some tabletop games and is quite easy to get the hang of. Strategy isn't too indepth or complex, but it has enough variety in units, skills, and spells to make you question what combinations could work well together. The level up system is also neat in that it lets you further customize your more battlehardened units.

For one thing, it is a free game, and (almost) everything can be unlocked with in-game currency. Even then, the system gives users 'cyans' (cash currency) for participating in the leaderboard.\nThe strategy is pretty deep - I will not say that this game was easy to learn at first. There are many little things that affect how the battle will turn out. It isn't EVE Online level of learning curve, but it can be difficult at times. Sometimes it is actually optimal to keep your units slightly weaker so you can fit other units in.\nThe different factions are fairly well balanced for a game that is in an open beta. that being said, there are only three so far but there is promise of up to nine different sides availble.\nUnits have a decent range of customization - you have the option to name them, recolor them, and choose talents as they level. However, leveling your units can sometimes be a bit of a grind - AI isn't the best. If you want a challenge from the computer, try fighting armies significantly larger/more powerful than your own.\n\nOverall, a very good turn-based strategy game from the makers of the Blood Bowl series. Definitly has potential to one of the better free to play experiences, at least within it's niche.","April 12, 2014","true","66.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game feels like I’m playing Mordheim.  You will pick a starting war band from one of the three factions and you'll hit play.  You set up the match you are looking for and you get put with a real person and engage in some great PvP turn based tactical gameplay.\n\nYou can also train and play some PvE matches/scenarios.  There is a list of PvE matches to play and have fun with.\n\nWhen you are done with the matches you can send your units on missions. (Kind of like in Mordheim)  You send one of your units off on a mission to gain you ducats (in-game money) and there is a chance of success or failure (unit injured).\n\nThe game is NOT pay-to-win.  I have played under 20 matches and I've already purchased 3 or 4 figures with in-game money I earned from the matches I played.  You buy more figures so that you can draft a higher point army.  They give you a standard 200 point army and you build from there.\n\nIf you are a table top war game fan you have nothing to lose here.  It's free, give it a try.  I think you'll like what you find.","February 11, 2014","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I feel that most opponents played wolves with a team of 2, meaning they are a bit over-balanced (8 of 10). One player played human and one played undead. Win/loss seems to be based more on a lucky initiative roll than on how well you position your offense and defense. It takes a very long time to set up and go, and the mouse cursor is slow as well.\n\nI needed to go through the tutorials more than once to get the instruction, and the controls seemed less-than-intuitive. I wished for better options to get to the 200AP total for a team composition. I think I'd prefer to have 200AP to buy attributes for my soldiers and spread them a bit for my own control/tactics/preference. Then I could have 1 really strong soldier with 40hp or 10 really weak ones with 40hp each.

It's strategic, it's complex and has a lot of depth. The lore and setting is also very compelling. If you ever played Heroes of Might and Magic and always wished to play JUST the combat moments this is definitely the game for you. Plus, against real people.\n\nI hope they can make a great campaign and bring a lot of players as in the beta, I struggled to find real players to play against.","January 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have big fps drops every time I move a unit, on quad 3.8 cpu with 660 GTX graphic card. I can run starcraft 2 on ultra and CS:GO with 100fps average, but not dogs of war tho.^^\n\nProps to the idea of a game but it's still in early phase of a development if you ask me. For a second, please imagine Heroes of Might and Magic game and the amount of units and content when it was released in 1990's, now look at Dogs of War release in 2014.

After completing the tutorials you are told to pick 1 of 3 factions with 0 explanation to the differences or benefits they offer.\n\nSo I have my faction and still no real idea on how to play this game I look for an AI battle to practice only to find the ONLY gameplay is to play against other people over the internet. So I clicked find a game and waited..and waited and after 10 minutes it finds me a game! However it appears my opponent had been playing a lot more than me - he explained that my army was not good enough to compete against his and I would ultimately lose. He explained that there is 0 tactics in the game...the person with the biggest army wins especially in the first 5 levels as you are literally fighting in an open field.\n\nSadly he was right...He obliterated my army with 0 skill...right click this big guy to attack my small guy and *poof* down he goes. My only positive of this game was the nice conversation I had with this guy and how we both laughed at the fact Kings Bounty is a much better game.\n\nTL;DR - Dont waste your time, go play Kings Bounty if this type of game appeals to you. There is no skill involved and you can literally buy (with real cash) a big army and win every game.","February 5, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The game play is average, at most and the wolf faction is a dominating force in the game.\n\nBasically you have to familarize yourself with all enemies because you never know what you're up against otherwise. I'm fighting my way through skeletons with my Tank and then a skeleton with a big sword hits me twice in one turn with a 20 and a massive crit, enough to 'one shot' me at full HP. Spent the rest of my game d**king around with my archer taking 2's off their knight and using my knights as fodder. Wolves get an innate 2 hit passive, which is game breaking. Not only are they naturally better at combat but they also move more places. People might say "that's reasonable because they're wolves" but I'd tell those people to get lost and after they've gotten lost to play this game against wolves and still genuinely tell me that you prefer some quarter-arsed realism over balancing and enjoyment.\n\nI picked the humans because they seemed most mid-ground and even the tankiest. They are dominated in every way at the start game and there is little you can do against players except hope you get lucky. The wolves need to be dampened and the undead already have MASSIVE numbers and free units. Why give them a massive c**t that can hit me for half or more of my HP that's ALSO a tank? More movement spots is balanced. More attacks is not. More numbers is balanced and fun to play with and against. Equally strong units but the ability to spawn in more is not.","February 20, 2014","false","6.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
