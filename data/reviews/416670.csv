"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093215211/recommended/416670/","76561198093215211","Robertson Crusoe","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093215211/","548 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEdit, 07.01.2016: In short: So the energy system is gone, since there were many negative reviews stating precisely that this kind of mechanic does not belong on steam. (Good work people. Speak out that we do not want steam to become a semi-Facebook.) Hence, I edited parts of my review. But in sum, I still find the game to be too repetetive, shallow and cannot overlook the fact that you can only craft a tiny amount of free stuff, while there is a p2w marketsystem in place aswell. Again: I'd rather pay for customization, knowing that we all have the same chances, than paying for superiority.\n\n+ Fallout-esque artwork. The maps look alot like a polished Fallout 1 or 2. Or a apocalpse-themed Jagged Alliance 2.\n+ Turn-based combat. Every team has 20 seconds for its actions. Thats more than enough, keeps the game at a great pace and opens various strategy options.\n+ Lots of skills already. You can upgrade your merc with exp and ingame currency. So you do not have to spend any dime to advance. You can freely choose how to spent the exp. Also, when your merc levels up, you can spend 3 points per level on his abilities to upgrade him or her even more.\n+ 5 different classes. Sniper, tank, scout, medic/tank and grunt.\n+ Tactical gameplay on different maps. You will probably see some of the maps but currently their are not too many gamemodes.\n+ Short loading times. There is barely no loading time. You can hop in and out without having to wait a longer period of time.\n+ Nice soundtrack. Even if I do not understand a word, I can still feel that the soundtrack fits into the game and compliments it.\n\n- Ingame cash for superior items. Cash items do have better stats and give great advantages over regular items. Like better evasion, higher damage output, more health, you name it. Sort of "pay 2 win" or "pay 4 advantages".\n- Limited Energy mechanic. Not sure why this is in place. While you can buy the ingame currency, gold and premium time with real money, there is also a limited amount of energy. That means, you have like 500 energy units, a battle costs 5 energy units, traveling the map costs energy units. I did not make it to the limit, but it confuses me that its even there.\n- Low playerbase. I know this game just launched, but with the current playerbase its hardly fun. Most of the times, each team has one real player and the rest is filled up with bots. Yes, bots. There is no way around them unless you want to wait 4 hours for the matchmaking. But the A.I. is really annoying since they will constantly run into their deaths and feed the enemy team. So, after all is does not make a huge difference if you play in any tactical way.\n- Capture mode is a pain in the bottom and has nothing to do with strategy. Its basically spamming spawns, rushing to the capture point and standing next to each other spamming AOE damage. Thats not fun. Not at all.\n- Grindy. Very grindy. That would not be a problem if the matches were engaging and exciting. But since you basically shoot bots all the time it quickly becomes a mind-numbing process.\n\nIn sum: While there is a great game that could be alot of fun, there are various mechanics that do not feel right at all. Instead of paying for customization, like in LoL or other games where the items are strictly only cosmetics, you can buy better items with real money. You could also get those items by playing the game and logging in daily, but it would probably take a year and you would always be the "worse equipped" merc in your rated game. Also, the energy mechanic makes no sense at all. Why make the player pay for items aswell as for playtime? So after you bought an item, you still have a limited period of time until you have to either close the game or pay more money. With that mechanic, I don't understand how the playerbase shall grow, since many players will have to shut down their game and will eventually be annoyed.\nLike other players stated, features like this are known for facebook or such but do not make sense on steam. I'd rather pay to customize my merc in a non-p2w way than have to pay to keep up and to keep playing. So, I cannot really recommend this game, even if it looks so gorgeous and could be so much fun.","December 19, 2015","false","11.0"," 229 of 246 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","229","246","10","6"

IT HAS AN ENERGY MECHANIC LIKE MOBILE GAMES DO. if you like being confined to short ammounts of play time, ever shortening as you get further and further in the game and actions cost more, then by all means have fun with this other wise avoid it. Gameplay wise? live action TBS game where each side players take turns at will and then "rest" while waiting for there team mates to finish. Then its the other sides turn. Thats ok and so is the combat its sorta like a stop and go FPS with people trying to get in range, or flank, or in cover. That part is fun... unless the other team has bought ♥♥♥♥ from the store which gives them a distintive advantage... then its not so much fun.  Again thou all of this is a joke thou when you can only spend so little time playing before the energy runs out and you have to wait to play again and we all know the nature of energy mechanic dependant games now dont we? after seeing them on the mobile so much we know that actions will cost more and more and your energy pool will not increase or does so little that in the end your forced to pay money to reset the energy so you can play again. sounds like fun? like i said then have at this otherwise PASS","December 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 118 of 141 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","118","141","5","4"

I was leading scorer on most of the first games played without spending a dime. I liked the game so much that I did spend a little later, but there are no items i can buy that give me a major advantage over the free players. I unlocked a character and got "premium" for a week which gives faster xp and money, most of the items are bought or manufactured with the resources that you earn from grinding. If there are negative reviews complaining about pay to win that is pretty much false. even though i level faster with premium, i am matched with similar leveled players and have no advantage over them. The game is a little crashy right now, its crashed a couple of times a day, but it is less than 2 months into early access at time of writing. The game-play is sort of turn-based team battles with fun skills / mechanics. it is sad that some will give this a negative review based on the fact that there is any way to spend money at all, as if the developers should forget any chance of profiting and make everything 100% free. those people do not help the gaming industry. give this game a try if you like action-packed turn based shooter battles. you can have loads of fun without paying any money and if you are willing to grind you can indeed be one of the top players with free play. skill matters.","February 13","true","76.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It could be better in some places, while others can just be improved by just a little bit. It's close to Fallout 1 and 2, very similar to Planatary Conflict. I understand that I'm playing this in Early Access so keep that in mind if your read this.\n\nCharacters: There are currently a total of 5 playable characters, with their own special classes, Sniper, Scout, Medic, Robot (tank), and Infantry (assault rifle). Every character plays "TRUE" to their class, however there really isn't much in class improvments other than 8 skills in each class. Sure you can upgrade those skills and become amazing, but players don't have freedom to customize their characters. Yes you have the 8 skills you can level up. but when you max out your scout or whatever, every scout is that damn same.\n+ Solid Class with strong builds, but lacks customization\n-  Unffortunatly there are only 1 male and 1 female character model in the game that is reused for everyone (+1 robot)\n* This can be fixed by giving the classes like maybe 12 skills instead, but your character can't have all the skills when they max out. The player will have to choose what they want to build. That way i'm not using the same tactics over and over again to deal with the same type of class everytime.\n\nEquipment: Weapons can be unlocked by getting kills with your weapon. The more you kill the faster you and unlock it. The same goes for grenades and first-aid. Using the two will unlock better grenades and health-kits. Weapons and armor can be upgraded and improved, this is great and all but, once you finish upgrading an item, you can't progress farther with them anymore. You'll have to acquire the next teir of items. Also you can't choose the type of upgrdes you want to put on the item. The item has a set list and thats it.\n* MORE WEAPONS (you can never have enought weapons)\n- Weapons are unbalanced - (sure I'm still in the beginning of the game and what not, but I've been watching the game and the damage going around and i've noticed that damage on a weapon don't really mean much in the end) most of the time it's the class and it's specail skills that determine the effectivness of a weapon. Yes the weapon does have it's own stats and power that gives you that edge. However, my scout has been murdering "EVERYTHING" with only the second sub-MG in the game. I'm able to crit for 300+ DAM normal and 600+ DAM skill at lv.3. (normal damage around 150 avg) Meaning at this level, I can 1 shot kill, or take out 90% of their health, not to mention I get to attack twice as a scout. On my turn, someone is probably going to die... I feel great when I'm doing this, but I rather pvp in a balanced world where the player's mental ability is the key to victory and not the math you do to max out your damage.\n\nGameplay: The game is actually pretty straight-forward. Move behind cover, shoot the enemy, and sometime capture a point. It's a top-down grid locked tactics pvp is what it boils down too. With smart plays and a good team, you can really do alot of crazy thing even though the classes are somewhat limited. Reguardless, the gameplay is solid. I understand the this game is still in early access, but i really hope to see the following...\n+ Moveable Objects\n+ Destructable Enviornment and Cover\n+ Ammo and Reloading\n+ Mines and Traps\n+ Go Prone\n+ Higher and Lower elevations\n+ Smoke and Fog to reduce visibility\n+ Difficult Terraine and Damaging Terraine\n+ Capture the Flag (game mode)\n(damn if anything, just one of these will do)\n\nMy only main concern are all the micro transactions in the game. It feels like the type of pay to win kind of game. However, if you can acquire all the items without spending a single penny then this game will have a prettly long life... untill you run out of energy and can't play anymore.\n\nYEAH WTF IS THAT! THAT MY #1 "WHY THE HELL DID YOU THINK THATS A GOOD IDEA TO ADD THIS INTO THE GAME!" MOMENT. Get rid of the damn energy bar. I can understand the energy being there to doing jobs, moving through the map, this and that. BUT THIS IS A PVP GAME YOU GUYS MADE! It's already a free game with your micro transactions everywhere, now you want us to PAY TO PLAY after a certain amount of time. In all honesty, I won't. I really like this game, I do, even at this stage. But when I can't play your game when I'm out of energy, I'm going to play another game and spend money there... hate me if you want... I'm just being honest.\n\nTo everyone else. Play this game, it is worth it. Reguardless of what i've said. With typo's and all.","December 20, 2015","true","27.3"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"

Highlights of my time here include; Rage, Furious masturbation to the incessent and unrelenting music, Oh how I long to hear that russian Beauty sing that ♥♥♥♥ing song one more time. Don't let me get started on the eurphoric effect of hearing the same Gun shot sound when hovering over your mecenary. I like how you kept the menus nice and basic. In this awkward mashup of X-COM and Fallout with it's Fallout Tactics look. I want to wholeheartedly thank the devs for tossing me into a battle of the Gods during my first battle.\nExcellent way to burn time in this Pay to Wi- I mean 'Freemium' game. Before the battle you have the option to buy OP upgrades not to meantion the lack of progrssion, you get two standard gears to buy in the store, roughly progressing, from 5k hear to 10k gear, then suddenly it cuts off and  youre forced to buy gear for an INSANE 50k + What the ♥♥♥♥! NOT TO MENTION THE AI IS ♥♥♥♥ING STUPPPIDDDD. Some players NAMELY SCOUTS RUN IN WITH NO REGARD FOR LIFE, The cover system is pointless unless youre a sniper.\n\nTo their credit, Each class relies on the other class, eg. Snipers rely on scouts to provide vision, and Scouts rely on cover fire from snipers etc. And then there are the tanks, nuff said, nobody targets the tanks because they are giant walls of health that miss every ♥♥♥♥ing shot and should only be attacked when desperate.\n\nFinal verdict: 4/10.

It reminds me of games like Jagged Alliance and Fallout:Tactics, the amount of content is great and adds a ton of replay value. The only thing that I can see being an issue is the pay to win items you could get in the game, this throws balance out the window and can cause the game to be difficult for casual players.\n\nIn terms of game play itself it's spot on and to the point, I still feel as though this particular game should be an iPhone or droid game mainly because it's simple and to the point.

It's considerably shallow and the gear definitely feels pay-to-win.\n\nAs if the above was not enough, this game was so bad they actually hid their one lone achievement: "No More Kittens."  I'm safely assuming from what I've researched online that you have to kill five kittens to unlock it.

Here we go.\nGunslingers is...basically X-Com, but not X-Com. Ya know?\nIt loads pretty quickly, faster than most browser games I know of.\nIt's basically a\nX-com PvP Game with no Aliens. Everyone's a mercenary. So I'll list the good.\nPros-\nNice and simple. Open game. click Battle, choose mercenary, grab some items, join game.\nIt's alrightish BGM for the lobby area type thing.\nGraphics aight.\nGives you some AFK system type thing where you can send your peeps to do some stuff for extra XP, money, or upgrade money (???).\nJohn (the first dude you get, the sniper) He's pretty OP.\nLeto (the medic) She's also OP.\nMatches end quickly\n\nNow...the not so good.\nCons:\nLeto's OP. She's the medic. she can camp behind someone, and heal them all day...or herself and hardly die.\nJohn's OP. He's the sniper. He can camp as far as needed, go into Sniper mode and hit you for 130-140 damage a turn.\nScout girl isn't fun at low levels, don't use her. Just send her for EXP.\nRobot is just robot.\nOther guy...who even uses him.\nOh, you have to get Gold to unlock them. Not in-game money. Real Cash money. The 3 others, (Leto, Robot, and Other Guy)\nIt's basically P2W.\nBOTS. OH MY GOD. BOTS RUIN THIS GAME. "oh no they don't" OH YES THEY DO. BOTS RUN FORWARD, NOT IN COVER. RUN RIGHT TO THE MIDDLE, EVERYONE ELSE ♥♥♥♥ING KILLS THEM. GG. Do you know how not fun that is?\nScenario:\n14-14 Team Deathmatch(whatever it's called).\nBot runs in (From your team), gets blown up. You lose. Half the time they're just scout bots dying over and over.\n\nTL;DR - P2W PvP Mercenary Pew Pew With Bots\nI'd give it a maybe.","December 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Absolutely. Hopefully with this game being in early access, they will respond to the community’s gripes with them and remove them, because this game has potential to be good, real good.

Ontop of that, the developers are ghosts. If you try to find their website or anything about this game you can't.

Like many "Free, but pay to play" games it suffers from numerous flaws limiting playability for those who are not ready to dig into their wallets. The availability of equipment and additional hirelings is non-existant or extremely unless you shell out real bucks. The turn based interface is slow and sometimes non-responsive. The AI controling the non-player controlled characters is dumber then an intellectually challenged kumquat.  You get to control only one character, so all your team is AI controlled. This means all your team is usually slaughtered as they rush directly into automatic fire without thought for cover. The enemy tend not to be as dumb. Also very limited carrying capacity means you are quickly out of medkits and/or grenages.  The only real way to get money and EXP at first is long (8 Hr) farming sessions in the "job" section during which you may as well watch grass grow for excitement. Even after the rewards are limited so multiple farmign sessions are required to get equipment and skills increased.  Finally, the extremely bad Russian singing in the background does not add to the appeal, might as well have a recording of a cat being molested/tortured. Luckily I did not spend any money on this, or else I woudl have been screaming refund.

You have no choice but to wait, watching until you find what you're looking for and this can take months for a single piece of gear.\n\nThe game is p2w but only if you want to play in the tourney, or if you're up against older players. In random battles you almost always go up against bots who's armor, health, and weapons scale with your own. This means you don't need gear at all to win most of the time.\n\nThere is no difficulty, and no need for strategy thanks to the poorly coded bots. And for the most part whichever side uses the most grenades will always win as bots don't use them.\n\nAnd then there is the prices of the cash shop, which lets you buy wulong, gold, or premium time. It is expensive to buy the gold which is needed for the top gear in-game. $100 will buy you 3k gold. The best weapons in the game for each of the 5 toons cost about 1.5k-1.8k gold + 500 - 1k gold to fully upgrade. The top armor costs about 700 - 1.5k gold a piece + w/e is needed for upgrades. (or so i been told) To give you a better idea, this means it costs about $300 to fully equip 1 toon and an extra $100 is needed for each extra toon as the armor can be swapped between them.\n\nIn the past the older players where actually able to get the top gear much easier and cheaper, so a lot of the older players already have the full set of top notch gear. For the new player however, its much harder because the gold that is needed is just part of the problem, you will also have to wait for the item to show up in the shop. This can take months or even years for a full set regardless of how much gold you buy. Because you don't need gear at all to play and win against bots there is really no reason to buy gold at all.\n\nNote: To clear up a few things I read in other reviews, there is no longer an energy mechianic it's done away with. Also a few people have played for a few hours and said you need money to unlock all the toons, this too is incorrect. While it's true that you start with 2 of 5 toons and you need 150 gold to unlock each of the other 3, you also earn free gold by playing the game and leveling up the toons you have, as well as free gold from the daily logins. You make 125 gold every time you take a toon to level 10 and you have 10 generations as well. So a f2p player can earn 1250 gold from each toon x 5 different toons for free. No real money is needed.","April 12","true","588.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
