"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/357840/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Zombie Camp: Last Survivor is a shooter... where you stand by your position and kill zombies, skeletons and... well giant bosses. The goal? Survival during 10 waves! And while you begin only with a pistol, you can gain xp and money to unlock new weapons, upgrade them and resplenish them.\n\nRight now, there is only two levels: a graveyard and a farm (or medieval town, choose what you think it's best). But, in the end, you just want to kill them, because well, admit it, while you don't move and you just shoot and shoot and shoot, you want to beat the score.\n\nIt's a little game, perfect for breaks and for brainless moments. While the graphics aren't the best around, the zombies are still well done, the difficulty is well-balanced.\n\nThere are some bugs: it's hard to scroll your "upgrade" menu, the berserker view could stay during all a game because you paused in berserker mode, sometimes, I don't know why but it's changing weapons when I'm not even scrolling and the soundtrack is lacking during the waves. However, get past that and you'll have a little fun game. For the price, you aren't robbed.\n\nBesides, there is a giant COMING SOON for another landscape... so, wait and see!","April 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

Zombie Camp: Last Survivor is pretty much what you'd expect, by killing zombies, explosive zombies, skeletons, armored skeletons, even the almighty Skeleton King! The Farm or Medieval level, however, doesn't unlock until Level 15 but in the achievements it said Level 5 to unlock it, which I find quite odd.\n\nHas a few bits and pieces to fix, but this game is quite fun and I can't wait to see that last level that is coming soon in the future!","April 19, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tautology/recommended/357840/","tautology","tautology","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tautology/","1886 products in account","To start with the most negative and work our way up. The major problem with this game is that the control system is not fit for purpose. You are given an overly sensitive non-inverted mouse control with no option to change it. For those of us who grew up with flight sims this is fundamentally broken and makes it unplayable. This is basic, basic stuff that should be in every game with a first person perspective.\n\nThe game itself is basically about an hour or two of okay play followed by 6 hours of tedious grind to get the last two achievements, showing bad pacing from the developer.\n\nThe graphics and animation feel last millennium and the sound is annoying at best. In short, I've played better free flash games with more options.\n\nNeeds some serious work from the developer, like understanding the basic requirements that game players have.","May 29, 2015","false","9.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Stand still {there is only aim movement}\n2. Shoot zombies\n3. Grind\n\nBut it is entertaining nonetheless.\n\nIt's hard to be critical about a game that is at todays date $1.99 USD, that doesn't crash or suck memory. Some big name titles do that for $59.99 USD.\n\nSo if you like mindless killing over, and over and over again - get it\nIf not - avoid.\n\nOH, and it has achievements, essentially the main I reason I purchased it.

The game is incredibly basic consisting of only 2 levels with 10 waves each. It has an unlock system where you get a new gun every few levels, i had fun just grinding kills and upgrading them to max. i also like how you have to shoot the gems to get the money, adds a little challenge and desicion making to it. The upgrades are good, limited in what they are but work none the less, you can really tell when your weapon has been upgraded. However there are a LOT of problems with this game, making it virtually unplayable. First off your level gets stuck at 19 with 7xp to level 20. Next is the gun reload sound, it sounds like a slow mo grinding noise its horrible. Your gun dissapears when you look to far to the left or right. However none of that compares to the most annoying thing about this game, for no reason at all your gun will just change, you might have a sniper rifle out and you shoot and suddenly the weapons swapped itself to the shotgun. This is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥. If like me you have only the unlimited pistol ammo and ammo for the weapon youre using, then this game be deadly, its made me lose on several occasions because everytime i get the right gun out it just swaps it out again.\n\nI got this on a sale and i guess im okay with that, i wouldnt pay full price for it thought. My advice is wait till the game has been patched and new content is released. That said if a basic game is this bugfy then i wouldnt count on that stuff to much.","November 2, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
