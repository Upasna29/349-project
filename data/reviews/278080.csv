The total cost of the DLC is $190.80. I am not going to comment much about the DLC, as this is a review for the game, not the DLC. Yes, I think the price of the DLC is fairly high, but the DLC is optional and not needed to enjoy the game.\n\nI still think the game itself is worth getting without purchasing the DLC.\n\nHow it Runs:\nGame runs great on highest settings at 1920 x 1080 resolution, I get 60 FPS no problem.\n\nOverall, I haven't had any issues with slowdown or framerate drops that I usually see on the console versions. The loading times are also pretty quick compared to the console versions as well without a solid state drive.\n\nGame Settings:\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\nTexture Filter: High\nQuality Settings: All High\nVsync: 1\n\nNote: I had to set my resolution in the configuration instead of within the game.\n\n(See specs at bottom of page)\n\nStory:\nThe story is based off the Romance of the Three Kingdoms historical novel, but since it is a video game they have fantasy elements and change some things to make it more exciting.\n\nThe Story Mode has a bunch of cinematics before and after battles that help tell the story and they are alright for this type of game.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics seem to be based on the PS3 version of the game, but they still look better than the PS3 version due to higher framerate, resolution, and I think they added a few things in the graphic options that make them look a bit better.\n\nOverall the graphics are average for a console port of a game, but the gameplay is the best part of the Dynasty Warriors series.\n\nGameplay:\nThose who know the Dynasty Warriors series will be familar with the hack and slash gameplay. You can control a hero from a roster of 82 characters, each with their own individual design.\n\nThe game is mostly about using weapon attack combos to defeat hundreds of enemies and other officers through battles in the game. There is a lot of flashy effects for the weapon attacks and special musou attacks which make the game more exciting.\n\nYou can obtain new weapons to equip your warriors with and each warrior can use two weapons and switch between them in battle. You also can level up each warrior to level 150.\n\nThere are story missions for the three major kingdoms (Wei, Wu, Shu), and the Jin and Lubu forces. As well as a Free Mode to replay story and other battles, a Challenge mode that has arcade type battles, and Ambition mode where you can upgrade a camp and conquer territories.\n\nConclusion:\nI purchased the game because I am a fan of the Dynasty Warriors series and I don't own a PS3 or PS4, so I can't get Xtreme Legends unless I pay $50 for this on Steam or go out and buy a PS3 or PS4 and pay $60 for the PS4 version or $70+ for the PS3 bundle.\n\nThe graphics seem fine to me, they aren't amazing, but they aren't bad either. I played the Xbox 360 version of DW8 and they seem to be a bit better, but the graphics aren't as important as gameplay with the series.\n\nOnline multiplayer would've been a good bonus feature, but I don't think its a mandatory feature for the series. I have never played online in the past titles, I usually play solo or split screen. If you need to have online multiplayer then pick up the PS4 version instead.\n\nThe game has been running great and I haven't had any technical issues yet.\n\nOnly complaints:\n- DLC is now avaiable, but the price is a bit high (though the DLC is optional and not needed to enjoy the game)\n- Would be nice to see controller buttons instead of keyboard buttons when using a controller.\n- Depending on controller may need to remap your controls.\n\nOverall it is a good game if you are Dynasty Warriors fan or someone who likes hack and slash games. It is cheaper to buy the PC version (North America - USD) than the console version as well which is a plus. Should be glad they brought Dynasty Warriors 8 game to Steam!\n\nUpdate 1: There seems to be some people having issues with the game crashing, freezing, not starting up, etc. I haven't encountered any of these issues yet, game has been running perfect on my machine. However, I would check out the forums for more information about known technical issues if you think you may have a problem.\n\nUpdate 2: It seems many people are upset with the high DLC prices. These prices are very similar to the console versions, so its not just a PC thing. I do think the prices are too high, but the DLC is completely optional and not needed to enjoy the game. I would suggest waiting for a sale and only picking up some of the better DLCs (Weapon Packs / Stage Packs).\n\nNote: I would recommend using a controller when playing this game.\n\nComputer Specs:\nGPU: Geforce GTX 760\nCPU: Intel i5-3570K 3.40GHZ\nMemory: 8.00 GB RAM\nResolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz\nOS: Windows 7\nPSU: Corsair 750W","May 13, 2014","true","36.7"," 1,140 of 1,287 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","140","1","0","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/278080/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive "OMG ITS LU BU" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this "Complete Edition" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.","December 28, 2015","true","92.6"," 106 of 115 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","106","115","12","6"

Despite that I will still give a subjective review of the game.\nI loved it because you could just be a soldier in a battlefield, something I always wanted. The games have changed a "little" since then. Some for better some for the worst.\nAnyway lets start\n\nPros:  You can be a COMPLETE BADASS\n4 different modes with a lot of content\nA huge selection of different characters, each with their own unique weapon and moveset\nA huge selection of music\nOption for Japanese / English dub\nYOU CAN BE A COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥ING BADASS?!\nFull controller support (and the game is best played that way)\nCons:  False advertising\nOverpriced DLC\nSmall selection of resolutions\nIt's not that challenging (at least for me)\nCan get a bit tad repetitive\nDetailed version:\nThe game is based on the novel the romance of the three kingdoms which is based on the historical time period of china that the three kingdoms occured with a bit more fiction involved like magic and a few characters that didn't exist but the game includes all the major fights and events.\nYou are just a badass soldier in a battlefield, with godlike powers that can kick everyones ♥♥♥! Until Lu Bu comes along and kicks your ♥♥♥. Over 70 characters if I recall correctly and each has their own unique weapon and moveset. There is simply no way you won't find someone you like.\nThere are campaigns for every one of the three kingdoms. + The jin kingdom and a Lu Bu campaign. If you don't know who Lu bu is shame on you.\nEach campaign has the "true" path and what would have happened if (insert kingdom) had won (insert battle) plus a few extra stages that cover some other battles.\nIt also includes a free mode in which you can select whichever character you like, play whatever battle you desire siding with whatever army you like.\nAlso a challenge mode with a few other "mini games" per say which challenge you to beat a highscore and an ambition mode. Which is much more grindy empires version of the game. You select your character, build your own empire, fight and recruit officers etc.\nXbox controllers work just fine, I personally use PS3 with motionjoy, it works perfectly as well, I don't get why some other people have problems with their controllers.\nDid I mention the huge selection of badass music?\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThis is not a bad port but it is NOT a good one either. While it runs on 60 fps with no problems and everything on high and it looks "OK"  the game is being falsely advertised. The pictures in the previews are from the PS4 version while the port was from the PS3 version, it says that it has online coop but it is nowhere to be found. Only splitscreen.\nA lot of resolutions are missing, I mean how can you get THAT wrong.\nDon't get me started on the DLC. Overpriced garbage. Only 2 of them are worth it, the stages DLC but even those are still way overpriced.\nAnd finally a gripe I've had with these games since DW6. They are just a little bit too easy. You would expect at least enemy officers to fight normally but no they don't. They are but dolls for you to test your awesome movesets. High difficulties will make them hit a bit more but nothing crazy. It will mostly up their health. Dynasty warriors Strikeforce for the PsP has fixed this problem but another company makes that game. Since they are revamping dynasty warriors 9 I hope this problem will be fixed.\n\nFinal verdict:\nFor die hard fans of the series this is a must buy. For people who like hack and slash wait for a sale (50% off is more than ok) and buy it. You will have tons of fun but if you are not a fan of Hack n Slash this game is not going to change your mind about them.\n\nE: The new review system is god awful.","July 20, 2015","true","187.9"," 128 of 150 people (85%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","85","128","150","13","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/278080/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","There’s something sadistically enjoyable about killing thousands of warriors on the battlefield. And considering this is the first time I have ever played a full Dynasty Warriors game, I found it to be quite an enjoyable romp through the historical fiction Romance of the Three Kingdoms book.\n\nI don’t think I could coherently put into words how much fun each of the missions are in this game. The missions take place within some very famous battles that really did happen a long time ago, as well as multiple hypothetical scenarios. Each mission starts off in a small closed off area. The calm before the storm. The character can use this time to talk to NPCs, or buy weapons at the shop. Then as your character walks into the battlefield, all hell breaks lose. Story mode is where Xtreme Legends shines, as it makes the player feels as if they are experiencing the battles as if they occurred in real life. Sure one hero is killing thousands of enemies with an oversized paintbrush, but the flow of battles are modelled after a real historical event.\n\nSome may attack the series for predominately being a button masher. At first, I would have agreed with them. I was having quite an enjoyable time on Normal difficulty doing just that; button mashing. Then I decided to try out one of the harder difficulty levels. I sucked. It takes quite a lot of skill to conquer Dynasty Warriors on Hard or the more difficult settings, as it becomes less about plowing your way through enemies and more about balancing the multiple factions of your army, and responding to a range of urgent matters that need to be handled around the battlefields. It turns into a strategic battle. Spend too long in one spot and the battle will be lost, as the war still plays on around the player.\n\nOne of the best things about the gameplay is also one of the game's major flaws. These battlefields are enormous, and the number of characters that can inhabit the screen at any one time shows the scale of these environments. There were multiple times where all I could see was an ocean of infantry waiting to attack my lone soldier. Yet on some maps, it can easily take a few minutes to walk from one end to another, and when missions change on the fly that ask the player to travel to the other side of the map, it becomes a very dull trudge indeed.\n\nA big downside to the PC port is the unfriendliness of the control schemes. There are no button prompts for both keyboard and gamepad, and it makes the learning process a pain. Additionally, whilst playing co-op, two players have to share a keyboard. I don’t think I can remember the last game that delegated the arrow buttons and the number pad to player two. Needless to say, that isn't a whole load of fun.\n\nFor fans of the series (and the historical events the series is based upon) I have no doubt in my mind they would be happy with the included Encyclopedia alone. It is staggering how much content Tecmo Koei have been able to insert into this game. If I spent time to read all of the history and character descriptions, it would easily take a few hours. Dynasty Warriors 8 feels like a fan service, almost to the point of frightening off new players. In my experiences with games that feature a huge character roster, you’re slowly introduced to the cast, allowing you to experiment and decide which character plays best for you. With 82 characters to select from, the inexperienced player will be overwhelmed by the choice.\n\nIn addition to the wonderful story mode, Xtreme Legends offers a Challenge mode and Ambition mode. Challenge mode is pretty self explanatory - you'll be tasked with showing your skills through a range of scenarios, while Ambition encourages players to, as well as the on-field action, build a camp by using the resources they obtain from battles. They’re both not that fun to be honest, and I found myself quickly returning to the story modes.\n\nThe PC version of this game allows for players to tackle missions in split screen co-op. Sadly, all this does is cause the framerate to significantly drop. It also lessens the atmosphere that Dynasty Warriors tries so hard to create. I never felt like I was fighting an army in co-op when I was forced to squint at half my screen. Sadly, there is no form of online co-op, unlike in the console version, so if you want to play with friends you’ll have to battle on the same screen.\n\nAll said though, I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I got from Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. There is so much content that you could spend hours just trying to skim the surface. Although as I'm not familiar with the history I never fully understood what I was doing, it didn’t hinder my enjoyment. Both fans and newcomers to the series will have immense joy in fighting on this battlefield.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 22, 2014","true","57.5"," 129 of 154 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","129","154","0","3"

What's that?\n*Non-Playable character models still crappy, makes some cutscenes unwatchably bad.\n*Textures still largely low quality, giving game a very dated look.\n\nKoei is likely to see negative reviews like this and think:\n"PC gamers just don't want Dynasty Warriors"\nTo which I say:\n"Dear Koei; I wouldn't have bought it in the first place if I didn't want Dynasty Warriors on PC, you made top seller on your first day, but this is a terrible port and you people have a history of crappy ports and generally suck at supporting your games."\n\nSo that said, like many of Koei's other ports this game just falls short of all of the potential of the PC. It has no online multiplayer, inconsistent and often low texture quality on environments and especially on non-playable characters even during cutscenes, a unit limit far lower than what most PC's can handle, and no narration between missions (seriously how hard would that have been?). Some have also reported game crashing bugs, but I haven't encountered any.\n\nOn the positive character textures and models for playable characters tend to be pretty good, and there are a ton of characters to play and a wide variety of weapons to choose from, as well as several modes of play. Voice acting remains hilarious which I believe is intentional.\n\nHowever the lack of narration between missions really hurts immersion in the story and feels uncanny and painfully silent after the fully voice acted cutscenes and battle speeches. Poor textures and extremely limited number of units allowed on screen also both serve to make the game feel unpolished on the PC.\n\nThe lack of online multiplayer also really hurts the experience. Dynasty Warriors has tremendous potential here, and it's potential that is being entirely wasted.\n\nKoei has traditionally assumed that PC gamers just hate Dynasty Warriors, failing to understand that what PC gamers actually hate are broken glitchy terrible ports. Past PC ports such as Dynasty Warriors 6 Xtreme Legends were so broken that stores pulled them off the shelves, and received pretty much no support whatsoever.\n\nHopefully this game making top seller on Steam will show Koei that the market is there for games like Dynasty Warriors and their previous assumptions were fundamentally irrational non sequiturs.

Easily the best title in the series (at least since DW5).\n\nFor those new to the series, Dynasty Warriors (a.k.a. Shin Sangoku Musō) is, basically, a hack-n'-slash based on era of the Three Kingdoms of China, and the romanticized novel of the same name. In its stages, there are thousands of enemies of various calibers to mow down. You got your peons that go down in a few hits, your commanders that are a little tougher, your generic named officers that are a threat, and other playable characters that have the same abilities you do. You have a more-or-less equal amount of allies on your side, and how they fight is determined by your side's overall morale, which itself is determined by your performace. Each character has their own string of combinations, but I'll get into that in the next paragraph.\n\nBeing a combination of the base Dynasty Warriors 8 and the Xtreme Legends expansion, this game is chock-full of content. There is a wide variety in the 82 characters available to play, each with their own set of weapons, combos, 2 signature attacks, 3 Musou attacks and 1 devestating Rage attack. Levels are capped at 150. Over 220 stages (300 if you purchase the DLC) accross 60 different maps you get to play through Story and Free Mode. There are six factions, each having two Story Modes, the first of which branches into two different paths, the Historical and Hypothetical route. So that right there can take about 100 hours to complete. If that's not enough, you unlock additional stages to play in Free Mode as you play through each faction's Story Modes. Also, a wide selection of mounts and companion animals (several types and unique variants of horses, elephants, tigers, pandas, bears, attack birds, wolves, and Tenko from Toukiden).\n\nAnd then there's Ambtion Mode... the beef of the game. There are actually two parts to it, elongating this already-lengthy experience. It is a much less linear game mode. The first part invloves amassing enough materials in battle to build a town to please the Emperor, all while recruiting every single named officer in the game (There are 816, including the 82 playable characters). Developing your town leads to many advantages, notably the ability to customize weapons, either to put on a flashy lightshow, decimate crowds in seconds, or even one-shot even the toughest of opponents. Another important function is the return of bodyguards, who can protect you, go off on their own assault, defend important position, and use their own special skills (fire attacks, emergency support etc etc) on your command. You may select three out of the 816 (that includes the playable characters) to be your bodyguards in between battle. The second phase of Ambiton Mode involves conquering territory. Long-time fans will immediately liken Ambition mode to a very watered down version of the Empires spin-offs. If you like this game but grow weary of just hackin'n'slashin', look forward to that as well, since DW8: Empires is coming out Q1 2015.\n\nOn with the story. Divided into five factions (the sixth one is really just what-if scenarios for unaffiliated characters), you get to witness the conflicts that took place during the eras of the later Han and of the Three Kingdoms from Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin, and Lu Bu's perspectives (It covers battles from about 184 to 264 AD). That era in particular is very mesmerizing as it is, but Koei went the extra mile and added a hypothetical ("What-if this happened instead") route to explore the possibilities of how things could have been different as a result of YOUR actions. For example, Cao Cao suffered a infamous defeat at Red Cliff/Chibi. Saving the right people might just change that. I was very pleased with this.\n\nI have had my fair share of misgivings with some of the historical inaccuracies, bias towards Shu, and defamation of other factions (particularly Cao Cao) that have been a thing in earlier titles (you can thank the writer of the novel for this). I am happy to say that this is no longer the case by DW8. Each faction has been made likeable, with their own motives for doing what they do.\n\nNow, some people like to thrash the series for being a "mindless repetitive button-masher." I am one of those people that refute that claim. Most people who say that haven't played beyond "Normal" difficulty. Bumping it up to Hard from the get-go makes for a far more interesting experience, as you must then find the most effecive means of dealing with various situation. What playstyle works best with this character? What works best on crowds? How do you prevent your morale from plumetting since you can't just "mash button square to win" anymore? What works best against an officer on steroids? Ambtion Mode (notably the subjugations) have you make use of your three bodyguards to guard important positions that could easily fall since the morale bar is pretty irrelevant in that mode. Yeah. A lot deeper than just a "mindless button-masher".\n\nDub fans will enjoy a pretty solid cast of voice actors, and for those who prefer the good ol' consistent Japanese voice track, it is available as Free DLC.\n\nAlso, the music is just the bomb. Not only is this game's soundtrack solid by its own right, but fans of the older games might notice some of the music from the previous games are in this game as well. The hypothetical routes of each story mode feature music from DW2-DW6, and included as free DLC are old BGM packs for DW3-DW7.\n\nThe PC version is the only one to not suffer from any slow-down whatsover. Though your framerate may drop depending on your rig, lag is virtually non-existent.\n\nOf course, it has its fair share of cons, as well. The gameplay can grow repetitive if you're not invested in the small details enough or its story. That and Ambition Mode can get a liiiitle too grindy. Though, it's still a great way to blow off some steam. The naming can be a little deceiving for new-comers to the series (the game does NOT include the DLC available for purchase), and the DLC itself is rather pricey. Admittedly, this is a pretty niche title, for a niche audience. But all-in-all, if you can get past that, Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition makes for a solid gaming experience.","December 16, 2014","true","674.3"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","68","70","2","0"

The series is turning more and more casual, but I like it. I love mowing down hundreds of enemies at a time. I love the shiny special effects. I love the cheesy cut scenes. I love the iconic battle music. It’s hard to put all of it into words. Whenever I get bored of all the “deep” games, this is what I come back to. You should give a try too, of course with a controller. (Fix for rumble  here.)\n\nIf you like this game, you might want to check out the DLCs. Most of the them are cosmetic, with a few exceptions:\n\nJapanese Voice Option (free): this one is required since the English dub aren’t excellent.\n\nNew Stage & Camp Symbol Pack: This is the compilation of all 30 DLC stages released for Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends expansion on consoles in one DLC. If you’ve cleared all stages in DW8 Xtreme Legends Complete Edition, considering buying this if you want more. Some of these scenarios are very challenging, especially Battle Royale.\n\nNew Stage & Animal Pack: This is the compilation of 8 DLC packs for vanilla Dynasty Warriors 8 on consoles. Each pack is a remake of one classic Dynasty Warriors battlefield into 3 variant scenarios, one of witch will give a special animal in game upon completing a certain objective. So all in all 24 stages, Shu side Qi Shan is the most difficult of all.\n\nWeapon System & Upgrade Pack and Weapon System Pack: unlike “Unique/Powerful Weapon Packs” these are not weapon reskinned with slightly different attack value. These two DLCs gives you 9 new weapon system with completely different move sets. 9 actual new weapons. Keeps in mind, however, these 9 weapons will be incorporated in-game in the standalone Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires that is to be released on January 2015.

If all you have is a PC and you haven't played any games from the franchise since Warriors Orochi, then you owe it to yourself to shell out for this version. Especially if there's a steam sale or some such.\n\nDynasty Warriors 8 is uncomplicated yet deep, with a huge cast of characters just waiting to be experimented upon, each character with their own unique gimmick/playstyle. This really needs to be stressed: Omega Force, the developer of the series, has done a bang-up job establishing exclusive weapon mechanics for each of its 82 characters that will keep you engrossed in finding out how to best maximize your slaying prowess. They're introduced 3 at a time at the beginning of each stage in Story Mode and even their higher functions are unlocked through leveling, so you're never intimidated by having everything thrown to you at once.\n\nAt least, not in Story Mode. Outside of Story Mode are scores of extraneous game mechanics which ultimately add nothing to the game, forcing new enthusiasts to run to any of the (honestly quite excellent) player submitted FAQS for help. The weapon system in particular needs to go, where a character's fighting style will be based on the weapon rather than the character. So if Lu Bu is equipped with Guan Yu's crescent spear, he'll start fighting like Guan Yu. Meaning you can have Lu Bu jump around like a little girl by equipping him with, say, Daqiao's magical sticks. My point is that giving every character the choice of every weapon allows cheesing and actually takes away from the uniqueness of the characters. The focus of the game shouldn't be on inanimate objects anyways.\n\nThen there are game modes which will confuse potential players with poorly thought out goals, such as Ambition Mode. The levels are grindy, repetitive and mostly there for the gems and materials needed for upgrading your weapons or artificially leveling your characters. All the money you'll gain playing Story Mode will be spent on the faculties you've built in Ambition Mode, but you have to play Ambition Mode to get the materials that upgrade these faculties into something useful.\n\nTied to that is my huge disappointment stemming from my experiences playing ye olde Dynasty Warriors 3 on the PS2 in that for a game mode based upon the stated goal of reunifying China, there is little to no strategy involved at all! Ambition Mode introduces Bodyguards, friendly generals whom you can order around the map and change the course of a battle with their special abilities. In practice however, their influence on the battlefield remains minimal. So Ambition Mode becomes randomly generated stages where you unify China under a single Emperor by killing every Chinese general personally and thus bringing them forth to your cause. Bodyguards are a great idea on paper but suffers from no one on the development team having any faith behind it, leading to another extraneous and useless game mechanic.\n\nFree Mode is Story Mode but with added goals. Optional goals. And you can play with the Bodyguards unlike in Story Mode. But it's the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. Offers literally nothing that couldn't be added to Story Mode. Like I said: lots of useless clutter in this game.\n\nI (most probably) won't be buying a Wii U but it'll be interesting to see just how Hyrule Warriors compares to the Dynasty Warriors franchise. I remain optimistic in promoting DW8XL, though: as useless as the new options are, Hyrule Warriors doesn't seem to offer any new options themselves. And for all the mistakes that Omega Force have made, they have managed to create 82 characters each with their own engaging fighting style. And that is an achievement in itself.","October 25, 2014","true","386.3"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","45","56","2","2"

Most modern videogames usually have limited time to make campaigns but for this game each character you fight with has over 8 hours to complete depending on the difficulty. The voice acting is cheesy but it's mostly decent, the music in this game is awesome with all the guitar shredding & there are so many weapons to collect in the game it's ridiculous.

You might want to take this into consideration when choosing between the two games.\n\nDW is a game I highly recommend as a "casual" game. The good thing is its easy learning curve. Unlike other action games like DMC, you can learn the control and tactics rather quickly. On the other hand, "musou" series are often accused of being lawn mowing and key-bashing games that will make you bored. It's a personal matter depending on what kind of ACT fan you are. KOEI is trying to increase difficulty by adding challenges and annoying archers/wierd high-tech weapon into the game, but the point still stands. I personally am completely comfortable with the difficulty setting now, since KOEI has a challenge mode in the game that takes time to master (with rare drop reward). If you think this is too easy, either buy a mission DLC or switch to some other games -- almost every musou game might be relatively easy in the perspective of hardcore ACT players.\n\nWhat's new? I think this game is better optimized than its DW7 counterparts, so it has better performance on PC (unlike the previous game, DW8 does not have that "invisible soldier" glitch that makes your life miserable). It adds new characters and assign each of them an UNIQUE weapon, which is also better than DW6 and DW7. Most characters get less weird costumes. The weapon looting system is less time consuming compared with its previous counterparts and other looting games, since you can always utilize the blacksmith. It adds a rage gauge and a Rock-Paper-Scissor attribute system. The most important plot breakthrough is the introduction of a hypothetical mode, which generally integrates DW5, DW6 and DW7 stories into one game. Also, in story mode, you can now choose from several characters for each battle instead of the mandatory one.\n\nThat said, the story telling of DW8 is not as good as its previous games. I know KOEI hired a professional director last time, but the problem mainly comes from the hype route system. (I'll save spoilers here) Generally you have the option to save certain important generals in some historical event, where they are supposed to die. However, even if you fail, they die only after battle, so there are less heroic, tragic and epic death moments in the game. Still, the Wei and Lu Bu campaigns are well-organized and have some of the best developed characters.\n\nPS1: If you are new to the game and now facing the massive population of ancient Chinese generals/beauties, don't expect them to be that balanced. It's now a co-op and do have some dudes that are hard to master. Some of them are clearly OP, and the most OP one is a little pretty lady instead of the mighty Lu Bu or Guan Yu. This game is good for giving you a variety of options.\n\nPS2: Some people might find the game a little insulting due to how easily a large number of soldiers get killed, and some might be insulted by certain actions of some characters. I'm personally fine, but anyway.\n\nPS3: It's highly recommended to wait for a discount. KOEI is not known for lowering price easily and it charges every DLC for a considerable amount of bucks. I only recommend the mission DLCs since they add lots of challenge to the original game. Other additional contents are likely to appear in the DW9 anyway.","November 3, 2014","true","488.4"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","43","53","2","0"

Be warned, however, this game is NOT for everyone.\n\nA lot of people call this "mindless hack and slash gameplay". They're really not correct in this judgement, and are, in fact, being pretty ignorant towards the series.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's address the combat. I believe there are 83 characters in this game. Each character can carry two weapons. For the first weapon, you ALWAYS want to have their 'Ex' weapon equipped. This is the weapon they perform the best with, and gives you access to special attacks, called 'musous'. With these weapons, you will have better attack power, better combos, better everything. So with one of these weapons per character, it in turn translates to 83 UNIQUE MOVESETS IN HE GAME. Of course, you can equip any weapon you'd like as your second weapon, so go crazy!\n\nWeapons also come in many different forms. I believe there are 6 different ranks of weapon, measured in stars or dots. This determines both the rarity of the weapon and how powerful they are. 6th tier weapons were added in Xtreme Legends; before this edition you could only go up to 5th level weapons. There are a ton of weapons in this game, so if you like weapons, this game's got it. Additionally, each weapon has 1 of 3 'affinities'; heaven, earth, or man. This is basically a rock, paper, scissors type deal. You want to have a weapon equipped that is strong or equal against the opposing officer's. That's why you have two different weapons; both having a different affinity so you'll NEVER be at a disadvantage.\n\nLike I said before, there are a lot of unique movesets and warriors in the game. This keeps the combat fresh, with all the combos you'll be able to pull of and special attacks to try out. On the harder difficulties, you CANNOT just mash buttons and hope to survive. This is why I absolutely hate when people call this game a "button masher". There is legitimate strategy and skill to this game once you put enough time to access the hgher difficulty tiers.\n\nThe actual gameplay revolves around a battlefield each time. Think of it sort of as a third-person real-time combat strategy game. There are different strongholds or forts scattered across the map. If you defeat the officer inside of that fort, you'll capture it, and your soldiers will spawn there. This is how you gain more troops to overcome the opposing army you're fighting. Then, you have more powerful officers of the opposing army you have to take down, and various other objectives to complete. These all happen in real-time, so pay attention to your map in order to know what your current objective is.\n\nThere's also a ton of content in this game. There's your basic story mode which has SIX different storylines to play. Each storyline additionally has extra, "What-if" scenario stages that really add to the replayability of the game. That's not all, though! There's free mode, which let's you play as any character in any story. Mostly used for levelling up, still nice.\n\nThen there's ambition mode. This is completely new to Dynasty Warriors and is really quite huge. You're goal is to rebuild this little town. You fight consecutive battles without dying, and the further you get, the more rewards you're given. You colelct materials to level up the town and the various buildings in it, and weapons to level up your warrior and suit him up for battle. It's really unique and I highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nAfter that, there's challenge mode. You use stock characters to complete various arcade-style challenges. A fun way to test your skill.\n\nSo, given all this content, it will honestly last you a couple hundred hours if you plan to 100% it. And no, none of what I said included ANY DLC. That is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL and not needed. I know the base game is still expensive, so I wanted to make sure I addressed this. I still do not have any of the DLC and this game is still wonderful and amazing. I really hope more people give this game a shot and enter the wonderful world of Dynasty Warriors.","September 29, 2014","true","17.5"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","40","51","0","0"

It finally make it to PC after almost 1 year and it's bundles with Xtreme Legends and renamed Complete Edition.\n\nAbout the port, it's pretty good port with several issue. The graphics are using PS3 graphics and not PS4, which is not a problem for me :P. I got 60 fps during gameplay, 30 fps during cutscenes which is very good for this kind of game.The graphics can be nhanced with ENB which already made by modders. Controls are still awkward. No mouse support like the old PC version, though the game is better played with gamepad. Some people have black screen issues which is problematic. Luckily, I only encountered few times. People already found temporary solution for it, but KOEI need to make patch for it. And the online coop from console version is not available, only local coop stays.\n\nAbout the game itself, it's a very good hack-and-slash game. There are story mode which will follow the story based on the Romance of Three Kingdom novel, free mode (pick any officer, pick any stage, go wild), Ambition Mode, Challenge Mode. There are 82 playable characters to choose from, each with unique moveset and weapons to choose from. The game mechanics has been greatly improved from previous games ie Weapon Switching, new musou attacks, Storm Rush, Rage Mode to try making this game not jus a brainless button masher (still a button masher though). All playable characters has different personalities, so you'll have fun exploring each of them. Another plus point is the soundtrack. Koei never fail to deliver this part. All soundtracks in this game really enjoyable. In Free Mode, you can choose which song to play for that stage before you start playing.\n\nIf you're a Warriors fan and you don't have a console like me, this is worth the full price, if you can run it of course.","May 23, 2014","true","253.5"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","6"

It's got all kinds of modes that are all Dynasty Warriors. It's got more playable characters than I've ever heard of in a game, all with unique move sets and nearly all with unique weapons.\n\nIf you've never played Dynasty Warriors, here's how it works: You are a massive badass, and you run around the battlefields of Three Kingdoms era China obliterating everything. Depending on your character and weapon you have different abilities, move reach, and combos, but basically you run around decimating entire armies of enemies. This is all reasonably easy unless you've cranked up the difficulty, but really it isn't about skill; it's about efficiency and killcount. KIllcount is astronomically high, often passing 2000 in one level.\n\nBasically don't get this game if you want something technical or cereberal. Get this game if your life feels difficult and you want to do something easy but satisfying.\n\n[As an aside, this claims to be the complete edition, but there is a lot of DLC available that isn't included. Those of us who played this on console expected that DLC to be included with the Complete Addition, but it isn't. That said, if you can get the DLC on sale some of it adds levels and weapons/movesets, which can extend replay value]","October 19, 2014","true","40.5"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

Now available on PC and Steam, this game includes the Extreme Legends DLC and even though that this is a PS3 port, it's very enjoyable, the control is good, the performance is good, the gameplay is awesome. I'm a fan of Dynasty Warriors by the way.\n\nThe story are now more focused on each kingdom and you can choose from the kingdom of Shu, Wei, Wu or the later new established Jin Dynasty. You can also play the story of Lu Bu and other officers that are not part of the three kingdom like Yuan Shao or Meng Huo. And then on each stages, you can play one of up to four participating characters in that stage/battle.\n\nThe graphics of the game is improved from the previous game but still not as advanced as any game to date, you can judge that from the system requirements. Texture of the game is somewhat poor too on cutscene. Animations still pretty much the same, just with some new animations. Physics also still pretty much the same too.\n\nAs for the performance, it doesn't have issues of any kind, no lags, no stutter, the game runs pretty smooth and very playable. I play it on Windows 8.1 and there has been no issues at all. Well, I do encounter a minor bugs but it will not hinder your gameplay or playthrough at all. One of the bug is, at Hu Lao Gate, when I defeat Diaochan, the announcement says "Diaochan is enraged by the struggles of Lu Bu." It should be the other way around.\n\nNow for the feature, each characters now has unique abilites if they're using their default weapon, and now can use Rage. I simply call it, advanced musou, as it will consume all the musou energy when using it. A new game mode called Ambition Mode also present here, I won't spoil it though, it's quite interesting. The Challenge Mode also make a return here. A weapons type now includes an affinity. There three affinity, it is Heaven, Man or Earth each will outdo another.\n\nOverall the game is good and recommended to play. Even that this is a port from the console version, it's still very enjoyable. The game only lacks multiplayer online, if only at least an online co-op is included, this game will be perfect. I recommend this.\n\nRating 8/10","May 31, 2014","true","27.9"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

He's like that dude that tells people about his particular set of skills over the phone, but in this case he then beats you to death with the phone cuz he was already in the damned room.\n\nSlightly crud keyboard controls are really just about the only thing that I can fault in DW8XL, but once you get into the thick of it you barely notice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucimaru/recommended/278080/","Lucimaru","Smugnoa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucimaru/","334 products in account","Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Edition\nYou might wonder why a complete edition game has a separate available dlcs and are sold at crazy price. Long story short, it is a single product of normal DW8 + DW8XL, which in ps3 are 2 different products with different story combined into one. It's a good thing if you ask me since—you don't have to buy both of them like the previous dynasty warrior games normally do—to fully enjoy the experience of slaughtering thousand of peons in the name of benevolence while following romance of the three kingdoms story.\n\n"Ok I get it. So what's so good about the game itself?"\n\nTl;dr?\nA fun game to learn history, based on a famous chinese historical novel "Romance of The Three Kingdoms" and at the same time a good stress reliever while you're mashing and alternating between normal attack and charged attack to try different combos with over 80 characters to try, each with different weapons, movesets, traits. Most of them, if not all, were real figures from the three kingdoms history.\n\n"More details. I need to know what I'm getting myself into."\nRather than explaining the game, I would like to compare the game to the previous dynasty warrior series since explaining about the dynasty warrior itself will take forever. Don't worry, you'll get it even if you haven't played the previous games.\n\nLike I said before, this is the combination of DW8 (base) + DW8XL (expansion), hence complete edition. It is the first in the franchise to combine both since in the previous games, the base game only has a historical story mode while xtreme legend expansion adds an alternate story mode but still playable without base, and you have to buy both to get the full experience between history and hypothetical story. Well you get the point.\n\nLike the previous games, DW4 and DW7. Rather than every characters, DW8XLCE focussing the story on each kingdom. This is probably a major change since DW6 and could be proven to be efficient, at least for me, as you don't have to play every characters in the game with most of them having a same battle (ex : both Gan Ning and Ling Tong have Battle of He Fei in their storyline). And if you really insist to play every possible characters in the same battle, you can do it in free mode. Each battle in each kingdom story has a notable characters in that battlefield which you must pick, each have different and important role/objective. Furthermore, all of playable officers in that battlefield still get experience and level up. This is great and saves a lot of time if you want to try or level up every characters because you don't have to start as weak as level 1 and can take on a higher difficulty.\n\nThanks to xtreme legend expansion, each kingdom's storyline has a historical route and additional hypotethical route. A historical route is, pretty much self-explanatory, a route where you follow the story based on a real historical event of three kingdoms. There's not much you can do in here. Even when you're able to beat or already defeated every dudes in the map, if the victory condition tells you to surrender/retreat, so be it.\n\nWhereas the hypotethical route is basically what-if scenario. What if x didn't die on y battlefield? What if x didn't get injured? What if they win at z battlefield thanks to x plan? You have a certain conditions in certain battlefields to fulfill in order make those what-ifs come true, hence opening up a hypotethical route. And I tell you all of them are epic.\n\nNext is weapon system. Okay so other characters level should be decent thanks to auto-leveling at story mode, so what about their weapons? It would be sucks to play on hard with sufficient level but still using a starting weapon, right? Well don't worry, because every non-playable officers you have killed in the battle will drop a random weapon. And since it's random, if you have played enough you will obtain new additional weapons for every characters. The higher the difficulty or the later the stage, the better the weapon of course.\n\nAditionally, every characters can use every weapons (or rather, movesets) in the game regardless of fighting style. In extreme case, a mighty Lu Bu can use Xiao Qiao's fan and becomes very feminine as carried like a princess. Vice versa. Well puting that aside, it makes your life easier if you don't have a decent weapon for a character and too poor to make/buy one so instead you decided to use a stronger weapon of other's character, though you can't use their ex attacks.\n\nThere are a lot of things too which I failed to include in this review like ambition mode, bodyguard and their skills, ex attacks, weapon affinity and storm rush. Well just play and experience it yourself.","July 22, 2015","true","169.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"

If you're a fan of hack-n-slash games, or Warriors games in general, you're going to have a good time with it. Let's hope Koei decides to address some of these issues, and make more of these games available on PC.\n\nPros:\n+Lots of replay value, branching paths in story mode, Ambition mode, free mode, lots of weapons to collect.\n+Plenty of characters to pick from, there's bound to be someone you love (Ding Feng, Wang Yuanji), hate (Guan Yu, Sima Yi), or love to hate (Dong Zhuo, Sima Zhao).\n+Runs really well (60 fps constantly, no slowdown even with a ridiculous amount of troops), at least on my machine.\n+Really fun if you like these types of games, cheesy atmosphere and line delivery to match, great music, etc.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of online multiplayer.\n-Graphics are lacking, especially during cutscenes. Horrid looking shadows.\n-Occasional crashes, and people have been having compatibility issues. I've not had it happen yet though.\n-Weird button display that doesn't take into account whether you're using a controller or not. It'll show up as default symbols or key commands, doesn't really make sense.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\nIf you already own the game on PS3, Vita, or PS4, I can't really reccomend buying it again unless you really want 60 fps, and even then, I'd reccomend waiting for a sale. If you haven't bought it yet, though, like me, then it's been worth the money already. Let Koei know about the issues though, you can be supportive without being a shill, and critical without going on a tirade. The lack of online multiplayer is a black mark on it, but for those diving into the series who want to just play by themselves, have at it.","May 16, 2014","true","70.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","2"

From it's ups (DW 2,3,4) to it's downs (DW 6,7) Ofcourse this is entirely my opinion but Dynasty Warriors 8 XL is a nice refresher when it comes to the series. The story in DW8:XL was poorly drawn out, but they always have been only sub-par at most. The price is up there but i've seen it hit 50% sales quite a bit and is certainly WORTH picking up, whether if you are a novice hack n' slash player, a veteran, or an expert of the Dynasty Warriors franchise such as myself. Offering ALOT of replayability, but the main struggle when it comes to a hack n' slash is "will I get bored of it in a week?" and "Is this a worth while purchase?" The soundtrack alone was among my favorite parts of the game, along with the 100+ characters and weapons to go along with it, I can see myself chewing through a few hundreds of hours trying to complete everything (from campaigns, hypotheticals, challenge mode, free mode & ambitions mode) I would assume anyone who has some experience with hack n' slash should have an easy time enjoying this game and not getting bored.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr3x1/recommended/278080/","Dr3x1","Drexl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr3x1/","414 products in account","TLDR: This is a solid progressive iteration on the long-standing DW franchise. Fans of the series will enjoy it, but it is plagued with technical issues as a PC port, and hasn't aged well in general.\n---\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS AND COMMENTS:\nBe advised the following is targeted at those already familiar with Dynasty Warriors. If you have never played a DW game go watch some YT videos or buy the game, play for 2 hours and decide if you want to get a refund through Steam or not.\n\nInnovation is something we are likely to never see in Dynasty Warriors. Each title in the series iterates on the former by adding new mechanics and improving the graphics, but does little else. Most games would receive a lot of flak for this, but DW fans seem to put up with it (myself included). This is probably the best iteration of the series so far, but keep in mind it is still just another DW game. That is both a good thing and a bad thing which I will cover in more detail below.\n\nDW8-XL CE is a terrible PC port. It is obvious they didn't even try. Keyboard controls are available and appear to be fully rebindable, but aisde from ALT+F4 I couldn't get the keyboard to work at all, even when I launched the game w/o a controller plugged in. In it's favor the controller inputs are rebindable, which is rare to see. Co-Op is local only. No LAN, and the online Co-Op that appears to have been in the console versions (based on screenshots I've seen) has been stripped from the PC version.\n\nFurthermore, DW8 suffers from all the same problems every DW game has suffered from, and they are compounded by the fact that game design and technology have advanced while the Dynasty Warriors franchise has continued to remain in the past (pun only slightly intended). This means controls are not intuitive for a modern title, graphics are dated (they ported the PS3 version not the PS4 version), and the UI is awful. The same large, and somewhat garish UI that each iteration seems to hold on to is present. It's barely tolerable on consoles, and doesn't belong on a PC title at all.\n\nAll this said it also benefits from same things that made DW games of the past great. Everything you expect is still there, and they have iterated on some things that I think helps the title. You can summon a horse at any time and any location which helps in getting around the map. Mounted combat is possible, but not very fun or effective. You can swap between two weapons for each character which further diversifies your options in combat which is great. At the same time they also appear to have decoupled the weapon type from the character. This means that while each character starts with the iconic weapon you have come to expect them to wield from previous titles, you can immediately change which two weapons they use if you wish. I consider this a net positive because choice is nice even if you choose to have them keep using their iconic weapon. From what I've played it seems some weapons have higher compatibility ratings with certain characters than others. So even though you can use every weapon with each character some are more effective than others. Oddly however, the Musou ability (that special ability you press circle for on PlayStation) is character specific. This means that regardless of what you have equipped your character will pull out their iconic weapons when doing their Musou then switch back. It's not a big issue, but is a bit jarring.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nDW 8-XL CE a solid progressive iteration on the long-standing DW franchise. Fans of the series will enjoy it, but it is plagued with technical issues as a PC port, and hasn't aged well in general. Based on my research many consider this to be the best DW game so far with DW3-XL coming in as a close 2nd. However, most of the votes for DW3 appear to be a result of nostalgia rather than pure objective criticism. If you are looking to satisfy that DW itch I'd say this is definitely worth picking up as long as you go into it knowing that you will be playing a console game sitting at your desk, using a controller. If you can, I suggest streaming the game from your PC to a living room television and sitting comfortably on the couch with a controller, unless you own a PS4 in which case why did you read this far?","June 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","3"

It is essentially the epitome of a hack n' slash game as you are dropped onto a battlefield immensely strong and are given thousands of mooks to have your way with. There are enemy officers that provide a bit of a challenge every now and then but once you've mastered the relatively simple combat system there is not much that can stand to you. I heavily enjoy the gameplay however the common criticism that it is very repetitive is entirely valid as there is not much variety in the combat. The story mode is pretty compelling if you're into wuxia stories but if you're not into the gameplay then you are going to have a pretty rough time having fun with this game.\n\nI very much enjoy the series but my recommendation to newcomers to the series is to play a friend's copy before buying for yourself. Since the entire story is included with every game you don't need to worry about being unfamiliar with what's happening and that helps make it accessible. Definitely worth buying for fans of the series but avoid the DLC.

While it has the minor and typical flaws of a port it's 100% playable and great fun for those who desire a fun hack and slash with an easy to follow and unique story line for each campaign. Let's lay down some pros and cons:\n\npros:\n+Upholds graphical standards of the recent last gen(ps3/xbox 360)\n\n+All the stories of Dynasty Warriors 8 mixed with the the bonus content and modes included in Xtreme Legends!\n\n+Improved gameplay smoothness(many of the older dynasty warriors games had fps drops during the massive waves of enemies getting annihilated even in the console versions)\n\n+Excellent stories for each of the 4 kingdoms(the 3 old originals as well as the more recent Jin dynasty)\nand for the first time the ability to play through the story of the "Mighty" Lubu a character known widely throughout the series as the most fearsome of fighters.\n\n+Dian Wei clunking his bald head against Lubu's.\n\n+Dian Wei clunking his bald head against everybody else.(15/10)\n\n+New characters, both beautiful female characters with unique art styles and powerful looking male characters who fall nothing short of badass with all kinds of new movesets and massive combos!\n\ncons:\n-Controller mapping is very poor, I recommend using an afterglow a1x controller from PDP, when setting up your button input it feels like you're reading another language and takes about 10 minutes of double checking just to make sure everything is set up right. However, once set up the game runs great just like it would on your xbox or ps3!\n\n-Poorly optimized for live streaming via twitch and hitbox(if you care about it), the game runs flawlessly on my amd phenom 1100t 6core at 3.3ghz and my radeon 6850 at max settings but once I turn my stream on it's all down hill from there!\n\n-Some of the environments have slightly blurry textures, Dynasty Warriors uses a fairly old engine which isn't fully up to par with most modern games, this is easily made up for by the colorful characters and wide array of refreshed battlefields and brand new ones all together.\n\n-This is another personal con, a lot of familiar officer names dating all the way back to Dynasty Warriors 2 are still for some reason important enough to be put into the game but not important enough to have their own unique character.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nDynasty Warriors is still going strong, I was blown away by 7 but 8 is the best one yet! While I recognize bits and pieces of the stories from 7, 8 delivers a refreshing and nothing short of adrenaline pumping feel while you slash and crush your way through hordes of opponents. I always say a good game or story has characters that YOU wish YOU could be if it were possible, Dynasty Warriors 8 gives you just that!\n\nFeel free to reply to my review and tell me what you agree or disagree with, always interested in discussing!","June 28, 2014","true","36.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I was in a moment where i just wanted something that allowed me to kick a lot of ♥♥♥, i knew the series though i had never played it before and decided to give it a shot, since it was on sale. Blast off. I immediately grew extremely fond of the game and its strengths, and happily accepted to ignore its flaws. Here's a list of the pros/cons of this game in my opinion:\na\nPROS\n-So ♥♥♥♥ing BADA$$! This game just allows you to enter a battlefield and kick so much ♥♥♥ you will just stay there grinnin' at the screen, overwhelmed by the sheer sensation of power this game gives you.\n-Even if you may look overpowered in difficulties up to Normal, you still have 3 more grades of punishment waiting for you after Normal: if you want a tougher challenge, you're welcome. Don't even think of getting out alive with a non-leveled character, they will tear you to pieces. So, if you don't like being omnipotent, this game has many antidotes.\n-Just don't listen to the general opinion that this game is merely a button masher. Ok, combos are few, very easy (just light attack a certain amount of time+heavy attack, and that's it), but it's not just fighting. Every battle has its own objectives you have to care about: avoid rescuing the troubled allied for too long and he's dead, battle over (for example). You must be very careful of what the game tells you: while you rampage through random enemy forces, you may miss your chance to complete an objective, thus making your life way harder and/or even failing the whole mission.\n-The sheer amount of playable warriors is humongous: more than 80 powerful characters, each one, which is really something, with a dedicated weapon and move set.\n-There's a lot of content: five campaigns that allow replayability thanks to slight objective variations depending on the character you choose, a free mode with rankings and extra objectives, the very interesting Ambition mode in which you can lead your preferred warrior to ultimate power and some challenges. At nearly 58 hour of gameplay, i am way far from the completion of this game. As long as you like it, you have tons of things to do.\n-As soap-operish as the plot may be, it still is enjoyable enough to be a good glue between a mission and another.\n-The soundtrack is powerful and exciting, giving the battles a real hand by boosting your heroic feelings quite a lot. If you are into being influenced by music, of course.\n\nCONS\n-The game is very repetitive. If you don't like killing things (a lot of things) all the time, you will grow bored.\n-The english voiceover is quite bad, sometimes to laughable levels. Free japanese voiceover DLC, though.\n-The DLCs this game has are very expensive and not quite necessary unless you've already fully explored the base game, which can require hundreds of hours.\n-The graphics are rather poor.  Character design is nice, but sceneries are empty and non interactive, textures are not detailed, geometry is very simple and generic characters all look the same (because they are). There is quite a load of special effects and a huge amount of troops displayable on screen with virtually no lag even on semi-good machines, but this game doesn't shine much on this side, no doubt.\n-Playing with a keyboard is excruciating, and controller mapping may be tedious sometimes due to generic button names provided in the option menu.\n\nThis game has a lot to offers, and also historical flaws that are part of its DNA. If you like this kind of game and need to unload your stress through peons genocide, though, don't think twice: Dynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends (Complete Edition Ultra Super Turbo DX and what not) is the game you need. And always remember: don't pursue Lu Bu. Because no matter how bada$$ you are, he is more.","February 5, 2015","true","110.5"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","19","32","4","4"

The main focus of the game, like all other DW games, relies heavily--not surprisingly--on combat.  Before I delve into that, however, there are three main game modes to choose from, each of which play pretty differently, depending on your playstyle.\n\nFirst, you can play through Story Mode, which is what I recommend to everyone starting off regardless.  From here, you play through stories and histories of families in the Dynasty Warriors franchise, playing through epic battles and scenarios.  There are multiple paths to take in the storyline...one with the "historical" route, and one with the "hypothetical" route, adding a nice secondary option to all of the storylines for those who wish to view them all.  Each scenario allows you to play 2 or 3 heroes at a time, giving you many options when choosing which officer you like to play.\n\nSecondly, Free Mode has returned, which would make a lot of fans happy.  From here, you replay stages unlocked in Story Mode, completing certain challenges by capturing, killing, rescuing, convincing, etc...as the name implies, this is the mode where you are "free" to play whichever playable characters you wish, along with any type of customization you want to use with him or her.\n\nThe third and newest mode, is Ambition Mode.  In this, you choose a family and an officer from that family, choose the weapon sets and skills you wish to use as you try to raise your own camp to a prestigious state where you are able to serve the Emperor with protection, and honor.  In Ambition Mode, you will recruit your own officers, purchase certain buildings to be placed in your camp, buy and sell weapons, talk to guards/citizens/officers in your camp, and fight in battles earning you experience, gold, and building materials.  This is a great way to play a character of your choosing and getting a fresh start, playing the game how you like it played.\n\nCombat, while the main part of the game, can sometimes be overwhelming, tedious, and almost a little TOO simple in its fighting style.  However, the INCREDIBLE amount of weapons you can choose from really adds a whole level of fun to the replay value of this game--not to mention, some of the weapons you are able to use are laughable, in the sense that you actually feel the need to use them, or at least try them out!\n\nWhile the game can be pretty repetitive at times, the storylines, character customization options, and music, are a few things that keep you coming back for more time and time again.  And although I am impressed with the DLC that is offered, a lot of it seems a little too pricey--although I highly recommend the Japanese voiceover pack!  All in all, this is a solid game that is well worth the money if you are a fan of the franchise.\n\nI rate it a 7.6 / 10","November 10, 2014","true","21.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

A mixture of PS3 and PS4 visuals, with the biggest drawback being that there is no online co-op play (yet?) for the PC version. Aside from that rather large negative though, the huge positive is how long this game will last you if you've ever been a fan of the Dynasty Warriors titles. Completing the base story-lines on my regular DW8 PS3 version had taken me roughly 30 hours. Xtreme Legends Complete Edition expands on to a new storyline featuring Lu Bu, Challenge Mode, Free Mode and further character advancement for the 80+ characters, up towards a level of 150 each - and with hundreds of weapons to find and collect. Ambition Mode has also been greatly expanded, something I had only played a few hours of on my PS3 copy of DW8 - but also another extremely fun mode for any fan of this series.\n\nAlthough the console versions sometimes struggle at the FPS side of things, I've been able to maintain 60 FPS at all times regardless of how many enemies are on the screen at once. This is all whilst running at maximum-detail graphical settings, 1920 x 1080, under Windows 7. (I hear that Windows 8 is currently causing some trouble for other players, but not all.)\nMy system build is now roughly 2 years old but should give you a general idea of what you may need: AMD FX Bulldozer 6-core @ 3.30GHz, 8GB RAM and an AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB which has been overclocked slightly.\n\nHighly recommended to past fans of Dynasty Warriors, otherwise please look in to DW8 video reviews to get a better idea of what you would be in for as a newcomer to this great series. A word of advice though: Do NOT pursue Lu Bu...","May 13, 2014","true","13.3"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

There's a decent amount of graphic options considering it's a console port and the game doesn't look inferior to the PS3 version in any way, but keep in mind it's not PS4 textures as it's the PS3/360 port.\n\nAs for comparing to earlier DW games, if you haven't played one since DW2-6 or something, story mode has taken leaps and bounds forward and is a much more cinematic experience with a variety of characters per run instead of just one character. After you beat the story, there's a mode called Ambition mode where you basically grind through a bunch of random battles to unlock upgrades for a base camp, build rep with other officers, and so on. If you're just after the story mode, I wouldn't pay $50 now (ie wait for a sale) but if you're a fan and enjoy the combat/grind ambition mode + story is probably worth it for hack n' slash fans.","May 13, 2014","true","16.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

There are 4 main campaigns available - Wu, Shu, Wei, and Jin - with a fifth campaign based on the exploits of the infamous Lu Bu. Each of these campaigns has a split that occurs the second time you play them (assuming you hit all the requirements), allowing you to complete either the historical end, or an alternative end (which generally isn't as bleak as the history can be. What? You thought ancient Chinese warfare has happy end?).\n\nThe gameplay itself is the best I've seen from the series, and it allows you to take two different weapons (which was new to me). In a way, it's kind of like a fighting game between two officers, it's just that hundreds of mobs get in the way.\nThe character roster is also insane, with dozens of playable characters, each with their own unique attacks.\n\nIn terms of optimisation, it runs really well for me - I get a near constant 60fps, only dropping when there are a LOT of men and particle effects on the screen.\n\n\nIn short, DW8 is easily the best DW game I've ever played, and you should really give it a shot.","June 14, 2015","true","106.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynoidgirl/recommended/278080/","gynoidgirl","Allison the Valkyrie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gynoidgirl/","42 products in account","I am a long time DW player, having played and beaten every installation of this since DW2 (the original was a fighting  game I didn't care for), and I've enjoyed every hour I've spent on these games.\n\nNot having a next-gen console, I haven't really been able to play DW6 or DW7, and when I heard this was on Steam, I jumped at the chance to play it.\n\nThe basic story of the game is very similar to every other DW series game, you are placed back in the time period of the Three Kingdoms in Ancient China, and you help your faction duke it out with the other ones in order to unite the land under your control.  This game series is generally based off of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" story, and as such may not be actually representative of what that time period was like, but it's entertaining enough to make up for it.\n\nUnlike previous entries, instead of choosing one character and going through the storyline, the game gives you a selection of characters to use in each stage, some of them you might be familiar with, and some you might not, and then your role in each stage depends on what character you chose.  You may be playing the character responsible for setting an ambush up, or launching a fire attack, or making a solo run into the hordes of enemy forces to distract them.  In all cases, it can be fun to do.\n\nAt it's core, Dynasty Warriors is most commonly compared to a "hack and slash" genre game, and they're not that wrong.  But the calls of "button mashing" are not that valid, because yes, you can win by mashing buttons, but unless you're attacking in the right way at the right time, you will wind up losing, because the enemy actually uses its AI.  The game also was said to "punish" players who didn't take care of their allies.  I've seen this first hand, and they are not kidding.  In previous editions, I could simply run through all the forces, taking out the enemy, and finish the stage relatively quickly.  Now, if I run off to do that, and my allies die, the enemy forces DO get stronger, where one stage I was gang-attacked by 7 playable Wei generals, and I was quickly obliterated.\n\nIn addition, in the story mode, each kingdom has a "hypothetical" route, obtained by performing certain actions in each stage, therefore changing the history (example: Sun Jian is killed by an archer in one of the early levels, but if you defeat a certain enemy in time, that event doesn't happen, and he survives).  Each Kingdom's alternate route usually ends with their complete victory in unifying the land, and I find I enjoy them more than the traditional. (Especially Lu Bu's).  When I play through their story modes, I do what is required to trigger the alternate one, simply so I can bask in the enjoyment of doing so.\n\nThere are plenty of characters to enjoy, especially since this version has the 5 new characters introduced in Xtreme Legends, one of them for each Faction of Wei, Shu, and Wu, and 2 for the other faction. (Wei - Yu Jin, Shu - Fa Zhong, Wu - Zhu Ran, Other - Chen Gong and Lu Linqui).\n\nIf you are not a Dynasty Warriors fan, or if you've never played the game before, this is a wonderful place to start.  If you absolutely hate hack and slash games, I'd take a pass on it, as that is kind of the core of this type of game.\n\nIf you are the type of gamer who likes to call themselves a "one-man army", then yes, you can easily do that in this game.\n\nNow, the only real con I find, and it is a big one, but not enough to make me demand a refund:\n\nNO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!\n\nPS3/4 has it.  So does the XCrate.  But PC doesn't?  Hopefully they address this with a patch soon.  Local co-op does work, however, and is a lot of fun when you're hooked up to a big screen TV.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.  Become a one-man or one-woman army and take over China!","December 19, 2014","true","222.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With several modes to play through, including the popular ambition mode, there is plenty to keep you occupied.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is you play a significant character from Chinese history and roam around the landscape on foot and horseback killing thousands of enemy soldiers while levelling up yourself, skills and weapons in the process - sweet. There are loads of characters, moves and special weapons to pickup, plus you can fight from horseback. Generally there are hoards of enemies mixed in with tougher characters for you to wade through - respect.\n\nAfter turning the Japanese voice option and subtitles on I played through ambition mode for a while to level up some of the familiar characters. After the usual calibration period getting used to how to set the characters and weapons up I went into the Lu Bu story mode, which was pretty cool. After completing several of the story modes I turned my attention back to ambition mode to aquire all the goodies required such as Red Hare and improved weapon skills.\n\nIf you have played previous incarnations on Xbox or PS then the first thing you might notice is the improved graphics, especially view distances and slow down issues in busy Musou packed fights, which is greatly improved. Negatives are if you use a game controller the forward and back (red and green) buttons are reversed, although this can be changed. As per usual it can get repetitive but it's always an easy game to come back to or play when friends are around. With a choice of male and female characters and an intuitive control system it's easy for pretty much anyone to play - kickass you guys.","January 3, 2015","true","68.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't even think about buying this with the intent to use the keyboard/mouse to play, which sort of sucks considering the UI controls and popups are all keyboard keys and will not change to xbox/playstation buttons when you configure your controller.  Yes, you may have to configure you're controller for this game, it won't be plug in play/ready to go, unless you can deal with the default controls.  The graphics aren't anything to drool over and your framerate is capped at 60fps, which is fine if there weren't so many dips which make it an inconsistant 60fps.

The whole thing is this big, dumb, fun experience that I would recommend in the numbers 3, 5, 7 and 8. (3 is my favourite)\n\nI'll review the game without talking about the others where possible.\n\nThe combat:\nPros:\n1. You have a limited moveset that you use to kill endless troops. It doesn't stop being fun and it's a great stress relief.\n\n2. The satisfying sound effects and the feel of raw power are ALMOST back from Dynasty Warriors 3.\n\n3. Since you have a limited moveset every character has different abilities and moves.\n\n4. You can use other characters weapons (if you wish, I never liked doing that myself) and you have weapons more suited for different characters. This is great if you love a moveset and hate a character, or the other way around. It's great to have the choice.\n\n5. Combat is colourful and over the top.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Unit leaders. These guy are here to basically populate the battlefield but they have really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid consequences.\nTo begin with they never, to my knowledge ever stop coming, which is a first for Dynasty Warriors. You used to be able to empty the battlefield (if you're into that) but you can no longer; learn to just walk away; in a DYNASTY WARRIORS GAME.\n\nSecondly, Unit leaders will easily overwhelm most of your allies through sheer numbers as they keep swarming out of the gates like ♥♥♥♥ing insects. Get used to seeing all your officers cry for help every five seconds and get used to your aid meaning nothing; if you kill one another is on his way. They are weak enemies but they are strong enough to endanger anybody on your team apart from yourself.\n\nThirdly, capturing bases is absolutely useless most of the time. However, you can "capture" a base to open a door. Honestly you just borrow the base for a few seconds. They'll come back and claim it.\n\nSOLUTION:\n♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ unit leaders.\n\n2. The times are all ♥♥♥♥ed up. Sometimes you will be called on for aid but you'll have all of two seconds so travel the entire battlefield through locked gates and scenic routes.\n\nSOLUTION:\nGIVE ME A CHANCE.\n\n2. I don't like the new Musou system that was introduced in DW: 6 (I think).\nSOLUTION:\nSee DW: 3 to see what a FUN musou should be like.\n\n3. As much as I think the general combat is fun I honestly think it could use some sort of system to add/remove moves. For example if you're like me an you use Lu Bu then you're going to get fed up of his chokeslam pretty quick and actively try to avoid it.\nSOLUTION:\nSome way to customize moves or even better learn new moves as you level. There shouldn't be something like Lu Bu's chokeslam AT ALL in a game where you use the same moves all the time. It would also be nice to have the option to silence the characters if you don't want to hear them over and over and over and over and over again. I don't mind the vocals, myself, but I grew up with it and it doesn't bother me. The option would be great, though.\n\nStory:\nPros:\n1. There's a LOT of work here with a LOT of really great, fully voiced dialogue from all the characters and NPCs. There are also a lot of parts that are not voiced but they don't take away from the game.\n\n2. It's more daring than the other games with it's story meaning you'll see a lot more from the story than you would have expected. I can say that I enjoyed the change,\n\n3. The characters, although some of them have a single character trait that defines them, are fun enough to keep you interested in all the daft ♥♥♥♥ they do. To me the interaction between all the characters makes the game feel alive.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Well, it's getting better but it's not historically accurate. I know they never claimed it to be EVER but I have to bring it up.\nSOLUTION:\nNo, no. Just carry on. It's ♥♥♥♥ing weird.\n\nAmbition mode:\nPros:\n1. With a bit of tweaking this could really be the best part of the game. You go around battling and collecting allies, getting a bit stronger, a bit richer and you're working towards a goal. The game needs more goals and this mode is good for that.\nKoei need to talk to me about this mode because I have a lot of ideas, just saying.\n\nCons.\n1. There is a mechanic that put you against trying to win as many battles in a row without failing. If you reach 30 battles you get a "something special" and no I don't know what it is. The problem is this mode is broken and I will explain why.\nFirstly, you can't save and carry on another day, THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ED. 30? In one day? What if I'm busy? The game is a great stress relief what if I want to play it after work? No? Okay.\n\nSecondly, the timer will ♥♥♥♥ you! Out of nowhere you'll have impossible times to complete something. I had 30 seconds to reach the nearest enemy (to get more time) who is on the other side of the map that takes 15 seconds to cover on the fastest horse in game and takes 1:30 to kill with the most powerful character in the game. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!?\nSOLUTION:\nWHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!? SORT IT OUT!\n\nOverall:\nI love Dynasty Warriors. It's like a colourful and fun cartoon series about superheroes. I always look forward to these games.\n\nThis is one of the stronger Dynasty Warriors games. There is a lot of fun to be had here and there's hours of things to do. If you're a student and or you have a job then I absolutely recommend this game. It's a fantastic stress relief. If you're a serious gamer... I'm not so sure.\n\nThe only way to see if you like it is to try it. Find a friend who's probably playing it all the time and play with them or borrow it or something.\n\nI play this on my own but I will say it's better to have some friends or a forum to talk about the game. It's fun to talk about, laugh at and share stories with people with this game.\n\nAll in all I have to give it a 6/10. - I can just about recommend it to everybody. Just. Fix your ♥♥♥♥, Koei.","June 13, 2014","true","27.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","3"

Before you buy it understand these three things. first,  that is a port of the ps3 and not the ps4, so the textures are pretty much potatoes. It does play at 1920x1080p and it does reach 60fps so thats good news, but again even on the highest settings the textures are pretty bad. Next, it is currently local co-op only. I say currently because i cannot possibly think KOEI would release this game at full value and not include online features which were included in the console version. And lastly, the controlls are just awful. If you are like me, which i assume you are, you played the previous dynasty warriors games on a console and are familiar with the controls. If not, then you're not going to be as bothered by this. If you use a gamepad (which you honestly should for a game like this), it is very important to know...that some genius at KOEI decided it would be a FANTASTIC idea to make the musou button (special ability) and confirm button the exact same button. Allow me to explain the layout of the controller for this game on console so you can better understand (will use a 360 controller for demonstration, and for a reference of those who would like to use the most effective layout.)\n\nLeft analog stick= move\nRight analog stick= camera\nA= jump/confirm\nB=Musou/back\nX= normal attack\nY= Strong attack\nLB= Block\nLT= Change weapon\nRB= Call horse\nRT= Map\nStart= Start\nBack=? (i forgot what it did but it doesnt matter)\nDirectional Buttons= bodyguard commands\n\nSo we see here we have a pretty effective set up on console. Heres where KOEI innovated the game for PC gamers.\n\nMusou and confirm are the same button, so if you want to get anywhere navigation wise you need to press B to confirm. Which is awkward and weird\n\nJump is also linked to the back button. So by pressing A you will end up going back in the menus which is also awkward and confusing for those familiar with the gamepad\n\nIn order to naviagte specific menus left and right, you need to press the Block button (LB) and the change weapon button (LT) where on console it was just LT and RT, so again ♥♥♥♥ing awkard.\n\nAnd the best part, the game doesnt tell you which key to press for either M/K or gamepad!!! it just shows you a ♥♥♥♥ing logo of what you should press.\n\nOh and also, they added a pause button which is a diversion and doesnt do anything. The real pause button is called bring up display or some ♥♥♥♥. So the pause button is useless.\n\nSo you will need to decide if you are familiar with the controls from console between an effective combat control system, or an effective navigation system. Because some sociopath at KOEI decided that we cant have both. So definitly keep that in mind when you go to play this game. Oh and when using the gamepad, the main menu says "press any key to countinue". Which is a gigantic lie. You need to press whichever button you assigned to the "display battle or whatever the ♥♥♥♥" button (not pause).\n\nDespite these issues and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it is a good port and it plays how it should. after a while i adjusted to the controls and am kicking ♥♥♥ all over the place. It may not bother you but it kind of upset me, was all the characters and character weapons are available right from the start (only the weak versions of the weapons, you still have to unlock all of those). I feel this was a terrible move because A) it takes away the excitment of unlocking characters and seeing them for the first time and which weapon they have. B) In this game you get 2 weapons...any two weapons you do so please. SO by having all the weapon types available at the start takes away the fun of unlocking them. which for me, was the best thing in dynasty warriors 8.\n\nSo i do reccomend getting the game, but i reccomend waiting a while until KOEI fixes the problems and drops the price. Hope this helped!","May 13, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Also this is 2 player couch co-op for pretty much everything, for anyone who maybe deciding to buy for the first time.\n\nThere is so much content in this version, the 3 main modes in this is the classic story mode, play out the story of one of the kingdoms, though this time round, you cant just pick a officer from that kingdom then play through the entire story being OP like before, for each story you pick between 3 officers for that mission, if you help plans succed or complete certain tasks other officers will be available on missions further down the line, or may even unlock another story path.\n\nGameplay wise, this is super smooth for me, not had any graphic lag or delay when loading enemies, the in-game cinematics have been done very nice.\n\nFree mode is what it sounds like, pick any missions and play with any officer, though there are objectives to fulfill if you wish to obtain A rank.\n\nThen Ambition mode, similar to other Xtreme legends, you have your own town and fight battles to help build up your town, upgrading shops, capturing officers, so on and so forth.\n\nThere are still the challenge modes like the bridge challenge\n\nSo if your un-sure about the game, keep in mind this is one of the best ones to buy, price can be steep at the moment but you get alot of content in return.\n\nLastly, I would recommended a gamepad, if you have trouble with yours just re-map the buttons, the camera controls didnt work for me til I remapped it. Even though it has gamepad support you still need to push a button on your keyboard to access the title screen menu's which is proberly the only problem I have with it. After that ive been using the gamepad entirely.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGreat game, tons of content, 2 player couch co-op, lots of characters. recommeding gamepad.","January 1, 2015","true","43.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/278080/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","I usually only review games I've finished, since I want to give them a fair chance and, admittedly, I like writing positive reviews more.\nThere's just too much game here though. 50+ hours in I've completed 3 of the campaign modes, one of which with both endings, and made my way through half of Ambition mode.\nThis is the Dynasty Warriors game to get, both for fans and newcomers of the series.\n\nI haven't played a core DW game since 4. The problem with the series is that it always does roughly the same thing, so I didn't bother picking up the next 4 games when they came out.\nBecause of this the contrast is astounding.\n\nDW4 had 42 playable characters from the 3 main factions and assorted extras (like the Nanzhong royalty or antagonists from the start of the various campaigns).\nDW8 ups that to 77, and this "Xtreme Legends" version adds another 6. That's almost double the number of characters, across 6 factions (and, still, the extras).\n\nEven just sticking to a single faction this is a long game.\nLu Bu, long-time antagonist and strongest warrior in the land, finally gets a full-fledged campaign and accompanying faction. I started that one first, and it had a LOT to do.\nA campaign consists of about a dozen stages (which take 10-40 minutes each), after that you've reached the "Historical Ending". That's right, 8 games in and the series is still trying its best to have some semblance of historical accuracy in there. This means that, generally, things don't end well for your faction of choice.\nFor people like me, coming from the early PS2-era games, 12 stages might not seem like a lot. Back then the game was divided into Acts, each Act taking up 2-4 stages and each campaign having ~6 Acts.\nIn DW8 though, there is a big second ending to go for. Around halfway through that dozen stages there tends to be a pivotal battle, something big that the first half of the campaign has been working towards.\nIf you do everything right and fulfil certain conditions in the battles leading up to that crucial battle you can change history, branch off of the Historical route and head for the "Hypothetical Ending" which usually ends with your faction of choice ruling the lands. That's another 6 stages.\nThese alternate conditions are initially hidden and up to the player to figure out, but completing the Historical Ending will reveal exactly what you'll need to do to gain access to the second path. Such conditions might involve making sure a specific person, particularly ones that historically don't make it, get rescued.\nAlong the same lines there are also optional stages, unlocked comparably (and the conditions also get revealed by getting any ending) that are like the Tales interludes between Acts in DW4.\nThen there's a set of Extreme Legends levels, added with this expansion, which is another 8 or so fully fledged campaign levels.\n\nThat's 30+ stages of hack and slash goodness. Per campaign.\nYes, there are 6 fully developed campaigns and another 20 or so levels categorized as "Other" following people like Yuan Shao, Meng Huo and Dong Zhuo. (Don't worry if you don't know who those people are, there's tons of characters, remember?)\n~200 stages then, and most of them unlock a version where you can play it from the other side of the conflict once you clear it. It's no wonder then, that only 0.7% of players have the achievement for completing all stages.\n\nThe actual gameplay (which I guess deserves covering as well) consists of taking one of the suggested officers (from a roster of 2-4 suggested for the mission in the Campaign Mode. In Free Mode you can pick anybody) and running through a Chinese battlefield completing objectives, defeating enemy officers and carving a path through hundreds upon hundreds of enemy soldiers.\nIf you're looking for a power fantasy then this is it. There is a wide array of difficulties, the regular Easy-Normal-Hard is pre-faced by a Beginner difficulty which is truly easier than easy. Unless you really, really try to mess up it's almost impossible to lose the stage. Above Hard is Chaos, which will give you a significant challenge, even with characters stronger than level 100 (level caps at 150). Above Chaos is Ultimate, which will make you weep regardless of how much time you put into your favourite character.\nCombat relies on the quick attack and strong attack buttons, which you string together into combos. Every single playable character has a different type of weapon with a different move set, but they tend to be easy enough to get into. If you have trouble coming up with 83 significantly different weapons then you'd be correct. There are around ten or so different types of swords, but they actually feel (and look) different. And there's no shortage of outlandish weaponry either. From the fast chakram to maces, to pikes, to bladed shields, to canoes.\nYes, canoes. You will come across some weird, weird weapons in this game.\n\nYou get to choose two weapons to take along into battle (and up to 4 skills which boost certain aspects of your character). It's advised to take at least one of the type that 'belongs' to your character of choice, since they automatically have access to two strong EX Attacks, which are basically special moves with that weapon. Other characters can learn to use these as well, but only when the original wielder has been levelled past level 50.\nThe reason you get two weapons is because all weapons have an elemental affinity (Earth, Heaven, Man) which opposes each other element in rock-paper-scissors style. That means that every enemy officer you meet will be at an advantage, disadvantage or neutral to your weapon. Being at a disadvantage means your attacks won't stun an enemy officer at all and damage is greatly reduced (halved?), and being at an advantage deals (around 50%) more damage and allows for a special Storm Rush manoeuvre when you hit him/her enough.\nThis means that it's a good idea to carry two weapons of differing elements and switch them out when necessary, which you can do at any time in battle with a press of the button (it even has a special Switch Attack unique to the weapon). This adds a (thin) layer of strategy to what is otherwise a pretty simple gameplay loop.\n\nNew weapons are found regularly, every officer you defeat will drop one, so you'll have no shortage of weapons. Each weapon type has 6 grades of weapons, and more stars denote stronger weapons. They also have randomized weapon skills, like dealing Fire damage on heavy attacks or increasing attack speed, adding an extra layer of complexity. This gets even better/worse once you progress far enough in Ambition Mode to unlock a Blacksmith which lets you fuse weapons together, upgrading and merging the weapon skills. With some effort you can make absolutely insane weapons, only adding fuel to the fire that is your power fantasy (although, at higher difficulties, you'll need every help you can get).\n\nAmbition Mode is a completely separate mode where you first set out to build a palace to attract the emperor-in-hiding to your side, completing short randomly generated missions to gather allies, supplies, fame and gold and expand your own base camp. Once you do there is a second phase, new to Extreme Legends, where you set out to conquer China now that you have the backing of the emperor. There is a lot to do here, and everything carries over to the Campaigns and Free Mode. This easily adds another 30+ hours of stuff to do on top of the already stupid amounts of content.\n\nThe only thing missing is a character creator where you get to make your own warrior, a feature I quite liked in DW4 (and Samurai Warriors 1), but there are plenty of characters (roughly a quarter of them female) and you're sure to find plenty you'll like.\nThis is a polished action game with nigh-infinite content and a button that calls your horse to you which you can then mount while running. That might not seem like a big deal, but it is.","May 13, 2015","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a ton of content to the story modes. I have some criticisms though. I wish Ambition mode were a little more interesting, it's just grinding the same battles over and over, and I wish you leveled your characters individually so there's more of a reason to go back and replay as previous characters. Battles are also not particularly strategic. Just beeline towards the enemy officers. Previous titles would require you to take and hold bases or to support other officers.

Some mounts / pets. Story is about different families in China, battling over control of the area. There may be some history connections, but I'm not sure. In story mode you play one of the families of your choice, select one of the available characters for each mission, and kill thousands of peasants / warriors / officers / commanders. Each weapon type has it's own animations, every character you play has it's own special moves and combos.\n\nThere is no mouse support in this game, you either play on keyboard, or plug in controller. Texture quality and visuals are poor, main character models look decent but not awesome. Voice acting is basic, with weird translations here and there that don't make sense, being ported / translated Asian game it's similar how Russian language translates to English, usually it doesn't make any sense too, unless professionals translate it with knowledge of the text.\n\nNo multiplayer in this one, only local co-op. It's a fun experience if you feel like one man army killing machine. I really enjoyed Zhurong, by far the most sex appeal female in the game, looks like jungle woman.","August 15, 2015","true","14.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I played the hell out of that game, unlocking every character, beating every campaign, and leveling everyone up to a ridiculous degree. For whatever reason, the Dynasty Warrior series has retained just the right balance of grinding and satisfying gameplay to keep me entertained for years. I've played multiple entries of the series, and even though each game is pretty much the same exact same thing, it always keeps me happy and satisfied.\n\nBased on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there is somewhat accurate historical portion of the game, and if you've never heard the story before, it's actually an entertaining period of history. It's not exactly 100% accurate (Dian Wei never wielded an axe that was nearly 2x his size, for example), but almost everything in the game is inspired by a true story in some way.\n\nThe port is pretty good, all things considered, but there are a few hiccups. The controller is not bound in a way that makes sense, and you'll need to change things around to get it to play right. Navigating the menu for changing controls is a pain, and you're going to end up taking a ton of screenshots of the menu on accident... Unless you've changed  your steam screenshot key. Other than that, everything has run smoothly for me.\n\nThere are multiple gameplay modes, including the story mode, which has multiple characters and paths to play through, a free mode that lets you choose any scenario and side, and some kind of conquest mode that has really weird rules but is satisfying to play.\n\nMake no mistake, this game is a grind. You grind. You grind some more. You grind and grind and grind. There is honestly not much challenge here. The game is pure grind-tastic fun, plain and simple. If you've never played a Dynasty Warriors game, this is a great place to start, and the port is nearly flawless.","February 17, 2015","true","59.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That's the best way to describe it. On paper it's an awful series but there is just some satisfaction to the combat that the copycats have failed to capture. The whole game is a dreadful grind of repetition of the same few moves. Balancing comes wholly on the grind half of the board with enemies one-shotting you or your weapon, sharpened to a keen edge through hours of grind, juggling hapless ♥♥♥♥♥s forever without even the slightest danger of their retaliation. You will never get better or learn new skills. The best player does the same moves as the worst player. Only ever too easy or too hard, the game should not even be taken as an exercise where you could find a meaningful challenge. In fact, the difficulty levels are just there to scale the game up once your characters have leveled enough. Every boss enemy is a playable character so they all should be a rival fight and yet they are all just exercises of juggling and walking around their block.\n\nSounds pretty dreadful, doesn't it?\n\nAnd yet... and yet. There's a certain satisfaction to it all. Hits feel right, the carnage you wreak on the battlefield feels right, the characters feel right, the story especially feels right. It's always been nothing but a beautiful song to the olden days. Mighty, valiant warriors, wise scholars, brilliant generals, fearless leaders, virtuous (And a few ruthless) maidens, battlefield comrades, tragic sacrifices, honor, glory, all the beautiful things about war. So conditioned are we to the relentless cynicism of the modern era that even Koei's often awkward adaptation of Chinese martial history feels like a shining relic of the chivalry society has forgotten. You don't spend a lot of time with any of these characters; the cast is far too huge to manage that, but each embodies their characteristics so well that you feel as if you have known these people for years. On a gut level, Dynasty Warriors will speak to you if you let it. Yes, it's goofy, it's light fare, but think about it. How rare, how truly rare is it to find something so unabashedly chivalrous, so unashamed in its elevation of heroism, so utterly devoid of this awful modern malaise we are all trapped in. To me, it shines so brightly and scratches an itch that has gone unaddressed for so long that I did not even know it needed scratching.\n\nWith five different campaigns, each with a set of side missions and an alternate, non-historical path, a whole collection of missions for the various less important characters of the story, a whole separate mode where you fight randomly generated battles on the game's maps to support an ever-growing grind, challenge modes, free play modes where you can play as the either side in almost every story map with any character; each map and each side having its own challenge objectives and letter rating. The battles range from straightforward cake walks to strategists putting together clever ploys to desperate defenses to one man stands and, despite their simplicity, they manage to usually tell a story. There may be a lot of repetition here, but if you enjoy it, there is a LOT of game to consume.\n\nFor the DW veteran from 4-5 or so, 8 ramps up the combat with rage modes, SUPER super moves, three whole super bars normally, ability to swap weapons, as in adopting the moveset of another character mid fight, and the like. Whereas 4-5 had the average enemy KO counter of 200 or so per map, here you'd be hard pressed to defeat under 500 people per map. Story will also level up unused members of your kingdom as they go so you can change characters without issue.\n\nFor the port anxious, don't be. It runs perfectly well, I have had no issues.

This is not their first PC release prior to this we had DW4 hyper, DW6, DWO and of course ROTTK. When I found out Koei were coming back to the pc via steam with 8 I was excited to say the least. When I found the game was built on the same engine as 7 I was even more pleased. Just started playing 8XLCE and its fantastic same Dynasty Warriors carnage that we all know and love with kick ♥♥♥ asian metal music but the PC performance really helps over consols. Scattering hundreds of soildiers with no slow down? awww yeah. I only have one issue and that is I'm gonna spend to much damn time on this game :D\n\nEdit:\n\nPut some hours in to this game now and yes it is great. I am annoyed at the community for some of the stupid reviews and comments against this game. Some coming from "long time fans" judging by what they say they dont sound like long time fans to me. Sure online coop would be nice but that does not ruin the game. Sure ps4 textures would be nice but hey that doesnt ruin the game. Sure there are a couple of bugs but they are easy to overcome. Also the people leaving bad reviews because of B or O depending on control is accept? Thats how it is in Japan!! Plus people complaing about M&K use. Really? Even as a PC elitist DW has no place on M&K buy a 360 control pad! The Japanese release of this game has just happened so we may get a patch soon. Even if we dont I am happy with this and will play hundreds of hours. Just like all the Dynasty warriors before this (except 6 maybe :D)\n\nOne thing I actually miss from this game that previous ones had? On story mode I miss the naration. I am aware there is narration on the Japanese VO. But I find it hard to use Japanese VO when its based in China with Chinese names. It just dont sound right. I know DW8E is coming to Steam soon and its Japanese only so we better get used to it. I would prefer a Chinese VO as I watch the ROTTK TV series which is Chinese.","May 13, 2014","true","121.5"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

One thing that this game has that differs from the older titles is the ability to swap between two weapons (both can be chosen from a LARGE assortment of different weapons). This allows many different combos to be made. This also allows you to switch out a particular character's weapons out of that character (ie: Zhao Yun using Pang Tong's weapon instead of his own + another weapon), which, personally, I am not a huge fan of, for I enjoyed using a new character and seeing what his strengths and weaknesses are.\n\nAddionally, a new feature called "Storm Rush" was introduced. When using a weapon which has a type advantage over an enemy officer, you will see a blue crystal ontop of the officer. After using the weapon with the type advantage and breaking all 3 sections of the crystal, your character will enter a mode where he unleases a bunch of powerful attacks on enemies infront of (or around) him/her. While this may seem good, having a weapon with a type DISADVANTAGE on an enemy officer will result in your attacks not causing flinch to them. This makes it so switching between weapons with different types almost neccesary.\n\nAdditionally, switching weapons allows you to break some officer's attacks while they are charging them, and breaks guard. This is different than the older titles where an enemy's officers guard was a pain to get through. Personally, I still prefer the old system, as it encouraged repositioning.\n\nThe soundtrack of this game is AMAZING (just like the soundtrack of the older titles). The additional characters and Jin add a lot to this game.\n\nOverall, a game I definitely recommend. Now if only I had more time to play it...","December 30, 2014","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cco-makoto/recommended/278080/","cco-makoto","high quality video game rips","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cco-makoto/","296 products in account","The latest edition of Koei's historically accurate action game, set in the tumultuous years following the decline of the Han Dynasty.  If you have played any of the previous titles, this game will probably seem at least somewhat familiar.  Deploy a general, tactician, or otherwise noteworthy character from the Romance of 3 Kingdoms, and rampage across the battlefield, taking out hundreds of grunts, officers, and bosses along the way.  This particular title takes a sort of "best of both worlds" approach to the gameplay, implementing the weapon change and element system of DW7 while also giving every character a unique weapon set like earlier titles--that way, you can either play the characters with their EX weapons, or mix and match for your favorite combination.\n\nGameplay modes are mostly bog standard for the (x) Warriors series.  All four kingdoms -- Wei, Wu, Shu, and Jin -- have a Musou (story) mode route that mostly follows the progression of the plot of Rot3K, joined by the Lu Bu story mode from Xtreme Legends; and a set of stages for unaffiliated forces such as Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao, etc.  The XL expansion stages for every kingdom are included, as well.  Within the story mode, you are limited to a set group of characters for each stage; after beating each stage, however, you can play using any character in free mode.  Along with story mode and free play is a Challenge Mode, using set characters to clear one of five different goals.  And each story mode includes extra stages and a special path split, activated by meeting certain goals in each stage.  Usually, this amounts to preventing major characters from dying as they did in the original story.\n\nThe last mode is Ambition Mode, in which you build up your own base and army.  Within Ambition Mode, you choose your main officer and engage in a variety of timed battles, where you collect materials for upgrading buildings and forging weapons; as well as battling named officers.  The officers you defeat join your forces, and can be used as bodyguards and as playable characters, if they are one of the many major characters in-game.\n\nGraphically, this game is a mixed bag.  Parts of it closely resemble the Complete Edition released on PS4.  The playable officer models are quite detailed, and have been noticibly touched up compared to the original 360/PS3 editions of this game.  However, level textures and NPC's have not gotten the same treatment; the latter is especially obvious in a few cutscenes, where you can see just how murky and unrefined the skins are on the normal mooks.  Generally, though, it's not going to be extremely obvious due to the pace of gameplay.  Nonetheless, it does seem like they may have skimped a bit on the graphical touch-ups compared to the next-gen console re-release; no real reason why they didn't go full bore.  At the time I'm reviewing this, the game only includes the English voice track, which is missing intermission narration and voice-overs outside of cutscenes; the Japanese track has yet to be released as DLC.  Given how Koei has handled this on console, this will likely be released as a free update or free DLC in the near future.\n\nOther than that, the other major issue with the game is a lack of multiplayer outside of split-screen local MP.  The lack of online co-op is confusing, given that the console versions DO have online play; hopefully this will be changed in a later update.\n\nDW8XL is overall the best game in the series available on PC right now, and among the best Warriors games, period, second maybe to Warriors Orochi 3.  There's a pretty good return on investment in terms of play time.  Five story modes, each with a branching path for the second half; a couple dozen more extra stages from the Xtreme Legends addon; and as a nice time-killer in Ambition Mode, all mean that there's plenty of stuff to keep you busy.","August 15, 2014","true","35.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

The storylines are very nice and well done, However I also feel that they could have been longer as many battles were missing. The Ambition mode is a very nice addition that really could use some expanding next time to allow for more things to be done with your camp. Like, maybe put the ambition mode camp combined with Empires play style?\n\nAs for the graphics, I think they are fantastic. Many have said it lives between PS3 and PS4, but that doesnt really matter as they are still very good. I think they did a very good job with the female characters as well.\n\nGood:\n- Graphics\n- Game Play\n- Story\n- Ambition Mode\n- There are some very cute things. Such as some female outfits and Fox Animals.\n- Lu Bu's Daughter\n\nBad:\n- Controller setup is not user-friendly. Takes a good 10-20 minutes to understand how it works. It does not auto-detect what kind of controller you are using. (Using an Xbox 360)\n- Keybinding. Some of the keybinding is very iffy and hard to follow. Such as the keys for menus and their mapped equivalents for controllers.\n- Its not Empires.\n- There is not an Empire version (yet) I can play as Lu Bu's Daughter\n\nThis game is well worth it if you enjoy button mashers and wrecking thousands of enemies. I hope that they will bring DW8: Empires to steam shortly after the Playstation release!","June 24, 2014","true","50.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game runs smoothly on my Lenovo Y500 with dual cards.  My only issue was the control mapping.  It was weirdly placed and it took a while to get used to.  I don't remember the previous DW games having a weird control scheme like this one, but I found a comfortable adjustment which I'll write below to help others (I use an Xbox 360 remote).  It would also be nice to see controller buttons rather than keyboard buttons on the screen when using a gamepad.\n\nGraphics:  9/10 (I see people complaining about graphics, but this is the norm for DW games.  They could have probably improved it though, especially with it being a PC port)\n\nGameplay comfort:  9/10 (This is a mass murder game, so I rate gameplay by comfortable transitions/synchronization)\n\nContent:  10/10 so far.  From what I've seen, this game has hours upon hours of epic game time, just like it's predecessors.  It also has a bunch more characters than I'm used to, which is a huge plus.  Each having different skins/recolors is just icing on the cake.  Weapons are diverse and there's a ton of choice.  Abilities/passive stats are plenty and easy to understand.  Game types are simple to get a hold of and the story so far is about on par with the other DW games.\n\nReally the only thing I feel it's lacking right now is online co-op.  Local co-op is awesome, but online mode would be better.\n\nNow for the 360 controller mapping:\nX- Basic Attack\nY- Strong Attack\nB- Jump\nA- Special Move\nStart- Menu\nSelect- Map view switch\nLeft analog click- Horse call\nI also adjusted the camera movement/look to the right analog stick, which was weirdly placed as the left and right trigger.  I kept everything else the same.  This also frees up the left and right triggers for your own purposes.  Pause doesn't seem to work for me.  Of course you should adjust it to fit your needs, but I found this set up leagues better than the default.  More natural and it makes the A button the "select" and B button the "return", which made it easier to navigate menus.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game!","June 21, 2014","true","75.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For people who say  that it's a ripoff because "Complete Edition with blabla DLC's"; well, Koei did screw up with the name, but it means that the original DW 8 game, alongside the Xtreme Legends expansion come in in one game, instead of getting them separately to transfer data, etc. So you get the Story mode of the 3 Kingdoms alongside extra stages and the Lu Bu storyline, alongside Ambition Mode (with a revamped post game) and Challenge Mode (it's not hard but it entertains for an hour or so if you want some achievements).\n\nOverall, the Story is great, for people who kow it and people who are new to it, it does a good job explaining the events (Alas, i recommend the japanese voices, since the English ones don't feature a narrator or base conversations, only events and battle lines, which are still a lot, and better voiced than before, but well depends on one's tastes honestly)\nThe Shu bias is slowly getting reduced, and every kingdom is amazing in its own right; the missions are great, with the option to pick around 2-3 or even 4 characters per stage for every kingdom, it allows for more characters to shine, and provide more variety in mission objectives. To put an example for longtime fans, at the Battle of Chibi, if one were to play Huang Gai or Han Dang, you get to the Fire Boat, and well, get all the fun; if playing Sun Shangxiang you get to protect Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang while waiting for the wind direction to change for the fire attack to happen, and so on. Which makes it even more interesting on split screen, having 2 people go to different locations to spice things up more.\nAlongside the new Hyphotetical objectives to unlock the Hypo route of each faction, it just makes the already good Story Mode, get a lot of replay value, and opens up some interesting scenarios, and gives some characters who don't make the cut in the historical route have some spotlight; though it's not perfect, but no real complaints as it just adds more to the already extensive campaign. (I am looking at you, Shu final hyphotetical stage, for putting in Zhuge Liang and Zhao Yun instead of letting us play as the 3 bros Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei alongside Liu Bei)\n\nThe Ambition Mode is an entertaining mode for fighting skirmishes against the cast of the game, recruiting allies, gaining fame and materials to build a massive building to welcome the Emperor and become known throughout the land; a bit silly but it makes for a good inmersive experience when you don't wanna spend time repeating stages on free mode and you rather just fight for the go of it; this mode also allows to build facilities based on your expansion which will benefit the entire game, such as increasing the weapons a blacksmith can make, or fusion weapons to get the best out of the skillset they have, get animals, increase exp, many options are here to keep the player going, alongside the obvious fun that is beating the 3 kingdom founders and Lu Bu to join whoever your character you are using's cause, it is better than the conquest mode in DW7, of that much i am certain, it also allows 2 player coop.\n\nThe gameplay well, it's dynasty warriors, sure it's a "button masher" but there is so much depth into it, more to it than what we give credit for, each character being favored by different abilities, such as shadow sprint (cancel strong attack with normal to continue the chain), Dive (lets you escape easier), Whirlwind (more dmg when enemies are sent flying), and Dash (midair jump or cancel an attack into a forward hop); and that's not even counting the different effects of each weapon, which can vary from increasing musou (special attack) power, to increase the raw power of it, to slow enemies, to grant more dmg the longer your chain is, etc. With the double weapon system, alongside the 3 elements (Man-Heaven-Earth) which is a rock-paper-scissors mechanic which grants advantages or disadvantages, resulting in various possibilities out of a well timed switch attack that could become a switch counter when the odds are against you, or a powerful storm rush when you make good use of your advantage; so many mechanics, alongside the musou system which grants 2 ground musous and an air one, each character benefitting differently from the properties of their own moveset; sword fighters usually have good air musous to keep the chain, while other hard hitting characters' air musou sends everyone flying, while having a grab ground musou, and so much more. The gameplay, the most important part of this type of games, is well made, and allows more some good strategic parts, whether to go all out or hit and run depends on how one wants to play, enemies on hard and above are bound to give the player a challenge, specially if underleveled, trust me on this.\n\nAnd the OST (Soundtrack) is...well, all Warriors games have awesome soundtrack, but this one is just GOD DAMN\nOk, sorry about that,  you get a new Soundtrack, with Battle of Chibi (both historical and hyphotetical), Hefei, Fan Castle, Wuzhang Plains and well, the Lu Bu route soundtrack being hands down one of the best i heard; oh and if you are not satisfied....long time DW fans are in for a surprise for the Hyphotetical routes of the stages which play some well known songs, which i won't spoil for you :D\n\nAlas, but it's not perfect obviously, when it comes to the pc release, we got cut off the online multiplayer and the ps4 graphics, the latter not being that bad, but the other one can be a deal breaker for people who looked to play online with friends, (hoping DW8 empires fixes this) but why am i recommending this version? Well if you get it in a sale like i did, you get PS3 textures but with custom resolution, you also get to select how many enemies you can get on screen, and on PC oh my, it's terrific; and all the waves of enemies falling before you go at 60 fps pretty much all the time, even when events like fire attacks happen, which used to be the main cause of slowdown in consoles, it's fixed in the pc version and runs perfectly, which of course makes it AMAZING to play split screen with a Friend; I still remembered how bad it was in the PS2 and how little it improved in PS3/PS4 but this version was made for local coop, it runs amazing, and this shows how much potential Warrior games have if Koei made a perfect release.\n\nI say this is a good 1st try since Dynasty Warriors 6; and i hope to see more DW games coming to PC and making full use of it's capabilities, the game is amazing, although it does have shortcomings; but Warriors fans having a huge amount of content to look forward into, and newcomers have plenty of mechanics to memorize if you wanna be a True Warrior of the 3 Kingdoms, without spamming Lu Bu's  buffs, which i remind you to not pursue on Hulao Gate, just in case.\n\nOverall Good Experience and sets a good stone for future Warriors games, 8.5 don't let people who are butthurt over lack of online and that claim that hurr hurr DLC; which is not necessary, it adds a couple of stages which well, should cater to longtime Warriors fans as it brings back maps from classic games, (which pro players use to grind on Ultimate since they are hard), and some prototype weapons which would be later chosen to be used in DW8 Empires to change the weapons of some characters, costumes and the like are not necessary, and the game already has huge content by itself.\nMechanics are well instructed in the game, but you can always look up a guide, so no need to be afraid, wheter you are a long time fan or you wanna inmerse yourself in the Era of the 3 Kingdoms, this is one of the best experiences you can get; and if you want online, get the console version, they are just as enjoyable.\n\nAlso Lu Lingqi, jesus, Lu Bu's daughter, such a badass, Koei give this woman a spotlight in your next game dammit.","February 16, 2015","true","182.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Nothing fancy like DMC, or deep like Soul Calibur/Tekken (each character only has ~10 attacks, and most of them are similar/redundant) but with battles that last 5-8 minutes it's a great way to feel "god-like" at the end of a rough day.\n\nGOOD:\n+  Huge playable cast, all fully voice-acted, and each fighter has an individual moveset.\n\n+ Reasonably well-written story, full of history, fiction, and historical fiction.\n\n+ A lot of extra modes, challenges and things to do for collectors/grinders/the bored\n\n+ All weapons are upgradable, you can add new effects, or strengthen effects they already have.\n\nBAD:\n- Extremely long, you will easily spend ~100 hours playing through all 6 (yes, 6) Story Campaigns\n\n- Little variety in the cast. Due to its setting, nearly everyone is a dark-haired Japanese archetype and many have similar voices, looks, and movesets.\n\n- Ranged weapons (~5 or so fighters) are wonky, difficult to aim, and generally useless.\n\n- EVERY.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdvancedNinja/recommended/278080/","AdvancedNinja","Nepugia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdvancedNinja/","601 products in account","While I love this game to death, I think it's worth noting that it is a Dynasty Warriors game, and if you haven't liked Musou games up to this point, you're probably not going to like this one either. That aside, this game is one of my favorites at the moment, I'd like to break this game down category by category, but tl;dr is at the bottom.\n\nGameplay\n--------------------\nI won't waste time here explaining the DW gameplay mechanics in depth, but suffice to say, you'll take your overpowered character of choice, and use them as a wrecking ball to destroy generic soldiers to enemy officers. Each character is skilled with different types of weapons and has two unique combos with their respective armament. Of course, there are generic combos and skills associated with a weapon that anybody can utilize, but the special combos make your character that much more deadly. One new addition is the affinity triangle - basically every weapon has an affinity on it and certain affinities work better against others. This is a refreshing, though it basically boils down to doing more or less damage to an enemy depending on who has the affinity advantage.\n\nWhile there are several different modes to enjoy, there are many times that modes like Ambition (where you develop a forward camp into a palace, recruit officers, etc.) can feel like an endless grind. I've put a good deal of hours here and still have a while to go. Though stages have different objectives (randomly generated) in this mode, they more or less boil down to 'kill officer A'. Once you get familiar with these, I can see how the gameplay could get old fast.\n\nGraphics\n--------------------\nI look at graphics in two different categories: design and polish. Design-wise, this game is one of the better ones. The weapons all look cool in their own ways, environments are authentic and very appropriate for the game, and the characters are unique in their own ways. Veterans can argue that they look similar to previous entries into the DW series, but they've never gotten old to me.\n\nPolish is a bit of a different series. The graphics aren't bad by any means, but they aren't outstanding either. To touch on what I said earlier, there are times it feels like they didn't improve the graphics at all, but simply recycled them from older games. It hasn't bothered me yet, but I will say that if you're looking for a graphical masterpiece - you won't find it here.\n\nSound\n--------------------\nI've always felt that if gameplay wasn't what you remembered DW for, it's the soundtrack, and DW8 is certainly no exception. The musical score in this game is excellent and has a ton of tracks. The tracks are asian-themed, and really help you get immersed into the action. This is usually the case with DW games, and DW8 continues the trend perfectly. As of the posting of this review, the majority of the soundtrack is available on YouTube, so you can evaluate before you buy (I'm thinking you won't be disappointed).\n\nAlso, you can get the original Japanese VAs through a free DLC - this made the sale for me. :)\n\nControls\n--------------------\nBefore I begin, I used a wired 360 controller for this game, so I can't comment on the mouse and keyboard layout. Controls are simplistic, and easy to get the hang of. Using the default controls, the A button goes back and the B button confirms; this is standard for the Japanese, as I understand, but can be frustrating until you get the hang of it. Combat is another story completely.\n\nAttacking and combos are easy enough to learn, and as you progress in difficulty, you'll find the need to put that into use more and more. Overall, once you get the controls down, I think you'll find them enjoyable and straightforward.\n\n\nTL;DR\n-------------------------\nPros:\n\nFun and addicting hack and slash gameplay\nGreat soundtrack\nGame design makes levels feel immersive\nVery good port - haven't crashed once and runs very smoothly\nLots of different weapon types and attack\nCons:\n\nGets really grindy, especially in Ambition mode and looking for good weapons\nGraphics are fine, but nothing more\n$190 worth of DLC, and there's no new levels?\nWhen playing with X360 controller, on-screen buttons prompts still reflect keyboard controls.\n\nSummary: If you're a fan of DW or the hack and slash genre, this is a great game, and I think you'll get a lot of fun out of it. Otherwise, I'd hold out for a sale or just steer clear, if you're not a fan of the genre.","November 9, 2014","true","66.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Buy this when it's on special; hold your money otherwise. Gameplay Experience: 1/5. Story/Cinematic Experience: 5/5.\n\nThe Good: The multimedia in this game is incredible! The graphics, the animations, the music, the cinematics... all of them specially crafted to provide an amazing immersive experience.\n\nThe Bad: The gameplay is grossly primitive even by 1980s-1990s standards. 'Strong attacks' aren't 'strong' in the slightest, and yield far damage throughput than spamming regular attacks. The AI is also rather pathetic at all difficulty levels: troops and officers alike merely stand around, look at the enemy, randomly attack, and randomly defend. They didn't even bother pretending to make the combat between enemy groups realistic... instead, you'll often find troops mingling with one another as if they were in bumper cars, and officers are always playing lone wolf running around soloing enemy armies rather than fighting alongside their own troops. At the highest difficulty level, the game degenerates to a button smashing hack-and-slack, providing less of a challenge and more of a time waster towards meeting your objectives and advancing the story.\n\nThe Ugly: Prior to this game, the last game in the series I played was Dynasty Warriors 4. There are barely if any changes or innovations from DW4 to DW8...  The gameplay mechanics are largely the same! And no, the three point system doesn't do much except provide a means of spamming switch-attacks for a virtually fool-proof way of beating the enemy. Oh! And let's talk about Ambition Mode for a moment... talk about the dumbest, cheesiest, greatest waste of a feature of any game in this day and age! The randomly generated maps are the pinnacle of generic gameplay. None of the buildings or their ranks do anything of any significance towards enhancing the gameplay experience. Honestly, you waste more time upgrading the buildings than you get back from their virtually non-existance benefits. Bodyguards are also pretty useless; again, their abilities take more time to initiate than you get back from their virtually non-existent benefits. (On that note, I'm disappointed that bodyguards aren't available in the story mode like they were in earlier titles of the series). Weapon upgrading is also a time consuming process that yields little returns: as a game where a two-year old could button smash his way to victory on the highest difficulty level, any weapon will do. Sure, better weapons will make the game go faster, but so would lowering the difficulty level since the challenge is the same, but without as much monotony and time wasting. Something else: this game recycles content like crazy! If you want, for example, to get all of the 5th and 6th weapons, you need to replay missions over and over again... story mode stages from different factions or hypothetical scenarios recycle missions over and over again... ambition mode recycles missions and stages over and over again... Last point: Elephants, the War Elephant in particular... greatest disappointment in the history of time. Enough said.\n\nBottom Line: If you enjoy button smashing, and believe a challenge (ie. higher difficulty levels) should comprise doing the same thing as before, but taking longer to do it, then this game is for you! Otherwise, the best way to enjoy this title is focus on enjoying the story at the lowest difficulty level: as I've said before, higher difficulties provide less of a challenge and more of a monotonous, time-consuming, un-fun, unrewarding impediment towards beating the stages. In playing the game on easy, obtaining 5th and 6th weapons would be unnecessary, which is good!, as obtaining all of these weapons would otherwise involve repeating stages over and over and over again otherwise... boring!!!","September 24, 2014","false","196.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I still play DW4 today as it was one of the best games in the series. I was exicted to get DW8 with my new PC. Unfortunately this game fail my expectations in more ways than one. The story mode in this game is a definate step up from the others, however, it is near unbearable to play. The mechanics of this game are way out of balanced and simple minded. Don't get me wrong, DW4 was all button mashing, but it also had skill involved and kills were harder to get. It seems the increase in difficulty only gives enemies more health and damage, making minor effects to their skill and aggression. DW4 had quite the opposite effect, with higher difficulties camp enemies using complex combo moves and counter attacks to give a challenge vs DW8 witch you get 2 hit by an officer and its game over without a fun and challenging fight. The new move set replacing the items was also a dissapointment. The items in DW4 were unique and fun to level up using high level luck items to get it good with the random treasure chests. Now the physical powers are based on rock paper scissors type strong and weak weapon types, meaning 2hit victory or and even matched slow fight. The items were replaced by useless skills that were sometimes fun but more useless than not as a good weapon type meant all the difference.\nThe graphics on the game are an improvement but I couldn't care less about them because of its lame mechanics and AI. Lastly, the bodyguard removal and ease of kills. Bodyguards were fun to train and use, causing great rage when Sun Jian had slayed Kevin from the default Mystery bodyguard group. You grew attached to the bodyguards as you had to allow them kills to level up and become strong, which is why I miss this key feature of the game. Finally, the kills in this game are mindless. Sure its always been button mashing but getting 2000 kills without trying is insane. In DW4 500 kills a battle was really good. All in all, If you are looking for a game like the good old days, this isn't for you.","March 21","false","24.4"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Things you should know:\nTechnically a console port. Expect graphics and a control scheme build for consoles (Primarily the playstation). My suggestion is to keep movement using WASD, attacks using IJKL, and camera using TFGH\nLots of hack and slash, mobs of enemies on screen, occasionally led by officers. Can get repetitive, but it's great if you just want to lose yourself in the carnage.\nTons of playable characters. 80+. Unique weapons, stats, and voices for each. Weapon upgrading and crafting system is massive, can be hard to get a hang of, but can create some awesome weapons.\nCampaign is well done (although occasionally hilariously cheesy)\nDLC is a waste. Don't bother.\n\nOverall: 8/10, would play to pass time and relieve stress. Enjoyed story.

It's a simple concept but very enjoyable. Pick a character, strap on some weapons then run towards entire armies and lay waste to them. The combat is very enjoyable as there can be 100+ combatants on screen at a time and you send them flying like you are a case of dynamite. Another small thing I enjoy is the depth to the combat, when you first play you will probably think this is as simple as it gets with a normal attack and strong attack. If you pay attention to weapon types and switching moves and their benefits, partnering up the right weapon types can make for a much different experience.

The combat is very enjoyable as there can be 100+ combatants on screen at a time and you send them flying like you are a case of dynamite. Another small thing I enjoy is the depth to the combat, when you first play you will probably think this is as simple as it gets with a normal attack and strong attack. If you pay attention to weapon types and switching moves and their benefits, partnering up the right weapon types can make for a much different experience.

With the game on Easy difficulty you should breeze through, murdering anything that stands in your way and only sometimes needing to resort to Musou to quickly dispatch officers. On higher difficulties a real need for strategy comes into play. You have to pick your battles, approach carefully, and make sure you follow the missions lest you end up buried in extra foes that'll quickly finish you off.\n\nThere's a ton of gameplay here. 16 hours in, I 100%ed one of the five campaigns in Story mode and dabbled in Ambition mode a bit. If you're a completionist, you'll be in it for a thousand hours here. You have over 100 officers to max out, just as many weapons to find, four modes to master, five story campaigns, a ton of extra challenges, and I think seven difficulty modes to do it all in.\n\nThere's a weapon and officer combination for just about ever play style. You can slaughter a dozen redshirts at a time with a massive greatsword, shoot them with bows that fire multiple arrows to a shot, gracefully dispatch them with rapiers or winged spears, or go with something even stranger like bladed yoyos, chainsaws, or even pool cues and billard balls. Each weapon has a completely different feel and profile, allowing you to switch things up whenever you want. You'll pretty much pick your officer based on what weapon you like the most; then it's a matter of finding an officer that favors that weapon.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Three Kingdoms saga, it's all a real treat. Really you need SOME knowledge of the story to fully appreciate the game's storyline, but if you don't have that, the game does a good job of explaining the story so far between each mission. If you just put your head down and barrel through a campaign, you'll reach the end and get a more or less accurate picture of how that faction fared through this specific chunk of the Three Kingdoms saga. Then you can go back and re-do missions to find bonus objectives to unlock a different path, rewriting history and guiding your chosen faction to victory in the war, instead of their historical destiny. They really nailed this. If you go about it this way, it literally feels like you're going back in time and fixing wrongs that led you and your faction down a less glorious path.\n\nDown sides... the graphics are not amazing. You can see shadow and texture quality issues during the cutscenes, but they're not ugly by any means. The cutscenes are in-engine and this is an engine designed to throw 1,000 men at you at once, not render two or three characters in crystal clarity.\n\nSometimes what you're supposed to do during a battle is not clear: you are just one officer in a sprawling battle and, based on which officer you pick, your objectives could differ even within the same mission. As your comrades shout orders, you have to keep in mind that YOU can't do everything, and your role is limited to one section of the field. Usually you'll be find blindly barreling toward the flashing green square on the map, killing officers nearby, and waiting for a voiceover, but sometimes it's not that simple. This can lead to missed bonus objectives, nasty ambushes, and in some cases instant game overs.\n\nFinally on higher difficulties the AI is Musou-happy. Musou is basically an ultimate attack with a chargeup time and, supposedly, a limit on how often you can use them. On higher difficulties you have that limit, but opposing officers do not, and they'll not hesitate to use Musou at every opportunity. It can get a little frustrating as getting hit with a Musou attack often chains into a long combo where you're left helpless to watch as you get air-juggled. Oh well, learn to dodge :)","July 8, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Can get repetitive, but it's great if you just want to lose yourself in the carnage.\nTons of playable characters. 80+. Unique weapons, stats, and voices for each.

Graphics are so-so, not much better than previous Dynasty Warriors, but the game runs smoothly as a result. Forcing stuff in nV control panel doesn't seem to work, and there's no in-game AA, sadly, except in cutscenes.\nCharacters are largely pretty, sans some noticeably bad textures.\n\nGameplay is typical Dynasty Warriors - you're the Chinese General equivalent of Ramirez, but that's what makes it fun.\nExpect classic(ally) hammy and bad voice acting, but at least it's funnily bad and not just bad.\nThis being DW8XL, expect to have many hours of content. There are no less than five major 'campaigns', with two major branches each, the "historical" and the "hypothetical" (i.e. Koei offering a "What if" scenario) routes. There's a challenge mode, there's a free-mode to play any mission any way you want and a huge cast of playable characters. Then there are the 'Other Story' missions, objective-related branches and the Ambition Mode, which is an anachronistic open-ended campaign.\n\nSadly co-op is only local, but if you play Big Picture on your home TV with a pair of controllers this should be a fun experience to share if it's anything like DW6 was for me.\nThe PC port is also fudgy on controls as it shows generic icons or keyboard prompts for menus, and there doesn't seem to be innate Xbox controller support or prompts (the Steam discussions also suggest it is finicky too).\n\nThe story is, well, it's the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Missions are dramatized enactments of historical battles, and characters that never fought or etc. may be fighters now. But hey, the ladies are getting more undressed as the series progresses. Plus, soft body physics have made their way in!\n\nPursue Lu Bu 2014.","June 29, 2014","true","54.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although i enjoyed the Wei storyline the most, the Wu and Shu campaign's were also great to play and of course Lu Bu's storyline was really well made.\n\nThe gameplay is also better than ever, the combat is fluid, enemies provide more of a challenge and can surprise you even on normal difficulty. The map design and tactics used are superb. The Japanese/English language option DLC was also a nice touch since i always prefered the japanese voice acting.\n\nOverall the gameplay and story is quite solid for a hack and slash game and definitely worth buying if you find a nice sale and enjoy the genre.\n\nDynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends is proof that Koei should bring more of their games to PC and Steam.","October 8, 2014","true","160.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For one, the game crashes so frequently on Windows 8 that it is practically unplayable, something play-testing on modern PC platforms would have revealed within ten minutes.\n\nSomething just as obvious is the lack of mouse support. Everyone who owns a PC owns a mouse, so it makes no sense that the game controls would be run entirely by the keyboard. The fact of the matter is we don't all have controllers, and we never will all have controllers, so support for the mouse is necessary and expected for this style of game.\n\nUntil these two errors at a sheer minimum are adequately fixed I'm not touching this game again, and if you run Windows 8 and don't own a controller, I advise you to do the same.","May 17, 2014","false","0.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Dynasty Warriors 8 is the best game in the series if you ask me, and Xtreme Legends Complete Edition just adds more to it. However, due to the state of this PC Port, I can't reccommend it.\n\nIt's terribly poorly optimised, has a very limited selection of resolution and graphical options, and it's control scheme defaults are obscene. There is no mouse functionality in the menus and despite using the now PC Standard Microsoft Controller the button prompts are ALWAYS for the keyboard controls despite the game clearly being designed for play with a controller.\n\nFinally, and most gauling of all, is the lack of online co-op. The store page itself even claims it has online co-op by having among the features listed "Co-Op" and "Local Co-Op". Every other game with the "Co-Op" lable on steam has Online Co-Op, but in this one case this is not true and Steam refuses to refund customers despite this blatant false advertising. Every other version of this game has the Online Co-Op, why not the steam version?\n\nIs it really so difficult to have the PC version, run through steam (a service well known for it's excellent online multiplayer especially when it comes to co-op) and have it be online? I'd say not, but Koei apparently can't do it.\n\nThere is quite a bit of outcry about this so we can only hope that this, along with the framerate and resolution problems, will be fixed in a patch later and if not a patch then in a third party mod.\n\nOddly there are a lot of people arguing AGAINST those of us raising complaints and taking KOEI's side in this issue. My question to you is this. How exactly is KOEI gutting features from the PC release and yet charging MORE for this version than any other version a good thing?","May 18, 2014","false","44.2"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I've completed 1 campaign at the time of writing this review and I'm happy. It took me ~4hrs to complete Lu Bu's campaign and I'm assuming it's gonna take around the same time to finish the rest. That's a good amount of game time for a hack & slash game. But we also have to include the factor of the other game modes. In other words, this game offers a TONNE of replayabilty.\n\nObviously, due to it being a Japanese game, the English voices are done horribly. The dubs don't fit right to what the characters are mouthing and it just looks awkard. That's why I'm waiting for a good Japanese pack to come out so I don't have to put up with desynced audio. Anywho. The actual English voice actors did ok at portraying what I thought the characters would sound like and make me feel like the voices fit.\n\nNow it's time for everybodies favourite thing to ♥♥♥♥♥ about... GRAPHICS.\n\nAlrighty, this games graphics to me are good. They remind me of Dark Souls 2 so I'm rather happy. But heck, I'd play this game even if it was FlyFF graphics. Getting the graphics options sorted was a bit of a struggle, as the game would refresh the look of your client every time you moved your screen res up or down. (Keep in mind, theres no drop box of screen resolutions. You have to scroll to your resolution.) The game runs fine on High, 1080p, 60fps (obviously depending on your machine) meaning it exceeds other ports that are limited to 1 graphic option and 30fps. However, in the cutscenes of the game, the quality is reduced to what looks like Low settings and shoved down to 30fps flat. This doesn't bother me in the slightest due to graphics not mattering to me at all but it can and will bother some other potental players.\n\nNow to the thing that almost made me give up on the game after 5 minutes: controls.\n\nThis games controls felt so wonky and un-natural to me, even with the controller. I first tried kbm, but then I found out there was no use for the mouse AT ALL. So I switched to controller, but it just felt so awkward due to the player only getting to move the camera using the right trigger and left trigger as well as there being no "pause" button allowing you to go in to the main menu. But this only took a good 5 minutes to sort out some good key configs for controller to make the game feel natural and not alienistic.\n\nThat is all I have to say after about 4 hours.\n\nEven though I only posted the bad things about the game, this game still deserves a good rating for finally bringing a long awaited game/franchise to steam. It's port wasn't great but it brought me back to the youngling version of me playing Guan Yu and wrecking that yellow emperor.\n\nBut this is a must have for all hack and slash fans as well as RPG fans who enjoy Asian warfare/dynasties..\n\nBeware of Lu Bu.","May 21, 2014","true","11.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The game cuts some corners on this level, but you don’t sacrifice anything important. The main way the game reduces power usage is to stop rendering the infantry’s details, so you are literally slaughtering faceless peons by the hundreds. In my opinion this improves the game, especial when even the enemy officers have no faces and die before they even stop introducing themselves.\n\nThe maps are very large and the characters are in no way linked to the world that they live in. When you turn your character, he spins like a top, even while on a horse. The walls are like a half pipe, completely smooth. It is a little jarring how the game gives so little ♥♥♥♥♥ about how the characters interact with the world, but that’s not why we play Dynasty Warriors, we play to be the ultimate warrior. The game’s graphics only go as far as it is needed to show your unlimited power being unleashed upon some faceless cretin trying to either flee or fight, but in the end his only hope is to get out of the high solider density and be by himself. They are too small to chase and kill, and that is their only saving grace.\n\nStory: 		1.5/3\nThere once was a book. It depicted an epic struggle between an orphan who grew into a monster and a man who became a god. Through the many years and endless greedy sequels, we got Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. Characters exist and they struggle in some over vamped high school level drama that is always exploding to the next plot point. With all the high energy I remember none of it. It is the blandest set of campaigns that try their hardest to get in the way of you slaughtering innocent people, and thankfully it even fails at that.\n\nThe story takes nothing from the game and is pretty funny how hard it tries. It’s like a Michael Bay movie condensed into a videogame.\n\nGame Play: 	2.5/3\nThere are two main game modes and some time-attack or free modes on the side. The two main game modes are Story and Empires. The gameplay is straight from dw5 with the addition of a weapon triangle, earth, man, and heaven. Standard one is weak against the other and strong against the third. You can also have any character equip any weapon, and two at a time. Have you ever been play a Dynasty Warrior and thought, “dam it, why is Lu Bu not using a magic harp to kill these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s”?\n\nThe story mode lets you play as a group of heroes in one of the soap opera style stories. At one point I think I fought the son of Lui Bie who was now king of some country and sucked at it so much that I was hired to kill him by his people who were then guarding him. So I was hired to kill the people I was hired by in order to kill their king who was killing the people. Only play for unlocks.\n\nEmpire mode lets you run a gauntlet of small battles. On the fifth battle you can fight a large battle to unlock a large number of officers by defeating them in battle. After each battle you can either leave, resetting the gauntlet, or continue and fight harder battles with greater rewards. When you return to camp you can upgrade it so you can get better bonuses during the battles, buy better weapons, or get pets. Finally you can have a majestic eagle kill you enemies. This mode is great for getting your character more powerful when you get stuck in the story mode, or if you just want to kill some people without all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nRe-Playable: 	.5/1\nIf you treat replay as starting a new character and using them to kill a small nation, then you can replay this game until the final horn is blown and gods descends from on high. If you consider it completing the game and restarting, good luck doing that before the end days.\n\nShould you buy it?\nThis game is a good time sink. I play it when I want to kill people without thinking. It’s pretty colors killing other pretty color like some bloody fireworks. It would be a good buy on about a 20% sale.\n","April 2, 2015","true","47.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me make this real simple in a T chart.\n\nPROS:\n-High-action gameplay.\n-Rarely a dull moment.\n-LOTS of levels in Freemode, Story, and Ambition.\n-Play through the Lu Bu, Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin, and Other storylines!\n-Eat your weight in meatbuns and never gain a pound\n-Slaughter literally thousands of questionably innocent soldiers every battle.\n-over 70 playable characters and weapon types!\n-Fun, new hypothetical battles tied in well with the actual storyline.\n-Kill that sick sack of ♥♥♥♥, Dong Zhuo.\n-Works surprisingly well on an older computer like mine, zero lag or crashes so far.\n-After you configure the controls to match your preference it's actually pretty smooth to play.\n-If you played it on console you'd have to buy the base game and then Xtreme Legends as an expansion, on PC it's all packaged. So it's actually quite a bit cheaper this way.\n\nCONS:\n-THERE IS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER, ONLY LOCAL CO-OP (which sucks but personally I play it solo anyway)\n-For some reason, there's no spoken narration between battles. You've gotta read it, which really isn't all that bad.\n-After playing for 8-10 hours in a single day it starts to feel repetetive.\n-Replay value isn't tremendous, but isn't low either.\n-Koei bleeds you dry for additional DLC.\n-Graphics are downright emberassing during cutscenes on the non-playable characters. Not noticable during battles though.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSo in tl;dr format this is a very enjoyable game for a price that's actually quite a bit lower than on consoles, it runs flawlessly on my moderately older PC, has lot's of content, DOESN'T have online multiplayer (only local co-op), and let's you practiaclly commit a chinese genocide in every battle.

Note that I didn't say "excellent".\n- Killing millions of chinamen that were simply following orders has never been so easy and fun.\n\nCons:\n\n- Default KB/M keybinds are totally whack. Who the hell decided that?\n- Using a controller doesn't change the control instructions to match your keybinds. I don't have the tab key on a controller?\n- CPU utilization is garbage. This can be expected from a console port, because consoles are a cancer upon the gaming industry, but seriously? Tons of users have issues with this game slowing down because it only likes using a single thread.\n- It's absolutely unbelievable that this game series does not have online multiplayer by now. You can sorta remedy this by using NVidia Gamestream to simulate local co-op, but... this is (almost) 2016, and on steam, and they can't spare some of the cash that they gouge from the players to code some online multiplayer through steam? What?\n- The developers/publishers are not US based, and don't give a crap about you, and will never read your complaints.\n- The voiceovers suck.

Now, here I go after I bought this port on sale and my god. Using the PlayStation 4 controller for this game feels completely messed up. It's not the same setup scheme as it was on console, and the movement controls feel delayed as well. Every time I tried to set it up, the game freezes up and I have to Ctrl+Alt+Del out of it and close it. I hope they fix this problem and not to mention that this game is extremely difficult to master with the default controls on the keyboard.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty great. You have a lot of characters, with each of them having different individual move set, to choose from, so many battles to fight in, and most of the times this game can turn into a grind fest if you wish to level every character.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying this port, make sure you have a right controller for it.","March 24","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has no online multiplayer, inconsistent and often low texture quality on environments and especially on non-playable characters even during cutscenes, a unit limit far lower than what most PC's can handle, and no narration between missions (seriously how hard would that have been?). Some have also reported game crashing bugs, but I haven't encountered any.\n\nOn the positive character textures and models for playable characters tend to be pretty good, and there are a ton of characters to play and a wide variety of weapons to choose from, as well as several modes of play. Voice acting remains hilarious which I believe is intentional.\n\nHowever the lack of narration between missions really hurts immersion in the story and feels uncanny and painfully silent after the fully voice acted cutscenes and battle speeches. Poor textures and extremely limited number of units allowed on screen also both serve to make the game feel unpolished on the PC.\n\nThe lack of online multiplayer also really hurts the experience. Dynasty Warriors has tremendous potential here, and it's potential that is being entirely wasted.\n\nKoei has traditionally assumed that PC gamers just hate Dynasty Warriors, failing to understand that what PC gamers actually hate are broken glitchy terrible ports. Past PC ports such as Dynasty Warriors 6 Xtreme Legends were so broken that stores pulled them off the shelves, and received pretty much no support whatsoever.\n\nHopefully this game making top seller on Steam will show Koei that the market is there for games like Dynasty Warriors and their previous assumptions were fundamentally irrational non sequiturs. Here's hoping for some patch support and the addition of a narrator and online multiplayer, at which point I'll revise this review.","June 30, 2014","false","7.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

For instance, it's lacking plenty of DLC that has been in the PS3 / PS4 ports.\n\nThis is however, the best you can get out of the Dynasty Warriors franchise for the PC. Unless you'd like to play that Chinese version of Dynasty Warriors 7: Xtreme Legends which involves you travelling all the way to Taiwan to buy the game, install it and try and figure out the Chinese menu.\n\nThis game is your typical Chinese killing simulator series that everyone has come to know and love. (Not the Japanese killing simulator Samurai Warriors). you pick a character, choose a weapon, equip some skills and beat the heck out of every living creature that has red bar tagged to it. Controls feel great (after a bit of changing things here and there) and your character moves as gracefully as expected from an "AAA game".\n\nAs per most Dynasty Warriors, your character has a basic attack, a strong attack and a muso attack (in 3 forms) and an additional rage attack. Basic attacks and strong attacks can be combo-ed to provided a variety of entertaining attack moves. These vary from character to character and information can be obtained from the character screen at any time during a battle. Muso attacks come in three forms now, the basic muso, an aerial muso and an aimed muso--each muso's varies from officer to officer and hence, you'll have to experement to form the best combo. The rage muso is essentially your character's "ultimate" form where he/she goes all red and angry and starts dishing out ridiculous amount of damage--just think of it as telling a girl on her period that she looks fat.\n\nStory wise, there isn't much story as expected in a Dynasty Warriors game. Story mode campaigns however gives you access to the usual Wei, Shu and WU campaigns. The Jin (or Shima) campaigns as well as other (Where you play as that lizard helmet-ed Lu Bu) are still there as other campaigns to try (as piror to Dynasty Warriors 7).\n\nThere's also the usual challenge mode as well as amibition mode where you farm up your own officers, materials and fame to create some giant heck of a temple / castle for your dear emperor to reside in. Farming is split into 3 groups, farming for officer allies (to accompany you/ do work for you), farming for materials (to build up your town) and farming for fame (to build up the limit of officers you can have). All of these involve one simple thing -- picking up your weapon and beating the hell out of every living creature you see on the battlefield.\n\nMusic in this game is great as always--catchy, uplifting and always gets your mood up in fights. Although some pieces can be a bit dragy at times. Old but amazing scores such as the Wei thunderous theme music from Dynasty Warriors 7 make a return in this game. You'd also feel a sense of satisfaction when you hear that satisfying "TWACK" sound when your character lands a blow on someone else.\n\nThe graphics in the game match up to the PS3 version of Dynasty Warriors 8. I must say I was rather disappointed that Tecmo Koei didn't try to port up to the PS4's verseion of the game given the PC's unlimited processing power. All in all, the game looks decent when cranked up to max but doesn't quite match up to the graphics of today's games such as Titanfall. For those of us who can't understand. It's like playing Titanfall on the 360 after you've touched it on the Xboxone--not exactly very pretty looking, yet still decent.\n\nUnfortunately, as of 18/5/2014, the advertised multiplayer isn't exactly multiplayer. Clicking on multiplayer just brings you to a blank screen. Meaning you can't beat up Chinesemen with a friend from the other end of the world. Split-screen should work in theory, but I don't have a duo controller to try it out with. Who wants to play Dynasty Warriors on the keyboard anyway.\n\nAll in all Dynasty Warriors is what it should be. A casual beat-em-up simulator where your main focus would be to have fun. It's a recommended buy for most people out there since it's the ONLY newest gen Dynasty Warriors that is available for the PC (unless you'd like to play Dynasty Warriors 6 / 4 which are incredibly old and not on Steam).\n\nThanks to Riptide for the game.","May 18, 2014","true","25.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not recommended to anyone but the die hard fans of the series who can put up with this ♥♥♥♥.","October 2, 2014","false","5.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043036975/recommended/278080/","76561198043036975","Dark™","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043036975/","119 products in account","As a huge fan of the DW series (played since DW2 came out on PS2), I highly enjoyed this game. They did a fantastic job on the new characters and the rage system is phenomenal. That being said, if you are brand new to the DW series I wouldn't recommend this game. I believe that you have to have a love for the series in order to enjoy this game, unless combat is your cup of tea. If you're brand new and appreciate story and cinematics more than combat, I would recommend DW4, DW6, or DW7 instead, all of which are some of the only few available on PC as well (luckily).\n\nTL;DR: If you enjoy the DW series for the combat and not so much the plotline, then this game would be for you. If you are a DW loremaster like me (although I enjoy the combat as well), the other games in the series are extremely better.\n\n~~~~SPOILER WARNING FROM HERE ON OUT. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK~~~~\n\n-The Bad-\n\nThe Story Mode is argubly the best mode in the game, next to Challenge Mode. Ambition Mode is almost literally a grindfest, and Free Mode is pretty pointless unless you're farming for weapons.\n\nDifficulty: That being said, Story Mode has some difficulty problems. If you play on normal difficulty setting, the game would be semi-difficult in the beignning stages but once you get to the 4th or 5th battle it gets ridiculously easy. Especially if you find decent weapons along the way. Basically the 1st battle is the hardest and the last battle is the easiest. If you try raising the difficulty, the beginning stages are ridiculously difficult, but if you can get past them the rest of the games difficulty should become easier. Regardless, you shouldn't have to up the difficulty of a game because you get baby fed OP weapons. Also, some characters gain rage meter ridiculously fast and it lets you cheese the battles (Xiahou Yuan for example).\n\nCutscenes: The cutscenes were alright. There were other games in the series that had way more powerful cutscenes though. Most of the cutscenes were either someone dying or a random group of peon's running to an officer and just getting slaughtered. Also, from a story standpoint, the cutscenes were a little upsetting. Big important events that had cutscenes in all the other games (like Pang Tong's death at Luo Castle) were removed and instead replaced with a cutscene at the end of a battle. People want to see cutscenes in the heat of the moment, that's what the series did so well and that's what the people love. I don't know why they got rid of it. Seems like they tried to coalesce every big event into one cutscene at the end of every battle.\n\nGraphics: The graphics in this game are not to be what is expected from a 2014 PC release. DW7 looks almost identical, and has more realistic features (like after killing somebody their body stays there on the ground instead of mystically disappearing like in this game). It seems like they updated armor textures, facial expressions, and some spell effects, but in all honesty I want to have an eyegasm when I'm out on the battlefield fighting, not in cinematics. Especially with todays technology, upgrading the graphics instead of copy and pasting them from DW7 wouldn't be that difficult.\n\n-The Good-\n\nCombat: This game hands down has the best combat I have ever played in the series thus far. From using your rage meter, to switching weapons to gain an advantage in battle, the combat in this game is phenomenal. Plenty of options that keeps it fresh and interesting.\n\nCharacters: There are a plethora of characters in this game. Koei did an insanely good job at making each character unique and have their own style of fighting. There's no two characters that you can pick up and play the exact same. It's also exciting when you get to play someone new, even though I play Zhou Tai 99% of the time.\n\nVariety:  Another great feature of this game is it's variety. Instead of just having the 3 standard story modes (Wu, Wei, Shu), they added in Jin, Other, and Lu Bu's story mode. 6 different storylines to play through. This is most of the reason why I'm addicted to this game. What's even better, is you can jump between Story Modes and it will save your progress in all of them (not battle saves though). Sure, the cutscenes and difficulty may be subpar, but as a diehard DW fan I always look past that.\n\nI hope this review helps some people out. I tried to give some insight as to what you are getting yourself into when buying this game.\n\nEdit - Just realized the game is on sale right now for $25 once again. Highly recommend picking it up, even if you are new to the series. Pick it up cheap while you can, it probably won't be on sale anymore after this.","July 18, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/co199/recommended/278080/","co199","RobotWizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/co199/","684 products in account","After putting roughly 30 hours into this game and trying all of the game modes, I feel like I can write a reasonable review.\n\nSystem Specs\n\nWindows 8.1\nIntel Core i7 4702HQ\n8GB RAM\n512GB SSD\nnVidia GTX 765m\n1600x900 Resolution\n\n\nPerformance\n\nThe first week of this game's release was pretty rough for Windows 8.1 users. I had repeated hangs where the game would freeze on a loading screen, requiring closing the game and re-opening it. There were ways around this (namely running in Win98 compatibility mode), but those problems have been resolved with the first patch. Now that the patch has been released, I have absolutely no slowdown with all settings cranked. Dynasty Warriors games have never been too demanding and this game doesn't change that. As long as you're not trying to run the game on a potato, you should be okay.\n\nGameplay\n\nDynasty Warriors has long been a series that players either love or hate. I haven't played a Dynasty Warriors game since DW6, as I don't own a console. When I saw DW8 was coming to the PC, I had to jump on it. Let me tell you - this game is a world apart from DW6, and it's for the better. There is a lot of content here:\n\n- 6 story modes: Lu Bu, Wu, Wei, Shu, Jin and Other, all with different branching stories.\n- Free mode, where you can play any officer in any level.\n- Challenge mode, where you have a set challenge to beat at a set level.\n- Ambition mode, where you build a base camp and then conquer ancient China.\n\nRoughly 30-35 hours in and I've only beaten one story mode (without the hypothetical branch) and dipped my toes into Free and Challenge modes. I've made it through the first half of Ambition mode, as well. Those modes, combined with the ability to level all the characters to 150 and get special weapons leads to a huge amount of content; I'd venture to say there's between 60-100 hours of content here, easily.\n\nControls\n\nI play without a controller. I remapped the keys to WASD for movement and JKLI for attacks. Using LSHFT for block and camera center and Space for jump has worked well for me. I'm not sure about controller mapping, as I don't use a controller.\n\nSound\n\nThe dubbing is gloriously cheesy in this game, but it's Dynasty Warriors - what do you expect? I enjoy the over-the-top voice acting and cheesy buttrock soundtrack; will it win any awards? No, but this game isn't about the story so much as it is chopping through thousands of footsoldiers only to drop a massive Musou attack and ooh and aah at the pretty colors.\n\nVerdict\n\nI didn't mind paying full price for the game, as I have limited experience with Dynasty Warriors and knew what I was getting into. The initial pre-patch game was a little rough to deal with, but now that it's been patched this is a great game. I'd perhaps wait for a sale if you're new to DW, but there's a lot to love here.","May 28, 2014","true","37.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The formula doesn't change much, the graphics get upgrades and the system gets minor tweaks.  But overall, Dynasty warriors stays the same over time.  However, this time around we gain Ambition mode!\n\nAmbition mode lets you pick a character you have unlocked (via story or one of the starters) to start your own 'faction' and grow in power.  You'll do battles to gain allies, fame, and resources, as well as upgrading new facilities and eventually building the massive temple I can't remember the name of.   It's a pretty cool mode and adds a lot of replay value over just spamming free mode once you finish storylines.\n\nPotential New Fans\nIf you've never played a Dynasty Warriors game, then go into it understanding one core bit of knowledge:  It's a hack and slash beat'em up.   You'll ride around the battle field completing objectives, but mostly you're massacreing hapless soldiers and battling other generals and lieutenants.   Occasionally getting demolished by Lu Bu.   There are a ton of storylines to play through, as well as a massive amount of characters with unique move sets.\n\nI personally love the series, but it's not for everyone.  I recommend watching a gameplay video before making your decision.","May 25, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The things they introduce each game, with new characters, scenarios and weapons are all worth it.\n\nThe classic story of the Three Kingdoms remains the same, but now you can enter "Hypothetical Routes" through the story, effectively changing history. These require all sorts of special requirements to be fulfilled in the story missions, and one particular mission will change radically, allowing you to win a battle that was historically lost or save certain characters from their historical demise.\n\nThere are a ridiculous number of characters, some of whom get no playtime in the story mode at all, and there are other characters whose classic setup has been overhauled with new EX attacks and weapon options. Add this to a more comprehensive Free Mode than in most previous titles and it gives you an enormous amount of replayability and fun.\n\nWhile Dynasty Warriors has never been a game changer, the series remains one of the best hack and slashers on the market, and it's characters continue to get deeper and more interesting with each passing edition, particularly with the addition of the hypothetical routes. The dialogue is known for being awful, or at least below average in quality, and this remains the same, but it's become something of a charm of the series.\n\nTo conclude, if you like a good old bit of button mashing fun, this game is one of the best. It's cathartic, simple and hilarious in it's execution for all sorts of reasons.","May 19, 2014","true","103.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Will it blend?\n\nNo, it won't.\n\nWhen I boot up a modern game on the PC and it requires you to use the arrow keys and enter to navigate menus, that's a pretty bad first impression. When I use the configuration utility outside of the game to set it to 1080p and it defaults to 800x600 resolution when launching the game, that isn't helping too much either. When you have to cycle through every resolution between 800x600 and 1080p just to get to 1080p (meaning it loads the game in each resolution), I start to taste some bile. Having to rebind every single button on my gamepad for a barely functional control set up while using f12 to clear binds (seriously) left me literally saying "oh no" while attempting to make this game playable.\n\nI love Dynasty Warriors.

I've only played about 2 missions in this game before I had to stop, so I don't quite have a lot of details about the game itself. If you've played any other Dynasty Warriors game before you already know what to expect from the gameplay. If not, it is a ridiculous, over the top hack n' slash game loosely based on the book series "Romance of the Three Kingdoms". The gameplay itself is fun, and its mostly about spectacle fighting, but there is a bit of difficulty and a high chance of suddenly being killed from only a few hits on the harder difficulties.\n\nSo what's actually new in this version? More characters, more weapons, more stages, Lu Bu gets his own personal story mode in the same category as Wu, Wei, Shu, and Jin (honestly this just sounds like a DLC pack more than anything). The game is addictively fun especially if you like spectacle fighters or fast paced hack n' slashes.\n\nSo what are the downsides? Well its a below average quality PC port. My first and most pertinent issue is texture flickering. The textures on a lot of ground flicker like crazy around any hills, and sometimes disappear completely. This is the reason I could only play 2 missions before I had to stop. I've attempted messing with the graphics options but there seems to be no way to fix it in game (if anyone can find a fix for this, PLEASE let me know).\n\nSecond problem: The graphics options menu. For a PC game it has very few choices for graphics settings. The major issue here though is the resolution setting. Instead of a drop down selector you have to scroll through each possible resolution, and the game reloads in the new resolution and asks you if you want to keep the new setting. This is just frustrating and pointless.\n\nThird problem: Control displays. The game features fully rebindable controls for every action in the game, and thats wonderful, it really is. The issue is that no matter what you set the controls to, or if you're using a gamepad, the game will always display keyboard controls on the menus, and in game they just show a random key with a picture that vaguely describes the action you would do if you hit that key. The question is, what key/button is it? It's a guessing game that requires you to continuosly refer back to your controls to figure out what does what.\n\nFinal problem: This is more of a personal issue, but the overall graphics quality. I understand that the DW series has never won an award for amazing graphics, but playing this even on the highest graphics settings I feel like I'm playing a PS Vita or old XBox 360 game on my PC. The graphics feel like an overall downgrade from the original DW 8 on XBox 360. I get that not everyone has a monster tower of a computer that can run anything a person can dream up, but I'd at least like to play something that doesn't look like it belongs on a portable system.\n\nThe second, third, and final problem I can live with and still whole-heartedly recommend this game, because at the end of the day, its all about the gameplay with this title, but the first problem physically harms my eyes on most stages. I will still recommend this game, its still fun as all hell, but I don't recommend playing it too much until the texture flicker is either fixed with a patch or someone finds a work-around to make it stop. Til then I suggest refraining from excessive play times.","May 14, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here we have a story routes based on the history of the three kingdoms more or less ,also story route WHAT IF plus bonus levels with proper story also based on what if except the Lu Bu's one which offers only 2 story routes. In the previous DW7 everything was told like a historical movie drama with deaths , sadness and happiness to me was epic. Anyway the good thing here is they decided to add more of a fan service which is awesome too, you can save your characters from death and change the history.\nYou don't need to play the previous games of the franchise  to understand the story mode. Each DW is different with similar story. The game can be very repeteitive because of its nature but that doesn't mean it's not fun. The graphics look better than ever and the weapon system from the previous  DW7 is improved. From what i know the PC version is a port of the PS3 version but with improved graphics and FPS. I havent played the PS4 version ,i wasn't so impressed from what i saw but still i can tell the PS4 is the best. If you dont own PS4 go for the PC version. It's still good enough but i wish KOEI ported the PS4 version.","June 24, 2014","true","157.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And because of that it pains me to not be able to  recommend this game.\n\nThe PC port of DW 8 is atrocious. To start, they ported over the PS3/Xbox 360 version of the game. WHY IN THE......grrrrr.  The east Asia control scheme is still in tact (B/O is confirm selection, while A/X is back) which isn't a huge problem, but makes you feel like an idiot while you enter and exit menus for 10 mintues straight. If you don't have a gamepad controller definitly stay away, your mouse will become your new favorite paper weight. No 16:10 monitor resolution support. O and despite what the store page said; there is no online multiplayer! Why!? Why!? Even the PS Vita version of this game supports that. Very disappointing.\n\nWith that being said I love dynasty warriors, and I will still play the snot out of this; it's just there is no way I could recommend purchasing it to a fellow gamer, it would be morally wrong.\n\nStep your game up Koei...","December 29, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

To max this out id take another 20hours+.

Added five new characters, and a story mode of the Demon himself LU BU, this is so far the best in the series. With so many characters to choose from, and they all having their own fighting style, it is impossible to find a favorite character. Whether you are new to the series and just finding your favorite, or you're a returning fan with a previous favorite character like myself, there is a character just for you. The only problem there is with this port is the fact that it doesn't have mouse support, so unless you are comfortable using the keyboard fully, you'll need a gamepad.\n","August 16, 2014","true","122.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

TONS of unique characters, and weapons to choose from, good tutourial, story mode, and free mode. One problem, is that the buttons are not clear in the tutourial, they use symbols instead of the keyboard buttons, or a controller button, but if you look in your options, or just fool around with it, you will find the controls to be mediocre (I use a 360 controller) but they do not handicap the game's play style at all.

However, if you are a long term fan of this series this wouldn't have come as a suprise. There is unfortunately NO online co-op, which is something that I've always wanted for this series. The controls are intitially really weird, and I opted for just using a gamepad instead of fumbling around with the keyboard.Graphics are pretty lackluster but that's never what this game was about right?\n\nThey added an enormous amount of weapons (specific wep for each character), and a new game mode. The new gamemode is a little boring in my opinion, but it's a nice change of pace from the regular story line. The best addition to this game has to be the alternate endings that are, non-historical, but much more fun to play out.\n\nOverall would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who is new to the series and long-term fans alike.","October 2, 2014","true","44.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you buy this, make sure to have a fully working 360 controller or you will be dissapointed.\n\n- No Network Multiplayer yet.\n\n\n*Good Things*\n-----------------------------\n- It's Dynasty Warriors on PC.\n- Ambition Mode is very fun, and does provide some break from grinding the campaigns over and over.\n- Japanese VA available (this was added in as free DLC after release)\n\n\nShould you buy it?\n-----------------------------\n\nI'd say in it's current form, yes, assuming you have a working 360 Controller and are a fan of the Dynasty Warrior series.\n\n\nShould I buy the DLC?\n-----------------------------\n\nNot really.

For new players, this game offers interesting fighting gameplay mixed with you personifying a character in history.\n\nPROS:\nThe weapon system - Each character has proficiencies with different weapons, ranging from 1 to 4 stars.  You are able to use whatever weapons you want as your primary and secondary weapons, but it would be wise to stick to the ones you are proficient with.  Personally I find this system to not be worth much and stick to the weapon meant for the character (their 'Ex' weapon).  So, for example, Lu Bu, I use two helberds, one for primary and another for secondary.\nThe levels - I like how they decided to add Hypothetical routes to the story modes.  Granted these maps are largely "aww lets all come together and win yayyyyy" maps, but one could take the historical value in that these battles would happen should the path have been taken in history.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is typical of Warriors games and can be watched on youtube for 5 minutes and understand what its about.\n\nCONS:\nGraphics - Why they decided to port the PS3 graphics of the game is beyond me, and whoever decided to do that should be slapped.  Having played this on the PC and then seeing the PS4 graphics, it drove me to buy the PS4 version of the game and replay my progress there.  One caveat that I had not considered was that my game looked much better if I turned the brightness settings all the way up!  Strange...  Graphics comparison videos are available online.\nCharacter design - While I, and many others appreciate a dub to accompany the subs with the option to go back to Japanese voices, some of the English voices are just terrible.  For example; Jiang Wei's voice is bad,  and Sun Quan's is not well done but tolerable.  There are also token words that get very old very fast, such as Jiang Wei/Liu Chan's overuse of the word "Benevolence".  I also dislike how they are morphing many of the characters to look like they are ripped right out of an anime, but I guess we have the otaku kawaii culture that Koei caters to in Japan to thank for that.\n\n\nAll in all: For the new fan a suitable game to try, if you can get it on sale.  For those that have been playing for awhile, give it a shot.","September 29, 2014","true","49.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Depending on the weapon you choose, you'll get a different moveset to negotiate your way to your enemies' elimination (me and my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rhetorics) and it all gets spectacular in new ways whatever you pick.\n\nBut all I am doing is just beating up enemy soldiers to win each battle?\nYes and no. Granted, many of the scenarios' outcome are decided upon whose commanding officer gets defeated but there are other kinds of critical objectives taking place, as well. One I can think of is escorting an important officer to safety out of the battlefield, which means you'll have to fight those who stand in the path and putting the mission into jeopardy. (that's the point, after all)\n\nEvery scenario also have a set of different events that will decide the flow of battle and it is up to you if you will carry them out for the benefit of your current scenario or the next one. So the strong point being is that it all comes to strategizing your next move. (like, should you carry out that side objective or protect your commanding officer from incoming attacks?)\n\nOutside the gameplay factor, I must say that the developers have allowed to lift up the character's personalities throughout the story, giving them some kind of intrigue value since you can relate with some of them. Cao Cao, for example, has been relatively portraited as some kind of villain at different points but playing the Wei campaign shows that there are different nuances that defines his human values.\n\nBy what I've summed up so far, Dynasty Warriors 8 comes up with different gameplay functions and character designs (both in looks and moves) on a familiar preset based on the Chinese history. Having not played anything since DW5, this was a welcoming return when it has made its way to Steam and it's hard to quit when I've gotten into the rampaging and progressing through the battlefields and stories. I haven't tried other game modes such as Ambition mode, but you can find other reviews that touches upon those contents. Ever since Dynasty Warriors Online went down, I (as many other fans) only wished the online multiplayer function would come back again on this release but I can only hope it does someday soon.","August 1, 2014","true","186.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/highlysuspectURL/recommended/278080/","highlysuspectURL","highlysuspectusername","http://steamcommunity.com/id/highlysuspectURL/","421 products in account","I started playing the franchise at DW3, which would eventually be done so on a near religious level, almost all the available characters stats were maxed out by the time I stopped playing it.  I also had the chance to put in at least a few hours for DW4, and DW5.  I haven't gotten the chance to play DW6, or DW7, so if my review mentions features that were already present you'll know why.\n\nFirst things first.  Lots of people complain that it is a bad port.  IT'S NOT.  Many users had some issues before I had even purchased a copy, it had to do with multi-core usage I believe, but that's all been fixed.  I have a mobile GTX 500 series card and can play this game at full settings with fluid gameplay.\n\nPros: I liked having the ability to have two weapons in the battle at once, so I wasn't stuck with a single weapon the entire time as some battles can last up to 45-60 minutes.  There's also plenty of more NPC's on screen.  I used to think killing 1000 units was a big deal but the other day I finished a battle with more than 3000 units dead and didn't think it took too long.\n\nI also enjoyed the inclusion of ranged weapons as an ACTUAL weapon rather than just a side-weapon all characters received.  The aiming in DW3 will not be missed.  The ghost horses that you can summon out of nowhere is kind of odd as well but I'd rather have a ghost horse than run my ♥♥♥ around the entire map for 8 minutes.  While online multiplayer is not included, local co-op is! So grab a second controller and invite someone over to play with you.  And have you tried Huang Gai's new weapon?  It's a god damn boat.  Water pops out of nowhere and he slides on his boat in the middle of a battlefield.  Some of the weapons even float now, which I wasn't used to, but there's always been magic weaponry so why not.\n\nCons: The most annoying thing for me was mapping the controls to my controller because the default settings were kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for me.  I made the button scheme almost exactly the same as DW3 minus/plus some features, and that can be achieved in just a few minutes.   I also miss the quick cut-scenes for introducing characters, and for when they die.  And I feel like some of the custscenes in-between battles are drawn out too much, as if they say a lot but have nothing to say.  Otherwise this is just a more polished DW with more characters, more weapons, and more ways to play.\n\nThings that need to happen:  GIVE ME DW8 EMPIRES","July 22, 2014","true","14.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/recommended/278080/","DustyBronco","Dusty Bronco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/","378 products in account","This game is a gem. Let's get the bad parts out of the way first.\n\nAny problems this game has is related to it being a console port. It has last-gen graphics (PS3/Xbox360). It's made to be used with a keyboard, not a mouse. The FoV is stuck around 60 and CANNOT BE CHANGED. There are even logo movies that you have to sit through when you want to exit the game. It has "partial" controller support through a gamepad button assignment tab in the options menu. It doesn't actually list what buttons you put down (every Xbox controller button shows up as "B1, B2, etc."), so it can take some time to set that up properly. Even at that, when playing with a controller, there are instances where you're not allowed to pause the game, and one of the keybindings actually becomes "quit this instantly without a prompt and go back to the main menu." That's infuriating. It runs well - I've never dipped below 60 FPS, so they did great on that front.\n\nNow, onto the game itself. Dynasty Warriors 4 is a game I must have sunk hundreds upon hundreds of hours into when I was ten years old. I tried one or two Dynasty Warriors sequels since, but they both felt like a departure. But, THIS GAME. THIS GAME RIGHT HERE is the spiritual successor to the Dynasty Warriors game that I loved. A few things I really miss (character creation is gone, RIP) and a few new things that I really love (ambition mode is an amazing addition to the series). All of the characters are unlocked from the start, which can be a little overwhelming to begin with. However, all of your old favorites are here, and they even have a fresh coat of paint - there's a new combo system in place where you can unleash moves unique to each character (it seems - they have a HUGE roster, so I wouldn't be surprised if they copy pasta'd a few of them). It's great to see how much they've fleshed out each character.\n\nAmbition mode has you building up your own campsite. It's kind of a campsite. You want the emperor to come visit you so that you can protect him (...?), so you go on battles to raise your fame, gather materials for building up your amenities, and recruiting more officers to your cause. It's the standard Dynasty Warriors fare that hasn't really changed much over ten years  - go charge at those red blips on horseback, break boxes / vases, defeat enemy officers, etc. What's new to me is that you sometimes need to kill a gatekeeper to progress, who is slightly stronger than your average infantryman. That's pretty much every battle. They end by killing someone important. Most officers, when defeated, drop a weapon - the weapon system may be new to you, too. In DW4 you upgraded weapons through experience. Here, you find weapons in the wild or buy them from the blacksmith. A niche to the weapon system is that there's some sort of element rock-paper-scissors game going on. The element I stuck to is "heaven," and sometimes that gives me an advantage over an enemy officer, and sometimes a disadvantage (that I can turn around by paying attention). Oh, there's weapon switching, too - that's neat.\n\nI haven't played too much into the story because I am in love with ambition mode, but if what I see here is any indication, the story mode will be just as great.\n\nThis game is really a gem. If you grew up playing the series, you'll feel right at home. Be sure to hop in practice first, as they do a great job of explaining the new battle systems they have in place (and the ones you may have forgotten).","July 19, 2014","true","45.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also suffers from pop in from time to time, but seeing as though this game is essentially fighting a horde of enemies, this is very minor, and horse controls are semi-abysmal (Turning when you get on is atrocius, "want to jump with the horse? Nah, dismount instead.") because the controls are switched.\n\nAll in all, the game is great, not perfect.\n\nSolid 9/10.\n\nEDIT: I have found that the controller problem is related to the configuration of the ps3 controller with DS3, the 360 controller support is the way it is intended to be.","July 20, 2014","true","50.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sofaking/recommended/278080/","sofaking","Sofa King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sofaking/","326 products in account","One of the better DW installments in my opinion. The historical and hypothetical routes gives you pretty much every scenario ever imagined so far for the series. Ambition mode is pretty interesting and really adds to the replay value. 5th and 6th weapons are for the most part a challenge to get so collectors have plenty to look forward to. I'm just really irked that they didn't include the original Japanese audio for this one. I've had it in previous DW games on consoles but for some reason they just decided not to include it.\n\nI would definitely recommend this title to any DW fan. To those who are new to the series: It's a glorified hack'n'slash, set in the Three Kingdoms era of feudal China(following the story of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms). If that's the kind of game you enjoy, I also recommend this to you.\n\nBREAKDOWN:\n\nThe story is given in various formats. Cinematic cutscenes are used to tell some more dramatic moments, while the stories of the battles themselves are told during gameplay through dialogue. Exposition and time skip filler story is presented in visual novel format. The story itself is, of course, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. If you've played any other DW game before, you know what that means. If not, then honestly the DW games are probably the best way for you to experience that story.\n\nAudio is standard DW, which is both a pro and a con. A pro because it's very concise and action packed, from SFX to BG music, so the audio really adds to the impact of the game. A con because it literally has not changed since like, PS2 days. The audio is more high definition, sure, but those death screams are the same death screams I heard as a child, slaughtering thousands of hapless Chinese peasants.\n\nGameplay is standard of a DW game. No weird gimmicks in this one like they've experimented with before, just pure and simple attacking, blocking, parrying. However, with the game's cast of 50+ playable characters, each with their own unique weapon, the gameplay can remain fresh for quite some time if you change up who you are playing or what weapons you are using.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention the one new thing they did add this installment, which is the Weapon Attunement system. Basically it's a rock/paper/scissors(or in this case Heaven/Earth/Man) system where certain attuned weapons do more damage to and allow for storm rushes against enemy officers using an attunement that is weak to yours. You are allowed two weapons and the game(and I) recomment using two different attunements in order to prevent enemy officers from having an attunement advantage.\n\nGraphics are... console port quality. To be fair, I doubt the studio ever put a lot of attention into the peons in the first place, but they look like clay soldiers when they do close ups of their faces. The officers themselves are much more defined, and they actually look good. It's also not very optimized to run in 1080p(which is an option on the PC version). I have a pretty beefy rig but I still notice huge frame drops when I first load a mission for seemingly no reason. It smooths out quickly though and will stay running smooth until the next time I launch the game.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'm leaning on a 7.5/10 for this one. Really is a lot of fun, but I think it's a very niche game.\n\nPS:\nAbout the multiplayer thing: It's been my experience that DW has never had online co-op. It's always been local co-op, so not sure what to say about that. I'm not sure if they will ever do online co-op for a Musou game so don't expect it to be a thing for this one.","July 29, 2014","true","127.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did not like 7, and my hopes weren't very high for this game, but let me tell you...awesome!!!\n\nPros:\nBrought back correct weapons - I remember in 7 that Xiahou Dun had a two handed mace, where as every other one he had a scimitar. He has the scimitar again! And other fixes like that.\nLong Campaign mode - you play by faction, not by character, which I like because you get to try out different characters and the story is much longer and it doesn't get as repetitive. Each level gives you 2-4 characters to pick from.\nWeapon Customization - while it may be a little cheap, every character has 2 weapons that they can switch between in battle. Some weapons are more compatible with the warrior than others (rated 1-4 stars). So even if you find a weapon that you really like, it doesn't make sense for ALL of your characters to use that weapon. And every warrior has a specialty weapon that they are supposed to use, but you can change it.\n\nCons:\nGraphics - there is nothing really special about the graphics, and I see some graphical flaws here and there (lines across the face, etc.) but it doesn't stop me from playing.\nPlot holes - I remember fighting Zhang He in one battle and the next level he was on my side. What happened? Why is he my friend now?\nOther usual bugs - I killed Diao Chan. Lu Bu got angry. The English message said "Diao Chan is enraged at Lu Bu's death" (something along those lines)\nControls - the default controls for the Xbox Controller are my biggest problem. I had to remap them completely because none of it made any sense. And I HATE that the musou button and OK button are the same mapping, because I use B for musou and OK should be A, so now whenever I want to confirm something it's B, and cancel is A...\n\nOverall -\nI can get used to the controls, though they are annoying. Everything else is not a dealbreaker to me. I've already put 8 hours into the Wei campaign and I love it.","July 4, 2014","true","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, this is probably my favourite of the series, dethroning previous favourite #5. I already had the original Dynasty Warriors for the X-Box 360, but I picked up the Steam version to get the Xtreme Legends content, which otherwise was only released on PS3/4.\nAnyway, this is the sort of game where you're either a fan, or you're not. If you like massive battlefields where you can slaughter hundreds (or in some stages, thousands) of lesser enemies, you've probably played Dynasty Warriors before and have a feel for what the game is like.\nAs far as the series is concerned, this game has loads of characters and a pretty complex storyline for all the major factions. Graphics are polished, and voices are decent - the appropriate balance of serious and stupidly over-the-top. Also, the Ambition Mode is about 296.8% better with the expansion than the standalone game.\nMy only serious gripe (and it *is* a pretty serious one) is that there are some serious problems with the in-game movies - many players, myself included, have experienced crashes whenever the game tries to play a movie (like when the game first loads!). This is resolved by disabling movies via the configuration menu, but then you're missing out on those badass opening and end-of-campaign movies that the series has always been known for.\nOverall, though, a very solid purchase for a Dynasty Warriors fan.","July 12, 2014","true","54.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't give you an exact number of hours I've spent on the games up to this point as that requires me to go back over 3 consoles worth of data, both saved and deleted, but it's at over 200 hours, if not 300.\n\nDynasty warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. The game that brings the franchise to PC outside of the online arena of DW:O. If you like mindless hack and slash action, then yes, you will love this. However, the developer himself has stated that this game has been made to hurt that mind set, rewarding tactical play and supporting your allies. If you know anything about Koei's Warriors series of games, you know this game.\n\nCharacter choice has never been greater, with the establish stories with the Kingdoms of Wu, Wei and Shu, fighting over China, 7 Brought in the tale of the historical victor, Jin, led by the Sima, and this title brings the Ahistorical tale of Lu Bu, stated as the protagonist of this game. Character count has increased to 87, going up from 82 in the normal edition.\n\nWhilst every character has a unique move set, this is only because they all have a unique weapon they are associated with. Every character can use every weapon in game, with a varied degree of skill. This is not a bad thing, it allows players who are trying to get used to a move set a safety net if they find that they can't get used to it. However, this brings in the downside of this. Whilst I'm all for unique looking weapons, a few of them are too.....fantasy based for the era this game is set in. I'm all for magic being used seeing as we have this being a major thing in the game, I don't see why they should have equipment that's associated with modern day equipment (don't believe me? check the Siege Spear)\n\nThe main story of the game has been changed from how it normally works. Dynasty warriors 4 brought in kingdom play, a style that hasn't been repeated nor explored since. this game gives you a selection of characters to use per battle and you have to pick one of them. They tend to vary, and the characters you pick are all the ones that have a major event occur involving them, along with all having a varied move set. You will never have a battle where all the available characters have a move set that is related to another style. You will also find that each character has their own role in the battle to come, allowing you to follow that path for them and watch the events unfold.\n\nNot only that, but the game also has, what it deems, a hypothetical route that you can take. Should you fulfil certain requirements, the next battle, or even events of the current battle, may change, allowing you more options later on. Like Aid in a later battle or the opportunity to turn back the tide. Each kingdom has two endings to it's normal route, the historical and the Hypothetical. What the Xtreme edition of the game brings in it is another third tale, one regarding Lu Bu and his story. These have their own battles and their own themes.\n\nAmbition mode is a sort of endless battle type game mode. you fight several battles in order to expand your home base with supplies, manpower or just to become famous.  Whilst the game doesn't go much into it in the base version, simply ending after you have built a palace, the Xtreme edition carries on, making it so that you attempt to unite China for the Han through fighting alongside your allies and making friends with them. Challenge mode returns, and the bodyguard system returns, allowing you to bring three allies into battle.\n\nThe game looks amazing considering it's roots on consoles, and it is good to see that it makes it's run on PC. if you do buy this game, I recommend you play it with a controller. I'm not saying that the game is impossible to play with a keyboard, but you will find it a lot more comfortable to be able to sit back with a controller and relax.\n\nThe story of the game is there, however, it is limited. Let's face it, your there for the game, not the story. However, there is enough development to give each character a personality and be more then just a character, but don't rely on it to carry you through. It's enough to give each battle context and to cover a few major events.\n\nIf you like games that just let you sit back and hack your way through enemy soldiers, you will like this game. If you like to be able to do that with a slight tinge of tactics to it, then you'll enjoy it. However, don't buy this game if you are expecting a tactical hack and slash title. what Strategy there is is limited to who you should take down and where you take the fight.","July 12, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That said, this is probably my favourite of the series, dethroning previous favourite #5. I already had the original Dynasty Warriors for the X-Box 360, but I picked up the Steam version to get the Xtreme Legends content, which otherwise was only released on PS3/4.\nAnyway, this is the sort of game where you're either a fan, or you're not. If you like massive battlefields where you can slaughter hundreds (or in some stages, thousands) of lesser enemies, you've probably played Dynasty Warriors before and have a feel for what the game is like.\nAs far as the series is concerned, this game has loads of characters and a pretty complex storyline for all the major factions. Graphics are polished, and voices are decent - the appropriate balance of serious and stupidly over-the-top. Also, the Ambition Mode is about 296.8% better with the expansion than the standalone game.\nMy only serious gripe (and it *is* a pretty serious one) is that there are some serious problems with the in-game movies - many players, myself included, have experienced crashes whenever the game tries to play a movie (like when the game first loads!). This is resolved by disabling movies via the configuration menu, but then you're missing out on those badass opening and end-of-campaign movies that the series has always been known for.\nOverall, though, a very solid purchase for a Dynasty Warriors fan.","July 12, 2014","true","54.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't give you an exact number of hours I've spent on the games up to this point as that requires me to go back over 3 consoles worth of data, both saved and deleted, but it's at over 200 hours, if not 300.\n\nDynasty warriors 8: Xtreme Legends. The game that brings the franchise to PC outside of the online arena of DW:O. If you like mindless hack and slash action, then yes, you will love this. However, the developer himself has stated that this game has been made to hurt that mind set, rewarding tactical play and supporting your allies. If you know anything about Koei's Warriors series of games, you know this game.\n\nCharacter choice has never been greater, with the establish stories with the Kingdoms of Wu, Wei and Shu, fighting over China, 7 Brought in the tale of the historical victor, Jin, led by the Sima, and this title brings the Ahistorical tale of Lu Bu, stated as the protagonist of this game. Character count has increased to 87, going up from 82 in the normal edition.\n\nWhilst every character has a unique move set, this is only because they all have a unique weapon they are associated with. Every character can use every weapon in game, with a varied degree of skill. This is not a bad thing, it allows players who are trying to get used to a move set a safety net if they find that they can't get used to it. However, this brings in the downside of this. Whilst I'm all for unique looking weapons, a few of them are too.....fantasy based for the era this game is set in. I'm all for magic being used seeing as we have this being a major thing in the game, I don't see why they should have equipment that's associated with modern day equipment (don't believe me? check the Siege Spear)\n\nThe main story of the game has been changed from how it normally works. Dynasty warriors 4 brought in kingdom play, a style that hasn't been repeated nor explored since. this game gives you a selection of characters to use per battle and you have to pick one of them. They tend to vary, and the characters you pick are all the ones that have a major event occur involving them, along with all having a varied move set. You will never have a battle where all the available characters have a move set that is related to another style. You will also find that each character has their own role in the battle to come, allowing you to follow that path for them and watch the events unfold.\n\nNot only that, but the game also has, what it deems, a hypothetical route that you can take. Should you fulfil certain requirements, the next battle, or even events of the current battle, may change, allowing you more options later on. Like Aid in a later battle or the opportunity to turn back the tide. Each kingdom has two endings to it's normal route, the historical and the Hypothetical. What the Xtreme edition of the game brings in it is another third tale, one regarding Lu Bu and his story. These have their own battles and their own themes.\n\nAmbition mode is a sort of endless battle type game mode. you fight several battles in order to expand your home base with supplies, manpower or just to become famous.  Whilst the game doesn't go much into it in the base version, simply ending after you have built a palace, the Xtreme edition carries on, making it so that you attempt to unite China for the Han through fighting alongside your allies and making friends with them. Challenge mode returns, and the bodyguard system returns, allowing you to bring three allies into battle.\n\nThe game looks amazing considering it's roots on consoles, and it is good to see that it makes it's run on PC. if you do buy this game, I recommend you play it with a controller. I'm not saying that the game is impossible to play with a keyboard, but you will find it a lot more comfortable to be able to sit back with a controller and relax.\n\nThe story of the game is there, however, it is limited. Let's face it, your there for the game, not the story. However, there is enough development to give each character a personality and be more then just a character, but don't rely on it to carry you through. It's enough to give each battle context and to cover a few major events.\n\nIf you like games that just let you sit back and hack your way through enemy soldiers, you will like this game. If you like to be able to do that with a slight tinge of tactics to it, then you'll enjoy it. However, don't buy this game if you are expecting a tactical hack and slash title. what Strategy there is is limited to who you should take down and where you take the fight.","July 12, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each playthrough of each faction gives a multitude of characters to pick from and can even change character throughout the storyline to stop the game from being repetative.\n\nDynasty Warriors 8 is one of my favourite games ever created and I'm glad it finally came to PC. 10/10.

The character's have amazing detail and their Mosou moves are brilliant/vibrant and addicting to pull off.\n- The sound quality is excellent.  Even the cheesy dialogue :)\n\nThe lack of "online co-op"  is no reason to downvote this game. It's still amazing without it.  And longtime fans, like myself, won't be bothered by this missing feature.\n\nIf you're on the fence, don't be.

However, I have two nagging gripes...\n\n1) No individual character storylines. Even though you'd often play the same level numerous times, only starting at different spots, it was still nice to follow a character you enjoyed and help orchestrate who they would become in DW5. Sun Ce is one of my favorite characters, and i was a little dissapointed when i only got to play him for 3 or so missions.\n2) Character name pronunciation. Now, i don't know if this is just my mind forgetting, or if the name's changed at some point, but i remember Sun Ce being pronounced Soon-say, and Cao Cao being cow-cow.

Since then, I have been a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors (as well as the Three Kingdoms story in general), and have fond memories of he and I playing DW4 latenight during summer vacation - literally every day until 3am (and a morning break in which he would go home, shower and return 4 hours later for more Dynasty Warriors. The joys of a carefree teenager).\n\nI stuck with the series all the way, though burned out on it with DW5 and was disappointed with DW6. I'm still a huge fan though, and I wasn't disappointed with DW7, which renewed my interest in the series. Sadly, shortly after its release, my console bit the dust. Of course, in the end, this was a good thing as it was the driving force to my wife buying me my first ever gaming PC. Alas, no DW7 (outside of jacking a glitchy and entirely foreign JP copy), and I figured my Dynasty Warriors fanaticism would be stuck in the past as memories of the good ol' days.\n\nThankfully, Koei decided to release DW8 and its XL expansion to Steam as the "Complete Edition," despite actually lacking a number of DLC packs available on the console version (though I've heard DLCs are on the way). And now that its been released, gamers are crying "foul!" at every turn for various reasons. So with all that in mind, and a bit of knowledge as to my background with playing DW games, let's get to it.\n\nFirstly and flatly, do I recommend this game? Absolutely, yes. The game plays like any other Dynasty Warriors game - pick a guy (or gal), insert person into a battlefield and go to town on the enemy. It's repetitive button mashing at its finest. The series has received the alternate title of "Chinese Genocide Simulator," and this game lives up to that moniker. The first story battle, I used my favorite Wu character, Shangxiang, and plowed through 1600+ people before the map was done (on normal difficulty). It was possible to get 1000 kills in DW3 thanks to the never-ending populating gates, which required the death of the gatekeeper before they stopped spawning enemies, but DW4 toned it down and 1000 kills generally required a higher leveled player and a lot of goofing around. As I said, DW5 burned me out - it wasn't very memorable for me, as with 6, so I don't recall how easy it was to hear your character proclaim themselves a true warrior of the three kingdoms. But for me to get 1000+ kills on the very first level with an unleveled-up Shangxiang was a sign of good fortune regarding this game.\n\nYour character can use any weapon in-game, but excels with certain ones, and of course is most proficient with their own personal weapon. You can have multiple musous stored up, and so on and so forth. Basically, the gameplay does add on to what the later renditions gave to the series, so its not like you might as well be playing a graphically improved version of DW2 or 3.\n\nSpeaking of graphics, this is another spot where many gamers are angry. The pictures provided in the DW8 store page are apparently screencaps from the PS4 version of this game, but the in-game graphics are PS3 quality, or perhaps a slight step above.  Certainly it appears Koei is guilty of fibbing, but honestly I just can't get angry - graphics don't mean a whole lot to me, and although it would be nice if they looked better, I can still go back and play DW3 right this moment and not have an issue with its block hands and hard-edged polygons. In other words, unless you absolutely NEED the very best you can possibly get, the graphics in this game look fine.\n\nSound-wise, I haven't heard anything terrible, which is both a good and bad thing. The music in the game offers a variety of songs from previous games, including the more memorable ones from DW3 and 4. This is always a welcomed addition. Unfortunately, I haven't heard any outstandingly bad dubbing. One of the things that makes DW3 such a great experience, then and now, is its terrible voice acting. I won't list them here, but a quick search in YouTube can help you find cutscenes with some of the most hideously read dialogue ever produced. I'm one of those guys who likes it that way, and I've never had an issue with the English dialogue in any of the games. Sadly for me, the voice acting has improved considerably over each rendition of this game, and although some characters in DW8 do not have a well-fitting voice (compared to previous incarnations), it's not bad enough to be memorable like "You flaming idiots" or "Yuan Shu, you have deceived me!"\n\nAnother gripe from the community is the controller support, or lack thereof. I've heard everything from the game not recognizing 360 controllers to default inputs totally dismantling typical controller layout. I can only report on what I've experienced, and that is nothing. I plugged my 360 gamepad into my USB port and started the game. It functions perfectly, with every button mapped out as how it would be on a console. The only thing is that, the buttons themselves don't appear in the game, meaning if you want to proceed through a menu, it won't show you the correct gamepad button, or ANY gamepad button for that matter. Coming from someone who plays a lot of low budget free junk or MUGEN, I'm used to this, and I would expect any gamer familiar with gamepad games in general to recognize quickly which buttons proceed and return in the menu screens, and retain that info for future playtimes.\n\nGamers are also miffed that there isn't an online co-op mode. If this was a feature you desperately need to enjoy this game, it may be a killer for you. For me, I didn't really have much of a fun experience with the online co-op in DW7 (nothing bad on the game's behalf - I just found myself playing with people who had no interest in coordinating with another person), and so I don't really care for online co-op. If they eventually include it, I'm sure I'll play it regardless, but I'm far more interested in whats available in-game presently.\n\nLastly, there were a lot of issues with freezing, black screens, infinite loads, CTDs, etc.,. Koei has thankfully shown they didn't just dump this out on the PC and walk away - there have been (to the best of my knowledge) two updates now that have patched issues in the game. Although some people are still having problems, I think a vast majority have cleared up and can now play the game.\n\nHaving said all this, and if you read all this (congrats), you'll no doubt find me to be a fairly easily pleased gamer when it comes to Dynasty Warriors. And I don't deny that. The game is exactly what I want - big battlefields, lots of kills (or KOs), lots of things to find, level up, etc.,. For others, there are just too many problems to justify purchasing. To each their own. But if you find yourself in agreement with my standpoint on things like graphics and lack of online co-op, I would seriously consider buying this game. It's mindless entertainment, repetitive and the same story and battles that've been told (usually incorrectly) since DW2. But it's my guilty pleasure, and it may very possibly be yours, too.","June 22, 2014","true","56.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No discernable DLC, PS3 graphics and a lot of people are complaining about bugs.\n\nHOWEVER, this is a Dynasty Warriors Game. There have been 7 games of the main incarnation, Expansion packs aside. If you intend to buy this game, get used to the fact that it's not going to be a different style of Gameplay.\n\nSeriously, if I see another complaint saying "It's just the same as the last game" I might have to cut a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nYes, the style of Gameplay hasn't changed, and I doubt it ever will. This game is so popular in Asia, its a wonder they send the game over to us.\n\nDynasty Warriors 8 Xtreme Legends: Complete Edition is being supported by Koei, and, even as a long-term fan, that surprised me. The game has changed so much since the earlier incarnations, for those with the ability to get over a simple and repetetive concept of Gameplay.\n\nThe new roster of Characters contains some real gems, Fa Zheng and Yu Jin spring to mind. The features are brand new and improved from seven, and the entire package for £39.99 isn't something I believe as too steep. The new characters and their weapons make up for the lack of DLC, in my opinion, as the weapons are usually vastly overpowered, like they were for Dynasty Warriors Seven. The New Hypothetical stages that have been added to the stories, as well as Lu Bu's owe story is a great innovation, though sadly the interactions between certain characters who should have more to do with each other is a litttle flat.\n\nAll in all, I would say, buy the game, especially if you're a long-term fan like me. It's a nice little bit of inaccurate history, but the aspect of what really happened some 2000 years ago is still there, buried under the story-telling. The gameplay can get repetetive, but that's why there are 81 characters with 81 Weapons.\nSure, it's button bashing, but you have 81 different ways to cimmint Mass Genocide on Ancient China.\n\n10/10","June 4, 2014","true","131.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Max resolution 1080P-higher would have been nice for downsampling but it is fine\n\nSupports the two xbox controllers I have attached to PC without any issue however the in game button prompts do not update and remain to what the default keyboard bindings are - no big deal.\n\nCo-op works well split screen but there is no online play - this would have been brilliant.\n\nFor those with high end GPU's you are able to enable SGSSAA/additional anti aliasing via Nvidia control panel (sorry not familiar with AMD but probably possible also). SweetFX works well as by default the colours are a touch dull and dark but after some tweaking the graphics get a pass.\n\nThe game itself has a ridiculous amount of content - 1200 weapons to unlock, 80+ characters to play and level up. Lots of stages to play through. Simple arcade button mashing formula but the combo system does have a bit of depth and despite some lengthy battles the action remains fresh. I think I am 10hours in and have not scratched the surface, look forward to playing more. Will end up sinking 100hours into this at a guess.\n\nTaking it all into consideration I highly recommend this game and hope that they continue to port newer versions over to PC.","June 9, 2014","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Proving a relatively successful run on the consoles, Dynasty Warriors 8 relives the storyline of the Three Kingdoms and the playable modes of past Dynasty Warriors games - but this time, with a much larger cast of playable characters, new additional content, weapons and maps, and even new playable modes. The storyline proves interesting, exciting yet slightly repetitive, whilst the action of slaying thousands of warriors itself, is satisfying nonetheless. However, due to the port to Steam, graphical qualities and rendering are kind of poor, resulting in occasional characters who look like cardboard cutouts. For many computers, it is very possible that players will suffer slowdown, lag or even screen tearing as a result of the sheer enormous amount of people on the screen at times. The soundtrack/score is no doubt excellent, supporting the game by building the tension of war, and also as just ear-candy if necessary. As part of a personal favourite series, Dynasty Warriors 8 also doesn't disappoint in difficulty as the tradition of pursuing Lu Bu in any difficult higher than easy is still a living hell. 9/10","May 29, 2014","true","41.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When they say Complete Edition, I personally think it encompasses a lot of things - every single weapon is unique, great retelling of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, high replayability, intuitive game modes, more interactive battlegrounds.\n\nI could be biased. I mainly played each installment from Dynasty Warriors 2 to Dynasty Warriors 5 Empires. After that I lost interest due to only minor changes from 6 and 7, and the changes didn't really seem to improve much, if at all from my own perception. However this edition feels like a return to form for the franchise. It's the same Dynasty Warriors you know and love, but feels like it has great substance and weight to it as opposed to random bells and whistles that really don't improve anything.\n\nMainly got this one because now I only play on PC, and Dynasty Warriors is rarely ever released on this platform. As a port, it has worked just fine. If you have a console, you might be better with that version instead since it has non-wonky co-op. You can play co-op on PC, but only in person with someone next to you and they use the same keyboard as yours. Haven't tried hooking the pc up to a TV and using two controllers or one controller and keyboard yet.\n\nIf you're solely a PC gamer and have been missing the Dynasty Warriors you know and love, definitely get this game.","May 28, 2014","true","40.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Since the age of 5, I have been playing the first Dynasty Warriors and look where it had got to now. The years fly by so fast, suddenly everything is on it's latest feet, new games come out, and of course, graphics improved. But enough with th memories. Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends is an epic game for hack and slash game fans as you will be doing that for the next 50-70 hours of playing (If you do keep playing it). I myself at this point had got to 70 hours and I'm still not close to finishing the whole game! I have, though, completed Ambition Mode. Ambition Mode is a really challenging and entertaining mode (But some might get bored of it because of it's repetitiveness and at a point, you will be asked to collect the officers again, which means all the progress you made will be wiped out, just like that. At first, I couldn't believe it and just stopped playing. Was staring at my computer screen and went like WTF? Those officers of mine, which took me 5-10 hours, dissapeared just like that! Now I have to collect them again! Well, I went to the trouble of collecting them back in the end, and finally completed that mode. I'm finishin up on the campaigns now. I see from this game that KOEI has put all it's talent and has tried their best to make this the best Dynasty Warriors game that was ever made and they put their efforts to recreate the battles even more close to the true history, not just using a nation and a character and winning everthing, no. Now there are true deaths and battles which are relevant to the true story of the Han Dynasty. Since I was just a child, I learnt all my Han Dynasty history from playing the Dynasty Warrior series, and I really enjoyed that. The only thing missing from this Dynasty Warriors is some VS. I used to play Dynasty Warriors VS on Dynasty Warriors 4, but they should create VS for the next series of Dynasty Warriors as it is one of the best features I used to play with my friends. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10, since it has offered many features, but thrown away some important features as well. They have made many interesting characters, such as Lu Lingqi and Fa Zheng, but I say that they should be careful not to go overboard just because they want to add new characters. Lu Lingqi, as some of you may know, is not known and not historical. For me, it should be hypothetical. Diao Chan and Lu Lingqi should not be included in the story of historical and should only appear in hypothetical since there are no records about them (Sorry to the fans of Lu Lingqi, but it's true. I would prefer that it stuck to history and Lu Lingqi's just supposed to be in hypothetical). I woudl recommend this to generations fo Dynasty Warrior players, as this is really a step up of the game to the new generation.","May 25, 2014","true","79.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Oh lord the script is terrible and the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ your pants funny. That should NOT take away from the fact that the game is pure old school fun and a cry back to games like golden axe and double dragon, which we all would assume if any modern game tried the exact gameplay as these 'classics' they would be laughed away even with PC melting graphics.\n\nGameplay is simple enough for any 10 thumbed monkey to play it and this is where you get the button mashing stigma but to me so many great games are 'easy to learn but hard to master'. The list stretches to the moon and back: Sonic, chess, checkers, most nintendo games, tekken, street fighter. These are all games with simple rules/mechnics but the potential of the experience is actually much greater than first expected.\nDW8 has all the old school stuff you would want and adds very customisable weapon and skill system which runs seperate of character levels. Graphics are a big improvement as well as the animation which you will see by the sheer volume of  moving parts on screen.\nI also like the fact your character can have two weapons of your choice of which there is an insane number to choose from ranging from the dull to the 'no feckin way that works'.\n\n\nIts not trying to be serious, its not trying to appeal to the masses, it is just a modern beat em up complete with all the cheesey nuances that added to the fun of them.\n\nDL:DR\nBuy it if you want your nostalgia bone tickled by a funny eager to please lab puppy.\nIgnore if you expect a modern 'sophisticated' experience","May 24, 2014","true","61.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My biggest concern with a Dynasty Warriors game is how does it play, and, as long as you are using a controller, it plays amazing! Maxed out settings on a 5 year old machine and it plays like a dream. No slowdown, no performance issues, none of that. Without a controller, however, this is garbage. Some of the worst KB/M bindings ever, and I shouldn't even mention the mouse because it isn't used AT ALL. I would LOVE to have camera/attack be the mouse and the wasd for moving, but no, so controller it is. Doesn't have native support for Xbox controllers though, strangely enough... you have to manually configure them.\n\nGraphically, this game isn't that impressive. HORRIBLE texture quality on many environment items and generic soldiers. During game play, not AS noticeable, but is glaringly obvious during one of the many many cut scenes. These textures would have looked bad on the N64. Named Generals look great, on the other hand. Several different costumes per character and there are tons to pick from, as usual.\n\nSound is.... god I want the Japanese voices. Koei just gives 0 ♥♥♥♥♥ about decent voice acting for the US release and it shows. Always contender for worst voice acting of the year, DW8 is right up there on that list. But that's bog standard for a Dynasty Warriors game, as is the incredibly hype, but ultimately forgettable guitar heavy cheesy rock music. Just ONCE I would love to see a DW game be more serious tonally, with traditional Chinese music and voice acting. Will probably never happen, but one can dream.\n\nLots of complaints, but ultimately, this is Dynasty Warriors. Odds are you don't need a review. You already know if you will like it or not. As a Dynasty Warriors game, this one is fantastic. As sadly only like the 4th one available on PC, I can not say how it compares to the console versions, tho I can just tell from screens that it is graphically inferior to the PS4 version, and lacks some of the content as well. It's still a great mindless slaughter simulation, and that's all I really expect out of a DW game and this delivers in spades.","June 21, 2014","true","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Basically it is just pure Hack'n'slash in 3rd person. The good part of it: A lot of different combos, weapons and characters. Compared to the sixth one you have way more characters to play and also another mode - the "Ambition Mode" - which is something different to the normal story, even though it still is just killing more enemies. As a fan of RPGs and Hack'n'slays and action games, this is my favourite combination of the genres. Local Co-op also makes a lot of fun.\n\nHaving spoken of good things, here are some bad ones:\nFirst of all the graphics are inconsistent: Playable Characters look so much better than other ones, even in the cutscenes. This may be just me, but i find it disturbing.\nSecondly, there is no online Co-op, Why?! There was one on the console!\nand the last point: it gets a little boring after you have the best weapons fused since even ultimate doesn't challenge you anymore.\n","June 20, 2014","true","60.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thankfully there are mods (ENB) to make it look similar to the PS4 version.\nOtherwise it's the best DW game so far. A lot more characters, very few clones, and the story is expanded with what-if scenarios and Other and Lu Bu story mode. Some characters feel rehashed from DW7 but the new musou attack and second ex attack keeps it fresh.\n\nOn the technical aspect there are alot wrong with the game.\n\nThe game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥, controls refuse to work and black screen crashes are common. A fix to this is to set compatibility to Windows 98. There are also more gamebreaking bugs like npcs that refuses to follow you and gates that stay forver closed. If KOEI doesn't keep on this we'll never see a PC port again.\n\nNo online multiplayer only split-screen which is ok. Online co-op rumored to be in a future update.\n\nTLDR: Port from PS3 so looks bland even with max settings. No online co-op only splitscreen.\nHowever best DW game to date and it was OK for a Japanese PC port.

However, the textures aren't very pretty but you only realize that whenever you are standing still doing nothing. But that doesn't happen often because there's usually too much going on for you to notice. Gameplay-wise the combat is exactly what you would expect out of a Dynasty Warriors games, hacking and slashing thousands of brainless foot soldiers with the occassional Lu Bu sighting is a staple of this franchise. The "Story Mode" has a lot of content and has added several new players to the old roster and "Challenge Mode" gives players who are into that sort of thing something to do. But the "Ambition Mode" is very boring and involves doing 4 mission types over and over again in an attempt to build up your base. Overall it's a good game for both fans and newcomers alike because it's just a lot of fun and worth the price in my opinion.","May 17, 2014","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Oh lord the script is terrible and the voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ your pants funny. That should NOT take away from the fact that the game is pure old school fun and a cry back to games like golden axe and double dragon, which we all would assume if any modern game tried the exact gameplay as these 'classics' they would be laughed away even with PC melting graphics.\n\nGameplay is simple enough for any 10 thumbed monkey to play it and this is where you get the button mashing stigma but to me so many great games are 'easy to learn but hard to master'. The list stretches to the moon and back: Sonic, chess, checkers, most nintendo games, tekken, street fighter. These are all games with simple rules/mechnics but the potential of the experience is actually much greater than first expected.\nDW8 has all the old school stuff you would want and adds very customisable weapon and skill system which runs seperate of character levels. Graphics are a big improvement as well as the animation which you will see by the sheer volume of  moving parts on screen.\nI also like the fact your character can have two weapons of your choice of which there is an insane number to choose from ranging from the dull to the 'no feckin way that works'.\n\n\nIts not trying to be serious, its not trying to appeal to the masses, it is just a modern beat em up complete with all the cheesey nuances that added to the fun of them.\n\nDL:DR\nBuy it if you want your nostalgia bone tickled by a funny eager to please lab puppy.\nIgnore if you expect a modern 'sophisticated' experience","May 24, 2014","true","61.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This one is much smoother, sharper and challanging. The character design is beautifully done and the cutscenes and events are nicely played out. It is packed with content, extras, pictures, weapons and stages.\n\nStory mode is somewhat split into 3. The normal story on what really happened. 'What if' stages, e.g Lu Bu joining Wei and hypothetical stages whcih changes the outcome of the story.\n\nRecommend you play this with an Xbox360 controller, I have had no problems so far but newcomers will take time to get used to the combat system and chaining it all together.\n\nThis is most defintaly a PS3 port with minor improvements but that doesnt make it terrible on what some people say. It is a shame it isn't the PS4 port but IMO I reckon KOEI wanted the PS4 version to be exclusive only considering it IS a PS4 launch title.\n\nI also recommend toy play this on hard and above to get a REAL man challange out of it.\n\nOnly down part is that their are no DLC outfits (so far) and I hope KOEI will release them soon.\n\nI was planning on giving this an 8 but when I found out about the alternative story route and the What If stages it puts more depth and wanting you to discover on what could have happened in their time.

Do not buy this game if you're magnetically attracted to Lu bu. It will end in many tears, varying between rage and despair.\n\nOnto a more serious note, it's a hack and slash that's been refined over 8 titles, apparently trying to catch up to its Japanese cousin, Final Fantasy for the title of "most sequels without becoming an EA style cash grab money milking franchise", looking at you, Mass Effect 4.\n\nCompared to the original DW8, the improvements are varied and 'worth it' in my eyes, particuarly the improved ambitions mode. Taking over all of China by creating a Warlord who uses...a harp to slay thousands of foes without batting an eyelid? Yes please.\n\nOh, and the music is, as always, extremely fitting, with the only 'complaint' being headaches affecting certain people (myself included) until you evolve and adapt to the rather unusual light and blur styles. Ever seen that episode of the Simpsons when they go to Japan, switch on the TV and have an epileptic fit? Yeah, it's a lesser version of that it seems.\n\nBut never fear, the game is worth any risk of slight cranial torture...just remember, do NOT pursue Lu bu. Well, not until you have one of the new 6 star weps, and can rampage through the newly added difficulty level. Then feel free to smack down the demon with your genocidal harp.","May 19, 2014","true","107.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There will be some controler configuration needed to set up the controler to the same controls as the PS3 version (not sure on the Xbox versions), though it will be using "Circle / B" as confirm and "Cross / A" as back rather then the other way around (Japanese standard).\n\nOverall I highly recommend the game, though it may be tricky getting into this game if you have not played the previous editions, though a good knowledge of the Three Kingdoms Era will prove usefull in understanding the game.","May 18, 2014","true","72.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot more characters, very few clones, and the story is expanded with what-if scenarios and Other and Lu Bu story mode. Some characters feel rehashed from DW7 but the new musou attack and second ex attack keeps it fresh.\n\nOn the technical aspect there are alot wrong with the game.\n\nThe game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥, controls refuse to work and black screen crashes are common. A fix to this is to set compatibility to Windows 98. There are also more gamebreaking bugs like npcs that refuses to follow you and gates that stay forver closed.

However, the textures aren't very pretty but you only realize that whenever you are standing still doing nothing. But that doesn't happen often because there's usually too much going on for you to notice. Gameplay-wise the combat is exactly what you would expect out of a Dynasty Warriors games, hacking and slashing thousands of brainless foot soldiers with the occassional Lu Bu sighting is a staple of this franchise. The "Story Mode" has a lot of content and has added several new players to the old roster and "Challenge Mode" gives players who are into that sort of thing something to do. But the "Ambition Mode" is very boring and involves doing 4 mission types over and over again in an attempt to build up your base. Overall it's a good game for both fans and newcomers alike because it's just a lot of fun and worth the price in my opinion.","May 17, 2014","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of the series and a huge fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms strategy games. Although I like making my own legacy in the world of the Three Kingdoms, sometimes it's just nice to kick back and relax with some of my favorite DW characters.\nZhou Yu is still my favorite character even though in some of the series he was a little feminine. But now I'm just glad they made his skillset badass in DW8!!! Sure it's a hack n' slash game and it can be repetitive...but THAT'S DYNASTY WARRIORS FOR YOU!!!\n\nThis game brings back great memories and I can't wait till they release the Empires Edition. Until then I will give this game 9.5/10! It's still the same story except in Xtreme, they add mystical stuff? I don't know but I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL THE TRUE DYNASTY WARRIORS FANS! GAME ON!","August 2, 2014","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once again many people online shared the same issue and yet there was no solution.\n\nThird issue was that even after I got the game to function with my second controller I had to rebind all the keys, navigating menus is far more complicated than it needs to be and after spending all the time I had setting it up correctly the ♥♥♥♥ing camera spun again.\n\nIt looks cool and everything and I'm sure you'd probably like it but only if you're one of the ones lucky enough to ♥♥♥♥ing play it.","January 2, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here we have a story routes based on the history of the three kingdoms more or less ,also story route WHAT IF plus bonus levels with proper story also based on what if except the Lu Bu's one which offers only 2 story routes. In the previous DW7 everything was told like a historical movie drama with deaths , sadness and happiness to me was epic. Anyway the good thing here is they decided to add more of a fan service which is awesome too, you can save your characters from death and change the history.\nYou don't need to play the previous games of the franchise  to understand the story mode. Each DW is different with similar story. The game can be very repeteitive because of its nature but that doesn't mean it's not fun. The graphics look better than ever and the weapon system from the previous  DW7 is improved. From what i know the PC version is a port of the PS3 version but with improved graphics and FPS. I havent played the PS4 version ,i wasn't so impressed from what i saw but still i can tell the PS4 is the best. If you dont own PS4 go for the PC version. It's still good enough but i wish KOEI ported the PS4 version.","June 24, 2014","true","157.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I honestly dont know why its not, seeing as it is possible on the console version.  I mean why even put it on pc if you can only local co-op.  whats the point?  I wouldnt recommend this game on pc because of this problem better to just get it on console for now.","April 20, 2015","false","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"
