FUNDUCATONAL, if you will. This elegant little puzzler is a lot like that science teacher you had in middle school (hi Mr. Hellmund! Why yes I've applied myself - I review video games in my free time!) who's enthusiasm for the scientific method is only eclipsed by his increasingly colorful ties. This is pretty, this is challenging, and you'll learn a thing or two. And don't be too intimidated; this game doesn't require you to know a lick of chemistry. If you're a fan of puzzlers and like factoids, check it out. I think it's a refreshing change of pace. It isn't BREAKING the mold, not really. This has been done many times before, but that isn't really all that BAD either.","July 21, 2014","true","1.1"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","3"

Even though you don't need any understanding of chemistry what so ever, if you enjoy puzzle games this game is most certainly for you.\n\nAt first glance, we may be reminded of the classic Atomix from the Amiga and C64 era. Apart from building molecules, this is an entirely different game that feels very unique and genuine. The staggering 144 levels will keep you busy for quite some time as it took me about 12 hours to beat. The puzzles themselves are easy enough for the average person to beat while not feeling silly doing so and difficult enough to challenge every mind. The basic premise is controlling one atom to move, bond, break, turn other atoms to complete a molecule - all within a set of boundary. The only letdown is atom variety as you'll only be seeing C, O, H, N and He which can and will get boring once you're close to completing the game.\n\nIt is worthy of mentioning that the game runs on Adobe Air and there have been reports coming from Linux users that it does not run on some occasions as Adobe has ceased linux support.\nAlthough the game would greatly benefit from Steam Workshop integration, the developer has stated he does not wish to implement such features in the foreseeable future - a shame as user created levels would keep the game and its community alive for longer.\n\nFor the fan of the puzzle genre, Sokobond will quench a thirst for simple 2D puzzlers. The average gamer should give it a try as its addictive nature may surprise you playing it more and more. If you have a personal vendetta against these types of games - stay clear of this one.","October 26, 2014","true","11.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

Each atom is a simplified representation of its real-world counterpart, focusing mostly on the number of bonds it can form.\n\nThe puzzles in this game range from simple to quite tricky, and it took me quite a few hours to complete the entire thing without cheating. [Don't cheat, it's very satisfying when you solve a puzzle]. The mechanics require you to do a lot of lateral and reverse thinking, which is quite good.\n\nSimple graphics and sound design, which works well for a puzzle game.

The core component of Sokobond is to combine elements together to create molecules. Sounds simple, right? As with any other puzzle game, the puzzles in Sokobond can become deceptively hard. Whilst the design is simple, it doesn't distract from the core gameplay.\n\nAfter you get to grips with the understanding of the molecule fusion, the game will throw a few curveballs at you, allowing you to split bonds or create double bonds, for example, furthering the possibilites of creation and puzzle solving. A small neat touch is that after you beat a level, you're given a fact about the molecule you just created.

The feedback sounds are diffused amazingly in the ambient background, building up a very calm scenario. For a non time-based puzzle, I didn't expected such good sound works. But like the molecules information, the sounds are very limited too.\n\nThe game progression is very simple, it follows the complexity of the molecules. The maps can be solved using single-agent search algorithm. But sokoban are known as NP-hard problems (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard). The puzzles can exponentially grow the branching factor of the moves which can be very challenging.\n\nSokoban can be a very entertaining way to keep your brain active but cannot be considered a game for the casual.\nInterested in more sokoban? please visit the official site: http://www.sokoban.jp","July 22, 2014","true","3.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The gameplay is a block-pushing puzzler at it's very core, however with increased bonding, your molecule grows larger and thus movements gets restricted. This unique twist adds fresh flavour to the genre and without much knowledge in chemistry, you'll soon find a lot of intriguing fun facts thrown towards you for completing level after level. The game does grow very challenging later on, but only after you grew accustomed to the basic mechanics. Progression is well done. I do have some minor gripes with the rather classical Helium levels and some levels that require larger molecules, nontheless, overall Sokobond is a very good game and should be picked up by fans of the genre.

I would also recommend not cheating or looking at the solutions for the puzzles, because while some are hard, there are always simple ways to do them.\n\nIf you want a more in depth review feel free to watch the review I did on YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOCycfVSB0M","January 31","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The puzzles consist of connecting all the atoms together  to form an element which is easy enough at first but the game soon brings in different mechanics which also make the puzzles much harder but it is still alot of fun. There seems to be alot of levels to play and as you complete each level you get to choose which puzzle you'd rather do next as it opens more than 1 up. You can of course go back and play the levels you left which will open up even more levels to do.\n\nSokobond is a beautifuly designed puzzle game with a fantastic soundtrack. I give the game an 8.5/10.\n\nVideo: Coming Soon","July 22, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You start with a board with a finite amount of space, and a single piece (an ion) that you can move.  Move it next to another ion and the two will bond.  Bind all the free ions together to make some compound and you're done.  The thing is you can neither rotate your molecule, nor unbind ions, and the board is designed such that you have to be careful how you bind the first ions or you won't be able to get your molecule to bind with the last ions (the molecule'll be too fat to maneuver).  Sounds simple, and the early puzzles are, but they get harder.\n\nSuccessfully create a molecule, and you get a little blurb about what that compound is, and how it's used.  Chemistry ftw!\n\nYour progress through the puzzles is tracked on a grid with one puzzle per grid block.  Solve a puzzle and the adjoining puzzles become available.  You start in a red area with red puzzles.  Finishing the puzzles leading to an arrow opens up a new, differently colored grid section.  Sometimes the different colors offer new mechanics, sometimes they just offer harder puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are as good as they need to be.  The sound is adequate.  The background music is the ambient, puzzle-game sort (think World of Goo).  It's unobtrusive enough not to bother you while you're trying to figure your moves, but keeps you from listening to nothing.\n\nYou don't need any chemistry knowledge for this, but you'll certainly pick some up.  The amount of free electrons an ion has is indicated by floating circles slowly orbiting it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/290260/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Sokobond is a puzzle game with a learning twist. You see not only are you trying to reunite, or combine the different objects in the level, but these objects are actual periodic elements, and you are putting them together to create different chemical compounds. All I have to say is who knew science could be so fun? You will be faced with level after level of differing elements and obstacles to overcome. If you successfully put all the elements together not only do you unlock additional levels, but you get to learn about the compound you just created.\n\nGraphically you are not going to see anything 3D, but in this puzzle game, the beauty of the simplicity of the graphics shows that this is definitely more about the elements. All the colors are varying subtle colors such as red, green, yellow, blue, etc. The levels are laid out in a grid base format where you will be trying to combine the elements by moving up, down, left, and right. The little added pieces to the game also come off as subtle, but are very recognizable after you use that functionality the first time. The pieces I'm talking about are the - and + which will take away bonds, or add bonds.\n\nThe music and sounds follow the same path as the art style. It is a soft sound that gets other sounds added in when you make a bond, or lose a bond.\n\nThe controls, as described before, are simply moving up, down, left, and right.\n\nSo here's a game that has no story, but has many rewards to be had. The rewards you gain are that you complete a level, open up other levels, and if you so choose you can learn something about the compound you just made. As the levels increase, the difficulty increases. There are many many levels to sink your teeth in, and for those parents out there you can not only educate your kids with this game, but you can secretly help out if you have a controller plugged in. The best part about this puzzle game is that the developers did not want to stop the chance for someone to learn about all the different compounds, so there is an option in the menu that allows you to unlock all the levels.\n\nI personally found this game a breath of fresh air, I did not have to worry about monster attacking, or having to watch certain statistics to make sure I could survive a level. I was able to play at my own pace, and hell I actually relearn some stuff that I had long forgotten about. So with that I have to give this game a 9.5 out of 10.","August 1, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start with a board with a finite amount of space, and a single piece (an ion) that you can move.  Move it next to another ion and the two will bond.  Bind all the free ions together to make some compound and you're done.  The thing is you can neither rotate your molecule, nor unbind ions, and the board is designed such that you have to be careful how you bind the first ions or you won't be able to get your molecule to bind with the last ions (the molecule'll be too fat to maneuver).  Sounds simple, and the early puzzles are, but they get harder.\n\nSuccessfully create a molecule, and you get a little blurb about what that compound is, and how it's used.  Chemistry ftw!\n\nYour progress through the puzzles is tracked on a grid with one puzzle per grid block.  Solve a puzzle and the adjoining puzzles become available.  You start in a red area with red puzzles.  Finishing the puzzles leading to an arrow opens up a new, differently colored grid section.  Sometimes the different colors offer new mechanics, sometimes they just offer harder puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are as good as they need to be.  The sound is adequate.  The background music is the ambient, puzzle-game sort (think World of Goo).  It's unobtrusive enough not to bother you while you're trying to figure your moves, but keeps you from listening to nothing.\n\nYou don't need any chemistry knowledge for this, but you'll certainly pick some up.  The amount of free electrons an ion has is indicated by floating circles slowly orbiting it.  This is the sort of thing that gets ingrained in a mind over time after moving nitride and oxide ions around for fun.\n\nThis game is cool for its elegant simplicity, and because chemistry, yay!","March 6, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fairly simple puzzle that tends to have overwhelmingly convoluted solutions. You control a person in a warehouse, and your job is to put all the boxes away into designated places. They are heavy, so you can only move them by pushing them around. You can't move through boxes, and you can't push a box if there's a wall or another box behind it. Simple rules, incredibly complex solutions.\n\nSokobond takes this premise and adds chemistry to the mix. You control an atom, and your goal is to get all the valence electrons in all the atoms to bond. For example, you might control a Hydrogen, and another Hydrogen and an Oxygen are somewhere. Your goal would therefore be to bond both Hydrogens to the Oxygen to make water. Or mayble you'll control a carbon amidst another carbon and six hydrogens to make ethane.\n\nJust like Sokoban, in Sokobond, you have a maximum of four options available to you at any time: move up, move down, move left, or move right. Just like Sokoban, if you try to move into an atom, you'll push it. Unlike Sokoban, if two atoms with free valence electrons become adjacent, they will bond, and bonded atoms will move as a group.\n\nLater, you'll be introduced to three more puzzle elements: debonders which remove a bond you made, rebonders which add another bond to a pair of atoms (allowing for molecules like ethene or acetic acid), and rotators, which let you rotate bonds.\n\nJust like Sokoban, Sokobond has a simple premise, but loads of depth, and all those extra-convoluted solutions.","September 3, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've never played sokoban (which this is based off of if it's not obvious to you), but it's a great spin on the concept, as instead of just being able to push things, you can pull atoms around when you bond with them (but bonding in the wrong pattern can make the puzzle unsolvable if you can't bypass an obstacle as that shape). You can infinitely undo any number of actions, so if you get into an unsolvable scenario you don't have to start over, just undo the last X steps until you can try something else.\n\nThe mechanics that let you rotate a bond, make more bonds and split bonds are well executed, and they often get in your way just as much as they help you complete the puzzle, which makes you have to figure out just the right set of moves to execute.\n\nI resorted to a guide for a couple puzzles, as I had an idea of what I needed to make happen but I didn't know how to get there.

It's a fairly simple puzzle that tends to have overwhelmingly convoluted solutions. You control a person in a warehouse, and your job is to put all the boxes away into designated places. They are heavy, so you can only move them by pushing them around. You can't move through boxes, and you can't push a box if there's a wall or another box behind it. Simple rules, incredibly complex solutions.\n\nSokobond takes this premise and adds chemistry to the mix. You control an atom, and your goal is to get all the valence electrons in all the atoms to bond. For example, you might control a Hydrogen, and another Hydrogen and an Oxygen are somewhere. Your goal would therefore be to bond both Hydrogens to the Oxygen to make water. Or mayble you'll control a carbon amidst another carbon and six hydrogens to make ethane.\n\nJust like Sokoban, in Sokobond, you have a maximum of four options available to you at any time: move up, move down, move left, or move right. Just like Sokoban, if you try to move into an atom, you'll push it. Unlike Sokoban, if two atoms with free valence electrons become adjacent, they will bond, and bonded atoms will move as a group.\n\nLater, you'll be introduced to three more puzzle elements: debonders which remove a bond you made, rebonders which add another bond to a pair of atoms (allowing for molecules like ethene or acetic acid), and rotators, which let you rotate bonds.\n\nJust like Sokoban, Sokobond has a simple premise, but loads of depth, and all those extra-convoluted solutions.","September 3, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an elegant little puzzle game in which science-y things occur involving atoms and electrons and molecules and such, but you don't really need to know anything about science in order to play it. It's really more of a logic game than a chemisty quiz, in which the player must manipulate various particles around a board in order to get them to form the proper... ah, hell, I have no idea what I'm talking about. The game is actually much simpler and more intuitive to play than it is to describe. Try watching this YouTube clip if you want to see how it works.\n\nLike the game description says, "Sokobond" is beautiful, original, and (they left this part out) HARD as hell in the later, more advanced levels. I've cleared about 75% of the puzzles, and don't hold out much hope that I'll ever figure out the other 25%. The fact that I still keep trying should tell you how enjoyable this little gem is. A great addition to a puzzle fan's library.","April 24, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of my 90 minutes or so with the game, the thing that most captured me was the application of (albiet basic) chemistry, and the clever ways they used these principles in sokoban. If that's someting that intrigues you, and you can handle the mind-♥♥♥♥ery of sokoban, this game is definately worth it on a sale.\n\nHOWEVER, in my time with Sokobond, I soon realized that I absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing hate sokoban puzzles, so the cute chemistry puzzles soon turned into 2D-spacial nightmares in my case. Beware, this is a sokoban game first and a chem puzzler second.\n\nCONCLUSION: Neutral review. Grab on a sale if you can handle complex sokoban.","March 3","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
