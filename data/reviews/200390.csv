Let me get this clear.\n\nIf you happen to know the game called "State of war" you just know how "Oil rush" would be played. Sort of...\n\nWhat is the difference between this and other RTS?\n\nYou don't build anything, you capture the pre-set buildings on the map. Enemy does the same. Buldings can be recaptured infinitely.\nEvery building (factory) you have under control produces specific unit (for that factory) once at the given time (ie. 1 scout unit every 10 seconds). More factories of the same type = higher maximum limit of specific unit + making of the unit on more places -> faster.\nFactories can be defended by turrets.\nTurrets are made from oil.\nYou get oil from oil wells which you have to capture just like factory. Oil well can be recaptured too and cannot be defended by turrets.\n\nSo far it looks almost like State of war. Here come the changes:\n\nYou can't control every single unit. You can control only groups of units - be it the same type of unit or multiple unit types. Group like this can be sent ONLY to platform (factory, oil well, ...) of yours/of your enemy/neutral one. You cannot move units around the map the way you are used to from "normal" RTS.\nIf sent on your platform: Units circle around and defend the platform. You prepare attack/invasion this way -> get more units on one place before launching attack.\nIf sent on enemy platform: Units try to kill enemy (units and turrets) and then start to recapture platform.\nIf sent on neutral: just like enemy (neutral units may be present that defend the platform)\n\nThere are some upgrades and special abilities and so on...\n\nThis is not ordinary RTS and many "players" don't get it. This game really reminds me of State od war which is probably totally forgotten these days. But it was just like this - something new.\n\nI still have to go through the whole game and try multiplayer (and get PWNED), but I would recommend this game. You have to be prepared for it though. It is fast-paced, challenging, doesn't give you any rest when you play it.\n\nAnd just like with other reviews from me - guess what? :-) It runs on Linux without any single problem.","June 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 72 of 77 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","72","77","0","0"

Unfortunately, the graphics and building defensive turrets around the bases is all the main screen is used for. Gameplay itself is pretty much restricted to moving units from one base to another via the mini-map. All you can do is select 25%, 50%, or 100% of a base's units or select individual kinds of units rather than individual units themselves, limiting your tactical options. No sending sentries or guards in the middle of a channel. Additionally, each base only constructs one kind of unit. If you lose the one base that makes the cheap anti-unit guys, you are SOL. And no constructing your own bases either, you're stuck with the ones already on the map.\nOne of the biggest irritations is that units don't engage enemy units en-route unless they sail right on top of the unit, and even then they don't chase them. So a massive enemy force can sail right by your front-line bases with only a couple shots exchanged. So much for a defensive line.\nThe story is amusing if only because of its ridiculousness. Definitely not worth playing it for.\nIn the end, the game is just a grind of sending units forward, watching them die, building more units, sending them forward, and then back to retake a base, then forward again. Much better RTSs out there. (Also, for those saying it includes TD elements, sure if a couple pot shots as the enemy drives by counts as defense...)","January 6, 2015","false","5.7"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

This constant cat-and-mouse goes on forever making missions very tedious.\n\nIt's not enough to defend the borders of your territory since the enemy can sail right past those and go straight for your undefended bases in the middle.\n\nTaking over enemy factories doesn't matter since the AI will cheat and spawn new units at the edge of the map.

For one thing it seems the only way to move units around is after they have reached their destination so if you send a unit on a long trip you will not have control of that unit until it is done moving. Secondly defensive lines mean nothing. If you try to set-up a defensive line the enemy AI will just roll right through it and start grabbing a territory behind your defensive line. Or better yet the enemies will just simply spawn at the very edge of the map way past your defensive lines and grab the last territory they would logically go after.

Attempt to capture all the stations from the enemy.  Certain stations generate resources, others may generate units, and you can build defenses on stations. That seems to be about the entirety of the gameplay.  It's a mash up of RTS and tower defense, leaning more towards tower defense.\n\nThe campaign is 15 missions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/200390/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR – Oil Rush is a graphics intensive version of what I would call a “virus game” similar to the Galcon series. Technically it’s real time strategy, but it’s all about moving your troops between map “nodes,” protecting your own while capturing your enemy’s when his troops are away. The game maker took a simple gameplay concept and prettied it up with modern graphics and a campaign story.   7.5/10\n\nThe game takes place after global warming has flooded the Earth and left humanity living on ships and small floating towns in the middle of the ocean. The most precious commodity is now oil, used not only for keeping the navy ships moving but for producing electricity and other necessities. You play a young navy commander named Kevin who is fresh out of school and ready to kick raider ♥♥♥ to protect your people (and grab oil supplies while you’re at it).\n\nGame play is simple in Oil Rush. You usually start with a factory that automatically builds units until a limit is reached. You can send these units to any other “node” such as another factory or oil derrick. If the node belongs to an enemy a fight breaks out and whoever has more units will win and gain/keep control of the node. You cannot send your units into the middle of nowhere, they can only be sent to another node. And since the max limit of units is pretty small, the action is pretty fast paced (it’s hard to build up a massive army and crush the enemy because they’ll probably have the same size army as you). The more factories you control, the higher your unit limit is, so if you strike fast and capture factories early you’ll probably win the round.\n\nThere are a number different types of factories since every factory can only build a single type of unit. Additionally, there’s a tower defense element to the game because your factories can be “upgraded” to have automated defense bunkers to back up whatever units are there to defend. If your factory is heavily defended with bunkers you can feel safer sending all your troops out to attack. Oil derricks function as nodes on the map (you can send troops to them) but they cannot be defended with bunkers and they only produce oil, which is kind of like mana for your special powers. The special powers aren’t especially awesome but they can turn the tide if you have almost enough units to conquer an enemy node.\n\nPros:\n+Simple gameplay where you’re really limited in what you can do. Don’t go in thinking it’s a real time strategy game like Starcraft, this game is all about capturing and holding map nodes.\n+The graphics are very good for an indie game. My video card fan was spun up the whole time.\n+Unlike the Galcon games that I’ve played, Oil rush has an actual story campaign. You follow Kevin’s progress through hardships and an increasing number of enemy factions.\n\nCons:\n-The simple gameplay may turn some people off. As you progress in the campaign you get access to a lot more units and more special powers, but the core gameplay remains the same.  Capture and hold as many factories as you can until you reach your unit max, then send them to attack an enemy node.\n-The gameplay may be simple (moving troops around), but the game itself can be extremely difficult. Even on easy mode, some of the campaign missions are against overwhelming numbers of enemies.\n\nOverall, if you like virus type games you should enjoy Oil Rush. It’s like playing Tic Tac Toe with high end graphics on a bigger board. A simple concept framed with modern technology.\n","August 17, 2015","true","17.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/200390/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Oil Rush at its heart is a simplified RTS similar to Z series, in that the resources are gathered automatically by "capturing" oil wells, and there are fixed "factories" for unit production that you or the enemy can capture. All that is done in a post-apocalyptic naval warfare backstory where the the nuclear war had melted the polar ice caps, flooding almost everything and the massive loss of technology lead to battles between factions that fight over oil derricks (that are always captured, rather than destroyed). With light, medium, heavy, and air units, each with different types of weapons good against certain types of targets, and ability to place up to 5 defense towers around each platform, this RTS aims to look different and simplify things to faster action, There's no research other than some extra perks you can activate in battle depending your kills thus far. And those are almost too tedius to deploy as they are usually speed bonuses like "speed up construction" or "make this unit go faster" and so on.\n\nGraphics are quite good though frame rate could be better.\n\nAll in all, Oil Rush is not a bad RTS, the background is interesting, and its simplified RTS has certain levels of charm to it, but but it's a bit of MOTS (more of the same).","August 11, 2013","false","2.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Despite this, the game manages to become quite obnoxiously difficult a few stages in -- the irritating factor being that numbers are nearly the only determinant of strength, and yet the AIs can produce units at exactly the same rate as you, and so the game quickly enters a deadlock state where you're throwing units to capture one node while the opponent simply recaptures the last one you captured, that you HAD to remove forces from in order to actually stand a chance of capturing this new one; so the game quickly devolves into an incredibly boring series of ineffective node trading.\n\nThen, the game is barely interactive at all. The combat, as I have said, has no micro whatsoever (so you just watch as two guys on jetskis shoot SMGs at each other while circling a building), and the "macro" involves simply capturing nodes and then building several highly ineffective turrets so you can pretend they're better defended. Most of the time you're just sitting there watching, to the point where I have to wonder whether it started development as an automated Unigine demo.\n\nThe world's okay, though there is nothing particularly interesting to draw one in. The characters are forgivably cheesy and forgettably uninteresting. Overall, it's pretty forgettable, though it looks about as good as endless water and some utilitarian oil platforms can look.\n\nOverall, it's not something I would recommend, even when compared only to other Linux games.","November 25, 2013","false","1.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/200390/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Oil Rush is a good example of a game that is solid and well-thought out, but not necessarily fun. Yes, it's an indie. No, I'm not going to hold back. Bad is bad. Period.\n\nThe game takes place on the sea, with the occasional land objects (such as large rock pillars) and of course the RTS-bound structures. With that in mind, you generally shouldn't expect any framerate drops. Although lengthy gameplay does, for some reason, give me a frame hiccup from time to time.\n\nIt doesn't look bad, but it doesn't really stand out either. There's little compelling about the troops you build and the structures you defend. At this point, it's easy to disregard them as grunts or cannonfodder, which they often end up to be anyway. On top of that, it's not always easy to discern which troops are yours, as they only have a few stripes on them with your team's color.\n\nThe story is a typical slogan to how we are treating our planet badly. Global warming has flooded everything, and the planet is one now a huge ball of water.\n\nWhile the voice actors  have been recorded with proper gear, they seem utterly incapable of getting me engaged in the story. But their handling is even worse. At times, the subtitles strafe away from what's actually being said (so far it's been details) and some parts have even been cut off at the end. Hasn't this been playtested before release?\n\nThe gameplay starts out well enough. Instead of having freedom over the 'map', you now are limited to moving your troops between buildings. Select a building, select what kinds of troops you want to move, and how many. (you can only pick between 100%, 50% and 25%. Literally)\n\nDepending on who owns the building, they'll either defend the building with their very lives or kill every hostile around before they take it over.\n\nAs for structures, you have a few, such as the  Oil Rigs. These provide you with a constant supply of oil that fuel the creation of defensive structures and the usage of skills.\n\nThen you have the military buildings, that constantly spew out their assigned troop until they are at their maximum. You generally start out with a building that spawns Jetski riders (with guns) and eventually move on to the more heavier stuff. Such as boats and heavy boats.\n\nThese military buildings, and these alone, also have five small building points around them, where you can building defensive structures. Generally, these are several types of turrets for several situations. You have your typical weaksauce one that can fire at anything, your Naval cannon that's stronger but only hits boats and is more appropriate for medium and heavy troops, and of course something that makes the air less safe.\n\nYes, there are planes. But their only real difference is that they're a little bit weaker than a boat and aren't bound to any natural barriers present. Meaning you can think of a few 'daring' tactics.\n\nThe game starts out nice, holding your hand a little bit in the first chapter. But as soon as you get into chapter 2, you'll start to feel like the game is dicking you over.\n\nThere is a fog of war, yet the enemy AI seems to perfectly know whenever one of your structures is upgrading all it's turrets at once. (upgrading takes a little bit of time and renders it useless for the duration) I've seen enemy troops run past my structures just to get to the 'one' that was vulnerable. There's no sensible reason how it should have quickly known that.\n\nNot only that, but you always get the feeling that the enemy starts out with an army, while you still have to wait until yours is built. If you aren't placing your first spawns just right, you'll eventually end up with a few lost buildings in minutes.\n\nThe game has potential, but the lack of anything to engage me in the story and the mediocre system doesn't compensate for the rageful moments you'll have to endure. And with every battle being presented almost immediatly after a victory, you never feel very rewarded either.\n\nPersonally, I'd avoid this game unless you have the patience of a Saint.","July 10, 2013","false","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Check out his video on youtube for an accurate description of what the game is like.\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Interesting mix of strategy and tower defense\n\nCons:\n- Cheesy, imbalanced, repetitive campaign\n- Not much variety, one race/set of units for everyone\n\nRating:\n2/5\n\nSo Oil Rush is a game created by a Russian company called Unigine Corp specifically to promote their engine coinsidentally named Unigine. Promote the engine it certainly does as it's a beautiful game to look at. As for the gameplay, Oil Rush is lacking.\n\nFirst some things I did like about the game. The graphics I already mentioned are great. The water effects and texture detail stand out as being very good for a smaller engine like this. The music is decently catchy but the quality is poor.\n\nProbably the best part of the game is the interesting mix of strategy and tower defense in an uncommon way. In Oil Rush you don't base build, you capture bases (zones, if you will) that spawn specific types of units or provide you with resources. You also don't control your units individually but rather as a group and send them off to attack and capture. Killing enemies also gets you command points you can use on upgrades. They're all very straightforward but they again add just a bit of variety to make the game more interesting. You use the resources you collect to surround your bases with towers preventing an easy capture when your forces are away or on some of the command point powers.\n\nAt first this all looked straightforward and a bit boring to me but after playing with the mechanics for a few hours against a hard AI, the system actually does provide for some very tense fights and strategy in which bases you fight harder over to get the units you want and how you split the forces you do have to cover several sides of the map. After awhile you're thankful you don't need to control individual units so you can focus on the map as a whole. This isn't an entirely new idea for a game, building up forces until you have superior numbers and capturing nodes I've seen before but Oil Rush does do it with just a little bit of spice to keep it interesting.\n\n-------------------------\n\nNow for some of the bad parts of the game. It's cheesy and it shows, especially in the terribly voice acted campaign. I couldn't actually test the multiplayer since of course the game is deader than dead by now so I was restricted to the campaign and AI skirmishes. The campaign follows a very linear story arc, which is fine for a strategy game if the missions were fun but in this case they're really not. Several of the missions are artificially difficult with enemy units 'magically' appearing out of the side of the map and attacking your weakest base the very second you leave it.\n\nOther missions mix up the game completely and turn it entirely into a tower defense game with you controlling platforms that only allow turrets to be built while you watch enemies slowly move along a set path through them. If these levels were good it'd be a welcome addition to mix up the pace but they're not. There's none of the tenseness of a tower defense, none of the mayhem or strategy, you can literally spam any tower you want and win these levels UNTIL the last wave or so when they throw super enemies at you which you aren't ready for since the last 19 waves had nothing like that. That's the kind of stuff that makes those levels more frustrating than fun. Overall it's not an entirely terrible campaign, just tedious and uninteresting enough that I certainly wouldn't want to play it more than once.\n\nAlso to note is there's only one race and set of units in the game with a select few only being accessable in the campaign. This makes sense in the context of the gameplay since bases can only spawn one type of unit for everyone but it doesn't help the variety of the game. It's not a terrible design overall it just offers little in replaybility and makes the game much simpler and shorter than it could be.\n\n-------------------------\n\nI was torn on recommending this game or not for awhile since it's really not terrible, just not memorable. My final verdict for Oil Rush is NOT recommended. There are much better games out there that do all this game does and more and does it better. For a similar but superior game check out Divinity: Dragon Commander.","April 25","false","14.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Factories auto-produce units, there's not really any resource gathering (aside from capturing oil rigs), and you can only command your units to attack specific points rather than move freely about the map. Once you get into the thick of it, however, it's a fairly challenging game. You have to decide which points to leave units at to defend and which ones to leave basically defenseless (aside from fortifications) so that you can capture more points. In the later missions this becomes a nightmare but I enjoy the challenge. I still haven't finished it (I'm about two missions away from the end) but I've enjoyed the ride thus far. The voice acting and script is slightly terrible as it is all translation (I still don't understand why game dev's don't just hand their script over to a native English speaker to proofread before they record the voice actors) but as it only occurs before and after missions in most cases it doesn't really take away from the game.","May 15, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a limited game, thats worse than Command and Conquers. You dont get to choose where to build anything, you simply click a building alraedy there and spam units, so there really is no "strategy" in this game.\n\nThen again, I dont know to much about the game seeing as how I cant get past Level 2 due to the fact that the game goes into window mode by itself, then forces  me to save and close it, where-by my save file is not there anymore.... Game is riddled with bugs, glitches, and a crappy setup all together.\n\nEdit: As of 1/11/2014 The game is still a spamtastic pile. However they did fix the bugs. However again, the game is still a pile of crap.\n\nThe balance as a whole from mission to mission is just absuredly terrible. You'll go from beating a mission no problem on Normal difficulty to being unable to beat a mission on Easy.\n\nThe AI "cheats" on a serious level as well from Chapters 2-2 and on, you'll find yourself going up against countless waves of enemies being spawned off the map, while the AI still has the same production if not more, than you.\n\nThis isn't light "reinforcements" either, this is full time lines of non stop waves. You'll barely get time to make an offensive yourself even on easy.\n\nTo add insult to injury on this, the AI cheats in other ways as well. It doesn't get Fog of War like the player, the second you call your boats away from a structure, the AI will launch simultanious attacks on that 1 structure. Causing you to call back ships to defend it, and crippling your attack again.\n\nThe Game-play over all is extremely stale as it's more or less ships on a rail. You spawn them from structures where as they just sit there, until you tell them to attack an enemy structure.. In which case they make their own path to the structure to attack it. Pretty much like having Boats on train rails.","February 13, 2012","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is what Oil Rush attempts to do.\n\nCombat consist of moving units from one node to another. You can not redirect your units to another node if they have already been issued an order. You can however, cancel an order, but they can not be issued another order until they return to the node they came from.\n\nAll unit production are automated, you can not tell any single structure to stop building. So, you are more or less forcefully fed units that does not go over your maximum unit supply limit.\n\nThe campaign story is composed of predictable plot, with bland characters, and filled with stereotypes.\n\nThe whole game just screams turn-based for me, rather than a real time strategy game. There aren't too many moments were you have to react to immediately, and very few micro-management of units or actions. You can't tell a weak unit to retreat, you can't tell a repair ship to prioritize repair, you're more less just hoping the AI will do its job. Most of the time I'm just positioning my units to just either ride the momentum of an assault, or just allotting the units between defense locations as I see the enemy units slowly crawl across the ocean.\n\nIf you do like this game, I would suggest playing Eufloria instead. The controls there is much more refined.","May 10, 2014","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We've GOT to have more OIL!\n-The Boss-Man.\n\nThis game takes what might be a neat premise for a book, and turns it into a mind-bogglingly simplistic throw your things at their things until you have more things than they do simulator RTS with a protagonist who seems to have been given a copy of 'Ten habits of highly succesful people' and eaten the book-glue. Mister I-can't-believe it's-not-margarine gets sent by General baldy-bald on a series of tactical missions to obtain the immensely-valuable unobtanium oil, at whatever the cost! Cue spunky damsel, lots of anti-imperialist political tripe, and you pretty much get the plot.\nThe gameplay is pretty dry. The usual RTS-staples are watered-down to the point where unit construction is automated based on the buildings you control, and your main interest is in snowballing up your starting choices by constantly flicking your giant death-ball at the enemy facilities. There are hotkeys, but when an amalogous death-ball is the most reliable way to go you rarely use them. There's only one resource of any value, and it's Oil. can you guess what it is? The tech tree is the most irrelevant of 5% bonuses to stats your 'throw a big ball of stuff where it hurts' strategy couldn't care less for. Add onto this the fact that your camera seems to be stuck to the bottom of a bloated pelican and the fact that one of your missions is to escort a ♥♥♥♥ing balloon, and you're looking at a pretty washed-up variant of an already-diluted genre that ultimately fails to pass muster float my boat. Water puns.\n\nWhich makes me wonder how its art (which gives us those snazzy screenshots) got the production value it did, considering that neither the level-design nor voice-acting nor marketing nor beta-testing are really worth half a salty biscuit damn. Someone must have really loved oil rigs, then thought 'let's make a game about that'.\n\nAlso, will someone please tell the ♥♥♥♥wit who drew up the achievements that the '@' symbol does not mean 'and'?","February 29","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The anticipation.... The excitement... The total disappointment.\n\nOk, seriously... On how many "Strategy" games do you have 0 control over your units? Sure, you can tell a location to send all, some or a particular type of unit to go somewhere, but that's where your control ends. You cannot develop tactics on which unit should attack what, you cannot tell a certain number of units within a group (going to or coming from somewhere for example) to go to a separate location (you have to either recall the units or wait unit they reach their destination). This lack of control, while it may seem not so important at first, is where this game fails imo. Most of the time, your units end up being shredded because they focused their attack on the wrong unit or structure (i.e. defences).\n\nOh, and the voice acting... Oh God, the voice acting... It's so monotonous, it sounds like a computer is doing it. No life, no feel, no reality... If they did hire people to do the voice acting, they either paid so little that the actors wanted to punish the devs by their poor performance, or they hired total amatuers for it. None of the voices sounded like they were in character: they were just reading off the script. Oh, and the script was either changed later on or the actors decided to go as they please because the subs (that appear automatically btw) are different than what they actually say (about 40 percent of the time).\n\nThe only good things I can say are that the soundtracks were not so bad actually, and the graphics are appealing...\n\nAll in all, not recommended.

The plot is predictable, the characters are mind-numbingly simple, and the campaign ended too soon, for me (13 hours). Even the cut-scenes themselves were hard to enjoy because it was either skipped because I accidentally clicked during it or it was out of sync for whatever reason. Also, multiplayer is dead so don’t even bother. But even with all of these bad elements, it didn’t stop the single-player experience from being insanely challenging and fun!\n\nStrategy was the name of the genre and it definitely filled my cup. The naval units make sense and the upgrades truly matter in each stage you traverse. And let’s not forget the graphics which are amazing by the way. You can watch everything any direction you want and if you are feeling edgy, you can watch your battles in a cinematic-follow mode, all in your glorious PC rig graphics!\n\nSummary:Don’t mind the plot and just ignore the voice acting. Focus on the game mechanics and you will enjoy every minute spent.\n\nWorth: I recommend to buy it during a sale.\n\nLast Thoughts: That voice acting though…","January 4, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
