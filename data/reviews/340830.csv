No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nRazenroth is a top-down shooter with some rogue-like and RPG elements. It really took some time for me to warm up to this game. It starts a bit slow, with a storytelling cutscene that's several minutes long setting up the who's, what's, and why's of the game. Long story short, you are looking for your grandpa in the Valley of Whispers, a nightmarish region where all sorts of evil resides. Regardless of what awaits you ahead, you press on in hopes of finding your missing grandfather.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAs said above, Razenroth is a top-down shooter, meaing your point of view is directly over your character, giving you a nice view of your surroundings. Each game starts in a cabin that houses some of the unlockable features that become available as you collect Dark Crystals. When you exit the cabin, you are free to explore the surrounding region whilst fighting monsters and collecting items. Monsters can and will attack you from off-screen, just outside of your view. This means that they will often get the jump on you, and you will need to become quite evasive to survive. Movement is done with the WASD keys, and attacking is done with the Left and Right mouse buttons. Left clicking is your standard attack, firing a short ranged burst of energy towards foes. Right click is a more powerful, longer range spell that requires mana to use. Mana is regenerated slowly over time. The Q and E keys are used to activate various potions and items you find in your journey.\n\nAs you defeat monsters, you gain experience points. Like typical RPGs, once you gain enough experience you will level up, earning you a stat point and a couple of skill points. Stats include extra Health, Mana, Critical Hit Chance, and even Bonus Critical Hit Damage. All of these stats are equally important, but it's up to you how you spend your points. Skills have varying costs between 1 and 3 points, with most of them costing 3 point. Skills range from gaining mana per hit or firing a counterattack shot when damaged.\n\nPerhaps the most frantic portions of this game are the boss battles. As you explore each location, you will eventually reach a portal on the ground with a skull symbol on it. Touching it tranports you to an enclosed area with a powerful boss. These encounters will test your skills and endurance, but mainly your patience. Each boss takes very small amounts of damage from even your most powerful attacks, making each encounter somewhat of a chore. Most also have alot of different attacks which require you to stay on the move and avoid certain patches of ground, as they have become home to poison gas, webs that slow you down, or even bombs that soon explode. Patience, persistence, and kiting are required to defeat pretty much every boss. When defeated, bosses will drop instant healing items, potions, gear, gold, and dark crystals...so they are well the challenge.\n\nWhat RPG experience would be complete without gear? As you defeat monsters and open treasure chests you will find various pieces of equipment to boost your performance. Initially you begin with 4 main equipment slots and 6 accessory slots. Monsters drop gear very rarely, and bosses usually drop at least 1 piece. Sometimes treasure chests will contain 1-2 pieces of equipment, and at times you can find equipment sitting atop special altars waiting to be picked up. When you pick up a new piece of armor it automatically replaces what you are currently wearing. If you don't like your new gear's stats you can always pick your old piece back up and continue onward. Enemies also drop small amounts of gold very rarely, which can be used to buy items from merchants who also appear rarely. Gold can also be exchanged at a certain rate to obtain Dark Crystals in your cabin, which is where you start each stage from.\n\nThere are 3 different difficulty modes, and at least 4 unlockable characters to play as. Unlocking them requires you clearing available difficulty modes or defeating a certain number of monsters. These xtra characters have different spells and abilities, and are worth trying out to see how they differ. Even the lowest difficulty setting is quite challenging, so if you are one of those players who likes to tackle the highest difficulty of a game first, you are in for a treat!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nRazenroth is a very dark, bland game. The visuals are all dark hues, mostly brown, grey, and black. Not very colorful at all. The only things that are really colorful are huge amounts of blood from enemies and the pieces of gear and other items you find, especially potions. Monsters stand out from the environment pretty well, and are a tad bit brighter than everything else, making them easier to spot amidst other objects and action. Bosses are quite a bit larger than other monsters, making them MUCH easier targets than your standard monster fodder...who are alot harder to hit. Weird how that actually works out! Defeated enemies tend to explode into large pools of blood that persist as long as you are that stage. This is helpful for navigating each area and remembering when you've already been, even though there is a map.\n\nOne thing that some RPGs seem to not include is how equipping new gear shows up on your character. Razenroth has this feature! I was quite pleased when I discovered this, as I like having a dynamic character sprite. Looking at the same, boring character model gets very old after awhile. Changing it with new equipped gear helps keep things a little fresh and new.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThere really isn't much going on here in the musical department. The most I ever heard was in the intro sequence. Instead, the majority of what you'll be hearing are your own attacks. This can get old VERY quickly. You can also hear monster attacks, but they are usually drowned out by your own. Killing enemies is satisfying though, as most of them make a nice death noise as their corpse explode upon defeat.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis game runs really well. 60 FPS in most cases, dipping down to maybe 40 or 45 at times. It loads fairly quickly, with minimal loading screens between stages and when starting a session. I didn't get any weird crashes, stuttering, or lag at any point.\n\nThe game only has mouse/keyboard support, so controller users will have to use programs such as Joy2Key or MotionJoy to play with a controller. Though honestly after playing a bit I realized that mouse and keyboard was the best way to play, as moving in this game would be a bit slow with an analog stick...and probably would not be handled correctly by the game itself.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nInteresting concept, decent gameplay, and frantic action (once you get a fair ways into the game) all come together to make Razenroth an enjoyable experience for those who can overlook it's shortcomings. Patience is definitely recommended, as it can get pretty difficult. But it you like difficult, this is one shooter/rogue-like/RPG you will enjoy.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/CRR2swHXJjQ\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/340830/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Razenroth is Enitvare’s second venture onto Steam following their popular debut, Stonerid, which was met with mixed reviews. The studio has put into effect the lessons that they learned from their first game and the result is more than a little surprising. Yet Razenroth remains a largely undiscovered gem by Steam gamers. This is a great pity as there is much to like about it. The game combines largely traditional top down shooting action RPG gameplay mechanics with roguelike elements to great effect. I found myself dying regularly and relatively quickly in my first few attempts. I was a little confused as to the best approach to take. However, once I finally began learning the nature of the game I found it to be a relatively quick study and one that is a joy to learn.\n\nThe opening several minutes long cutscene does a thorough job of establishing the storytelling of the game. You’re essentially searching for your grandpa in the Valley of Whispers  You start the game in your grandpa’s cabin and are free to explore the area and kill monsters who are ultra aggressive and hit harder than most early level game mobs do. You will not last long to get into a direct shootout with them so the first skill that you’ll need to pick up is that of quick movement and evasion. You can be attacked from mobs not on your screen meaning that you will have to become ultra alert to where attacks are coming from. Kill enough enemies and you’ll gain talent points. The culmination of each level includes a boss fight – each with its own set of mechanics. These boss fights can last several minutes giving you time to quickly learn their methods of attack and defense and then methodically taking them down. The boss fights were my favorite part of my time with the game as they genuinely feel like fair encounters that do not cheat but ones that are programmed well enough to be very challenging. The loot system is typical of most games within the genre. However, you’ll have to work for it as regular mobs seem to rarely, if ever, drop any loot. Boss mobs will drop at least one and there are chests and other special areas scattered throughout the levels that provide you an opportunity to find an upgrade.\n\nIn regards to the technical perspective of the game do not expect much. Both the graphics and the sound are rather bland experiences. Although the game is intended to be played in ‘dark’ mode I found the game more enjoyable aesthetically in light mode. Some may argue that this lowers the difficulty of the game but I found it to be a better experience this way. It’s definitely the type of game that I would recommend play while listening to a podcast. As I know that has become an increasingly popular thing to do I don’t necessarily argue that this is a weakness of the game but rather that the sound is just not memorable at all. Given that there is not much demand on the technical perspective the game runs extremely well. I was able to test this on a lower spec machine as well as my more modern gaming rig.\n\nRazenroth has its shortcomings.  It is far from the perfect game however the gameplay resonated with me to make it an enjoyable experience. I’ve long been a fan of both roguelikes and action RPG’s. The top down action suited the gameplay and the boss battles were varying enough that it is well worth continuing on throughout the game. All in all, a very solid experience.\n\nFor more reviews like this one and our daily giveaways please keep an eye on http://www.steamified.com/","January 8","true","8.1"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","1"

I have three or so hours from offline play.\n\nBeing a big fan of difficult, rogue-likes and randomly generated content, I can fully recommend this game. The gameplay, like most games similar to this, takes adapting. You most likely will die a lot, at least at first, but you learn from each playthrough.\n\nThe art is simple, yet great. It really fits the vibe of a grim indie-RPG game with rogue-like features.\n\nEach playthrough is entirely random generated. Enemies, weather, locations, layouts, all random.  It's quite well-done, I would say.\n\nUnlockable characters add to the replayability of the random generation. I've personally only used the first character, so I'm not able to say much on others.\n\nAll in all, I believe this game provides more than enough quality content, especially for such a low price.

There's a story to add a little extra to the gameplay which is direct and pretty fast-paced especially if you go head-first into a group of enemies.\n\nThe game will have you exploring different worlds, each with their specific monsters, there are boss fights which are engaging and always have you moving, and you can find lots, and I lean lots of items that you can equip on your character (the combinations seem endless). Speaking of characters, there are a few that you can unlock.\n\nI think Razenroth is a game that will help you unwind and not add to the pressure of a day.

This game I will be honest at the start is hella fun, you have lots of things to find, abilities, weapons, armor, you name it, the levels are reletively short, followed by a boss at the end of each level.\n\nBut I will say this, on normal difficulty (easiest) the game for me became so frustrating I had to stop playing. Now the game in and of itself was fine, but it was the final boss of the game (Ragenroth) that is where I had the problems. And this boss even on normal difficulty was hard as hell. I can't even fathom what this dude would be like on the harder difficulty levels of this game. The boss spawns these things on the ground which shoot green projectiles at you and if they hit you, the boss heals. Ok fine, I can live with that, but even on normal difficulty and after my 1st time fighting him and approx 2ish hrs later, I had to just give up, because I was so mad, I was shaking. I didn't even die, I was so powerful from all the upgrades, abilies, armor, ect that I had, it was impossible for me to die. But because of this mechanic the boss has, I just could not defeat it.\n\nI got too the boss a 2nd time, once again with pretty awesome stats and this time, I fought him for about 30min, before I decided, you know what? This is just stupid and I have had enough.\n\nThere is no set pattern on the boss stage, as too where he spawns the pads that shoot the green projectiles, you just have to run around endlessly trying to dodge these damn things and try to get hits on the boss, without those green projectiles hitting you.\n\nPeople on the discussion forums were pointing out how easy it was to defeat the boss, blah blah blah, but in the end nobody showed either screen shots or video proof of them beating said boss, which makes me wonder of the validity of it.\n\nPersonally for me, I would not recommend this game and I will keep the game and follow the updates and hope that the dev does something to remedy this situation, as to be very honest with you all and the dev, the entire game is great, there is no doubt, I know it sounds stupid to just have an issue with the final boss and the rest of the game be great and maybe others are beating it like they say they are in the discusson forums but without any proof of this, screen shots, ect, I have my doubts.\n\nPlease dev, lower the difficulty level of the boss on normal.\n\nI am not going to recommend this persnally, but by all means, play the game, it is fun, but I think it has some serious balance issues, especially with boss fights (mainly the final boss).\n\nCheers.","March 18","false","23.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","16","29","2","5"

There is 5 areas and 9 challenging bosses, as well as shops, chests,altars and NPC scattered randomly on the map. My only complaint is that there might not be enough variety into the weapons you use, it'll always feel like you are using the same spell, going straight forward, only the skin, damages, speed, rate of fire and range vary, as well as the amount of mana you recover when you hit an enemy, but do not expect any kind of fantasies, strange trajectories or big modifiers a la TBOI.\n\nStill, the price of the game is low and I think reflects perfectly the amount of game content.

Extremely generic. The speed you throw fireballs at enemies is a weird pace and is hard to get used to in a top down shooter. It is extremely awkward. My shots always miss because I have to worry about dancing around the enemies projectiles since theirs fire twice as fast as mine do. It takes a long time to build up stats and pick skill upgrades like a normal rpg, but unlike those games, it's a rogue game where if you die, everything is erased and you start over. The game is barely a 5/10 for one playthrough, let alone being forced to play it over and over again from scratch if you die. A really stupid choice by the developers to make this game like that. Imagine if in another top down action rpg that had a rpg system and levels that you play through, imagine if you died and everything you got to that point, including your skill point allocation and perks, was all erased on death. Imagine if all that Diablo 3 had was the hardcore mode. It would have been a flop.\n\n2/10. Incredibly generic, awkward firing rythm, and badly misplaced rogue element.

It is an action game with a dark atmosphere. It also has Rogue-like and RPG mechanics.

However it soon gets surprisingly fun.\n\nPretty similar mechanics to a lot of rouge-like bullet-hells just with... fewer bullets and a little less hectic and stressful gameplay but the large array of items makes it interesting. However whether or not you fail or succeed seems largely down to the items that spawn.\n\nFor instance the first play I got stomped by the first boss almost immediately as I was half dead and there were no health potions left on the map. Second time around I put more points into health and defence but still didn’t make it to the second boss.\n\nNext run I almost immediately found an item that massively increased the drop rates of other items and then quickly found a passive healing item and about a dozen other things. Then I found a magic golden apple that promised to make me very powerful (doesn’t sound remotely suspicious) and was evidently rare enough to warrant an achievement...\n\nAs such I could just put everything in crit chance and ignore every potion I came across. The result was a 30% crit chance, twice as much crit damage, half the mana cost on spells and virtually no chance of actually dying. So even the final boss fell pretty effortlessly to the epic wizard I’d somehow become.\n\nI incidentally love the fact that despite it having a backstory and voice over to tell said story it never makes any mention of why this guy and his grandfather are apparently both wizards. The assumption is that they gained magical powers upon being transported to this weird realm but they never seem especially surprised or perturbed by the fact that lightning is suddenly shooting from their hands.\n\nAfter the end boss there is some further voice over (which plays loudly even though I’d muted the game and as such is more scary than the boss itself) but this still didn’t really enlighten me any on their wizardly ways.\n\nIt was slightly disappointing that the game just abruptly ends after the final boss so I didn’t even get the chance to try the items it dropped. Would have been nice if it could go to an endless or arena mode that gets harder until you die. Will be interesting to play it on the harder modes with the other characters though and see how hard that boss actually is if I don’t have about 30 items equipped...","May 16","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/340830/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","I mostly got this game since it was on sale for 49¢, and looked decent. I was surprised by how much fun I had and am still having. It's sorta like the Binding of Isaac, where there are a bunch of randomly placed rooms with randomized stuff inside. The game takes place outside though, so the rooms have various props like trees, bushes, and other stuff to match the various environments.\n\nLike Isaac, you go through the random rooms, killing enemies, finding various items to boost your stats, then finally finding the boss, defeat it, and move to the next area. There are 5 areas, each with a different environment. the first one is a forest, while the second one is some sort of Volcanic Cavern. I won't spoils the rest.\n\nRazenroth IS different though. Instead of tears, your character is a Mage, and uses spells. First you have a Primary Spell, this does decent-ish damage, doesn't cost Mana, and actually restores mana on hit. Then you have your Mana Spell, which costs mana obviously, and does quite a bit more damage.\n\nYou have four button slots total, which are shown on the bottom of the screen. They are as follows:\n\nThe Primary Spell takes up the Left Mouse Button.\n\nThe Mana Spell takes up the Right Mouse Button.\n\nThe "E" Key takes up the Magic Book slot. Magic books do various things depending on the Book. Some boost stats like Primary/Mana Spell damage, range, crit chance, crit damage, and character speed/defense. Some do other things like summon tornadoes that damage enemies around you. There are a lot of Magic Books that do a wide variety of things I didn't list here, these are just to give you an idea of what they do.\n\nThe "Q" Key takes up the Potion slot. Potions do about what you expect: Outright heal or restore mana. Increase manage regeneration. Temporarily give health regeneration, increase crit chance, increase spell range, etc.\n\nThere are various characters as well. You start with one, the main character Charles, but you can unlock more. All characters start with a specific Primary and Mana Spell. Like Charles starts with the Magic Bolt Primary and Mana Orb.... Mana Spell. Potions and Magic Books need to be found. Characters all have 1 Passive trait as well, such as Charles having the trait that when you successfully hit an enemy with a Primary Spell, you have a chance of immediately casting a second time as well in quick succession.\n\nYou gain experience as you level, and when you level up you get a Stat Point to spend on Stats such as Health, Mana, Mana Regen, Mana Restored on Hit, Crit Chance, Crit Damage, Armor, and Speed. You also get 1 Talent Point per level, and when you have 3 Talent Points, you can buy a Passive Talent. Talents do things such as giving you a chance to cast 3 Projectiles instead of 1 when you cast your Primary Spell, Increase Damage while increasing Damage received, making you Mana Spell sometimes explode on contact which shoots some projectiles in various directions, and so forth. Honestly, I was rather underwhelmed by the Talents, I didn't find them as amazing as it would imply.\n\nThere are Items to find too, and they do various things, such as increasing stats, damage, Mana/Health, Mana Regen, Armor, etc. But they also have other traits too sometimes, such as occasionally summoning a meteor to strike the enemy, occasionally casting tornadoes around you, etc.\n\nThere are 3 types of Items. First are Gear, which consist of a Hat, Shoulders, Cloak, and Boots Slot, and you can only have one per slot. Secondly are trinkets, which you can have as many as you want. Then there are Pets, which are rare to find. All types carry the same types of boosts, like stats/damage and the like, and of course random bonuses. Pets, along with having those bonuses, also some times attack or debuff enemies depending on the Pet. You can have as many pets as you like.\n\nThere are a bunch of Primary and Mana Spells to find, with decent variety.\n\nWhen you start a game or go to a new area, you always start in you house. The house starts out with a bench that will allow you to buy permanent upgrades to it. Such as Totems that permanently increase your Health or Mana. You also start with a bench that will convert 10 Coins into Crystals, which are needed to buy the house upgrades. The bench will also convert Crystals into 5 Coins. Crystals and House Upgrades are the only thing that transfers between games. As for what kind of upgrades, the Totems like I mentioned earlier, then there are benches that let you buy Keys and Potions, a Bench that will give you 1 Magic Item per game, a Kitchen Counter that makes it so you start each level with full health, etc. Bosses drop 3-4 when you kill them, and mini bosses drop 1-2. And like I mentioned, 10 Coins can be converted into 1 Crystal, so be sure to convert them BEFORE you die, or whenever you get enough.\n\nThere's also an option to change the color theme, which I really appreciate. It defaults to a dark color theme, but there's also a Bright Color Theme that I preferred, and even an option to mix it up. There's also a bunch of Mouse Cursors to choose from.\n\nThere are other things too, but that's enough explaining. For downsides, I found the Levels rather small, with not much variety in prop setup. I wish there was an option to make them larger. And while there are a decent amount of House Upgrades, I wish there were more. The Talents were rather underwhelming as well, I wish there were more interesting ones. And I found the Stat Points pretty useless overall, with only the Health upgrade being useful, with Armor and Mana being worth it afterwards. Health and Mana increases 10 points per stat point, while the other stats only increase by 1, making them not worth putting Stat Points into, seeing as Items are common enough and boost them far more.\n\nStill, overall those are minor complaints. The game is definitely worth the $5 price tag, and I recommend you pick it up if your into a game Like Binding of Isaac with RPG elements and spells.","March 19","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing new about that. It's maps and monsters and drops and bosses are randomized every time you play the game, which I really like; but that's not cutting edge innovation either.\n\nSo it's a traditional game, but don't let that fool you! It's done so well! I particularly liked the dark, bleak atmosphere, the minimal storyline, and the many, many ways the game can be played:\n\n1. Increase your health and health regeneration and armor, to a point where killing you becomes virtually impossible (tank).\n\n2. Increase your mana and mana regen and mana gain on hit, and forget about your primary attack: Keep spamming those magic attacks that deal huge damage (wizard).\n\n3. Increase the chance of landing a crit and crit damage, and obliterate whole hordes of monsters in seconds (assassin).\n\n4. Use a unique style in which you deal more damage but receive more damage (barbarian); shoot triple bolts and reflect things randomly at enemies, while running around crazy fast (ranger); focus on using potions and spellbooks (mage); etc.\n\nAlso, loot. Sweet, randomized loot. You have no idea what you'll get, and you can either choose to build on the buffs that your loot gives you, or complement them with your attributes and skills. You'll love it when you randomly get four pieces of matching armor! (haven't had that happen to me yet, I got three matching pieces only, which was really delightful).\n\nI really like it. It's not a big game, but it aims at doing a specific thing, and it does it beautifully.\n\nThe only thing I would ask the dev to do, is maybe add a help section that describes different aspects of the game (for example, how exactly does armor work?)\n\n10/10 would recommend.","June 3","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must admit it's a little bit short, for example it takes only 5 levels to reach the final boss. But there are 3 different difficulty level, lots of unlockable charracters, lots of magical items, shops, quests, altars and more to find on each playthrough. so the game has a good replay value (But of course if you like the original concept of game).\n\nPros:\n+ Strong roguelike elements (So many contents in the game to appear randomely)\n+ Upgrade system for the hut ( that works for every new playthrough)\n+ 3 different difficulty level\n+ Maps and Enviornments have very good details\n+ cheap price (specially on sales)\n\nCons:\n- The RPG system doesn't work well so I chose same power ups every single time\n- abscence of music makes the game hollow\n- graphics and visual aren't eye catching\n- items aren't as crazy as games like Binding of Isaac (most of them just increase charracter's stats)","June 3","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
