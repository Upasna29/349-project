"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AsaOfTheSand/recommended/321330/","AsaOfTheSand","Asa / Tadero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AsaOfTheSand/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, the developer is an awesome, stand-up guy.  He takes every bit of criticism with a cool head and he doesn't have an ego that might get inflated when praised.  He's a man of his word, and every time he's told me he was going to do something, he's gone and done it.\n\nSecond of all - having played through quite a few iterations of ENYO Arcade so far, I can say that at the very least, updates happen.  Sometimes the updates are by the week or sooner, and those are usually just tweaks or bug-fixes or minor content additions.  Sometimes James'll go two or three months without an update, but when he comes back he either has something massive in store or he had some insane story for why he couldn't work on the game (and get this: all of those crazy stories are true)\n\nThirdly - ENYO Arcade is a gem of a game, and it's made by one man alone.  The game changes and evolves as the players give feedback and ideas.  If nothing else, ENYO Arcade is a game made to please the audience, and it knows what audience it is aiming to please.  There will never be a day (that I can see) when this game will pander to people who don't want a challenge or don't enjoy pixel art; there will never be a day (that I can see) when this game will be anything less than fun, difficult, and crazy.\n\n\nENYO Arcade is a chaotic platforming-shooter.  The goal of ENYO Arcade isn't to win, it's to win with a faster time than you just won.  Why?  Not because of the leaderboard, no.  Not because there's a bonus for doing so, no.  Not because there are any special secrets at the end waiting for someone who beats their own time, no.  The reason is because it feels good to overcome the brutal chaos and pure insanity that are the level layouts.  Sometimes all you need for pure chaos and insanity are five or six flying, self-destructing, heat-seeking drones with inconsistent pathing in a room that very well should be way too big for them.  Guess what? They know you're at the door, and they will labor to mess you up.  Sometimes chaos and insanity are slow, floating, orange orbs of death that leave trails of killer gas.\n\nAs of the time of this review, ENYO Arcade doesn't have much to offer except:\n-- An awesome dev who listens to community feedback\n-- Tight, smooth controls that feel good and respond well: when you make a mistake, you simply can't blame it on the controls\n-- Interesting monsters\n-- Balanced weapons\n-- Fun platforming mechanics\n-- NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PUZZLES\n-- A community that, though small, is very kind\n-- Fantastic potential\n-- Challenging areas that take practice and skill to overcome\n-- Beautiful pixel art - fun to look at and easy on the eyes.\n-- Fantastic music\nWait a minute, that's a lot of stuff.\n\nThe game is short, and only a little bit of lore is explained at all, but the replay value comes from the fact that it feels good to beat your own time and spend another 10 to 20 minutes on doing it again.\n\nAt $3, ENYO Arcade is ridiculously cheap for as much as it has going for it, and as much as it has in its future.  If that's too expensive for you, maybe you should take a look at your next AAA title that's worth $60 and you'll get 6 to 8 hours of enjoyment out of, then you'll look back here at ENYO Arcade and say "Why didn't I spend that $60 more wisely?"\n\nSeriously.  Buy this game.","July 30, 2015","true","12.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Despite my distaste for these types of games, I won’t lie to you. This was a solid experience that a lot more people should witness.\n\nIn all honesty, I wasn’t too invested in the story. Basically, the world’s a mess and you’re just trying to save the day. But then again, I highly doubt anyone purchased ENYO for an enthralling tale, so I’m not going to linger on it, anymore.\n\nWhat I have to commend the most is, hands down, the graphics. I’ve seen some good pixel art in my day, but damn, this was a sight for sore eyes. A dark overtone of black and purple mixed with the decay of a destroyed utopia. Colors mesh together and every pixel seamlessly coincide to create these beautiful backdrops and settings. It’s a shame you’ll be so busy trying to survive that you won’t notice the developer’s attention to detail. If you can, take a break and just admire the beauty. Trust me; it’ll calm your nerves.\n\nSpeaking of nerves, mine had snapped many times with ENYO. In case you weren’t paying attention, you’d know that I’m not a big fan of these types of games. Reason: They ♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off. I only, if ever, rage while playing a title like this. Hell, you should’ve seen me play Shovel Knight, and that was a cake walk compared to this.\n\nHere’s a tip: If it moves, it can kill you. Don’t ever let your guard down while playing this game. Keen eyes and keener reactions are what you’ll need to survive, and I learned that the hard way. However, I just wish there was a larger abundance of enemy types. Not all the sprites are too interesting, and it got a tad repetitive killing the same flying meatball over and over and over again.\n\nThere are a handful of different weapons you can choose from, and most are handy in different situations. However, I found the plasma weapon (You know, the one that shoots purple orbs of death) the most useful. In fact, I’m sure most players could beat the game without ever touching another weapon. But hey, maybe I’m the only one who feels this way. Just wish there was more incentive to mix up your method of killing.\n\nLevel designs are good, nothing to write home about, but good. They provide the challenge and I never felt cheated by enemy placements or stupid plat forming. However, they’re laid out like a maze. If you missed your exit to the next stage, you just might have to go all the way back, killing all the same mobs you’ve already killed, just to find the way out. It would’ve been nice if the mobs you’ve defeated didn’t respawn as soon as you leave that section of the level. It resulted in tons of frustration, but again, probably just me, seeing as how I’m a total noob at this kinda stuff.\n\nTo conclude, any fan of ENYO’s hardcore style and traditional gameplay will definitely love this title.","December 10, 2015","true","1.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

Rifle, shotgun, grenade and rocket. Each with their own damage and play style. Use them to fight humanoid enemies or wildlife creatures. Levels have destructable items like lights and explosive barrels. Explosive barrels can damage enemies. The defualt attack is to kick.\nAs you navigate the levels you can turn into a ball for a speed boost or use wallride jumps to reach higher areas. There is also a flight sequence.\nSmooth gameplay.","July 29, 2015","true","6.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

But after only ~20 minutes I'm not satisfied.\n\nThe pixel art isn't particularly stunning. I can't see why it is touted so highly in the reviews. What are the purple fuzzy things? What is the deal with the mech and why doesn't it fit in?  Everything is small an overly distorted. You zoom to "fix" it. Fix it?\n\nThe controls feel off to me. The gravity seems heavy. The wall jumping isn't natural. Or maybe it is the default button layout. Where is the "parkour"?\n\nI can't exactly put my finger on it but there are many other platformers I'd recommend before this one.","March 22","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"
