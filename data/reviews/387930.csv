No loud jumpscares as promised and the characters are creepy.\n-Although the levels are not the most original thing out there, their goals seem to make justice to the atmosphere.\n\nWhat may put you off:\n\n-The main story lasts for 40 minutes plus 10 if you are willing to look at the bonus levels (an endless version of one of the story levels plus a FNAF clone)\n-The old videotape asthetic may look interesting on the screenshots and gameplay video, but once you get into the actual game, it is just too much, almost unbearable. (at least the developer had the attention of putting an option to turn that off)\n-This is a glitchy one.\n\nHow was the experience?\nThe game itself was above average but way too short. It crashed one time and I broke the game about 2 times (going through a level without completing all the objectives, and I was able to go back through a door that was supposed to be locked AFTER I went through and NOT when I came back inside and tried to leave). I also experienced clipping issues with tables. The framerate is a bit low in the first level (which begins in a forest), but for the rest of the game, it went smoothly 80+ fps so kudos to the dev for that.\n\n\nWords for the developer:\nWhat is here, right now, is something. Not amazing, but not a piece of ♥♥♥♥ either Having been given a bit more development on the main story and it could have been something really special. It is a shame that you decided to release it as it is.","November 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 176 of 190 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","176","190","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/387930/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","The Tape is a short horror experience crafted in Unity. While that sentence will put off many people, including myself, I must say that this game is the very first Unity horror title that has run at a stable 60 FPS with no frame drops on my high-end rig. I should also mention that the developer also brought us Putrefaction, which was well received in general.\n\nThe story line within The Tape is perplexing and mild at best, you're a detective out to solve a murder. Your investigation takes you through two "haunted" houses, a cultist infested dungeon, a strange water level and a forest. I must say, the only part that I found at all intriguing was when blood began dripping from the walls. The entire experience will last about 30-40 minutes at best, and there are two endings to choose from. Luckily, there's a save point at the last part of the game, so you can replay the area and get the other ending if you wish.\n\nThe Tape's main graphic feature, which is a heavy "camera" filter setting, actually bothered my eyes more than it did to help my experience within the game. I turned it off, and what I was left with was a black and white game. While I'm not adverse to black and white movies and such, I must say I just do not feel that a pure black and white setting works here. Sure, it helps the faint shadows that are cast to stand out a little more, but other than that the title could stand to have some color added.\n\nAside from the extremely short main game, the player will have the chance to play three "bonus levels", which act a bit as challenge maps. The Forest mode is basically a Slenderman simulator; you walk around a forest until you've found 8 pages. I didn't run into any foes in this area, it seems to be just tedious walking. Dark Waters is a recreation of the water level within the main story, where you simply turn from left to right, gather up light and survive as long as you can against the demon head. Lastly, during Dungeons of Terror you will flip between 4 cameras with the aim to gather 20 pages and collect fuel to keep torches lit to keep the demon at bay. The pages show up randomly over time. All of these levels are rather easy and generic, and will not tack much time on to the overall game.\n\n$4.49 CAD for this title is too high a price to pay for an hour long black and white Unity horror title that offers no horror whatsoever. I ended up getting this on sale for around $1.50, which is a price I can recommend this game at, if I were to recommend it at all. Alas, I do not, as a seasoned horror veteran The Tape will flee from the vaults of my mind by the time I wake from my next sleep.\n\nRating: 1.5/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 4","false","1.7"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","0"

It has it's flaws but makes up for it in atmosphere.\n\nThere is very little in the way of backstory as you quickly find out that you are investigating a dissappearance of a young girl. There was such a seamless transition from cut scene to game mode that I didn't even realize that I was supposed to do anything. Once I started pushing keys I was quickly on my way to the abandoned house at the end of the road and my investigation had begun.\n\nThe camera effects mode... well intentioned but just didn't do it for me and I had to turn it off after about 10 minutes as it was leading to a headache for sure. I found the basic monchromatic view so much better and a perfect fit for a story of this nature, almost with a Silent Hill vibe to it.\n\nYou make progress in the game primarily from exploration and use of logic. There is very little in the way of object interaction beyond just going through doors and such but the surroundings and backdrops are so nicely crafted that I found myself admiring the game from an aesthetic viewpoint.\n\nOne suggestion I would like to make to the developer (and many other developers who does not speak english as their native language) is that if you are looking for widespread acceptance of your game from people in the West, you should collaborate with someone who speaks/writes english well in order ensure proper grammer and pronunciation of spoken dialogue and subtitled content. On several of the games that I have reviewed recently I have noticed grammatical errors that are not a huge deal, but correcting these would provide the polish it needs to give it a more professional appeal. Like I said this isn't a deal breaker... just a suggestion.\n\nFor such a short game I'm sure many could not justify the price but for a fan of the genre like myself I'm ok with it and it is a welcome addition to my horror collection.

The plot is not very elaborate or intricate, but in my view, this kind of game doesn't need to be. The atmosphere is quite terrifying, and the camera effects are *perfect*. You can turn them off in the menu, but I would recommend leaving them on as they really give you the  full experience. There is an extremely  basic form of stealth in this game, and honestly, for what it is, it's all it needs to be. The game isn't about stealth, it's about showing you an extremely creepy and dark atmosphere. The levels are minimalist, and this fits with the abstract nature of the game. It doesn't need lots of models or props, and I think while some of the level design seemed to be lacking in content (tunnels), this is probably more seemly so due to the speed at which your character moves for the first half of the game. But I think this game is really well done, and I do however wish that there were more to it. If the same sort of design, camera effects, locations (the forest reminds me of something from Blair Witch Project), and atmospheric attention were given to other horror games that give more in terms of interaction and gameplay, I believe that horror games would be far more tense. I would definitely hope to see another installemant, maybe with more interaction as well, and possibly more subtle music to add even furthur to the atmosphere. Overall, this game is exceptional when it comes to atmosphere, and I would love to see more like it.","November 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","29","46","2","0"

The sound in this game is equally impressive/oppressive, so these two factors already put The Tape yards ahead of the vast majority of alleged "first person horror games" released onto Steam in the past couple of years.  The "story" - what little there is of it - is furthermore highly intriguing, and the scenery is suitably compelling.  There's even a tiny bit of what one might conventionally term "gameplay" on offer:  A tiny bit of "stealthing" and/or other enemy evading, and even a "boss battle" of sorts near the end.  That's the good stuff.\n\nNow onto the not-so-good stuff.  The price is possibly a tad on the steep side, considering that the main game/campaign itself is probably under an hour, although there are some simplistic mini-games included as extras for those who can find pleasure in such petty things (including one where you time-manage some different camera angles to ensure things don't get dark for too long or you get jump-scared - sound familiar? - and another one where you wander around in a gloomy forest looking for pages of a book - also sound familiar?)!  There's also more than a touch of the "what the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to be doing here?"s in a few bits, though one could certainly argue that this fact adds a little to both the mystery of the piece AND the length of the gameplay, so it's perhaps not an absolute detriment to the game overall.\n\nSo yes, it's DEFINITELY scary and disturbing, DEFINITELY short, DEFINITELY not extraordinary value for money, but DEFINITELY worth a look if you're a die-hard horror fan, especially if you can grab it on sale.  By all means, if you keep your expectations fairly low, you may be pleasantly surprised.  Expect another Outlast - a game which it owes a small amount to, if not THAT much - then, well, you're clearly a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot and DESERVE to be disappointed.  I will be looking out for other releases from this Kazakov Olag character, though, as it's due time one of these Euro dudes churning out cheap horror games turned out to be one with a noteworthy TALENT (and while we're at it, more than just a fly-by-night scam artist).  Oh, look, he DOES have another game out already...hello, Putrefaction...Kazakov, don't fail me now...\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","November 20, 2015","true","1.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","13","18","4","3"

It's a bizarre mess of stealth levels and seeker maze quests and there's even a water-based boss battle to get involved in but it's all mashed together into a forty minute campaign without anything in the way of cohesion.\nThe loose plot hangs on the back of a detective searching for a missing girl in 1960s rural America with the gameplay conducted through the nauseous jitter-laden lens of a camcorder. I won't even get into how many feet of film you'd need to be carrying around with you to run one of those beasts back in the day but at no point does the game ever indicate that we NEED to be viewing this through a camera. It's a gimmick to sell a disjointed collection of stage designs rather than a game.\nThere's a 'Use' button mapped and you'll press it four times. Once to pick up a key. Three to light some candles.

You play as a nameless detective, on the lookout for a girl who had recently gone missing. He had compiled enough clues to pinpoint the girl’s last known location; an abandoned home nestled in the forest. It is your job to investigate the house and gather whatever information is available. Armed with nothing but your camcorder, you unwillingly uncover the presence of a mysterious cult operating in the area. Through them, you hope to find the girl and escape with your life.\n\nRight off the bat, I want to make something clear; I really didn’t want to give this game a thumb down. The atmosphere is spectacular, the mystery is intriguing, it’s got some awesome concepts, and it’s creepy as ♥♥♥♥.  But sadly, every time The Tape managed to scare me or do something brilliant, it does something equally stupid and unappealing.\n\nFirst, let’s talk gameplay. There is none. You walk and doors open automatically as you approach them. I have no problem with this. In fact, I’ve played quite a few games with limited mechanics that still entertained me from start to finish. I mean, it’s the atmosphere and suspense that counts in these types of games, so I was willing to forgive it for that. And let me tell you, the first few minutes of this game are great! The crappy camcorder effects were really appealing to me and added to the environment, and exploring the first level’s abandoned house was straight up creepy.\n\nBut… like I said earlier, the game took a step back shortly afterwards. You see, about midway through the second level, you have to make your way past some cultists, who patrol down a series of pathways. If one sees you, he runs at full speed, torch raised high, and proceeds to bonk you on the head in an overdramatic fashion. I laughed my head off when this first happened, and due to your painfully slow speed, there’s no way of outrunning them. So I was totally sucked from the experience thanks to The Tape’s horrible stealth section.\n\nThe Tape has some truly good moments, but a handful of bugs, a stupid maze puzzle, and an unsatisfying ending just don’t make up for them. You can easily beat this game in under an hour, and seeing as how the bonus levels are uninspired and boring, I just can’t find it in myself to recommend this game.","December 2, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/387930/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","This game isn't bad. Actually, in a few areas it excels rather nicely in, while not scary it is a bit creepy and a few of the scenes and moments are nice twists on some old-timey horror convention, and it isn't riddled with jump scares, with attention focused on to build a sort of slow-burn or atmospheric experience. However, the game as of the time I played and write this does have a few bugs, the developer doesn't appear to be native English and the dialogue comes off as a bit broken (it's only really noticeable in the endings, however), but the biggest deal breaker for many will be its length; The main game is about 35-45 minutes long. There's some bonus stages I'll get to in a bit, but the time might sell some off the title.\n\nWhich is a shame since it actually isn't a half-bad game. While the pacing is decent, it does feel the game could be fleshed out more and there's more to explore here. I actually found the game quite interesting; It's hard to talk about specific moments of the game in part due to the game's briefness, but the basic aesthetic is well-handled (and some screen artifacting and effects used to give it and old film sort of feel are well-done, though if you don't like it the options allows you to turn it off), the game isn't repetitive and despite its shortness does mix-up the variety and threat multiple times, though isn't hugely challenging. But what the game excels at is giving the feel of something like an old black-and-white horror film in game form. The audio is very minimalistic and somewhat washed out, but worked with the old film aesthetic. And some of the imagery is tad creepy... But not of the sort it happens suddenly or catches you off-guard, the sort of slow-burn where the camera stays fixated on a piece of imagery for an extended period of time as it sort of ingrains a sort of deeper feeling to the scene. As a big horror enthusiast, I did find the interesting scenarios and imagery to be enough to make the experience worthwhile. And for those weary of crappy indie horror games; this isn't one of them. It's not bad, or badly made, or using assets badly, or not understanding horror, or anything like that. It's solid, and you can tell the creator both knew what they were doing and understand the horror they were going for.\n\nBut not flawless. Outside of length concerns, the way doors opened were a bit awkward, the game has a few bugs... I didn't encounter anything game breaking, but a couple objects I could walk through, and the way doors open in this was a bit janky (they kind of open automatically when you get close to them, which is a bit odd in how they do as such). Really, just some small janky things like doors or the cultists in the first scene you're in danger being blind as a bat almost, but thankfully it didn't take away too much from the experience.\n\nThere's some bonus levels in the game, at the time of writing three in total (the the developer has said he wants to make and release more post-release), but I'm hoping future levels end up more like levels from the actual game than the sort of mini-games the three currently available are. The mini-games are a bit finicky, more than the main game, but fine. Two of the mini-games also have obvious inspiration, one more than the other, which I'm happy they kept out of the main game, but questions if we need it in game at all. Regardless, what I think is the best of the bunch is a minigame that's kind of Five Nights at Freddy's inspired, but also it's own thing. You have four cameras you switch between in a dungeon, there are torches on each camera feed (two torches on each camera feed I believe), you need to collect fuel that appears randomly and locate pages to make more pages to appear you need to pick up, all while avoiding a demon that will appear and disappear; make sure you keep at least one torch lit on a camera screen and don't hover or linger on cameras with the demon on it, all while locating and picking up pages (the objective is to pick up 20 pages on the feed). I had a bit of fun with this mini-game all things considered, was worth a play. The other two were passable though; One is kind of a 'keep-away' mini-game based off of a certain moment in the main game where giant heads & hands come out at you from the water and you keep them away with light, but honestly you turn so slow and it was a bit dull (the section in the main game which is a twist off this was better done in my opinion). The last mini-game is the worst, in my opinion, it's a Slender clone, but not an especially good one. The extra mini-games are fun, but pale to the main campaign and I kind of hope if/when more bonus levels are added in the future, they build more off the main game than as little mini-game diversions. I'd be more interested in content more like the main game than little, "inspired by," mini-game sets.\n\nWhich brings me to my core point: I like what the main game has going for it. It's not especially scary, but I found it enjoyable, creepy, and interesting. I think a few scenes from the game are memorable, and honestly would like to see more of it. Which highlights to me it was worth experiencing on my side, but also underlines the game is short and could go on for much longer than it does; flesh itself out more. However, if the length doesn't bother you and a slow, little atmospheric dive into a creepy little horror game with some nice style going for it sounds appealing, I think the dive is worth it, but do hope the developer expands on the game if it does well for him rather than abandoning it. What's there is good, if needing a little polish. As is, I'd give it a solid 7-7.5/10, but with some expansion/extended content and added polish I would easily raise that score. While a bit lacking in some areas, it's not bad, not bad at all, and some scenes I feel are worth experiencing, especially for any horror buffs than may enjoy interesting and somewhat creepy scenes that aren't necessarily  scary, but interesting.","November 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

I'd say that price point is appropriate as the game is severly limited in length and the graphics are on par with a lot of these indie niche horror titles I've been playing lately (low-mediium).\n\nHowever I did get a few good scares out of it and some scenes were disturbing enough to have made for an entertaining livestream.  It is definitely slow to start but when it amps up it amps up HARD. My god.\n\nSo, if you have realistic or no expectations go ahead and drop half the cost of a sandwich on The Tape and play it with friends watching. :)","December 8, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","2"

When I started the game, I thought it was pretty good, but then after beating the first area, the game started to get really boring. Things became less fun, like the developer ran out of ideas and was like ''yeah let's just make a maze where you get chased by a girl''. Also, the game tells you that it does not have cheap jumpscares, and that's a lie. There are two jumpscares in this game. One when  entering the room at the end of the first area, and man will jump at you from the door and the second you read the note about the devil and exit the cabin-ish thing. The storyline feels like something the developer tried too hard to make creepy, but failed. I liked how in the maze when the girl got near you, your screen started to get all glitchy, that was pretty scary.\n\nAlso, this game is really buggy. At one point I turned off sounds completely(because I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥), but I could still hear them. And you can walk through tables too(and cabinets in the kitchen). Also, smaller resolutions(which I had to play in because bandicam does not record fullscreen games properly)cause the game to crash for me, and they also make some of the text unreadable. Really, I do not regret playing this, but I feel like it's a little too expensive for what it is. It would probably be better of being 1 buck or free in that case.\n\nDon't buy this, but watch a let's play. It's atleast worth doing that. I'll upload one later too, if you are interested and will share a link to it below when I do.\nEdit: Here it is!\nhttps://youtu.be/zUyj3vBoNVY","November 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Too high of a jump, Too slow of a walk, and no sprint. Also, all the monsters have broken AI. This is not Doodly. Over all, the game just doesn't scare my diddle doodles.

Not scary in the least.  All you do is move.  There is no inventory, there are no puzzles, just moving and avoiding things and a bit of "collecting" which is just moving to the right spot.  No real goal, no narrative.\n\nYour on a trail, then in a house, then in a dungeon, then in maze-like hallway, then in water with floating balls of light.  No sense, no connective segue.  And then you get eaten 1000 times by a giant head until you have to look up what to do and then when you try to do it it doesn't work.\n\nClipped through stuff and off the map a coupel of times.\n\nNo instructions, vague goals.
