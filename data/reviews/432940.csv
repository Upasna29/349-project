I really appreciated that. I went ahead and purchased the game and I'm glad I did.\n\nI have only played it a little bit but so far I'm really enjoying it. Good graphics (with no lag), great explosions (I've died a lot). Lots of perks and rewards with daily rewards and challenges. There are a lot of different paths you can try each time you race and its quite addicting.\n\nHopefully, see you on the leaderboards.","February 1","true","0.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

I was surprised on how addicting this game is and ended up playing over 11 hours. Here is a short(ish) summary of my thoughts about this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626065721\nTags: Early Access, Action, Racing\n\nHighlights Unforgiving, fast-paced, and addicting gameplay\n\nLimited soundtrack variety, the music feels repetitive after a while\n\nAlmost unlimited playability with new tracks and challenges daily\n\nTournaments to compete with other players on who can race the farthest (I have gotten into the top 10 a few times)\n\nCrisp 3D graphics complimented by a detailed post-apocalyptic environment\n\nThe ability to see the paths of your previous and best races\n\nSpeeder customization is slightly limited; you can collect customization kits by completing missions or placing in the leaderboards. A nice thing to see would be community-created skins for speeders.\n\nA vast variety of perks to unlock and buy for your speeder (you have to pay a small fee for your perks each time you race)\n\nSeveral upgradable pickups that help with your quest to race further and faster\n\nAnd my favorite feature: a boost meter that can charge from being close to obstacles\nSummaryOne of the main things about this game that sticks out to me is the amount of content/playability. Each day a new course is designed and the leaderboards are reset. For a price of $5 in the Early Access stage (the full retail price will change at release), you really can’t go wrong here. If you are really hesitant to buy the game, just go and try out the free mobile version. Can’t wait to see what they add next!\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\nThis game’s rating: 8.5/10. If you like fast-paced racing games, this is a must buy, even in its Early Access stage.http://store.steampowered.com/app/432940","February 20","true","12.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

What the letter had going for it in the sort of abstraction this one is pursuing a more realistic visual style of techno-dystopia. Yet feels way more unforgiving, since you can't jump out of dead end and only offer one retry per run, so memorizing patterns adds some nice variants to later game stages. It even has Dune sized metal sand worms popping out if nowhere.\n\nThe great soundtrack gives it a Gesaffelstein'ish atmosphere, yet could use some expansion over the the currently very short playlist.\n\nThe multiplayer leader board is nice and after a few day of playing you get a feeling that it really is quite unforgiving after stage 15 or so, even the upgrades won't get you much further, so it's a quite leveled ladder.\n\nDevelopers are currently (Feb 2016) very responsive and might fix some minor issues with controllers and non-16:9 ratios.","February 8","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Breakneck is a high speed action game where you escape from ailens on a speeder! It has amazing graphics and TONS of action. It is far better than the mobile edition of the game and is worth 5 dollars. The soundtrack is awesome with epic music suited exactly for the high speed action the game delivers. The zones each have their own look and chaos happens in the background as you try to go as far as possible! 10/10 would buy again:)","May 12","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirKV/recommended/432940/","SirKV","SimpleSimon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirKV/","338 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBreakneck is like an endless runner and has leader boards.\n\nYou can earn in game currency which you can purchase perks and perk upgrades which you will need as you are scored on the distance you travel. With a "pursuer" always hunting you down you need to keep ahead, so being strategic with your choice of perks is a must.\n\nYou get a wide direction to travel left and right giving you plenty of choices how you are going to get through the zones, keep an eye out for perk pick ups, avoid crashing, and avoid the "pursuer" which will take you down if it catches up with you.\n\nEvery day the game levels are changed up a bit to keep the challenge up, this is good and keeps it relatively fresh each day. What the game needs though are some more zone variants, right now there seems to be 3 or 4, and while they do vary on each visit during your play through it would be cool to have a more diverse change of scenery.\n\nGraphics are really good and fast, and the electronic music is very fitting the game, again a little more variation on that would be nice since it is essentially one track that loops (other than changing when the pursuer is on you).\n\nOne last thing I need to point out, while the game runs great there are the odd accassional time where it will freeze for a split second, this is real bad when your on a twitchy section, this problem has cost me high scores a few times. I noticed this happens if you head far left or right, its as if the game has to briefly load that area in.\n\nOther than that this is a great time waster and ooozes that just one more try appeal.","March 23","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure I was going to like this kind of "racer", but in the end it's pretty addictive.\n\nPros :\n\n- nice graphics\n- tight controls\n- really fast\n- good sense of progression ( you'll probably do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scores the first days until you unlock stuff )\n- "OH SH*T" moments\n- easy to play ( you only need to steer left and right, and one button to boost ), difficult to master\n- day-night "cycle" and weather that change every day ( today there was a sand storm ).\n\nCons :\n\n- really repetitive electro music\n- feels like a pay-to-win mobile game at first with mecanisms like "collect reward", "quick unlock this and that with coins", but it's not : everything can be unlocked by playing\n- UI is a pain to navigate with a controller and there is no "retry" button, after each run you have to go through at least 5 or 6 panels to start the race again.\n- the engine has problems displaying the obstacles fast enough sometimes, stuff will appear in your face\n- some mesh flickering\n- pick-ups are random and can ruin a run if you only stumble on the "bad" ones\n- barely any options currently, you can change the language, turn sound and music on/off, and that's it. You can't even just lower the volume a bit, it's either on or off.\n\nSo basically what is this game ?\n\nYou have a really fast ship and you must outrun some alien pursuer before they can lock some laser weapon on you that will one-shoot you. You race through short levels, each one is different from the previous one, in a few different "biomes" ( industrial zone, alien fortress, etc. ), and the trick is that you have to get really close to walls to reload your booster. It's not just a mindless "go-as-fast-as-possible" game, because you have to manage your boost to avoid running out of it in a critical moment, while finding the best path with the good pick-ups to help you. The fastest path is not always the best.\n\nYou earn XP and levels, which unlocks new features, and you also earn three different currencies : gold coins, blue insignas and purple bonuses. Gold coins are mostly used to buy advantages before each race ( an advantage is like "you get some free boost at the beginning of each zone" ), but each advantage slot must be unlocked by blue insignas. Each advantage is lost if you die or get catched by the aliens, and you have to rebuy it ( or not, you can also race without any advantage but you won't get far ).\n\nWhen you reach some levels you'll also unlock power-ups that will appear in the race, and you can upgrade these power-ups with insignas and purple bonuses.\n\nAt the end of each day you get rewards based on your rank, new skins for your ship, blue insignas, etc.\n\nOh and on top of that there are a bunch of "missions" you can do during the race to earn more rewards, like "collecting 100 coins", "finishing 5 zones without hitting anything", etc.\n\nIt's all pretty confusing at first but it makes the game more interesting.","March 11","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easily among my top time killers, action, speed racing, chasing, and full throttle addrenaline as to try and get further and further each time, slightly laggy with my laptop, but i believe thats simply because its a cheap laptop without a video card, but i think some graphics options like on the tablets/phones would be a little helpful for the weaker systems like mine.
