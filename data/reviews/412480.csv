I liked it so much that i've given one as a gift to my partner, hope that he will enjoy it as much as i do. It has a good and lovely design of characters, beautiful scenes, and its really funny; its like a super mario but with a lovely turttle in a seascape. I recommend it! ^^","October 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"
