You shouldn't trust your impressions after first few levels. Yes, they are boring, but not representative for the whole. I got the game in the bundle and first played in on tablet - and hated it. I tried it again after a year, when I installed it from steam. I tediously bombed my way through the initial levels, motivated only by getting some steam achievements. And then, suddenly, I was hooked. The levels started to be more demanding, the achievements harder to get - that was it. I needed to be stealth, to plan my route, to study enemies' paths and be quick at that. Overall it took me seven hours to complete the game with all achievements and I quite enjoyed it. And I haven't even touched player-made levels (yet). Definitely worth playing.\n\nSummary:\n- shallow and boring at the beginning\n- not very appealing artwork\n+ gets better after a few levels\n+ gets even better when you aim for all achievements\n+ lots of player-made levels if you're hooked","January 31, 2014","true","7.5"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

Each level consists of 3 additional goals in a variety of categories (collect certain items, don't kill anyone, kill everyone, etc) which provides some small level of replayability - in some cases, not all three can be achieved in a single playthrough.\n\nThe game is fun. Kind of easy, but fun. The only REAL problem I ran into is there were multiple instances where the game did not save progress properly - I beat many levels (in some cases 4 complete "worlds") and the save did not get uploaded to Steam Cloud properly (and it did not keep track of it locally), so I ended up having to redo all that progress. It was quite frustrating. However, for the game itself, it was a good time.\n\nIt only takes about 5 hours to complete everything there is to do in the game.

First of all, those dark creatures are just plain and simple annoying. You need to point your flashlight to them, so they are scared off, but if they get too close it isn't possible to turn around right in time and you will die.\nThen, the game heavily relies on trial&error, expect to die a lot. Annoying, just annoying.\nAnd finally, the bomb mechanic makes the game stupidly easy and takes away any stealth elements. Just a place a bomb, detonate, place a bomb right in the same place, run away and as soon as guards come there: Detonate and they're gone. And that's all. Unfortunately some missions even rely on that, else you won't be able to finish it.\nI liked the idea of mechanical-spiders not being destroyed by bombs, but unfortunately, only the very last 2-3 maps rely on them.\nIt is a really great concept, but just not thought out, how about making guards invincible to bombs?

I have 2.6 hours on record right now and was going to go complete the game. I happened to lose internet one day and when I loaded up Dynamite Jack it started back from the beginning. I thought it's no big deal, it's just a sync issue. Well when I got internet back I still didn't have my save. As far as I can tell I lost all of my progress. I looked for the local save file but I think there lies the problem. It appears that the game just saves to a single 'state.dat' file. So when I couldn't find the cloud version it overwrote it later with the new state I inadvertantly made when I launched the game from offline mode.\n\nJust be careful you know where your save is and to back it up!

Using just a flashlight and bombs that you have to find in the levels, you've got to make your way past guards and other obstacles to reach the exit.  This involves picking up keys to open locked doors and a lot of sneaking around, timing things just right, to avoid being shot.  Naturally, later levels get harder, but it's not terribly difficult to finish the game; I did in a few hours, but far from perfectly.  There is some reply value though in that it's possible to unlock extra levels if you don't the first time through, and each level normally has three goals/achievements, like beat a certain time or don't use the flashlight at all, so you can try to "three star" each level if you want.  It's pretty easy to pick up and put down at will since there's no real story to it, and it's not very long, so if you like puzzles (which I think this basically is), I think it's worth a try.","March 16, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ultimate goal is to escape each level with a greater goal of escaping the prison. The game is missing any real challenge since the AI is very predictable and incredibly dumb. Only in the last couple maps is there a glimpse of the potential for a challenge, but then the game ends leaving a feeling of "that's it?"\n\nThe saving grace is the map editor which allows anyone to design and play user created maps. The community has put out some intelligent and well thought out maps, although there is still no improvement to the AI issues.

ALL 28 levels looked the same. Once you've done 3 or 4, you'll know what you'll see until the end.\n\nAnd the mechanics themselves are just irrational. This game is light/shadow sight-based but nevertheless the guards will never notice the bombs you've just put in their way, even if they're staring to them. The AI is absolute simplistic and lacked of any intelligence. Guards will just follow their own route and maybe notice your detonations, but with 100% predictible moves.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game because it's just extremely meh. I'm sure you'll find MANY better indies than this more worthy.\n\n4/10","September 18, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

A simple concept, but it works, so can't complain.\n\nThis game does wonderful job of create a small cave atmosphere with the level design it provides. Stating that, it doesn't really branch to much other then the cave design. Some levels might have indoor sections yet the floor textures can feel a bit out of place when right next to the cave enviroment.\n\nThis intial game is pretty short and there might not be to much cause for replayablitity of the main level, yet it does have some fairly good, and for most part, well designed community Workshop levels.\n\nThis is a tough review for me because it was a good game to start out with, but it's not something that really is great in comparision to other indie or triple A games. So at the end I have to say, watch some gameplay videos and if you feel like getting this, possibly think about getting it on sale because, as previously stated, it's not a very long game.","June 25, 2014","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, you have infinite bombs, but can only place one bomb at a time. Throughout the whole game. How boring is that?\n\nAbout the stealth elements, basically you just avoid the enemy view cones or use a bomb detonation to lure the enemies to a spot, since the enemy AI is so bad that they literally won't do anything else than run to the location of a detonation, and then do whatever they were doing before. As you can imagine, killing enemies is very easy due to this, but some maps give you an achievement if you don't kill anyone (boooring!).\n\nLater on, there are some more challenging enemies, but they only appear on 3 maps and also have a specific flaw which makes it very easy to outsmart them.\n\nAbout the soundtrack, it really annoyed me after some time, so yeah, it wasn't very good, except for the final map theme.\n\nThe story is also basically non-existent, so the whole game just relies on it's game mechanics, which would be ok for a flash browser game, but not much more. It could have been much better.\n\nAll in all, the game isn't really bad, but it's not good either. It's a passable time-killer if you really haven't anything else to do, but you're better off playing better games. Don't waste your time with this.\n\nBtw, it takes about 2-3 hours to beat the whole game. After that (if you really like the game) you can play community maps.","January 22","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's amazing for it's price, but it just doesn't have the features to be the best.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n+ Great graphics for a top-down puzzel game (shadows and sorts too).\n+ Difficulty is nicely build up from easy levels at the beginning to challenging levels at the end.\n+ Aggressive AI.\n+ No game-breaking bugs (surprising for the price).\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Not alot of variety in levels.\n- Controls are poorly mapped.\n- No story line.\n\nDynamite Jack gives you alot of bang for your buck. Packed up with some nice features and puzzel elements, this game can get real intense when playing. Especially the later levels are filled with hostile AI and difficult maps. The game features a small but clear user interface. There is no irrelevant information shown other than a somewhat annoying tutorial at the beginning of each level. For the €8.99 price tag you get enough levels to play through and the game is surprisingly free of bugs.\n\nHowever, as soon as you boot the game, pay attention, an automatic cutscene/loading screen will pop-up showing the only bits of story line you will see throughout the whole game. Also, after a long gaming session some levels might feel familiar to previous levels, only to be stacked up with AI and extra objectives to complete.\n\nOne last big complaint towards the game is about the controls. They are so poorly mapped even ArmA III has better default controls. Z for your flashlight (yup, that's right), and control your character with the all familiar Unity control system: ↑ ↓ ← →.\n\nShould I get this game for the full price?\n- Yes.\nShould I get this game when it's on sale?\n- YES YES YES.","June 3, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's amazing for it's price, but it just doesn't have the features to be the best.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n+ Great graphics for a top-down puzzel game (shadows and sorts too).\n+ Difficulty is nicely build up from easy levels at the beginning to challenging levels at the end.\n+ Aggressive AI.\n+ No game-breaking bugs (surprising for the price).\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Not alot of variety in levels.\n- Controls are poorly mapped.\n- No story line.\n\nDynamite Jack gives you alot of bang for your buck. Packed up with some nice features and puzzel elements, this game can get real intense when playing. Especially the later levels are filled with hostile AI and difficult maps. The game features a small but clear user interface. There is no irrelevant information shown other than a somewhat annoying tutorial at the beginning of each level. For the €8.99 price tag you get enough levels to play through and the game is surprisingly free of bugs.\n\nHowever, as soon as you boot the game, pay attention, an automatic cutscene/loading screen will pop-up showing the only bits of story line you will see throughout the whole game. Also, after a long gaming session some levels might feel familiar to previous levels, only to be stacked up with AI and extra objectives to complete.\n\nOne last big complaint towards the game is about the controls. They are so poorly mapped even ArmA III has better default controls. Z for your flashlight (yup, that's right), and control your character with the all familiar Unity control system: ↑ ↓ ← →.\n\nShould I get this game for the full price?\n- Yes.\nShould I get this game when it's on sale?\n- YES YES YES.","June 3, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A simple & short top-down stealth game that starts out relatively simple early on and progressively gets a bit tougher to say the least.\n\nThe rebindable controls are extremely basic and the animations anything makes is very minimal but not terrible.\n\nThe object of the game is to get from point A to point B one level at a time, from your starting location to the "exit." You're free to choose what levels you want to start so should you have unlocked them.\n\nYour only real items are an unlimited supply of remote bombs and a flashlight which aren't always available to you immediately (and very few times not at all which becomes part of the challenge). There are a lot of pitch black areas to traverse through so that's where the flashlight comes in.\nThe bombs provided have a somewhat short range and are there for killing baddies and destroying specific key objects as well as making paths if the terrain present is at all destructible. Making a long path using bomb explosions however can get very tedious because of how short the blast radius is and the fact that you'll always have to keep your distance when placing a bomb so as not to get yourself killed. There's not a whole lot of need to do this at all.\n\nYou die in one hit and the stealth mechanics are very basic; stay out of an enemy's field of vision, watch for a pattern made by the enemies to figure out when to move, make an explosion with a bomb and soldiers available & nearby will check out the noise before going back to their scripted pattern. Not too far into the game the types of enemies will become a bit more unique and diverse. None of those new enemies will be anything like the average soldier for the most part.\n\nI've got a few personal yet very small problems though very irrelevant; I find it a bit bothering that the game's called "Dynamite Jack" and he's using those spherical cartoon bombs. Also, the story goes that he used to be a space marine who was captured, imprisoned, and escaped yet his methods of getting around are remarkably minimal.\n\nBy stealth game standards there isn't much of a big challenge in this game though there are in-game achievements that sort of encourage each map done specifically like beating a map in under a minute, don't kill anyone prior to exiting, kill everyone prior to exiting, etc.\n\nIt ain't a bad game though with how short it is I'd just recommend getting it for when it's seriously cheap or rather put a teeny bit of consideration if it pops up in another indie bundle.","July 9, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
