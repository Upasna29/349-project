The map was snow canyon and after several rounds I was finally able to cycle into the sniper position. 18v18 game. I find a nice place to go prone in the foiliage by a log and survey the battle to the best of my ability. I'm way too far away and its hard to get a clear shot, I'm feeling more and more useless as time goes on because I cannot see anybody. Before long, I check the team status and discover I am the only guy left alive on my side whereas almost the entire enemy team is alive.\n\nRight about then, I'm getting general chat messages thrown at me like grenades:\n"KILL YOURSELF"\n"STUPID SNIPER"\n"THIS WILL TAKE FOREVER"\n"HE IS ON TOP OF THE CANYON, KILL HIM"\n\nI do my best to ignore them, my heart starts pumping. Then I see an enemy.\n\nJust like they tought me in the in-game sniper training, I found a target across the canyon running parallel to me. I fired and he went down.\n\n"NICE SHOT!"\n"HAHAHA"\n"♥♥♥♥! HE GOT ME!"\n\nThen I see another. Bang, dead. My heart is pounding with excitment. I reel around to the bottom of the canyon where it looks like someone is shooting at me. I have the superior advantage. Bang, dead.\n\nBang, dead.\n\nBang, dead.\n\nThe chat is going absolutely crazy.\n\nI don't know how I did it, but I managed to take out the entire team single handedly in one of the more realistic sniper sims.\n\nLog onto another server and promptly get owned, and conistently get owned from that point on. I don't care, this epic moment keeps me warm.\n\nAwesome game even though its a propogandic as all hell 15/10","April 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 490 of 602 people (81%) found this review helpful 274 people found this review funny","81","490","602","274","16"

I'm a Vietnam vet, a 2-tour NCO, a wounded -combat- vet, BTDTGTTS, dear reader. I wasn't one of the REMF's. I'm also a man that's spent a lot of hours playing other shooter-type games on the PC, occasionally on consoles. I prefer the PC. I don't enjoy the easiest, or the hardest, setting, prefer the medium-tough degree in single-player. I seriously wanted to enjoy this game, but....\nI do not enjoy online play. I've tried it a lot, in numerous other shooter games. While AI can at times be -odd-, in their style, you can at least learn mostly what to expect. I can't say that about online play, I just do not like playing with, or against, other human players. I'd probably have a lot of fun with this game, IF it had a single-player mode. Sure, maybe it's because I'm -old-, I am, but it's a GAME, folks. It's supposed to be fun. I don't want a crowd of children, whose reflexes are twice as fast as mine and have time to do virtually nothing but play games, repeatedly kickin' my ♥♥♥. Sorry, it's simply not my idea of a good time.\nIf they ever release this game with a single-player mode, with a good story and thoughtfully crafted missions, I'd likely be one of the first to buy it, but as long as I have to compete against children, it's not fun.

A real team based First Person Shooter which rewards players for helping each other. For example, the faster you medic teammates, the less damage they will take to a limb when they've been shot in that area.\n+ Realistic firing mechanics. When an enemy is shooting at you, aiming becomes much more difficult and guns are not always 100% accurate.\n+ Most maps are small, which would traditionally be viewed negatively. However, this complements America's Army 3 because it allows players to become experienced with the environments, memorise key spots and provide accurate communication to teammates without confusion.\n+ Decent graphics, could be better though.\n+ A First Person Shooter which actually concentrates on skill, quick reflexes, constantly assessing your decisions and leaning around corners instead of blindly charging in like Call of Duty. The game is tactical but fun, deploying smoke grenades and flashbangs at the right time is useful, but they're balanced and not overpowered.\n+ Steep learning curve. This is a game for true First Person Shooter players. It isn't for the impatient or those who want to "respawn". Once you die for the round, you're out. So the game is about survival and teamwork, not personal glory and "leet solo skills". That said, it would be a mistake to compare this title to ARMA or Operation Flashpoint games. There will still be times when you are the last man standing and need to hunt down the enemy against the odds - good fun.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- With the release of America's Army: Proving Grounds, the sequel to America's Army 3, this game lost a large proportion of its community. In fact, the entire Australian group has left, and there remains only a few servers of dedicated American veterans with a love for the game. So, if you're from the United States and interested in this game, give it a go.\n- Limited weapon selection. The developers did this to reflect real-life military loadouts, but you aren't even given a pistol or knife as a secondary weapon. There are two main guns in the game, the M249 SAW and the M16/M4A1, with optional optic sights. Not a great amount of variety there.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\n\nAmerica's Army 3 is an underrated gem. Having played it over the course of a few years in excess of 1,000 hours, I can honestly say this game has huge replayability. Definitely download it.","February 18, 2014","true","083.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/recommended/13140/","pepperbelly","PepperBelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/","285 products in account","Alright, let's talk about America's Army 3.\n\nIf you haven't already guessed, it's the third installment. Coming from America's Army 2, it's a slight let down. That said, the game does have far better mechanics then it's predecessor (AA2), and even it's successor (Proving Grounds). It has all the mandatory and fundamental features/mechanics you expect from a tactical shooter. The game has a very authentic feel when playing it tactically. However, all that falls apart because of the poor server performance, terrible netcode, and inconsistent hit detection; sometimes you'll slay everyone left and right, and other times your weapon appears to be firing blanks.\n\nBecause of that, the game ends up benefitting from a more aggressive, run & gun style of play. So you'll see players firing in fully automatic, spraying down targets, strafing back and forth, spamming grenades, and so on. If you're the kind of guy (like me), that takes things slower, covering every angle and watching every corner, you should come out on top. But when it comes to shot placement, it's very inconsistent. You'll be the one to take accurate, semi-automatic fire at an enemy, and he'll spray back at you, and more often than not, he'll win the firefight, strictly based on the poor hit detection. Even though you line up those shots perfectly center mass, they'll feel like they do nothing at all, and even if you do win that engagement, chances are you were wounded in the process.\n\nIn short, this is an incredible game hampered down by those issues. If it was well polished, bug free, and had excellent online server performance, this game would be amazing. I want to love this game. I really do. It is an addicting game, with interesting gamemodes, and realistic weapon handling and maneuvering.\n\nThe reason why I'm recommending this game, is because it's FREE. It costs you nothing, and it's a decent experience. But you'll no doubt see the potential the game has, and wish it was better in all those areas I covered. Even with all its faults, I prefer it considerably over that of Proving Grounds, which in my opinion is an abhorrent game and a disgrace to the America's Army series.\n\nIf you want to see what AA2 was all about, look up "25Assist." It's a community made effort to bring America's Army 2.5 back to life, and has been running since around 2010. If the same love and care that was applied to 25Assist was applied here for AA3, it would no doubt be one of the best tactical shooters out there.\n\nIn the end, it's fun, and you may enjoy it, but you'll just keep thinking about how much better it could be.","January 27","true","16.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

It's aging a bit now, and the game's community/development has been replaced by that CoD wannabe pretending to be an America's Army game. BUT this is still a great game.

The AI on it, some of the training, and especially the special forces training section can help anyone improve their FPS game--regardless of what game you regularly play.

You go to the army to undergo a boring training and die a quick and painful death. When you see this as just a game that happens to be produced by the US Army it does not really work as well. While clearly the focus is realism, the game is hardly playable. The maps have far too large walking distances. Graphics looked great, but FPS dropped a lot on mid-range hardware of that time. Objectives were not really clear so it boils down to deathmatch. Actually people amassed on the servers playing the smallest and simplistic map available (some kind of bridge) and it became a slow paced sniper challenge with a very long time to respawn.

After meps you wil than get shipped off to basic training (where the game takes place) The game is literally a blast and its pretty accruate on the test that happens during basic. Found it really cool that you have to pay attention to your teacher in order to get the correct answers on your test. This is what i called a realistic simulation of basic. Online mode is pretty well done and many people still play the game!","February 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","23","42","3","1"

It is a team based FPS, like a cross between Battlefield 2 and Counter-Strike. You play either as the US Army or as the Opposing Force who are generic baddies. The teams battle for various objectives on a variety of maps with an array of real and fictional weapons - the fictional weapons are used only by the Opposing Force.\nThe heart of the game are the team-based multiplayer battles. There is no free-for-all deathmatch; everything you do is geared toward the idea of working as a squad of US Army soldiers.\nThere are plenty of problems, such as glitchy animations and weapons bugs. Also the graphics could look better, therefore that it uses the Unreal Engine 3.\nAmerica's Army 3 can be really good if you have a good connection to the server and if you can find other motivated and cooperative players.

You're going to die A LOT at the start, and probably for quite awhile until you get used to how the game plays.

While the straights sit out side getting frostbite unable to go to jag. Where it is well known women get the best jobs and advancements due to laziness. Do not lift anything. Can not keep up.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.","May 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","50","8","16","9","0"

The purpose of this game is to be a recruiting tool for the US military.  It looks like they took a 90s shooter, strapped on some clunky graphics, gave it a confusing heads up display, and never bothered to work out any bugs with the launcher they have.  I was excited to play at first.  It seemed like a game that could potentially describe a military experience.\n\nWhat I experienced was a "Boot Camp" where I had to read what was being done to my character.  Then when I tried to actually do the missions, it wouldn't let me.  I restarted, and I was able to join the boot camp mission before I crashed.  So I decided to skip boot camp and go onto the missions.  I would spawn, and die a few seconds later.  Sometimes I would die and it wouldn't say why.  I was part of a team completing an objective.  But to what this objective was?  No idea.  And when I asked for help, some dude with a name such as "Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx" would tell me to go back to boot camp.\n\n"Sorry, I tried boot camp, but it either wouldn't let me do it, or would crash out of it."\n\nBut what else can I expect from a recruitment tool?  I can assure you that this game would in no way attract me to the US military, unless I thought "Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx" was a good screename to have.","December 28, 2013","false","0.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

If you're a fan of COD (I happen to like COD, Battlefield, and CS), you'll find that the gameplay style here is significantly different.  Yes, there are some players that like to run and gun, but for the most part, this is a game that requires you to move slower and have more patience.  Having a mic for this game is a must, if you want to get the most out of it.\n\nIn AA3, there are no respawns.  You have an objective, which, depending on the game mode, could involve securing points, grabbing a suitcase and bringing it to a point, or escorting a VIP to an extraction point.\n\nAA3 also feels very different than Proving Grounds.  Much more teamwork in this game, far fewer players running around solo and dying in 15 seconds.\n\nPros:\n- It's free.\n- It's team-oriented.  Regular players use VOIP to call out enemy locations, so a team with mics will annilihate a team without them.\n- There is a pretty cool medic system.  Getting shot affects your movement differently if it's in your arm vs in your leg.  You can treat injured teammates, but have to apply the correct treatment.  (Sadly, there are only 4 possible treatments, so ultimately you just have to memorize those 4).\n- If you're not good at twitch shooters and like something more tactical, this is for you.\n\nCons:\n- There are bugs.  You must learn to live with them.\n- There is lag at times, but it's tolerable.  Don't like it?  Try another server.\n- There are essentially only 3 weapons (M4, M16, M249), but you can vary them a bit with different scopes/ammos/loadouts.  They also function differently if you pick them up off a dead enemy.\n- The community is small.  I'd guess there are only a few hundred active players.  Servers tend to fill up between 9pm and 1am EST.\n\nGive it a try... it takes a little time to learn and get good at.  It's free, so why not?","April 7, 2015","true","827.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Clunky, boring, awkward, and ugly. nothing about this game is smooth or intuitive. The UI is horrid, the graphics in-game are barely a step up from games released 8-10 years ago. (BF2 modern combat looked almost as good but was 100 times more fun to play.)\n\nThe AI is absolutely laughable, unable to hit the broadside of a barn from 5 yards away. Of course your Ai buddies are great shots, go go super USA...\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing against the USA or their armed forces, but this game is a wreck. I cannot belive it still is updated and played honestly, but then again, there are thousands of Roblox players still I guess... No accounting for people playing God-awful games.\n\nThe worst part is I think it had potential! Some of the elements are cool, the medic system, while clunky and awkward, is a cool concept. I like the different ways you can interact with your soldiers and such. The whole idea of you being just another soldier in the field is fun, but the execution of this title is incredibly poor.\n\nFix the graphics, redo all the UI elements, make the gameplay much smoother and more intuitive, etc etc... I tried this game years ago and it was unplayable.

It took restarting a few times for it to work) and did ok with that.\nMy large gripe with this game is that it's hard to connect to a multiplayer server which is the point of this game. It's a multiplayer game.\nLoading the game and going to multiplayer doesn't find a single server through steam. To attempt to connect to one, you have to quit the game completely, closing all open AA3 windows and go to Steam>View>Servers and try to connect to one through there.

It  made itself cool in a unique way because it takes a realistic aprouch and puts you in the shoes of a U.S Army soilder and takes you through trainning. I like it because it teaches people very important skills like First Aid, Gun Safety, and other skills that can be used i a life or death situation. Now I was in Boy Scouts so some of the skills I learned I learned again in this game, but that does not mean I didn't enjoy it.\n\nSo in conclusion i HIGHLY recomend people who are looking for a ARMY simulator and urge them to play this one and NOT A point and shoot, no scoping, killing for fun COD game.","November 23, 2014","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You see your teammates as USMC soldiers and your enemies as Nocza Militarni zo ta Ekspedi (NME) - fictional military organization. Your enemies see themselves as USMC and they see you with your team as NME. This is a pure American propaganda and I don't like it, but I guess it's called "America's" Army for a reason. But you should be able to play as NME too!\nSmall maps. The only map with a decent size is the "Ranch" map, but it's small too, just kinda bigger than the other maps. Bigger maps are what this game needs, especially for the VIP operations.\nDumb movement.

However what I got in return was disappointment and sadness, however I still enjoy it here and there.\n\nThis game has more bugs than a European bed, from graphical errors, to random crashes, the bugs actually cause player deterrance. Aside from all the issues, the multiplayer [concept] is still decent, and the training is fantastic. The new methods of reviving teammates is a lot more realistically immersive but still isn't a good enough reason to keep playing this game for most people. However, I will keep playing.\n\nHopefully they'll fix it up in the next year or so, til then, heed my warnings. It's buggy as hell, but still provides some of the same old AA fun from the past.","July 30, 2011","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However what I got in return was disappointment and sadness, however I still enjoy it here and there.\n\nThis game has more bugs than a European bed, from graphical errors, to random crashes, the bugs actually cause player deterrance. Aside from all the issues, the multiplayer [concept] is still decent, and the training is fantastic. The new methods of reviving teammates is a lot more realistically immersive but still isn't a good enough reason to keep playing this game for most people. However, I will keep playing.\n\nHopefully they'll fix it up in the next year or so, til then, heed my warnings. It's buggy as hell, but still provides some of the same old AA fun from the past.","July 30, 2011","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It uniquely simulates weapon malfunctions and offers a more detailed medical treatment system than other (unmodded) games, requiring certain treatments for certain injuries. Its default control layout is my favorite.\n\nAA3 is a net downgrade from AA2. Its training missions don't cover as many skills and tasks, its weapons selection is more limited (exclusively to M16 variants and the M249), It has no vehicles, no breeching, and no jumping. The weapons will occasionaly glitch out and become inoperable (not refering to the simulated malfunctions, but a game defect that hasn't been and likely won't ever be resolved).\n\nIn its favor, AI has been added as an optional opposing force.\n\nMy favorite AA remains AA2, and I recommend it over AA3 and AAPG.\nhttp://aao25.com/\n\nUltimately, all AA titles are inferior to Real Virtuality engine titles like VBS / ARMA / OFP , which militaries and more serious gaming communities use.

If anything go play Call of Duty or Combat Arms. It's just about the same thing, and at least there you won't be forced to watch propaganda videos that want to indoctrinate you and force feed you crap.
