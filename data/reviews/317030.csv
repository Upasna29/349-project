"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fencessystem/recommended/317030/","fencessystem","at least six gay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fencessystem/","357 products in account","I bought the Humongous Entertainment Complete Pack during Steam Winter Sales last year when I saw it was compatible with current Operating Systems including Mac and I was absolutely thrilled. At the time this wasn't included in the pack, which made me sad because I had very fond memories of playing this game as a kid. Thinking back on my childhood, it's probably my 3rd favorite HE game, falling short only to SPY Fox in: Dry Cereal and Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening. When I saw this game had been added to the pack and I had it because I had the pack (or maybe it had just been made Mac compatible, regardless, I saw I could download it) I was absolutely thrilled because I had just been lamenting over not having this game.\n\nWhile I don't think this would be a particularly interesting game for most adults, there's massive nostalgia value for me and playing it now threw me back to when I played it as a kid. I had a ton of fun and it was like a trip back to my childhood!\n\nI would definitely recommend it if you either A. played it as a child and have fond memories or B. have young children and want games for them. Actually if you have children and can afford it, I'd reccommend buying the entire Humongous Entertainment pack as there's hours and hours of entertainment value in there in pretty simple games originally made for kids to play!\n\nIt takes me about 45 minutes now as an adult to get through most Humongous Entertainment games I played for hours as a kid, but as a kid it took me a lot longer, I remember getting very immersed and they had a lot of replay value! I would absolutely recommend this game and virtually any other game from Humongous Entertainment along these lines for anyone with younger kids.\n\n(They're not boring as an adult either, in my opinion, if you want to sit with your kid and help them play or play with them!)","June 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

He never received any sequals excluding one spin-off game made afterwards. The game focuses on a toy bear named Fatty who is a cross between Winnie the Pooh and Teddy Ruxpin voiced by Scott Burns(Bowser from the Mario Bros. games) who prepares a birthday surprise for his owner Kayla along with the help of other toys to set up decorations and a cake. The game isn't as exciting as the other Humongous Games, but it was highly playable so I won't be too hard on it. I couldn't imagine there being more games on Fatty Bear, cause he's not a cool and suave hero like Spy Fox, not a mystery solving fish like Freddi Fish, not an imaginative kid like Pajama Sam. He's just a kind hearted toy bear who resembles other toy bears you would see in other medias. Though the game is worth introducing to your kids, but just don't expect it to be an ultra classic is all.","December 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know).

Spent 35 minutes wandering Fatty Bear's ♥♥♥♥house for a way to escape but no no avail. Would not recommend you play on a Mac, especially if you're unfamiliar with them like I am.","February 27","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a bit too simple for me & was lacking in plot compared to the other Humongous Games I've played. The voice of Fatty started getting on my nerves a bit and didn't fit well to the character. I'm aware I am not the target audience anymore but I like all their other games. However, this was the first game the company made so prehaps it just hasn't aged well. It was interesting to see all the details in the game eg, a mini game, personalised elements & being able to click on a bunch of backdrop that Humongous  would go on to encorporate into their later work. It's worth playing to get a sense of how far the company progress since their first release. I recommend buying this in the complete set of Humongous games, when it's on sale. Rather than as a stand alone purchase. Sorry if this angers the Fatty Bear Fandom!","January 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","2"
