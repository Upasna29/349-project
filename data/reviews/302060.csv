"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carrythxd/recommended/302060/","carrythxd","Carrythxd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carrythxd/","783 products in account","A game made by SCS Software back in 2011.\n\nSome of the tasks in the game are really easy but some of them are a lot harder which is a good thing, there's no free roam atleast I didn't find it if it was there but I don't mind at all, the game is about completing tasks in various scenerios and I think it does exactly that!\n\nIf you've played Euro Truck Simulator (ETS 1) the truck's handling and the enviroment's might be familiar to you which might help/might not help, atleast I found a lot of familar places while playing this game.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game. At the moment it's 7,99€ (on sale) but the actual price is only 9,99€ which isn't that bad so if you like trucking simulator's you should atleast give this one a try! :)\n\nAlso in the game, there's 50 Tasks + 7 Basic Trucking Tasks (learning the basic vehicle manoeuvres) and 6 Bonus Trucking Tasks and there's also ingame achievements (Note: Ingame not Steam achievements). A total of 36 achievements.\nThere's also 13 different truck models to choose from and a bunch of color choices!\n\nEDIT: SCS Software added some achievements to this game some time ago and if you have completed some of the achievements when the game didn't have Steam achievements, you will automatically unlock them.\nAlso, after fully completing the game, including the Bonus Tasks, I can just say that it's an extremely hard game to complete, especially the last few missions.","June 4, 2014","true","16.7"," 92 of 109 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","92","109","0","3"

Being able to maintain control while negotiating corners and avoiding obstacles is what takes skill. Doing that in reverse with  massive trailer on and still beating the clock is a real challenge.\nThe game is basically Euro Truck but confined to warehouses and frieghtyards etc. There are a few obstacle courses on roads, but there is no highway cruising here. It all about parking trailers. The tasks start out simple enough but soon get pretty challenging. On Pro mode the constraints on accuracy get a little too tight on some challeneges causing some serious frustration, but ultimately all are doable.\nThe different camera options and angles are a bit limited and sometimes it gets pretty hard to see what you are doing. Mouse look is available but awkward to use since you are on a time limit and usually dont have a third hand to be able to make use of it. Pro mode becomes even harder as you can only use driver views and the mouse, which means you will need to be an expert and using your mirrors.\nOverall this game is a great test of driving skill, coordination and situational awareness. A good buy for any true driving enthusiast.","August 10, 2014","true","39.6"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","56","67","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LPDriftKing/recommended/302060/","LPDriftKing","Drift King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LPDriftKing/","110 products in account","This is a great game for any Euro Truck Simulator (ETS) fans.  While ETS focuses on endurance driving and the freedom of trucking, Trucks and Trailers (T&T) focuses on the technical side of things.\n\nT&T is basically a collection of complicated trucking scenarios which are organized as mini-games.  It is very similar to Scania Truck Driving Simulator.  Challenges range from parking in small confines, navigating through tight corners, and mastering brake control.  The goal is to complete the task without causing damage to your vehicle.  This can be a lot of fun for truck enthusiasts, and there is little doubt that one’s trucking skills will improve.\n\nDifficultySCS decided to award Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals based on completion time.  A good driver should have no problems achieving the Silver medal for most challenges, but the Gold times require slightly rushed maneuvers that should never be attempted in real life.  Achieving Gold often requires many attempts, even for the best drivers.  It adds a nice challenge, but in real life, parking isn’t supposed to be a rushed process.\n\nReplay ValueDon’t expect much replay value on this game - unless you want to repeat the challenges over and over.  Despite this, the challenges will take you a fair amount of time (I am still working through them).  If you can get this on sale for less than 5.00 USD, it’s a fun little game to have.  A steering wheel or controller is recommended, but the default K&M controls are more than sufficient.\n\nGraphicsExpect this game’s graphics to be somewhere between ETS1 and ETS2.  It looks quite nice, and most low to medium spec PCs should have no problems running this.  You’ll probably get a higher FPS on this game compared to ETS2.\n\nFor the features it has, and its price point, this is a great game.","October 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

Trucks and trailers is seemingly a parking simulator through and through. You drive your semi for about 10 seconds before having to park it in various places with completely unrealistic parking hazards to avoid. That being said the game controls relatively well for being a small simulator game and looks half decent except for all the people of this world being struck with play-doh fever and being struck with rigormortis at the same time. Anyway getting off topic. The game is centered around parking and how well you can do it. And with decent controls it's a good timewaster but certainly not a full fledged game. Even though it is well done I don't believe there to be enough variety in the gameplay to illicit the 7 dollar pricetag. But that being said if you can nab it up for a dollar feel free to do so and have a laugh with your friends about another dumb truck game that could've easily been released as a small iOs title for the app store. Overall gameplay wise it leaves alot to be desired but is fun for a short period of time. 6/10 Decent title.

Sure, there's no campaign, just a bunch of challenges, but it's fun, diverting and surprisingly engaging. It's also very satisfying; there were times I was absolutely sure I couldn't achieve what they were looking for, but with some lateral thinking, lots of shifting and a bit of "crap, turned the wheel the wrong way" I was able to complete the task and it's really rewarding.

I really like parking and precise maneuvering challenges, but timing for Gold is beyong ridiculous in most tasks. If you want to get Gold, you have to be reckless. No pro driver will drive in such a manner on public roads or parking lots. Time for Silver is more or less reasonable. This game can still be enjoyed if you aim at getting at least Silver. It is fairly easy to get Bronze because you need just to complete the task without crash to get it, regardless time.

When i purchased this i assumed it was an expansion or something of that sort for ETS2 seeing that it was in the bundle but nope.\n\nWhat this game is, it's little bits and pieces cut out of the map from ETS2 and you get to play them as challenges.\n\nFor example, a parking lot is taken from ETS2 and the challenge is to park the truck in the spot in x seconds.  Thats it.  Thats all the game is.  Just little bits and pieces cut up from the map and each piece is a different challenge.","December 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","5","13","2","1"

This game is quite literally a truck-parking game where you're to move your truck and park it without hitting anything within a short time. You get graded on each level given how fast you can park your truck successfully; Gold if you can do it perfectly and fast enough to make a TAS-bot look impressed, Silver if you're a very experienced truck driver, and Bronze if you managed to do it safely without hitting anything. The instant you hit an obstacle, you won't get a medal for completion, but you will still get a mark saying you completed the level.\n\nOne thing that stands out to me in this game is the replay feature. The game will save a replay of your successful times so you can watch them later. I utilized this to make  this 1 minute video,  which I feel is good for demonstrating how the game plays.\n\nAll in all, I would say that this game is for people who either want to better their truck parking skills, trailer-backing skills, want to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 without open roads, or a combination thereof. I personally enjoy it, as it focuses more on the technical aspects of parking your truck where Euro Truck Simulator focuses more on the long open-road driving.","February 6","true","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game was true SCS, back before ETS and ATS. The game has terrible controls, same graphics engine as their followup games (honestly? unfortunately so.) However, this game serves as an example how SCS has grown. From a "Small company" to a "Small company with over 60 employees". This is the best they could do back then, and they poured their hearts into it--and that is commendable, but somewhere along the line they decided to bring their current games' development to a crawl and charge as much money as they can on every little DLC from rims to paint jobs to a god damned trio of bobbleheads for your dashboard (ETS2). If you get this game for free as part of a bundle or something, consider donating to a child in Africa, as I'm sure they'd be more than happy with this pathetic excuse of a game.\n\nThis review provoked by Timmy The Thief, a developer who is "too lazy" to go through complaints, so he just bans anybody who has something to say other than "YOU ROCK SCS".
