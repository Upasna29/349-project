The low price of this game makes it worth the investment if you want to experience what strategy gaming was like circa 1992.  That's not a bad thing, mind you.  Arcan Sorcery doesn't try to hide what it is: a very simple, low cost game that brings back the early spirit of 4X computer games.","September 20, 2015","true","32.2"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

It's not as deep or pollished as TW or MoM but for 7 bucks it's a nice Turn-based strategy game that plays like a board game. 7/10","September 18, 2015","true","34.1"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

I can deal with the amateur UI and unoriginality, but what kills it is how slow it plods along. I know it's not meant to be RTS-fast, but the lack of strategic options makes each step feel that much longer. So, avoid the large map if you value your time. Especially since the early game is pretty much the same as the late game.","February 4","false","11.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

It is well worth the price I think. The AI is enough of a challenge so far, The economy side of things is very simple - build in each of the lands you take to generate revenue and the more noble houses you have the bigger you can make your army, the army does cost to run and the need to also ensure a province you take is protected from internal unrest means that one cannot just galavant across teh map taking lands with just a few units at the start.\n\nI havent finished a game yet but am curious to see how it goes - i am wondering if it gets to a point that once one has more than half the lands that their revenue and armies is so high that they can just roll over everything else quite easily, or is there some other challenge awaitng the player?","February 18","true","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I enjoy this game the kinda strategy game ya play it beat it ...and it on harder play it beat it and just kick back and let the strategy of the game tickle your mind.  I like the mix of spells also....i thew a big spell at another guys state ....to bad for him.  Any most of all you can build up your provinces and build different units and manage then either to quickly be ready for battle or to take time to build up get rich and dominate the map.","September 15, 2015","true","2.6"," 17 of 39 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","17","39","3","0"
