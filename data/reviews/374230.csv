Every move consumes energy, which if run out of causes the robot to die. The free robot can find a release switch for his twin to escape, at which point he can collect battery energy from the path (by induction i suppose), and join and assist his twin in escape.\n\nThe puzzles start off easy, and progressively more complicated, and the last level was worth playing to ... enjoyable fun and entertaining. Go buy it.","August 11, 2015","true","10.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The gameplay itself is very simple, but the level design becomes more challenging (naturally) as the game progresses - that, combined with the energy management aspect, adds another level thinking to completing each puzzle.\n\nI haven't played much yet, so I can't say how much more complex the game becomes, but so far it has been pretty simple; as such, I'd like if it were a bit more dynamic and challenging, but again, that may yet become the case as the challenges progress throughout each level.\n\nI made a first impressions video for my YouTube channel, check it out if you want a sample of gameplay to help you make your decision! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsPCgXT4mkE","August 7, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I may update review once i have tried a father and son cooperative game.","September 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

LIke the beginning of a good idea.  It's also clear that this was an Ouya/Android port which is never a good thing.","August 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","0"

Maybe it's fun with two players but it's a pretty boring one player game.  Kindof reminded me of Lost VIkings, but with less personality.","August 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","2","13","2","0"
