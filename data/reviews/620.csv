"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedubmark/recommended/620/","thedubmark","THeDuBMaRK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedubmark/","51 products in account","I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them.\n-------------------------------\nIntro\nYou know how when you are on vacation and say, "I am so glad it isn't winter right now."? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.\n-------------------------------\nSummary:\nThis game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programed-to-be "idiot" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.\n-------------------------------\nMulti-Player\nThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities.\n-------------------------------\nOther important things\nThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.\n\nTo dumb it down:\n-------------------------------\nPros\n+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay.\n+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.\n+Well-designed maps and challenges.\n+Unlimited maps (user-created).\n+Fantastic story-line.\n+Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).\n+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.\n+Gender neutral.\n++Helps with cognitive brain activity.\n-------------------------------\nCons\n-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).\n-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here to me.)\n-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)\n-Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)\n-------------------------------\nMy opinionated review\nI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.\n-------------------------------\nRating\nOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing "Portal transportation" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a 97/100 after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.\n-------------------------------\nFinally\nThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!\n~thedubmark\n(I write reviews now)","February 22, 2015","true","26.3"," 357 of 375 people (95%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","95","357","375","55","39"

That‚Äôs why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.\n\nSTILL ALIVE?\n\nThe game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.\n\nONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER\n\nOne of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.\n\nENDLESS TESTS\n\nIn game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.\n\nMultiplayer:\nOnline: Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò Œò\nCo-op:    ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫O\nStoryline:   ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫O\nGraphics:   ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫O\nGameplay: ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫\n\n\n\nComplexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.\n\nVALVe made another good\ngame. With good intelligent humor,\ncharismatic characters and unusual\ninteresting gameplay.\n\nAs expected, nine out of ten [9/10].","June 19, 2014","true","41.4"," 376 of 408 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","376","408","0","8"

The tests are as mind bending as ever, and they've added new elements, like light bridges and emancipation gates.

I had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game.\n\nMy concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game. I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint. The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge. Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game. Your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game, though he can be a bit heavy handed at times.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first game, you will love the sequel, both for its expanded challenges, and its unique personality.

Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.\nThe gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.\nOne of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.\nCo-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.\nI highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.\nOverall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","July 16, 2013","true","38.4"," 242 of 275 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","242","275","0","0"

Somehow, in some strange alternate dimension to the rest of the game development world, not only did Valve deliver a highly polished sequel but they enhanced the concept in every single way (much like what Valve did with Half-Life 2 that many thought could not possibly match the brilliance of the original Half-Life).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338449536\nPortal 2 rightfully won stacks of Game of the Year accolades in 2011 including the BAFTA for Best Game. No mean feat by any standards except for the good ol' folk at Valve. Once again the mute Chell returns with the evil super computer GLaDOS and her cynical jibes that illicit more than just a few belly-laughs this time around (potato anyone?) as she continues to push Chell through increasingly more difficult tests that seem alarmingly designed to kill and mame. Chell has some help this time around in the form of another Robot named Wheatley who is brilliantly voiced by actor Stephen Merchant with absolute perfect comedic timing and the stage is set for yet another showdown...or is it? With a script that is as sharp as a tack and containing a level of comedy often associated with a Pixar film, Portal 2 more than rises to the challenge. Once again the puzzles or tests included start off deceptively easy before reaching a level of head-scratching confoundment towards the end. There is enough content here to give the old grey matter a good workout.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338450327\nHowever, its not in the single player that the game really shines as one would have expected (although it is fantastic in its own right) - the real meat of the package and the reason everyone should own this title is simply for its amazing co-op. This is without a doubt one of the most ingenious and side-splitting funny co-op implementations yet and still remains to be beaten. Giving each player a robot with portal guns of their own (P-BODY and ATLAS are just the two cutest robots imagineable), both players must help the other navigate the various test chambers GLaDOS has assembled. Working your way towards a solution often results in hilarious mishaps with incredibly funny running commentary from from the sidelines thanks to GLaDOS. It's an absolute winner! With added Steam Workshop support and thousands of user generated content and maps you have a title that could live on and on forever since apparently Valve are very adverse to the number 3 in numeric's.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=338450925\nWhile many doubted a full game could be fleshed out of the original Portal concept not only did Valve deliver on that promise it also delivered one of the finest games of this generation. If you haven't played this yet...what on earth are you possibly waiting for!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 26, 2013","true","26.6"," 318 of 387 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","318","387","0","0"

Certainly.\nOne of the best games available on Steam? Most definitely.\n\nThis game requires you to think out-of-the-box, and will have you solving puzzles constantly.\nThe dark humour in this game is hilarious aswell, and that only adds to the great experience.\nThe singleplayer is great, but solving puzzles with a friend is possibly even greater, and allows for much more complex contraptions. Even after you finish the story, you can download heaps of custom-made community maps, which allows for tons of extra hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/620/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Portal 2 is the follow on to the extremely successful first person original. The game retains all of the game play elements from Portal 1 and adds lots of new features such as bridges made from light beams, and splashing paint gel which accelerate your speed or make you jump higher.\n\nIn the single player campaign, you play as Chell. As with the original Portal, your character can take a small amount of damage before they die, thankfully like the original you don't take fall damage still.  The aim of the story mode is to explorer the Aperture Science Lab, which is filled of complex puzzles that have a clear exit point, but there are also other parts of the game which are not so clear leaving the objects less clear.\n\nThe tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the game play elements very well and gets you well prepared for the on coming puzzles; and whenever there is a new element introduced, the game does a very good job of making you aware what it does without shoving a tutorial screen in your face every time.\n\nPortal 2 is powered by the Source engine, like all of Valve's more recent releases (Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead, TF2), and it looks stunning. You will find it hard nowadays to find a game that looks as well polished as Portal 2, all of the colours, textures and visual effects are done perfectly.\n\nStory-wise is the feature in Portal 1 that I thought it fell down on, however in Portal 2 they knocked it out of the park. It follows on from the story line set in the original and goes beyond the level of detail and complexity that you would expect. I needed to find out how it ended once I started playing, and the ending is just beautifully crafted.\n\nThe difficulty is like most puzzle games, if you are good at them, it will just come naturally. It definitely has a better difficulty curve when compared to the original, but even still at times I had to revert to a walkthrough to pass through some puzzles (shame on me eh?) but there is nothing here that can't be solved if you sit and think for a couple of minutes each time.\n\nThe single player story mode took me about seven hours to complete, this to me is a perfect length for a game of this type, the game ends at a high point and I was 100% satisfied with the outcome. There is also a co-op campaign included which will also add a good number of hours. On top of both of these, we also have Steam Workshop support, meaning endless hours of mods and different chambers to try and master. I have yet to try any out yet but some of the maps and rooms I have seen on the workshop page just look amazing. I wouldn't be surprised to see people being able to get fifty plus hours in this game.\n\nIn conclusion, Portal 2 is a must play for any gamer out there. It is an absolute classic that should certainly be in your library. It goes on Sale every few months so most people will already have it, but you need to play it.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/recommended/620/","thordred","Thordred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/","2085 products in account","Portal 2 takes elements of adventure, puzzle, platform and first-person action games and blends them into a unique genre mix. It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?\n\nOnce again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.\n\nPortal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.\n\nIf you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.\n\nBut it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.\n\nWhen you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.\n\nLong story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. A game for the books.","December 6, 2013","true","49.1"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","57","59","0","2"

My 6 year old tells me one afternoon.  "Um, sure, okay" I say.  The idea never enters my mind that he is talking about a video game.  A few days later, I notice something while he is playing Scribblenauts.  Right there in his inventory of scribbly things is a portal gun.\n\nTHE PORTAL GUN.\n\n"OHHHH!" I say.  Now it hits me.  Where on earth did he see that?  I must be a terrible parent.  Okay.  "Daddy can play for you" , I say with a gleam in my eye.  We proceed to install Portal 1. Right when I start the game, he grabs the keyboard and takes over.  Before I know it, he's blazing right through the levels.  Then, he says, "Let's play Portal 2!"\n\n"Portal 2?"\n\n"YES! I want to play Portal 2!"   Well.  I actually do own Portal 2, so fair enough.  It's been on my backlog for too long.  We proceed to install Portal 2.  And on to the beginning...it's as if we are transported to a movie.  He's a little scared.  I ask him if he wants to stop it's okay - it may be too scary.  He squirms around, but as soon as the puzzles start he is ALL OVER IT.  Wow, this little guy really knows how to play.  Physics in a hole - WHATEVER - a 6 year old is blazing through this.  He gets stuck on level 15.  I GET STUCK ON LEVEL 15 TOO.  This puzzle is wrecking my brain, but then I realize I simply did not notice something.  Solved and on to the next.  The both of us play through the game off and on for a few months, he turns 7, and we put in a good chunk of puzzle solving together along with a fair amount of co-op play.  I even bought a controller adapter for a PS controller so we could play side by side.  A week ago we both finished it ( on the really scary parts I let him leave the room ).  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun completing a game with a partner.  My own little guy.  Thanks Valve for making a great game that is a also a wonderful father-son game to play together.  He proudly wears an Aperture Laboratories t-shirt now.\n","August 18, 2014","true","38.7"," 54 of 55 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","54","55","6","4"

I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^\n\nYou play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:)\n\nStory is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.\n\nThe Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD\n\nGameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went "Ohhhhh, now I get it" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)\n\nOverall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more. That feeling you get after solving a test chamber is quite awesome ^_^ and doing it again, but faster, feels even more rewarding. Although I have problems launching the game (It just might be my Steam client) the game itself runs incredibly smooth. I give this game two-thumbs up ;)","December 18, 2013","true","10.5"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","47","51","0","3"

Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments. ‚Äì GLaDOS\n\nThere is so much to be impressed about in Portal 2. From the amazingly developed and memorable characters to the brilliantly balanced puzzles, Portal 2 may well be the best puzzle game ever created.\n\nI purchased Portal 2 about 11 months after it was released. I didn‚Äôt even know who Valve was back then, I didn‚Äôt know what Source was and I didn‚Äôt have a clue about anything to do with the Portal story, but after playing it, Valve quickly became my favourite game making company. Back then, I was only interested in 2 things. Gameplay, and graphics. We had only recently upgraded to an Xbox 360 from a very old, original PlayStation, so the games I‚Äôd bought for the Xbox were, as you can imagine, amazing, but Portal 2 had 2x better graphics than any other game I‚Äôd been playing. I was also interested in the gameplay, and Portal 2 nailed it with its hilarious characters and difficult puzzles. As I grew up and played the game over and over again, I noticed things I hadn‚Äôt noticed before, like secret rooms and signs on the walls, which got me into researching the story. Trust me, the story is deep‚Ä¶ but, this review is spoiler free, so I‚Äôd encourage you to do it yourself! Now, the main review!\n\nPortal 2 is a brilliant combination of puzzles, well developed characters, and an RPG element, which makes the game amazing, and better than any other puzzle game I‚Äôve played before. To start off with, you wake up in a strange room, and you meet a funny little ‚Äúball‚Äù robot named Wheatly. He guides you over to the old testing tracks, but on your way to escape the facility, he accidently turns on the main core robot, who controls everything, GLaDOS! She ‚Äúforgives‚Äù you (play the oringinal portal) and instead of killing you, she spares your life and instead makes you test, as she indicates ‚Äúfor the rest of your life‚Äù. I‚Äôm not going to say any more, because it would be a shame to spoil it for anyone, but I highly recommend you play this game. This is one of the few games I would say to buy at full price if you have enough, because it‚Äôs totally worth it, and the Co-op campaign has a completely different story to it.

The original stands as one of the cleverest and most revered games ever made and so the pressure is on for the return visit to Aperture Laboratories.\n\nAs before, you play a human lab rat subjected to the experimental challenges dreamt up by the evil computer GLaDOS. The goal is to exit ever more puzzling rooms with the aid of a Portal Gun that lets you shoot up to two virtual doorways onto walls coated with a special substance. Once you've got two portals in place you can walk through one and come out of the other.\n\nInitially the challenges thrown at you are straightforward: zap one portal onto the wall next to you, put the other onto the wall next to the inaccessible exit and then simply walk through the portal. But after a few gentle introductory tests to familiarise you with the concept, Portal 2 starts presenting you with brain-aching challenge after brain-aching challenge.\n\nYou might need to open an exit by placing a block on a pressure pad, but the block is located on an inaccessible ledge high above you with no obvious route up. To reach it might involve using portals to reach a high walkway before firing a portal into the floor below and the other into the wall opposite the ledge with the block, so that when you jump down into the portal on the floor you are sent flying out of the other portal and onto the ledge with the block.\n\nAnd soon the complexity is cranked up with the addition of other elements to the puzzles such as tractor beams, gels that alter the properties of surfaces and bridges made out of light.\n\nLike many puzzle games the description often sounds more intimidating than the reality, but Portal 2's environmental conundrums are truly challenging: requiring lateral thinking and dissolving notions of up, down, left, right, forward and back. But while the challenges can be bewildering, the sense of achievement you get from solving a challenge that had you stumped is immense with confusion melting away into a thrilling Eureka! moment.\n\nPortal 2's fiendish puzzles would make a great game on their own, but the game doesn't compromise on setting either, moulding a captivating story out of its puzzling action. The script and voice acting is nothing short of fantastic: the acidic wit of superb*tch GLaDOS balanced by the bumbling Bristolian tones of Stephen Merchant, who plays an equally amusing rival AI.\n\nBeyond the single-player mode there's a set of co-operative two-player challenges that can be played in split screen or online. The two-player challenges are even tougher than the single player so the need to discuss with each other how to tackle each puzzle is paramount. While this means it works best when players are in the same room, Valve have done a sterling job of providing players with tools to indicate their ideas to other players so that the online mode works almost as well.\n\nThe only possible criticism you could level at the game is that once a room is solved, there's little reason to go back. But when a game delivers as many moments of joy and satisfaction as Portal 2, you'll need to be a rather sour soul to make such a charge.\n\nIngenious, engrossing puzzler and a worthy sequel to one of the greatest games ever!","March 2","true","43.4"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

You are about to purchase one of the most the best games that has, and probably will be made. Yes, the game is that good. Why, you ask? Well;\n\nThe story is well written and feels solid.  The pacing is perfect and manages to balance that fine line between delivering a consistently pleasing experience to you as the player but without leaving you feeling pressured or overloaded. The puzzles are challenging, but not mind-numbingly so; you will likely not be destroying your expensive hardware out of frustration at least.  The graphics are quite good and even though the game will be turning four years a few month's from now, Portal 2 is testament that Valve's source engine (which itself is growing quite long in the tooth) is still a force to be reckoned with. The sound design in this game, from the AI's comments to the  environmental sounds manage to create an atmosphere that feels truly amazing.\n\nAnd Finally, what makes Portal 2... 'PORTAL 2!'  the enigma known  as GLaDOS. There really is nothing that could be said about this entity that hasn't been already; except for the simple fact that GLaDOS is a lot more human than AI. It's uncanny. And also, depending on how much you've heard/read about the game, creepy. And sad. Damn.\n\nThe only real downside to Portal 2 is that given Valve's history with the number 3, another masterpiece like this is unlikely to happen in the near future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/620/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The original Portal was a success I don't think anyone anticipated. Arguably the best part of The Orange Box, it was a remarkably clever and original puzzle game, with an absurd amount of character. But to everyone's disappointment, it was all over too soon. But we were not forsaken; quite the contrary. With Portal 2, a direct sequel (by which I mean to say you should play the original first, as well as before reading this review which will inevitably spoil it), Valve has not only given us a bigger and better game, but one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever. I mean no hyperbole when I say Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece on a grand scale, and a game absolutely everyone should get the chance to play!\n\nFair warning, there is no way to talk about Portal 2 without spoiling everything that occurs in the first game, so keep that in mind if you have yet to play it (by which I have to ask, why the heck not?). Disclaimers out of the way, Portal 2 once again places you inside Aperture Science, an expansive underground scientific research and testing facility with fewer ethics than living test subjects. Which is to say just you, Chell, reimprisoned and put to sleep for who knows how long, only awakened when the entire facility is on the verge absolute destruction. Unlike before however you aren't alone, now joined by a naive little robot named Wheatly. With GLaDOS in pieces, escape seems like a simple objective. That is until someone flips a switch to turn her back on...\n\nThe original Portal is still one of the best written, and most hilarious games I've played, and yet its sequel is miles ahead of it in every possible way. With only a handful of characters, it's amazing how charming and witty every line is. Hilarious, clever, and maybe even a little touching, I can't think of a game that even comes close to matching how perfectly timed and expertly written every moment of Portal 2 is. It's minimal cast does an amazing job of breathing life into the decrepit facility, and makes the simple aspect of walking from one door to the next and immensely enjoyable activity.\n\nAnd it isn't just the writing that deserves remark, but how Valve has implemented it to seamlessly interact with your actions. Characters respond to what you're doing in such a realistic manner that it's hard to believe they are simply programs setup to do so. With so many games relying on traditional, uninteresting storytelling mechanics, Portal 2 moves the medium forward in ways developers need to take note of.\n\nHowever smartly written the dialog may be, it's in the portal puzzles themselves that Valve's intelligence really shines. Not content to simply reiterate the same mechanic we saw in the first game, new elements such as propulsion gel and laser maneuvering cubes are added regularly and consistently expand on the basic portal mechanic in unexpected and interesting ways. Every time I thought I'd seen all the ways a mechanic could be used, Valve expanded the spectrum and again astounded my expectations with the outwardly simple variances in usage that never would have occurred to me. Even on my second playthrough the puzzles never stopped being incredibly rewarding to solve, and giving me just enough of a challenge to consistently test my intellect in a wholly unique fashion.\n\nFor how old the Source engine is at this point, you'd never know Portal 2 was built on it based on how it looks. To this day I am utterly astonished at what Valve manages to pull off with the engine, and this is easily its most impressive usage to date. The once sterile Aperture Science is now presented in a gorgeous display of disrepair. Walls crumbly around you, lights flicker and cast dazzlingly shadows, plants grow through into the facility, and it all looks absolutely amazing! Even with it's makeover, Aperture is still an eminently memorable and distinct place to inhabit, and the increased variety in locations does an impressive job of realizing the sheer size of the facility which we've only scratch the surface of.\n\nI always forget to mention the soundtrack, not because it isn't a fantastic accompaniment to your journey through Aperture, but because it blends so well with the rest of the game that I almost forget it's there. That's not a slight against it however, it's a complement to how suited it is for the game that I can't separate one from another. It's a brilliant score with so many layers I couldn't begin to pick it apart to describe it to you (but thankfully I don't need to, as even if for some reason you don't play the game the soundtrack is freely downloadable). As for the ending, well let's just say Jonathan Coulton is a genius and leave it at that.\n\nAnd then there is the coop mode; yet another brilliant way Valve has surprised me, turning the solitary campaign into a multiplayer experience that demands cooperation. This is what impresses me the most about the mode; it isn't just two players going through a game designed for one, but an entirely new set of levels purposely designed to force you to work with your partner to complete them. It's amazing what can be accomplished with two sets of portals, and this is fully taken advantage of in what are perhaps the best designed puzzles in the entire game. If you don't have a friend to play with, go make one for this game. It's something you shouldn't miss out on.\n\nI can't get over it. I've been impressed by Valve numerous times in the past, love Portal to death, and thought I knew what I was getting with it's successor. But Portal 2 is so much more than that. It's an incredible achievement in everything it attempts, from it's outstanding script to the bewildering puzzles and spectacular presentation. It's the best game Valve has ever made, one of my all time favorites, and without a doubt one of the medium's greatest accomplishments!\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, there's testing to do.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","April 25, 2014","true","14.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","6"

The puzzles are even more creative and there‚Äôs a much wider variety of environments to work your way through. And these environments are often quite breathtaking to behold, which is in itself impressive given the age of the Source engine. Graphically it‚Äôs huge, expansive, and immersive. And then there‚Äôs the writing of course. Valve have always been at the head of the pack when it comes to the quality of the writing behind their games and P2 is no exception. The script is sharp, dry, and delivered to perfection by the cast. To top it all there is  now the option to play community-created maps and coop games with others.

Really, it's a lot of fun and shouldn't be missed out either (if you have someone to play with). It was also one of the first games on Steam with Splitscreen support. Although it's made only for two players only, I'm pretty sure that it also would be funny with three or four people locally, when everyone's trying to figure a puzzle out together and the gamepads get handed around.\n\nLastly, there's the Workshop integration, and boy oh boy, are there a lot of puzzles. There are very complex ones with custom terrain and more simpler ones, created with the later released simpler editor, and there's an endless supply of new ones. I acctually recommend trying the simpler editor out yourself, just to see how hard it is to come up with puzzles.\n\nAnyways, this is a game that everyone should play, even if it's not your genre.

The story isn't short it's a great length story, with very mind blowing test chambers that take time to complete. Portal 2's single-player campaign returns to the labyrinthine Aperture Science facility, an underground complex lorded over by an insane A.I. named GLaDOS. The main character, Chell, is perhaps the only surviving human in the facility.\n\nMULTIPLAYER when you've completed the singleplayer campaign, you're not even halfway through the game, there are tons of levels yet to explore. together with a friend, you will face many new challenges requirering teamwork and good timing.\n\nDifficultyThe game's difficulty depends on your puzzle solving skills. There is no difficulty or hints, should you get stuck and not be able to proceed, then you will need to turn to the internet. I can understand how one would get stumped in this game, with some of the testing chambers being massive.\n\nControlsThe game uses your standard FPS WASD and mouse controls, but also supports a special razer controller, and Xbox gamepads.\n\nDesign & GraphicsThe game looks great, it runs well on any modern pc, and the specifications match the performance and graphical output. Really great Graphics for  year 2011.\n\nAudioThe game sounds great. the OST is nothing special, but it gets the job done in the game. All explosions and sound effects are fine. The voice acting in this game is also great, and the dialogue can be quite funny.\n\nWORKSHOP  Supportthanks to Portal 2's workshop support, everyone who owns the game can make levels very easily and upload them to the workshop for others to play. so if you like the concept of the game but already finished the story, you should definitely check out the workshop.\n\n\n---- PROS ----\nAmazing story.\nGreat Co-op campaign.\nSteam Workshop Support for a ton of maps.\nVery nice electronic soundtrack.\nConsistently clever and challenging puzzles.\nGreat graphics.\n\n---- CONS ----\nNone.\n\nScore Rating: 9.5/10","February 13","true","19.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

I am disappointed with the number of people who have complained because A) they think the game is to short and B) they bought DLC obviously selling 'trivial' content and C) they believe the visuals are poor.\n\nBefore I discuss those two points I want to say why I think this is game is incredible, firstly it succeeds in being a great sequel, it's added loads of new gameplay mechanics to freshen up the puzzles and gameplay and hasn't tainted the original essence of its predecessor. The production values are astounding there are huge set pieces, stunning effects and some of the best voice acting i've ever heard in a game from the cast, particularly Stephen Merchant for his excellent performance as the babbling Wheatley and Ellen McLain returns scary as ever as everyones favourite AI baddy GLADOS.\n\nNow to comment on the three main criticisms i've seen. The singleplayer took many hours for me to play (at least 7 hours) and I haven't even touched the cooperative mode either which is sure to take several hours as well. The day 1 dlc is quite obviously not meant to "extend play" and is instead meant for novelty, also you can buy all the dlc in a bundle for about a quarter of the price than if you bought each item separately (if you still bought it and feel cheated then your too stupid to be playing this game). Finally, while the source engine is indeed quite old, even on my PC the game certainly looked impressive and those of you with more powerful computers and the people who will buy the console versions will enjoy the game looking even better.\n\nIn conclusion, Portal 2 is a must buy, a certain contender for game of the year, the game is smart, clever, well designed and a joy to play and I highly recommend picking it up but please if you haven't already please play the first game because it makes the experience that much better.\n\nP.S. The ending is a great one, I can't believe some people didn't like it, It will leave you wanting more is all i'm going to say","February 27, 2014","true","12.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/620/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A wonderfully-crafted sequel to an already original FPS game! This is, in a nutshell, Portal 2.\n\nReleased 4 years after its predecessor Portal 2 offers the following new features:\n\n--- While the core mechanics return some new elements are present and needed for puzzle solving. My favourite was the gel machine. These machines release gel and the gel-filled surfaces can be used to accelerate the protagonist in order to reach a much higher ground. Also, surfaces can be made available for the use of portals with the gel.\n\n--- Again, we have an extremely funny, relatively long and story-based single-player campaign. We have new voice actors (such as Stephen Merchant who usually works with Ricky Gervais - those of you familiar with Gervais's comedies will probably grow to like Stephen immediately) and the usual dark sense of humour is present throughout the single-player adventure.\n\n--- Co-op campaign is now available and demands that the two of you closely work together. Some of the stages can be tough (in both campaigns) but they are still heaps of fun.\n\n--- Graphics have also been improved. As we are in the same facility but after the events of the first episode, many of the chambers have walls that show aging and / or deterioration. This immediately allows players to immerse themselves in the story and realise that many years have been passed since the previous adventure.\n\nThe game has numerous mods available and just recently a paint gun mode has been released. As the gel-mechanics was based on a game called Tag: The Power of Paint, it was only natural to see the gun incorporated into the world of Portal. In fact, the creators of that game were hired by Valve and worked on Portal 2.\n\nPortal 2 is an excellent sequel and is worth every penny spent on it! This is a highly recommended game along with its predecessor.","July 24, 2014","true","15.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It isn't however one of those sequels where they give you the same product with prettier graphics and do nothing to improve on it; the game contains many great new innovations. At its core, portal is a puzzle platformer game, and this aspect is combined with the story in a way that forces you to think of outside-the-box solutions. The characters are all compelling; even the silent protagonist gets some characterization during the game. She's smart, good at jumping, and is able to jump over both emotional and physical obstacles with ease. When things get tough, and she has a murderous AI tryng to kill her at every turn, she just keeps testing.\nThe game has essentially three modes. There's the story, co-op, and community made maps. The community for this game  is amazing. They take all the resources Valve has lent them, and they make games barely recognizable as part of portal. It could also go in the opposite direction, and you get a game that feels like it should be a part of the main story. One major downside is that you cann't play co-op, or in  community maps, if you lack an internet connection. There are many great maps that make you think and analyze the tools you're given in different ways; It's a shame that you can't just download and play one of them while on the go.\nIf you're not into puzzle platforming, in-depth and imersive storytelling doesn't impress you, and you don't like any of your friends enough to play this with them without committing murder, this isn't the game for you.\n10/10","October 11, 2014","true","25.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

When he saw it on winter holiday sale he "made me" buy it for both of us.\nI finished single player first and I just love quotes, both Wheatley's and GladOS's. Single player felt longer then first game's and that sudden fall and change of surrounding is great. Cherry on cake is credit song which I only saw on Portal games and  make these games so special.\nI also like fun that doing these achievements brings, from throwing yourself into pit to breaking screens that results with some funny Wheatley's quotes.\n\nI think many people will agree with me when I say that co op is equaly good but even more fun the single player.\nThat is the element of game that I spent most of my in-game time on. Playing standard co op levels seperated into 5 groups of courses (not counting bonus courses) is great way to first learn game basics (in case you didn't play single player) but also to realize how good is your partner (how good reflexes he/she has, how much time is he/she willing to spend thinking, is he/she too stubborn to be played with, can you two understand eachother and how good host he/she is). I can say I played with at least 10 different partners I met online and finding few that I really enjoy playing with was not easy task.\n\nI also love the fact it has option to design your own test chamber and publish it on Steam Workshop pretty easily. Thanks to that you can, while in game, browse for the test chamber that is on your level (to be honest probably everyone after playing standard co op or/and single player for few times gets better on understanding game rules so he/she can solve harder tests more easily), subscribe and play it. There are whole collections of tests, some even with custom graphics and voices used to tell you original story through testing. You can choose from racing test to very complex one that require thinking.\n\nPlaying this game you can very easily catch yourself asking how did time pass by so quickly. One of my co op partners and I spent over and hour playing just one test, but I don't regret a second because it was so much fun :).\n\nI am going to finish this with conclusion that this game connects different people which all have one thing in common- they are ready to do some testing :)\n\nI really hope I didn't fail form and this review helped someone decide to buy this game and be satisfied with it like I am.","April 19","true","247.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.\n\nIn the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.\n\nAfter that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.\n\nAnd to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nWith the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, Portal 2 rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven‚Äôt yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","35.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

And so on...play to find your point of view about it....\n\nBut back to business!\n\nThis game is really really really cool! Based on interactive puzzles this game will make your hours flying away like an airplane directed to the other side of the planet.\nAs the name suggest you have to use portals to move yourself from a point to another, or redirect laser beams, or to move objects...or to throw them....or even to throw yourself!\n\nThe gameplay is fun, but it will easily put a sad face on you in some parts...and vice versa. The co-op mode is indeed the best one I've ever seen. In this game the co-op mode is FINALLY a true co-op mode (and I will say "co-op mode" another time just because I like to say "co-op mode" today). If you don't talk with your partner, if you don't plan to do stuff at the right time, if you go ahead alone....forget this game...is not for you; if you don't cooperate you will be unable to pass the first co-op level.\nThe fact that this game is even multiplatform compatible means that you can even play it with friend that have this game on PS3. This is a very interesting and good thing.\n\nThe graphic is indeed good, mostly based on HL2 engine (well...is a Valve game...lol) and the sounds are pretty nice too (funny the music based/created on the laser beams or in other puzzles you have to solve); and the support of the contoller will put a smile on the console's enthusiast.\n\nThe story is related to the first portal and as I said in the beginning the single player mode is more deeper than a simple game; a very good observer and listener will easy understand what this game wants to tell you...probably in its own way but still it is a message.\n\nOverall:\nGraphics 8/10\nSounds 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nCo-Op Gameplay 10/10\nLongevity 9/10","July 6, 2014","true","22.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

Not only that, it also delivers something else: a dark, black-humor-ish atmosphere that bestows upon the game a deeper sensation, thus envolving more thoroughly the player.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that the soundtrack of this game is truly remarkable and original to its core. It really was a breath of fresh air to me.\n\nValve, once again, has not disappointed.","November 30, 2013","true","40.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harklept/recommended/620/","harklept","[AI] Trademark‚Ñ¢","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harklept/","58 products in account","A great sequel to the already popular older game "Portal".\nA creepy setting with more of a backstory than the first, you meet a "friend" named Wheaty as you both try to escape.\nAfter activating (because "turned on" is sexual and strange to say when starting a computer) GladOS or that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• from the first game, you are literaly flung into testing chambers again as Wheaty tries to break you out. Only to later find out that he is crazy and ends up nearly killing you and GladOS. Through playing this game you learn the secrets behind the company and its founder as you travel into the older parts of the labs.\n\nI feel that this Portal has more of a story, while the first game focused more on helplessness and not being in control while being watched. I also feel more connected to this game, getting into this universe and being surprised with the shocking turn of events that take place. Sure, I'm not good with puzzel games, so I had to cheat a little and no clip to get to other parts of the game. (I am special. OK?) I am happy with the end results and the ending (no, I am not telling).\n\nStuff:\nSounds: 9/10 - Wheaty and GladOS are amazing in this game, and the sounds help too, the voice acting is great!\nSoundtrack: 10/10 - Here is a fact, and just youtube it if you don't belive me, aparently the soundtrack is so large and it   changes with the gameplay, it will take years for one song to repeat itself.\nGraphics: 8/10- Ok, Ok, its getting up there with age, but it is still good. I now feel like I am in some Sci-Fi Lab where crazy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• happens.\nConTROLLS: 8/10 - Same from last game, left mouse for one portal, right mouse for the other.\nStory: 10/10 - Some secrets are spilled.\n\nOverall: 98/100\n\nThis was a great game, but a game where I will only play once, because it is so linear. There is no choice. Sure, I may go back a try some puzzels without cheating.\n\nMaybe a Portal 3? Please? :)","October 12, 2014","true","5.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/recommended/620/","OrbiKitsune","Orbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/","86 products in account","Filled with dark humor and falling deeper (literally at some point) into the world of Portal, Portal 2 is the award-winning sequel that answers questions left from the first game. Only to bring even more questions.\n\n----\nOverviewPortal 2 is a sci-fi physics FPS-puzzle taking place in a chronologically-ambiguous position in the Half-Life universe. Following the events unfolded in Portal, the sequel brings the player faces new and old between the continuity of the experiment. It has a highly addictive cooperative mode, and user-generated content from the "Perpetual Testing Initiative" that brings the inner mad scientist of the user to life with the Puzzlemaker.\n\nPlotAs stated already, the game solves some of the possible questions of the player, let them know about the past of Aperture Science, but even letting them visit the old sections themselves. Character development is remarkable in this time between the two antagonists, as several turns of events throw the player into tricky situations.\n\nThe co-op mode also reveals some details of Aperture itself in the end of the testing 'experiments' between the two players.\n\nSingleplayer ModeThe singleplayer mode is heavily based on the first game, though with a number of twists. New testing elements and various new puzzles and techniques make the player think up ways through the tests, either involving the classic physics experiments, or laser redirections.\n\nCooperative ModeWithout cooperation the players won't advance in this mode. Literally. You really can't even get past the level selection if the players don't cooperate and play in such manner. More advanced puzzle techniques such as timing are introduced with a fair amount of trust being in the hands of the partner player. The incompetence (or mischievousness) of either of the parts might end in hilarious failures.\n\nGraphicsUsing an 'upgraded' Source Engine, the game is able to render truly beautiful environments at relatively low performance cost. Highly detailed testing environments, from the ruins of Old Aperture to the production lines of the facilities, you'll see yourself stopping for a few moments to admire the scenery.\n\nSoundThe soundtrack of Portal 2 and its iconic eeriness, generally accompanied by the 'robotic' sounds inserted into the music tracks make Mike Morasky's work fit perfectly into the game.\nThe sound effects of the game, not unlike the soundtrack, are highly detailed. From the slight noises of the testing elements to the rampaging avalanche bought by things like crusher plates in the game, every sound aspect has a high level of detail.\nThe voice acting is priceless, the character dialogue (or, in most part, monologue) is now fitting to each character's personalities and role. Including names such as J.K.Simmons, Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, Portal 2's VA is truly noteworthy.\n\nContent CreationAperture Science's Perpetual Testing Initiative -better known as the Ingame Puzzlemaker- is a tool both simple and intuictive to use. Simple controls and a range of elements available, the player can build test chambers to his heart's content with the tool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/recommended/620/","OrbiKitsune","Orbi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OrbiKitsune/","86 products in account","Filled with dark humor and falling deeper (literally at some point) into the world of Portal, Portal 2 is the award-winning sequel that answers questions left from the first game. Only to bring even more questions.\n\n----\nOverviewPortal 2 is a sci-fi physics FPS-puzzle taking place in a chronologically-ambiguous position in the Half-Life universe. Following the events unfolded in Portal, the sequel brings the player faces new and old between the continuity of the experiment. It has a highly addictive cooperative mode, and user-generated content from the "Perpetual Testing Initiative" that brings the inner mad scientist of the user to life with the Puzzlemaker.\n\nPlotAs stated already, the game solves some of the possible questions of the player, let them know about the past of Aperture Science, but even letting them visit the old sections themselves. Character development is remarkable in this time between the two antagonists, as several turns of events throw the player into tricky situations.\n\nThe co-op mode also reveals some details of Aperture itself in the end of the testing 'experiments' between the two players.\n\nSingleplayer ModeThe singleplayer mode is heavily based on the first game, though with a number of twists. New testing elements and various new puzzles and techniques make the player think up ways through the tests, either involving the classic physics experiments, or laser redirections.\n\nCooperative ModeWithout cooperation the players won't advance in this mode. Literally. You really can't even get past the level selection if the players don't cooperate and play in such manner. More advanced puzzle techniques such as timing are introduced with a fair amount of trust being in the hands of the partner player. The incompetence (or mischievousness) of either of the parts might end in hilarious failures.\n\nGraphicsUsing an 'upgraded' Source Engine, the game is able to render truly beautiful environments at relatively low performance cost. Highly detailed testing environments, from the ruins of Old Aperture to the production lines of the facilities, you'll see yourself stopping for a few moments to admire the scenery.\n\nSoundThe soundtrack of Portal 2 and its iconic eeriness, generally accompanied by the 'robotic' sounds inserted into the music tracks make Mike Morasky's work fit perfectly into the game.\nThe sound effects of the game, not unlike the soundtrack, are highly detailed. From the slight noises of the testing elements to the rampaging avalanche bought by things like crusher plates in the game, every sound aspect has a high level of detail.\nThe voice acting is priceless, the character dialogue (or, in most part, monologue) is now fitting to each character's personalities and role. Including names such as J.K.Simmons, Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, Portal 2's VA is truly noteworthy.\n\nContent CreationAperture Science's Perpetual Testing Initiative -better known as the Ingame Puzzlemaker- is a tool both simple and intuictive to use. Simple controls and a range of elements available, the player can build test chambers to his heart's content with the tool. You can even export your maps to edit with the Portal 2 SDK, for further detailings like custom assets and elements.\n----\n\nTL;DR: Portal 2 has a great amount of replay value, as well as its core likable elements. If you refuse to save Science and decide to do any manner of nonsensical lunacy, you really ARE a moro-- *punched*","December 27, 2014","true","97.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasstoeckert/recommended/620/","thomasstoeckert","Glacier Glacier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thomasstoeckert/","191 products in account","This game is a masterpiece. It's story and puzzles are out of the park. If you only buy one game, ever, it should be this.\n\nStory:\nThis game takes place in a run-down version of the aperture labs seen in the first game. But, unlike it's predecessor, you are helped along by a sphere named wheatley. As you try to escape, you end up waking GLaDoS, the antagonist from the first game, and you are thrown back into full testing. It's now up to you alone to escape.\nThis game's story is very deep and intricate, with nods to the Borealis in some easter eggs, and even the direct mention of black mesa. It has characters with immensly deep and suprisingly dark backstories, and is a game I contemplate still to this day.\n\nPuzzles:\nThe puzzles are much more difficult than the first game, and less hand-holding than before. It introduces some nice new testing elements, as well as makes new use of the old ones. The puzzles never end, either, thanks to the "Perpetual Testing Initiative" (Level editor + Custom levels on the workshop). The co-op puzzles double the fun, and difficulty, resulting in a massive need for teamwork.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game is suprisingly beautiful, for running on a game engine from the turn of the century. It's lighting and shadows outmatch other popular games, and they don't kill your system. My computer can run this game at medium settings, and my graphics card is an Intel Integrated Graphics HD 4000 (Planning on building a PC soon, using a laptop). It's still a good looking game, and will probably hold up for a while.\n\nAudio:\nThis game's music is always there, whether ambiently in the background, or boosting your pulse as you run through broken halls, death on your tail. The music is actually availiable free on their website, 3 full albums with all of the music included in the game.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThis game's co-op is brilliant, with customization of the two robots "Atlas" and "P-Body". Using the ping system to coordinate, you don't even need a microphone to communicate with someone random you meet. It even has a bit of story to the game, with the last level group revealing a large secret. The custom levels recentley updated to allow multiplayer, so this dosen't end for a while.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has a ton of nice features, content, and is really worth the $20 USD, if you are a first time player. I'm planning on getting a few more copies when it goes on sale to hand out to my friends that don't already own it, and play through with them. I love this game, and it's what got me back into PC gaming.","December 18, 2014","true","247.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The setting is immersive the moment you see it, and it still has the fun, portal-based puzzle style to it. With the addition of many more mechanics (gels, lightbridges, etc.) this game provides many hours of fun and thinking. The ever present GLaDOS is much more cold-hearted, but with the addition of Wheatly, Portal 2 still has the wit and charm of the first game. If you have played the first game, this is a MUST-HAVE.

Being the sequel to the GOTY Portal, I was expecting it to not be as good. But, upon starting and playing the game, I realized I was immensly wrong. The setting is immersive the moment you see it, and it still has the fun, portal-based puzzle style to it. With the addition of many more mechanics (gels, lightbridges, etc.) this game provides many hours of fun and thinking. The ever present GLaDOS is much more cold-hearted, but with the addition of Wheatly, Portal 2 still has the wit and charm of the first game. If you have played the first game, this is a MUST-HAVE. If you are new to the series, get it, and see how you like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezalon/recommended/620/","rezalon","Rezalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rezalon/","255 products in account","Before buying and playing Portal 2, I highly recommend buying and playing the first Portal game as it is integral to understanding the plot of Portal 2. My review of it can be read here.\n\nGame: Portal 2\nDeveloper and publisher: Valve Software\nGenre: First-Person Puzzle with Comedy\nReleased: 19 April, 2011\nSetting: Alternate future 52,XXX+, Aperture Science Enrichment Center, Upper Michigan, USA\nSpoiler-free plot summary: After the events of the first Portal, Chell finds herself waking up in the mysterious science facility once again. However, 50,000 years have passed since the end of the Portal 1, and the facility is now in ruins. Your only hope of escaping it once and for all is to trust one of the robots built to maintain the facility, Wheatley, who also wants to escape.\n\nFull review: Portal 2 is a far superior game than its predecessor. Portal 2, being a fully fledged game with a unique story, unique humor, new game mechanics, and new environments, makes Portal 1 look like a tech demo.\n\nPortal 2 can take several hours to complete; not just because the game is longer in general, but because the tests are far more varied than Portal 1's, and require longer thought and planning. There are several new mechanics which, when all mixed together, can make several of the later test chambers far more difficult than the previous ones, which means having to think outside the box. At first, these chambers might seem too hard or impossible to complete, but once you've worked out the solution, the "Aaaaah!" moment makes the struggle (and perhaps frustration) very much worth it.\n\nUnlike Portal 1, Portal 2 doesn't have advanced or challenge map packs; instead, Portal 2 has a challenge mode, which is a combination of the least portals and least time taken challenges in the Portal 1 challenge map pack. Also, instead of just having 6 chambers to be challenged on, you have every single chamber in the main campaign to be challenged on! An online leaderboard is also included in this game mode for those who want to compete with friends.\n\nA new addition is the map maker. In a parallel universe, founder and CEO of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson, has developed a multiverse device which can send test subjects into other parallel universes, who can test, and steal, that parallel universe's test chambers. These test chambers are the player-made ones you can download and play from the Steam Workshop. With the right know-how, you can make your own and upload them onto the Workshop for others to download and test.\n\nYet another new game mode is the co-op campaign. Set a few weeks after the events of the single-player campaign, two robots GLaDOS has created (you and a buddy) are tasked with completing tests in order to train you for missions GLaDOS wants you to complete. This game mode also includes its own online leaderboard and can also have maps made and uploaded to the Steam Workshop.\n\nAs I said before, the story and humor are unique. There are several twists that make you sit on the edge of your seat, and the humor, being incredibly dark, can make you laugh your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off, and make you feel uneasy, or even guilty about it. There are several new environments introduced that weren't seen in Portal 1, such as the behind-the-scenes areas of the test chambers, and the ruins of 20th Century Aperture. And although there is less of a mystery aspect to Portal 2 compared to Portal 1, those with a good eye (and ears) can still find some things you'd find out-of-place, even in Aperture Science.\n\nThis game is, no doubt, one of the best games ever made. Do I recommend buying this game? Of course I do! Especially if you like puzzles, or humor, or video-games, or breathing air. For NZ$23.99, I'd say this game is a tiny bit overpriced. I'd wait for a sale for when this game is about $17 - $20.","June 3","true","52.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianargonian/recommended/620/","hylianargonian","SurrealSaxhleel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hylianargonian/","89 products in account","This game carries on the legacy of the first Portal game by introducing new gameplay elements, mechanics and characters. Portal 2 is a masterpiece that is satisfying to play and makes once again stepping into the shoes (or rather, Long Fall Boots) of Chell a very fun experience. With a singleplayer and co-op campaign, the game is a huge improvement on the original and even puzzle and physics-based games as a whole. Having accidentely awakened GLaDOS after defeating her in the first game, Chell is given a new Portal Gun and begins testing once again under the watchful eye of GLaDOS. Along with a new Personality Core called Wheatley, the two travel through the test chambers, hoping to find an exit from the hell that is Aperture Science.\n\nWith new testing elements such as a tractor beam that can push and pull objects based on what direction it's going, blue gel that makes surfaces bouncy, and aerial faith plates which launch you into the air, Portal 2 makes coming back to Aperture Science a fun, refreshing experience. The puzzles in the first one were basic and limited to cubes, energy pellets and Turrets, but those were extremely fun and this game builds on the already great mechanics.\n\nStoryline wise, it's basic, but it works! There's one particular plot twist in it that will catch you by surprise, and the characters and voice acting in this game are just amazing, in every sense of the word. I found GLaDOS to be an excellent villian that had a very good sense of passive-aggressiveness toward Chell, Wheatley to be a fun character that was delightful to see everytime (P.S. he reminds of an actually funny version of C-3PO), and frankly I just enjoyed what the game had to offer in terms of character development.\n\nOverall, you most definitely should get this. Excellent in every way possible, though there's not a lot of replay value. That's ok, because you can make and play test chambers created by and other players for brand-new problem solving.\n\n10/10","October 30, 2014","true","43.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If the single-player experience wasn't already anough to buy this game then the co-op experience definitely is. Playing with a friend to solve puzzles can be great fun but also very frustrating but enjoyable at times.

You know, if you recommend such a game to someone else they might devote their existence to creating science.  Aperture Science.  From scratch!\n\nOh GLaDOS (and other personality constructs), how you inspire me...\n\nWhat drew me into this game is that this is no real shooter.  In fact, turrets and bombs are the only combat elements in this game.  Your goal: to escape to the surface, i.e. to think your way out of all those tests in the hope that someday the system will let you go.\n\nA masterpiece:\nPuzzles: 10/10.  Workshop items vary, but the core puzzles (Over 60 of them for Single player and co-op modes) are well-made.  Not so hard that you feel like giving up, but not so easy that you feel like you did nothing.  At some point in the game, you'll have to "test on your own recognizance," with almost no visual hints, but by then you should be well-trained in the "science" of Thinking With Portals.\nArt: 10/10.  On some of the new testing elements, the blue/orange theme is kept.  Additionally, the various test chamber themes seen as the story progresses are memorable.  Fairly visceral, but not to the point where it distracts from the puzzle solving.\nSound: 10/10.  The music is incredible, as are the ambient sound/scapes.\nStoryline: 8/10, although I must say that the behind-the-scenes stuff for Aperture Science is very impressive!\nDialog: 10/10.  Memorable lines by all the characters, with humor to match....\nPhysics: 9/10.  You can't be 100% perfect when portals are involved (visually and otherwise), but the algorithms are much improved from the original.\nCommentary: 9/10.  I miss hearing Ellen McLain's voice when she wasn't GLaDOS (a similar thing goes for all the other voice actors).  Other than that, the developers have truly insightful stuff!\n\nOther details depend on what system you're running, as well as the settings you have.\n\nAnd finally, this awesome game as an awesome in-game editor, in addition to being a Source Engine game, so you can create your own puzzles.  Be sure to check out the Portal 2 Authoring Tools (not for the faint of mind, though).\n\nRecommended gameplay (but I recommend playing the original Portal first): Start with Single-player mode.  Then move on to co-op and the developer commentary (for continuity of the story line).  Finally, when you feel tired of the 112 standard maps contained within the game, take a look into the workshop, where you'll find hundreds and hundreds of tests.\n\nOverall rating, with some generous rounding: 10/10.  These are also the same odds that you should enjoy this game.","December 13, 2013","true","625.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

Portal really hyped up the community with its portal mechanics (inspired by Narbacular Drop), sad to say it was really short, so the community demanded a sequel, which originates Portal 2.\n\nFirst gameplay through Portal 2, puzzles are really confusing, requiring you to think outside the box. Luckily, either GLaDOS, Wheatly or Cave are there to hint the players to go through the puzzles. There are lots of new mechanics too, especially the paint mechanics (inspired by Tag: The Power of Paint). The story is good and its comedy won't bore you. The game has a well made narration, showing the good and bad sides of each character.\n\nThe other thing that hyped it up was the Coop mode. Portals alone are confusing enough, now we have two sets of portals waiting to solve tons of other puzzles provided. This mode requires lots of cooperation and teamwork, and also a keen eye on possible solutions. Portal 2 also provided lots of utilities for coop plays, like gestures to express emotions, ping to show stuff, or even timers to sync in movement.\n\nOnce singleplayer and coop was done, nothing else is able to be done besides repeating the stories or doing challenges. Until, Valve released the workshop. Portal 2 was associated with the Steam Workshop, giving players a chance to create their own maps with ingame tools and playing endless amount of maps created by other players. This revived the Portal 2 hype, having players back on the game, creating maps and playing maps. Some maps are insanely hard, some maps are for casual players who love to stroll and play around.\n\nConclusion\nPuzzle SP/Co-op FPS game, challenging your mind to think outside the box while refreshing you with comedy and silly stuff. In-game Co-op features are well made. The workshop implementation also gives it a big boost, for players to come back and play new maps created everyday.","December 27, 2011","true","118.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has mind boggling puzzles that are extremely creative (which now you can make your own with steamworks), and an amazing plotline with a real cinematic feeling to it when it comes to the cut scenes. There‚Äôs one scene that gives me a chill every time, and that in itself is amazing.\n\nFor a puzzle game it sure does feel like there is a lot of action in this game. It can be very fast paced at times, and slow paced at others. Which I like, it‚Äôs nice to be stood there for ages thinking so hard at one point and running around franticly trying not to die at another.\n\nThere‚Äôs an amazing set of characters which are so perfectly done in terms of voice acting. I really couldn‚Äôt think of any better match for the characters they came up with. It has awesome little secrets and things to find that really expand your curiosity even further and make you really want to know more about the goings on at Aperture Science Laboratories.\nThe humour in this game is wonderful, and there was more than a few times I had a real chuckle to myself, I was pretty impressed with how well it was done.\nThere is a lot to this game, and it really is one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had.\n\nYou are a test subject, and you are once again trying to find your way out. But a lot stands in your way.\nI was pretty sad when I finished this game, as I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs anything to go on to turn into a future game. If there is, bring it on. I would love to once again be thrown into this world, but sadly I doubt there will be. It‚Äôs an amazing franchise, definitely one I can see myself playing again in future.\n\nThere is also a comic online on the Portal website for anyone that would like to see a beautifully constructed comic with some wonderful art that fills in some gaps and shows you how Aperture Science got to be how it is today.","January 18, 2012","true","71.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

How do you play? What do you do?\nPortal 2 is a FPS puzzle game. It is a direct sequel of Portal 1, and has many similarities to it. However, portal 2 is not the kind of game to sit there and copy what its predecessor did. Absolutely not, it‚Äôs here to improve on its past and give you an even better experience then last time\n\nControls\nThe game uses your standard FPS WASD and mouse controls, but also supports a special razer controller, and Xbox gamepads 10/10\n\nSound\nThe game sounds great. the OST is nothing special, but it gets the job done in the game. All explosions and sound effects are fine. The voice acting in this game is also great, and the dialogue can be quite funny. 10/10\n\nGraphics\nThe game looks great, it runs well on any modern pc, and the specs match the performance and graphical output. 10/10\n\nDifficulty\nThe game's difficulty depends on your puzzle solving skills. Personally, I got through fine without a walkthrough, but I know others who have gotten stuck at points. There is no difficulty or hints, should you get stuck and not be able to proceed, then you will need to turn to the internet. I can understand how one would get stumped in this game, with some of the testing chambers being massive. and i wish valve would have put in a hint button for new or younger players. But in my experience, i got through just fine. 8/10\n\nStory\nThe story picks up right after portal. X amount of years have passed and Chell must once again be tested. There are several new characters to the series, which it needed. It also manages the bridge the gap between the Half-life and Portal series. I had no issues with the story, and was impressed to see how clever valve was at linking things, and giving background. 9/10\n\nMultiplayer\nA new feature in Portal 2 is the ability to play 2player co-op testing chambers together. This has no real story to it, but takes place directly after the single player campaign. It's very enjoyable to play portal with a friend, and because of the emote commands, you won‚Äôt need a mic, or even a chat box really.  10/10\n\nLength\nBoth the single and multiplayer game modes can be completed in about 10hours total. That‚Äôs too short to make this game worth buying unless it‚Äôs on sale, Luckily, valve has opened the community to map making, which means, now the game is basically endless. There will always be another community level to play, but not all of them are good. 8/10\n\nOverall Portal 2 is a must have for every steam library. Delivering 2 decent story modes, and endless community levels, you‚Äôre in for a good time. You will get to build on the half-life universe, and have a few good laughs while you‚Äôre at it.\n\n9/10 - Near Perfect\n","March 16","true","60.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I enjoyed the game very much, but personally didn't (in general) like some of the faster paced reaction bits or having to place Portals while upside down and backwards (though they weren't going to hard on that). Portal had about 70% logic and 30% reaction puzzles aka Test Chambers. Only downturn was, that the (intentionally) grey and sterile environment kept the girls away from playing.\n\nSo, this game adds some Cockney speaking companion, has the old fun bits, remains solid in the core and adds really wonderful new gimmicks. All of them are lovely, but the Gels "stick" out for me, because they open up incredible possibilities. Apart from the gels, the game is in general more colourful than its predecessor since the story after the end of Portal allows that.\nNow it is about 80-90% logic puzzles which are not just recycled old ideas. To the contrary, the game hasn't really maxed out the sheer endless options and this is there the community comes in.\nThis is about one of the biggest games ever, since there are hundreds of free community test chambers to download and easily to integrate which makes the game extremely valuable - not only on sale!\nSadly, there are more of these factory/outdoor debris maps, where most effort remains simply looking for the portable surface.\nThe icing on the cake is the Co-Op Multiplayer, which should be really part of any good workplace team building effort. This hypes the game to a complete new level. Portal 2 reassures the community that Valve stands for witty quality games.\nHighly recommend this game; don't see anything worse compared to Portal and most of it better. You don't need to play the first part, but it helps to enjoy some comments even the better.","July 4, 2014","true","44.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've owned it for almost two years, and I've even created maps for it, albiet terrible ones. It's an amazing first-person puzzle game which offers players a chance to push their brains to the limits. And that's only the Singleplayer. For even more excitement, you can do the Co-Operative campaign, which offers an even tougher experience, as you need both players'... cooperation. Both stories are as amazing as the puzzles, so even if you find the puzzles easy, you can at least enjoy the story. And, again, even if you don't enjoy the story, there are literally thousands of community created levels from you to choose from, each with a certain theme. While most offer the 'Into the Multiverse' theme, narrated by the Aperture founder and CEO himself, others can have their own complex storyline and theme. I'd give this game a 10/10 rating.

Portal 2 and its testing facilities looks so beautiful and real you forget you are even in a video game. The plot is genius and most of all the puzzles make you want to send your hand through your computer (in a good way). The idea of the game is amazing and the execution is brilliant. I didn't think it could get any better from the original portal, but valve proved me wrong again. The big things are great and the attention to detail really sells the mood. All around 10/10. I have zero complaints.","May 5, 2015","true","225.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Definitely a candidate for game of the year.Sporting some of the best writing and voice work in years (as well as some deviously designed puzzles), Portal 2's single-player campaign is superior to its predecessor in every way. It makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games.Impatience aside, Portal 2 is an exceptionally well-crafted, intelligent, entertaining, humorous game. You will laugh. You will feel like a freaking genius. You will want more.

I didn't like it though because 1. At the time, I didn't like strategy games and 2. He used to boss me around in that game and yelled at me when I screwed something up. After I finished the first Portal, I decided to get Portal 2, since I loved the first one. So, on my birthday, I get some steam money. I remember a guy was selling this game cheap, so I get it off of him and decide to try it out. That first hour when I met the one and only Wheatley, I was in love with this game. Seeing the revival of GLaDOS, Wheatley's lovely accent, SPAACEEE, and lots more, I knew I was going to love this game. It would've been my vote for that year's GOTY, but Skyrim had to come out that year. -_-\nAnyway, I love the story, the graphics are a step up from Valve's normal dull graphics that you see on Source engine games. I think this game and Team Fortress 2 have the best graphics for a Valve game, with Portal 2 being ahead of TF2. To touch up on the story, this takes place "a long time" after the events of the first Portal game, and you live in a containment chamber similar to an average hotel room. The humor is back in the game, and the new character, Wheatley, who I absolutely love, makes me feel like I'm not alone with just GLaDOS, which was definitely a good thing. Gameplay is as great as always, but there is a downside. It feels like it is easier than the first game. Probably the only downside to a phenomenal game. To think this game is only $20 USD, man, what a deal. Definitely get this game. It was this series that got me into puzzle games!\n\nGraphics- 8.5/10\nGameplay- 7/10\nStory- 9/10\nAudio- 7/10\nReplayability- 5/10\n\n.:7.6/10:.\n+Best graphics in a Valve game\n+Longer\n+Awesome story\n-Easier than the first game","March 17, 2014","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It looks like a 2013 game, really.\nGameplay: The gameplay is like no other game. The puzzles, although a tad bit confusing at points, is a ton of fun. The addition of the gels make for a great time.\n\nStory/Lore: Now I'm going to do this one without spoilers, Going to be hard. In this game, you discover the truth of Aperture Science, the truth about Glados, and (if you look closely) some truth about why you are there. They dont just slap you in the face about it, they make you think about it.\n\nControls (Keyboard): The keyboard controls are great. Nothing else to say.\n\nControls (Controller): If you have a Xbox360 controller, and can connect it, do it. This game becomes 200% better with a controller.\n\nSecrets: This game has some of the greatest hidden secrets in the game, ranging from crossing into other games, to more information behind characters, to going back and jumping to your death.\n","March 17, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

WOOW !\n\nThe first part of the game (single player) has 3 finishes:\n\nGLaDOS learns a valuable lesson, but later cleared.\nWheatley learns a lesson and want to apologize for everything I did.\nChell achieved their freedom in a field of wheat ears in a world unknown to her, possibly controlled by the Combine, the brutal transhuman empire from Half-Life 2\n\n----------------------------------------------------------SPANISH-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEl juego es mucho m√°s largo que la corta primera entrega, abarca entre un 2.5 a 3 veces lo que fue Portal.\n\nEs muy entretenido y las gr√°ficos han mejorado notoriamente.\n\nTanto el juego individual como el Co-Op con robots son √∫nicos en calidad, imaginaci√≥n y dificultad.\n\nSe recomienda para colaborar con al historia, primero jugar hasta el final la versi√≥n individual y luego seguir el Co-Op, ambos siguen una misma l√≠nea de historia.\n\nPortal 2 es una secuela directa de lo que pas√≥ al final de Portal.\n\nSi no jugaste portal, puedes jugar Portal 2 sin problemas con la historia, aunque algunos detalles de los personajes no los disfrutar√°s como los que jugaron la primera parte, no tendr√°s problemas.\n\nAl igual que Portal 1, al final de Portal 2 hay una canci√≥n compuesta por el mismo compositor de Still Alive, Jonathan Coulton, en este caso es otro gran tema titulado: Want You Gone\n\nPortal 2 es una gran secuela, trae el mismo esp√≠ritu, humor, originalidad, pero en un envase mucho m√°s grande.\n\n(*) El momento m√°s √©pico de todo el juego sin lugar a dudas fue ver a GLaDOS reducida a un reloj digital alimentado por una bater√≠a de papa, y sobreviviendo en el nido de un cuervo, GLaDOS la papa amiga XD\n(*) El segundo momento √©pico fue el poder disparar un portal hasta la Luna‚Ä¶. WOOW !!!!\n\nLa primera parte del juego (el modo individual) tiene 3 finales:\n\nGLaDOS aprende una valiosa lecci√≥n, pero luego la borra.\nWheatley aprende una lecci√≥n y desea disculparse por todo lo que hizo.\nChell logra su libertad en un campo de espigas de trigo, en un mundo desconocido para ella, posiblemente controlado por el Combine, el brutal imperio de transhumanos de Half-Life 2\n","January 13, 2014","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

More great puzzles and humour from GLaDOS, Wheatley and Cave Johnson.  Valve trains players superbly with the new devices like hardlight bridges, excursion tunnels and the special goo. These are a great extension on the mechanics from the original\n\nWhat's better is the great co-op levels, these are almost as satisfying as the story puzzles.

The campaign is cool, the story takes unexpected turns, and it even tells you the backstory of Chell without even referring to her!\nTo really get the story, it is also suggested to play the first Portal game and to read the comic, as this gives you the complete experiene. And boy, do I love it!\n\nThe gameplay is great, the game deviates from the many CoD and WoW-clones by giving you a gun that fires two linked portals. You will learn to use these portals through the game, and how to fight with it using other elements from the test chambers.\n\nWhen the campaign is done, don't worry, there still is an unlimited amount of test chambers to complete. Thanks to the Perpetual Testing Initiative (PeTI), players can create and submit their own chambers for other players to test!\nIf you think you are ready to tackle the responsibilities of making your own chambers and releasing them into the wild, then the PeTI is something you'll love aswel. It's easy to use, and with it you can create stunning chambers from Aperture's glory time.\n\nAre you more into complex chamber designing? Don't worry, the PeTI is mod-friendly, and countless mods have been made to expand the elements to be used in the creator. My favorite mod is Ben and August's Extended Editor, where you get the full access to all Portal and Portal 2 testing elements plus custom made elements that almost all work without the player needing to install mods for themselves.\n\nOr if you are more into 3D design and making a chamber just like the developers did, Valve has made a special entry of Hammer for Portal 2, which is free to download and use when you get Portal 2. It certainly is the most difficult to work with, but it also gives you the most freedom. You can even create outside levels with it!","June 28, 2014","true","404.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm not great at them to begin with, and they frustrate me sometimes.\n\nPortal pretty much changed my outlook on that. I'd known about the Portal games for quite a long time before actually playing them. The first game was a great start, but I did wish there could have been more substance.\n\nPortal 2 is the embodiment of the perfect sequel. The gameplay improves greatly from the first; the chambers feature more factors, like the gels, hard light bridges, etc., and feel much more challenging. And, if you somehow get bored of the main Portal 2 campaign, there's also co-op!\n\nStoryline-wise, it exceeded my already high expectations. The dialogue was usually witty (GLaDOS), hilarious (Wheatley), or both. While there were very few characters in this game, it did a good job of making them complex and interesting. Of course, there are still some loose ends in the plot that were purposely left out, but I feel like it was better off being vague.\n\nPortal 2 definitely lives up to its reputation. After all, it takes a lot to be featured in hundreds of easter eggs across the video gaming universe.","September 24, 2014","true","14.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game opens with Chell back in Apature Science after being freed by a bumbling core named Wheatly. After accidentally rebooting GLaDOS, Chell is back with the Portal Gun and going through another round of tests until Wheatly comes in to save her again. Will they be able to stop GLaDOS again? Or is there another core that is more destructive then her?

While ya havethe portal gun and the companion cube, you also have Gels that come in handy. The Blue Gel lets you jump higher, the Orange Gel makes you run faster, and the White Gel makes you put portals anywhere. There are also light bridges, lasers and tunnes that help out with the puzzles, while ocasionaly outsmarting Turrets. Instaed of one character talking to you, you have 2 that do most of the talking in this game. GLaDOS is still the GLaDOS we know and love while Wheatly is the hilarious clumsy Core who clearly states that he's not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. There's also a 2 player Co-op mode where 2 robots from Apature take in on GLaDOS's tests, I've only played the PS3 version of this and it's fun toplay when you have a buddy helping out. So if you liked the first game, then your goingto love the sequel, full of surprises, complicated puzzles, and whitty dailouge. The game is a fitting ending to Portal that it makes you wonder how can they top it off with a Portal 3? Well then again Valve can't count to 3. lol","January 6, 2014","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And it didn't disappoint.\n\n\n\nLikes:\n\n- 100% player and camera control from game start to game end except for the ending scene. Zero cutscenes. This is what an ideal PC game should be. This point might seem very weird but it is a very big and important point in PC gaming\n\n- Not too easy, not too hard either. Lots of 'aha' moments. For those who don't know, the 'aha' moment is the defining characteristic of this game. If you don't get that feeling you can't appreciate the gameplay\n\n- Great use of sound\n\n- Music rhymes with gameplay\n\n- Great writing and entertaining story\n\n- Great voice acting\n\n- Co-op doesnt feel like it was added, it was made\n\n- Great FREE DLC. Usually free doesn't mean great. But Portal 2's DLC was surprisingly great.\n\n- Community made maps and mods\n\n- Can be played by all age groups\n\n- Polished\n\n\n\nDislikes :\n\n- Source Engine is getting old\n\n- The audience for this genre is kind of low\n\n\n\nVerdict : 94/100\n\nDon't let the genre stop you from playing this game","September 26, 2011","true","524.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/620/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nPortal2 is a first person puzzle game developed by Valve and released 2011. This game was greatly anticipated when it was announced and we all waited in anticipation for the release.\nThe game was not a disappointment, the developers brought us back to Aperture Laboratories and put us to work on new and innovative puzzles, Portal1 and 2 will always be one of my most favorite puzzle games, period.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You wake up in a strange hotel-looking room, after awakening you discover you're actually still inside Aperture Laboratories and the whole place is falling apart! You need to find a way out and escape before the whole lab falls down around your ears!\n\nGameplay: The whole game is based on the core concepts of two portals (an Orange/red and Blue Portal), be it moving objects through these portals, moving yourself between these portals, or jumping off high objects to reach hard to reach places, the game is a brainteaser in such a wonderful way. As the catchphrase goes ‚Äúprepare to think with portals‚Äù.\nThere are a number of features in Portal2, there are Single player, Co-op, Community Test Chambers/Workshop, Steam Achievements, and challenge modes where you can compete against your friends for fastest times, least portals used, steps, and more.\n\nAchievements: There are 51 Achievements for Portal2, Most of the single player achievements are straightforward fun and challenging to get... There are also Co-op achievements, so it would be best to make or get a friend to help you out.\n\nPrice: Portal2 is priced at $19.99 that will be the best 20 dollars you spend. But if you're on a tight budget like me you might want to wait for a 75% off sale, since the game was released in 2011 there's a very good chance that there will be sale for it.\n\nConclusion: I really can't sum up how great Portal2 is without saying ‚Äúlook, if you're even remotely interested in trying it out, you don't grasp just what an outstanding puzzle game it is. I highly recommend Portal2 to everyone and anyone.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update September 13, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Portal","July 20, 2012","true","41.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Totally excellent. The best game from Valve ever made. It is better than the Half-Life series of games, but I think Valve should make another game that will unite the two stories, the two worlds - events of Portal and Half-Life because the story in Portal takes place in Half-Life universe. I think Portal 2 with its allusions to the events of Half-Life can be a bridge to the large super-game. This may be a Half-Life 3 or something like that.","December 27, 2011","true","11.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game opens with Chell back in Apature Science after being freed by a bumbling core named Wheatly. After accidentally rebooting GLaDOS, Chell is back with the Portal Gun and going through another round of tests until Wheatly comes in to save her again. Will they be able to stop GLaDOS again? Or is there another core that is more destructive then her? The gameplay is like before, lots of puzzle solving while relying on your Portal Gun to help out, the puzzles are more challenging this time. While ya havethe portal gun and the companion cube, you also have Gels that come in handy. The Blue Gel lets you jump higher, the Orange Gel makes you run faster, and the White Gel makes you put portals anywhere. There are also light bridges, lasers and tunnes that help out with the puzzles, while ocasionaly outsmarting Turrets. Instaed of one character talking to you, you have 2 that do most of the talking in this game. GLaDOS is still the GLaDOS we know and love while Wheatly is the hilarious clumsy Core who clearly states that he's not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. There's also a 2 player Co-op mode where 2 robots from Apature take in on GLaDOS's tests, I've only played the PS3 version of this and it's fun toplay when you have a buddy helping out. So if you liked the first game, then your goingto love the sequel, full of surprises, complicated puzzles, and whitty dailouge. The game is a fitting ending to Portal that it makes you wonder how can they top it off with a Portal 3? Well then again Valve can't count to 3. lol","January 6, 2014","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And it didn't disappoint.\n\n\n\nLikes:\n\n- 100% player and camera control from game start to game end except for the ending scene. Zero cutscenes. This is what an ideal PC game should be. This point might seem very weird but it is a very big and important point in PC gaming\n\n- Not too easy, not too hard either. Lots of 'aha' moments. For those who don't know, the 'aha' moment is the defining characteristic of this game. If you don't get that feeling you can't appreciate the gameplay\n\n- Great use of sound\n\n- Music rhymes with gameplay\n\n- Great writing and entertaining story\n\n- Great voice acting\n\n- Co-op doesnt feel like it was added, it was made\n\n- Great FREE DLC. Usually free doesn't mean great. But Portal 2's DLC was surprisingly great.\n\n- Community made maps and mods\n\n- Can be played by all age groups\n\n- Polished\n\n\n\nDislikes :\n\n- Source Engine is getting old\n\n- The audience for this genre is kind of low\n\n\n\nVerdict : 94/100\n\nDon't let the genre stop you from playing this game","September 26, 2011","true","524.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great Final, totally love it.\n- Characters. This time there's more characters, besides GLADos. All her sarcasm always makes me laugh as well as Wheatley's stupidity, and Cave Johnson's 'murican attitude.\n- Gameplay. In Portal you use portals. In portal 2 you have Gels, barriers and the hallucinating combination of these 3.\n- Coop. Great Coop campaign, perfect game to play with a friend.\n- Soundtrack.

Let me say that first and foremost. Yes, if you have the money and are considering getting it, you should.\n\nHowever, if you haven't played Portal 1, play that instead. While Portal 2 has more puzzles and better graphics, I don't think it's a better game. The average puzzle in Portal 1 has 4-8 solutions, and the tutorial puzzles show enough that you learn how to use the mechanics, without making you feel like you're being told how to play. Portal 2 takes the subtle parts that made the first game a masterpiece and sort of hamhandles them. The average puzzle in Portal 2 has 1-3 solutions. The introduction of new mechanics, such as the goop, initially makes for more interesting puzzles, but ultimately creates a need to make the puzzles more restrictive and less intuitive. I didn't finish the game. I am an avid puzzle gamer, but one puzzle near the end of the game required such precision, timing, and execution that I couldn't manage it with the level of awareness I had.\n\nOf course, being a very social gamer, a friend and I flew through the multiplayer maps with no difficulty. I think I will attribute that to the lack of goop.\n\nTL:DR good game, the first one was better","December 4, 2013","true","28.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/recommended/620/","derpybirds","DerpyBirds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/","641 products in account","‚Äì The story\nYou are set in the future where a Robot called GLaDOS is presented as a sarcastic nemesis who just won‚Äôt leave you alone. You first are introduced to a seemingly friendly floating robot head Wheatley. He takes you through a bunch of tests which GLaDOS is presenting you with while he tries to take over the place. What happens next You have to find out for yourself.\n\n‚Äì My thought‚Äôs\nThe game itself is a piece of Art. Everything about the game just screams yes. The game is about puzzles and thinking with portals. If you haven‚Äôt played the first portal that‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôve played the first portal a long time ago and it didn‚Äôt impact the second game that much. Story mode of the game is done perfectly, voice acting as silly as it may in a robot game is done very well + animations are great. Maybe the only way it would be improved if you could play co-op with more people, other than that it‚Äôs perfect. I personally like the introductions of the Portal gun. Co-op was executed as good as you can possibly execute it, I was stunned to see how well the Multiplayer was made. A lot of games don‚Äôt have a good co-op system and/or multiplayer, but Portal 2 just took made it as easy as possible. If you wish to play co-op I suggest finishing singleplayer beforehand. Co-op doesn‚Äôt include a story, but rather multiple puzzles for you and your friend. I honestly can‚Äôt find anything bad to say about this game because it is just perfect, little to no bugs at all.\n\n‚Äì The summary\nThe game is excellent for people who wan‚Äôt to challenge themselves and friends.\n\n‚Äì The Pros\n+ Story ‚Äì The game has an excellent story mode for you to complete.\n+ Co-op ‚Äì This game includes a co-op mode for you and your friends to play, and can be set up in a matter seconds.\n+ Smooth graphics ‚Äì The graphics of the game are just stunning and perform well even for not so good computers.\n+ Little to no Bugs ‚Äì In my time of gameplay I didn‚Äôt experience any bug at all.\n+ Community workshop ‚Äì When I found out I could play other people‚Äôs creations I was just sucked even more into the game then before.\n+ Level editor ‚Äì Another option the game allows is a custom editor for you to make your own maps and creations and share with the world.\n+ Independant game ‚Äì What I mean by this is, even if you haven‚Äôt played the first portal game you don‚Äôt need to because the game‚Äôs story mode isn‚Äôt affected by the other game.\n\n‚Äì The Cons\n+ Short ending ‚Äì To be honest this is the only thing I could put on this, it doesn‚Äôt even deserve a ‚ÄúThe bad‚Äù section because it was so darn good.\n+ Micro-Transactions ‚Äì The only way to customize your character within the game is to spend a few bucks on a skin.\n\n‚Äì The rating\n+ I would rate the game a solid 9/10 just because of the performance and everything about it. Definitely suggest this game to your more puzzle-loving friends.","May 2, 2014","true","36.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Left 4 Dead, Half-Life, Portal, and now Portal 2. With Glados returning for revenge the story gets more and more intense. Running away from an vicious programme with menacing plans to crush you, Only being able to avoid her by supassing invigorating puzzles each getting harder than the next. To beat this game you need a quick brain and good at solving difficult tasks. Some tasks requiring smart movements, others precise timing and even a good accuarcy. If you've played other FPS games in the past you should be good. Even though it does'nt require inhuman ractions sometimes you can be on a tight time limit.\n\nPortal 2 has changed since its first game, with Valve listening to community requests and even adding in small easter eggs and funny secrets to hopfully blow up the internet.\n\nThis game is for those who like using their brain and take time in puzzle solving.\n\nAlthough i do wish the game was longer and even made a 3rd in the series.

All I can do is add to those thoughts.\n\nIt's a fun game, and at times a little challenging. It's perhaps not as challenging as the original Portal was, and the increased story elements take away from the awe of a story actually unfolding before your eyes in what appeared to be a straightforward puzzle game. Yet, Portal 2 has a lot of humor and the characters are great. The story is fun to follow and only adds to the experience.\n\nThere are a few Easter Eggs in the game for Valve fans, which is a nice touch.\n\nIn short - sit back, play and enjoy.","February 2, 2014","true","12.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The gameplay is nearly flawless, and the idea is brilliant. But first let me addresss everything the naysayers about this game say. 1: Predictable storyline. Hmmmmmmmmmmm I would agree with you there... except you didn't play the whole game. Seriously, almost everyone who says this has not played the whole game. And for the few who did, you clearly did not watch your surroundings enough. The point of the story was to make you want to play more, and it certainly did well on that note. 2: Not very hard. Again, play the whole game first. True, the game was not THAT hard, but I cannot think of a  puzzle game that executes the gameplay as well as portal does. While the game itself was not terribly hard, the community has certainly made some head scratching test chambers that will make you want to eat your own words. 3: Crashes. The game does not crash anymore (except on windows 8 so far) so ignore those reviewers who say that because their review is now irrelevent.\nFinal score 9/10","April 22, 2014","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Portal 2 is an awesome game. It has a unique gameplay using portals and the puzzle is amazingly clever.\nIt might be hard at first, but each and every puzzle solved gives you more reward than any other puzzle games. It just makes you more addicted and excited to solve more and more and more puzzles. Why do you think it is?\n\nIt is because Portal 2 has an awe inspiring story. Puzzle games might sometimes frustrating and lonely, but not here. Each and every part where you progress in Portal 2, you are engaged in a dialog (actually monologue) that's genuinely interesting. A true entertainment while you spend time thinking how to progress. You won't get bored after passing each puzzle because the story moves very well and invites your curiosity.\n\nI played this game and enjoyed every tests inside and I felt a lot of emotion while I am playing. I felt difficult at some tests,  I laughed so hard at the silly one-eyed metalhead spouting "serious" talk, I feel sympathy when the story reveals its moments, I felt smart when solving a puzzle that took me some time, I felt hope and optimism facing the challenge, and I feel an excitement, a desire to move forward and fights all the challenge given to me.\n\n"When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! MAKE LIFE TAKE THE LEMONS BACK!!"\n\n*nb: Portal 2 is better when you have played the first Portal game.","February 14, 2015","true","37.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Portal 2 brings it up the next level for the original Portal. This time we get to finally know a lot more about Aperture Laboratories and its dark side. Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny.\nI give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes.

Maybe the biggest spoiler in the game was a turret.\n\nFor the music; almost perfect, but sometimes a bit too electric. I liked the fact that the music changed with your actions, your location and plot. I don't see that often in games (if they already have music that fits). I.E; it intensifies when you're defeating the boss and it changes when you use the blue gel or if you kill a turret.\n\nThe gels are an amazing addition that really adds a new element to the game. Now you don't have only need to think with portals, but also with speed, fysics and bouncyness.\nAnd when you're in co-op modus, you have to think with portals twice as much as in singleplayer.\nDon't forget about the perpetual testing initiative! Since Portal have got an end, and after palying the game more times, you know how to solve the puzzles. But in Portal 2, you can use the maps of the community. And if you want to, you can make your own (like I did).\n\nThe detaillness of the maps where amazing. You can spilt Portal 2 in 6 parts and every part has got its own properties. For instance, when you're playing in the underground, you see that everything is falling apart due to a lack of maintenance. You also hear that. The soundscape fits amazingly well!\n\nShortly;\nIf you're hesistating, buy it. Portal 2 is worth it. It's even more worth it when it's on sale.","December 29, 2014","true","42.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Portal 2 brings it up the next level for the original Portal. This time we get to finally know a lot more about Aperture Laboratories and its dark side. Like in the original game there are 2 people back, Chell (Hero) and GlaDoS (anti-villan). This game brings up right where Portal ended well kinda as you are in a dorm room? You eventually meet someone named Wheatley who tells you that youve been sleeping for 100 years (clear white lie) and that the entire Laboratory is destroyed because of you (so true). The puzzles in each room increase and so does the story. The Co-op is strongly recommended cause many people do not co-operate with you since every puzzle is literally meant for 2 people. Than comes the beloved Steam Workshop making our lives 200% harder. Since you can make your own level, 99% people will rage quit im not lying its not only true but funny.\nI give this game 9/10 because the co-op mode doesnt have enough features and in my opinion they should add a little more levels in both single and co-op modes.
