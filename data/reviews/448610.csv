The physics aren't quite the same of that of the original, and I find that this makes the game a little less unrealistic somehow. Another letdown is that even though it says multi-player, it is not a live multiplayer setting like what you would find in a typical racing game, it is simply just a ghost of another persons run through of the level. A plus though, is that there are many levels that are made by the community and it is easy to share and play them.\n\nConsidering this game is extremely cheap, I can only just recommend this game for those that enjoyed playing the browser version of this game before this came out.\n","May 18","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game has seven levels and 175 chapters, each adding its own distinctness to the game.Every level leads you to a new circumstance.In some there is high gravity,some has Earth like systems,while some are designed for the hardcore extreme sports fans amongst you.So much is the vastness of the game that it allows you to edit your own custom maps for you and your friends in the editor mode.\n\nThere are typically 25 chapters in each level on an average,with the Earth level having a minimum of 6 chapters and the bonus level having a maximum of 41 chapters.Be warned though as you finish each chapter you face an even harder chapter.In Earth based system you play in a situation simmilar to that of what you face on  Earth.In hardcore you get to do extreme stunts based on the limitations of physics applied to the game.In gravity you face extreme gravity,while black and white is for fun,Beginning is for the absoulte starters.(Had some nice time in it).Challenge is a bit more punishing than the beginners and lastly the bonus is for  the kid amongst you.As mentioned they make up together a complete game.\n\nIts not just one vehicle you can have fun on but there are bikes,sleds,unicycles,you can even walk,apart from cycling.You die a plenty of times during the game play or your vehicle breaks ,so advised dont try this anywhere.The game itself is fun and is sure to entertain you for hours if not days being a 2d game its a refreshing change from all the other 3d games or even from the ones in its class.\n\nPROS\n\n+The levels themselves are exciting and varied\n+Good music,simple yet enticing\n+So many levels to choose from\n+Various kinds of vehicles to chose from,from cycles to bikes.from sleds to unicycles\n+Its pocket friendly\n+you can edit your own levels\n\nCONS\n\nThere are no noticable cons to this good game but if i have to mention\n\n-each chapter is locked and you cannot step jump\n-Its a bit unpolished and the game can do with a bit more polishing (coloring)\n\nApart from that its an extreme sports fans dream come true And as I mentioned in the beginning PG is advised for if you try out this stunts even in this game you die a gory death some times.(Trust me  I have died plenty of times and would die again !) All in all A solid 6.5/10 for presentation. Definitely a go getter for an extreme sports fan.","May 1","true","1.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cornerer/recommended/448610/","Cornerer","FlatOut 4 Coming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cornerer/","33 products in account","Tried every game mode so far including online. Not sure if they've updated something but haven't experienced any bug/glitches myself unlike some others claimed here. Game running perfectly smooth at ~65fps on my slightly above-average PC.\n\nNot sure if this is exactly comparable to Free Rider 2 (to me it isn't after giving FD2 a brief try because of comments, correct me if I'm wrong). For me being a player of "Gravity Defied" mobile game since ages ago, this game is as close as you can get compare to that, except gameplay much smoother & now featuring not just bikes but also the likes of "ATVs" and "Hoverboards", plus so many player-made levels with zillions track designs available instead of only the flat surfaces back in GD. Sometimes you even need to get off your bike (or whatever) + "roll" the rider by controls to complete the stage =D Oh and beautiful blood death scenes.\n\nJust my 2 cents. Free Rider 2 in my mind is much closer to those 2D Flash bike games from miniclip which is much more "high-speed biased" and "thrilling" to some/most minds, but to me Draw Rider is more challenging, more tactical and have a slightly more organized interface for finding tracks (again correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nI wish the aforementioned bugs by victims would have been fixed by now, because as the game stands for me right now, it worths every single penny despite few little flaws and I honestly think this is better than Free Rider 2 in terms of what I've been seeking for (even if excluding nostalgia)\n\nEDIT: You can buy full version of this on Android and play it on Windows with help of Android software, which means you can play it on both Android and Windows without spending twice. However the controls are pretty sensitive for leaning forward/backward in both versions and this makes controlling on touchscreen Android very difficult as "buttons" for these 2 are aligned for use of your right hand (and u can't use 1 finger for each when holding your phone). Feels way easier to play the Windows ver.","April 4","true","3.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

This game has a horrible learning curve (for lack of  better term.) The 12th level in the "Beginning" world (less than half way through) is so difficult as to require a Youtube video to figure out, and I still haven't been able to accomplish it. Effectively, I'm locked out of the remainder of the game, as the other Worlds are far more difficult. This is possibly the HARDEST game of this genre I've ever encountered, and I've played dozens.)\n\nI've only been playing Draw Rider for a few minutes, but I already LOVE it! Fabulous ragdoll physics, tremendous challenge, a multitude of opportunities and a variety of modes. For this low price, quite an accomplishment (in one player's opinion. Admittedly and unashamedly, this is my “type” of game.)\n\nThe goal of Draw Rider couldn't be simpler. Ride a bike (and six other things, apparently) from the beginning to the end. And it couldn't be more complicated either. Using the arrow keys you can move forward or backward and accelerate or brake. BUT.....keeping your wheels on the ground is another matter entirely, and nothing makes this more apparent than the first time you accidentally complete a triple-flip! The 150 courses involve all kinds of leaps and climbs, and a multitude of opportunities for disaster....and worse. You'll frequently find yourself dead, immersed in a pool of your own blood. Or you may succeed, unlocking the next level.\n\nEach level of Draw Rider is timed and has the traditional "three levels of success", gold, silver and bronze. But unlike some games, if you don't get silver, you don't automatically get bronze. No, you MUST finish within the third time range, or you get a "Restart" instead of "Next" upon completion. Perhaps to make up for what may make some players unhappy, when you replay you get a ghost rider to show how you're doing compared to your best (though still failing) score.\n\nDraw Rider has seven “Worlds” in addition to an online mode and a level editor. The worlds are:\nBonus\nChallenge\nBeginning\nBlack & White\nGravity\nEarth\nHardcore\n\nWhile the levels in each World are locked (except the first), none of the Worlds are locked, so if a player gets stumped it’s a simple matter to play elsewhere to gain skill. The opening World menu shows, for each, how many scores of each “medal” you’ve obtained, and the percentage of completion for that World.\n\nI’ll have more to say about Draw Rider later (as I explore each World), but I didn’t want to wait another minute. For now, be aware that it’s already dirt cheap ($1.99US), AND on sale. Prepare to enjoy some of the most maddeningly “laugh out loud” frustration you’ve experienced lately.\n\nThank you.","April 1","true","1.3"," 22 of 54 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","22","54","4","7"

I thought I was just being stupid or not knowing the controls, but no, it's impossible.\n-Leading on from that, there's no way to see the controls. It's not exactly a difficult game to work out, but the option would be nice. As would being able to reverse, instead of having to do a weird backwards wheelie\n-Unless I'm missing something, the game seems to be locked into fullscreen, which I'm not big on\n-Again, unless I'm missing something, the login/register part of the game to get user levels doesn't seem to be working. The box to type in the username and password wouldn't let me type, and then I couldn't get off the page. I had to alt+f4 to get away from it.\n\nSo really in conclusion, you may as well try it I guess.

I think it needs more fail acceptance then just everything must be done perfect to get to next level.\n\n(Im bad at pros and cons :P)","April 2","true","0.5"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"
