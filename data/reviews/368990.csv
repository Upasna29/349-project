Not absolutely terrible, but it's something I wouldn't really recommend. Game is less than a hour long, story is uninteresting and lacks real presence. Character walks the speed of molasses and a lot of the game, like most of it, is padded out simply because of how slow you walk and run (with limited stamina). The game crashed on me because of a faulty audio file that wouldn't work, but was able to bypass it. A lot of the 'gameplay' is figuring out which way is the right way to go with little to no direction, the worst of this being two sections where you crawl through vents. When anything exciting happens almost, it's an automated cutscene moment where you lose control of your character and they do some action in super slow-motion. The only encounter with a 'stalker' type thing is a flipping QTE sequence. Game is stupidly dark sometimes, you have a flashlight, but a draining battery pushes you to conserve batteries and lurk in the dark. Not fun to explore sometimes, and the game punished you for it sometimes, such as a scene where exploring can end up with you locked into a death scene with a train hitting you, and then having to start the game all over. Have to watch the opening credits (about 30 seconds long) each time you boot-up the game or die.\n\nHowever, game does have some nice lighting in places, the atmosphere in parts is pretty good, there's one or two moments that I feel were well handled (a scene later in involving a window pops up in my mind), most of it isn't offensively bad, just kind of ehh. Game ends abruptly on a cliffhanger "TO BE CONTINUED...".","May 18, 2015","false","1.3"," 114 of 123 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","114","123","11","0"

Even bought it for a few friends.\n\nIt was on sale for 9 cents (US). Turns out, it was 10 cents too much. I figured at the very least, I could get 3 cards out of it. By the time I bought the game, Steam's new "Two Hours before you get cards" rule had gone into effect.\n\nThis game should have come with the cards, automatically. The real Despair is that I had to idle this HORRIBLE game 2.7 hours to get the cards.\n\nSome people have compared this game to the game Bad Rats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/viatrixa/recommended/368990/","viatrixa","VI -nsanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/viatrixa/","413 products in account","I'm all for supporting Indie horror games, even if they do suck a little. But there are so many things off about Despair that I'd honestly recommend avoiding it, unless of course the devs give it some much needed love and polishing. I don't expect a luxury big name game experience for two euros, but even that price seems a little too much for Despair, at least in it's current state.\n\n- The graphics are quite an eyesore. Granted there's only so much that can be done with the engine, but still. A luminance slider bar would have done wonders here; in most parts, the umbra doesn't blend well with the atmosphere and creates a really wonky silhouette/cartoon effect. The highlighted puzzle/progress elements feels cheap.\n\n- The translations feel sloppy and incomplete. There are some words that are not translated at all, and the general wording & expression could use a polish up. There are a lot of people out there willing to help with this! This also applies to the blurb on the Store Page. Please don't hesitate to ask for help!\n\n- The Store Page for Despair doesn't mention that it's early access. Yet the game seems to have no proper ending and cuts off abruptly. It leaves us as the players hanging; what does this mean exactly? Will you polish it up in the future? Do you plan to expand the game? There is little to no story in the game save for the generic, cryptic notes. They don't tell us much. :/ Will we have to pay for the continuation? Or will this game simply be expanded and updated?\n\n- An inventory or at least a general notepad/diary etc. would be nice so we could go back and read the notes we've picked up and view the items we've picked up, too. This if course isn't super necessary but allows a player to keep track of picked up items easier.\n\n- An auxiliary light source. The batteries last decently but only if the player knows exactly what to do - those who do not immediately spot the solution / way to progress forward are left fumbling in the dark without any light source. A tiny light source to keep us going until we find more batteries would be wonderful.\n\n- Just in general, this game feels like the devs were in a serious rush to release it. It feels incredibly incomplete and painfully short. Which would be fine, but the Store page neglects to mention early access. What's the deal with this? Will we see more? Or is this a prequel to something? If so, once again, it would be nice if this was mentioned. We as the players are left hanging at the end of the game, nothing is explained.\n\n- I forgot who it was exactly, but some person on the forums stated that "darkness and noises do not a scary game make". I'm inclined to agree, at least concerning the horror elements in the game. The darkness was frightening only for a little bit, after which it came merely annoying. The "generic, dark haired horror element lady" could be made into something a lot more intimidating. Monster / enemy designs don't always have to be super original, but they do need that oomph in order to scare us, at least a little bit.\n\n- All appendages crossed in hope that the devs will better this game. Albeit it's nothing short of a hot mess at the moment, it technically does have potential!\n\n\n\n","May 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","11","13","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himesaminako/recommended/368990/","himesaminako","The","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himesaminako/","91 products in account","Cursor doesnt lock into game, so using a dual monitor set up sometimes causes the mouse to click on the desktop and minimize the game. good luck adjusting the audio settings with the invisible cursor. Games horribly optimized for what little it contains, graphics settings are severely limited (resolution and LOW/MED/HIGH, that's ALL). There's no gamma or brightness sliders or adjustments, so if your screen's brightness and gamma isn't jacked up (AND I MEAN SUPER JACKED UP) good luck seeing anything before you get a flashlight (and even when you do get it, its still hard to see).\n\nYou SPRINT slower than a turtle. And you have limited stamina, so you move even slower and can barely travel. Why is there limited stamina? There is literally no purpose to this other than to give you a sense of 'realism' maybe, you're never once sprinting away from anything, so you're forced to endure walking through tiled texture repeating hallways for hours.\n\nTo the next point, all the level design is just atrocious: blocky and repeating textures everywhere, dead/useless space everywhere. And mazes. I don't know why. The creator loves mazes, or something. The vents are a maze. There's just random mazes all around. It's stupid because you don't see it's a dead end until you walk 5 minutes down that path with the incredibly slow walk speed you have.\n\nThere are a bunch of events taking away player's control and it's quite extensive and jarring. Not a massive problem but it was kinda bothersome. Happened during events like climbing through vents. Or dropping down them. Or climbing a ladder. What I mean is it's fully automated, once you trigger the action you can't do anything.\n\nit gets better: during a scripted quicktime event the coder forgot to script a death scene. So if you fail to press the interaction key within the allotted time, your character will freeze and that's it. If you're like me and you did it on purpose to see what would happen when you die, your screen will be plastered with a horrible filter that makes it impossible to continue any further (you cant see anything for some reason).  Im serious, don't die, cause if you die you'll have to replay the entire game- and God help you if you decide to do that. I didn't think it was worth my time so I just looked for a video since my brother nagged me so much to see the ending.\n\nAlso the game crashes randomly and is riddled with bugs. It gets worse because there's not a single save point so have fun with replaying Walking Simulator™ 2015 if you crash or the game bugs out like it did for me.\n\nPrime example: I crawled through a vent and went only straight and when I jumped out I was in the same room I came from, with no way out. Looking at a walkthrough, I was supposed to end up in a different location entirely but I somehow ended up in the room I was crawling away from.\n\nand finally, the game starts off literally telling you to "find out what happened here" and the best part is you don't even do that- you walk around through non-relevant, disconnected, generic & bland setpieces with no explanation of anything only to find yourself boarding another train at the end for whatever reason.\n\nAnyway my biggest concern is who let this go on Steam, because there is absolutely no reason this should be allowed. It's bad, but it's not even funny bad because the slow walking, awful level design, and lack of anything besides those two made for an extremely unenjoyable experience overall with barely anything to laugh at. the only comedic part of this game is the trading cards. No, seriously, go read them they're hilarious.\n\nHad I not been concerned of being an abuser of the refund system, I would have refunded this long ago. Trading cards are worth more than this game (both in monetary value and enjoyment value). In fact I had more fun writing this long review than actually playing the game itself\n\nAlso, the HUD text for "batteries" is in Russian. Yeah, I have no clue either.","June 13, 2015","false","0.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

The game feels incomplete, lacking any clear objectives, It's a mystery as to what is it you're supposed to be doing or even where you're supposed to go. The game feels aware that you want to leave, which is probably why is has invisible walls to prevent you from going until it decides you're ready to go. Speaking of slow pacing, the character you control moves slower than a sloth, you have to make constant use of a quickly depleting stamina bar just so you can run at a subpar at best walking speed.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the game is extremely dry and dull. For a horror game I'm amazed that they forgot to even put in a soundtrack or anything of that sort to build some kind of suspense or atmosphere. The only thing that could be considered slightly scary was the jumpscares, and a jumpscare is like the fart joke of horror, something you can lazily throw in.\n\nAt least when I play a game such as Dear Esther I can be taken in by the beautiful visuals and the narrations, even if there isn't any "action", it's still something you can really enjoy for it's artistic merit. This game however is nothing more than a dead map.\n\nI know I only paid 9 cents for this, but even still I want my money back!\n\nThe only positive I can give for this is that the trading cards could be sold to turn a profit.","June 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You literally have to start the game all over. There are lazy quick time events that make up for  poor gameplay. Let alone its not even scary at all.

You're just trying to figure out where you're supposed to walk to and that's it.\n-You walk ridiculously slowly, making the game hideously boring.\n-The game's world is pitch dark and immensely frustrating to traverse without a flashlight; which makes it an extra kick in the nards that the game is full of paths that lead nowhere to where you run out of battery just from not knowing where to go. You then have no choice but to stumble around completely black hallways hoping you stumble onto something to advance the game.\n-The game has absolutely zero story. You find notes implying your character was responsible for somebody's death and that's the full extent of story that you get. The game even ends by saying "To Be Continued" with absolutely nothing resolved.\n-The game runs like mangled ♥♥♥- rarely cracking 10 fps- and trying to reduce the grahics quality to improve performance just crashed the game. The ♥♥♥♥-poor framerate results in God-Awful controls as the camera just kind of jumps from angle to angle.\n-This supposed horror game only has two scares the entire game, and both are pathetic: a girl in a very obvious mask standing off in the distance.\n-The environment  isn't even scary; just abandoned subway and- briefly- abandoned apartment building. The complete failure at building atmosphere is astounding.\n-There appear to be no checkpoints. There are only two spots in the entire game where it seems possible to die in the first place, but stopping or dying means going back to the start of the game.\n-Notable glitches include not being able to pick up items, the cliche paper notes you pick up not disappearing from the screen rendering the game unplayable, controls locking up when you die, and the game failing to load the ending! I had to check online let's plays just to find out I had- in fact- hit the end of the game.\n-Game is 30-40 minutes long depending on how long it takes you to figure out which way you're supposed to go.\n\nThis is the most generic horror game you can imagine; the only thing that sets it apart is the rampant glitches, horrible performance, and truly astounding incompetence in its design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpanthere/recommended/368990/","xpanthere","anal4pay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpanthere/","177 products in account","Despair manages to squeeze new kinds of scares out of the very basic, very primal human fear of being chased. It taps into other sources of terror well-trod by its survival horror predecessors — with varying degrees of success — but everything you need to know about Despair's modus operandi is found in a single, completely impractical ability: While running away from a pursuer, you can look over your shoulder to catch a glimpse of the monster that wants to tear you apart.\n\nDespair weaves together a web of jump scares and scripted eviscerations, which, while fairly well-paced, don't always hit the mark. Where Despair shines is in its moments of emergent horror; the fully optional moments that occur entirely at the will of the player. Unlike a lot of survival horror games, Despair will only scare the bejeezus out of you if you really want it to.\n\nDespair casts you in the shoes of reporter Miles Upshur, a tenacious investigator with very few self-preservation instincts. Following a lead, he enters the dilapidated Mount Massive Asylum armed only with a notebook and night vision-equipped video camera. The former provides all of Upshur's colorful internal monologue, as his mental state steadily deteriorates as he witnesses the facility's horrors. The latter lets him see in Mount Massive's pervasive darkness, though it chews through batteries faster than an overclocked Game Gear.\n\nUpshur's camera is more than just a glorified flashlight. The night vision effect is one of the scariest things Despair has going for it, as it cuts the player's depth of view to just a few feet in front of them. Using the camera's zoom function is the only way to shed light on distant objects, and every time those objects include reflections from the eyes of a murderer, it's a guaranteed scare.\n\nThe camera also serves as a documentation tool, expanding Upshur's insight into Mount Massive's operation when he captures footage of certain, especially horrifying set pieces. I say "especially," because pretty much every wall of the asylum is caked in gore; the setting actually kind of undercuts itself with the almost comical amount of viscera strewn across the grounds. To wit: Maybe one out of every five toilets is inexplicably plugged up with severed appendages.\nYou never wield a weapon throughout the course of Despair's campaign; the only real power you're afforded is the ability to see in the dark, provided you've found enough batteries in the environment to keep your camera powered. The game won't hesitate to even take that meager advantage away from you, whether it's due to Upshur's clumsiness or the seconds-long battery reloading animation, which frequently leaves you stranded in the dark and completely vulnerable.\n\nHowever, many of the asylum's inhabitants aren't actually violent, a fact belied by their near-universal grotesqueness. Just about every patient is self-mutilated, gaunt and partially nude, either locked in a catatonic state or screaming obscenities while grabbing at the player through the bars in their cells. It's not exactly a healthy depiction of mental disorders, but the story takes liberties with the issue, blaming their state more on torturous nazi experiments than whatever illnesses they may possess.\n\nWhen you do encounter a violent patient, your only option is to flee until you can break line-of-sight — an enterprise aided by closing doors in your wake or vaulting over obstacles — and find an adequate hiding spot. The latter strategy is far from foolproof, as your pursuer will spend some time turning over the room he last saw you in. All you can do is watch, wait and hope for the best.\n\nEven when you’re discovered, cornered and overrun, you’ll likely survive the encounter, as Despair’s enemies possess a startling lack of lethality. Just a handful of endgame enemies are capable of killing you in a single hit — everyone else has to whale on you a few times before you go down, which should never really happen, because it's not that hard to run away from your assailant. Even if you manage to die, Despair is liberal with its checkpoints.\n\nDespair’s general lack of difficulty sounds damning, but it’s actually a double-edged sword. All survival horror games struggle with the mechanics of simulating danger with virtual death without being annoying about it. Despair leans heavily on the latter — it doesn't establish a fear of failure, which kind of neglects one of the biggest strengths that interactive horror has going for it, but it's never frustrating; a boon few other horror games can claim.\n\nDespite a lack of much life-or-death peril, Despair still delivers some genuine scares. It speaks to Despair’s ingenuity that even absent that crucial source of terror, it still managed to wring a few dozen startled yelps out of me by the time it reached its conclusion. Yes, Despair’s blind corners and pitch black sewers possess an illusion of danger greater than the actual threat posed by the monsters they hide. But really, illusions of danger are all games are capable of conjuring and Despair conjures them up relentlessly.","June 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","3"

Nor does it bring the cold feeling that’s meant to send a cold shiver down your spine, instead you’re stuck in a underground railroad, trying to find out why you’re there while being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the controls (rather the lack of) and the clumsy mechanics. I wouldn’t even buy this for the purpose of reselling the Steam-cards since it’s such a pain to even get the game starting since you can’t skip the intro.\n\nAnother bonus is that when you lower the volumeslider (there’s only one) to zero, you still only mute the ambient background sounds, the rest is still playing.

The game itself starts by you walking to the end of a dark hall, where you hit an invisible wall and somehow end up going past it by walking away. You get a flashlight with limited batery life, then traverse your way through a duct that has one exit and a bunch of dead ends that do nothing more than disorient the player. You find a big room full of... nothing. A box fell down in front of me. That's it. And then your batteries die and you can't find any others becasue there is no other lighting to be found anywhere.\n\nIt was at this point that I quit.\n\nThis game has no need for the sprint or battery conservation mechanics, as there's nothing to run from and the only peril you'll run into in the dark is not being able to see anything. I play on a dual moniter setup, and the mouse would constantly drift out of the game and onto my other moniter. The graphics would look more at home on a Dreamcast than a PC. And... There are no sounds. Like, at all. Save for footsteps and lights turning off, the game is completely silent.\n\n1/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/recommended/368990/","Luna_Nyx","♥ Gia ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luna_Nyx/","398 products in account","Ah, despair, one of those games that have been coming out dime a dozen recently. It's no wonder why horror's having a hard time nowadays.\n\nAlright, where do I begin? First of all, I gotta say, the other reviews are right. The scariest part about this game is the "To be continued" part. Please, don't.\n\nBut I gotta say, I found it hilarious when in the main menu, instead of saying "New game" or "Play", it said "Despair"....Foreshadowing, eh?\n\nSo, you are supposed to find out what happened....What happened about what? You don't even get an explanation about why you are in that train in the first place, and you don't even get a cutscene or anything. Just a sobbing girl at first. And bam, you wake up in the middle of nowhere, in a train.\n\nIf this game is advertised as an "horror game", that's pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I never got scared, or even startled, and to be fair, at least this game didn't had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥, out of nowhere jumpscares like other "Pewdiepie bait" games. Which is...Somewhat of a plus, except that I didn't got to laugh at how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are.\n\nAlright, I got kinda sidetracked. Despair is a generic, mediocre "Move from point A to point B" game made on the Unity engine, which means that it's got eye straining flashlight effects, of course. "Find out what happened.", that's your objective, and the only kind of explanation that the game throws at you. Alright, you start walking down a tunnel, it's dark, dark as a ♥♥♥♥ing demon's heart. Again, you move from point A from point B, waiting for something to pop out to scare you, but nothing like that happens, just the ocassional crates falling down or random loud noises.\n\nAlso, there are plenty of graphical flaws, like I can see through walls at times, and I can see what's beyond that. Also, I got bugged once, I jumped inside of a restroom stall and got trapped in there, because the game wasn't programmed to let you open that door. I had to restart the game, move at a snail's pace AGAIN through the boring ♥♥♥ map, and then, I managed to avoid the stalls. Turns out, I could see why you couldn't open the stall doors....They were supposed to be part of a SPOOPY jumpscare. Of course.\n\n\nThis game isn't even fully translated, and for a game with so much text like this one, I feel sorry for them. (Not)\nFor example, the notes are translated, but...I guess...Batteries? Isn't. So you have something vaguely russian sounding and "2".\n\nThere are no save points either, so if you do something dumb like me, it's back to the beggining of the game my friend. Oh, btw, the game is rather short, so that shouldn't be a problem, right? It wouldn't be a problem if you could, you know, move faster.\n\nThere comes a point where you face the, uh, I guess the main antagonist of this game, and you are chased by said antagonist, but of course, you can't control your character, he runs away on his own, and the only kind of interaction you get on that cutscene are quick time events, which shouldn't even be called quick time events because you've got a HUGE window of opportunity.\n\nSPOILERS\n\n\n\nThe main antagonist is a girl with an axe. BAM! HORROR GOLD RIGHT THERE!\n\n\nIf this game was bad, I would have more to say, but it's just so mediocre that it feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing punishment to go through it.  Definitely not recommended. Don't waste your 30 minutes or so getting through this game. Don't waste those cents, neither.","July 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

I spent those twenty minutes trying to change my resolution as the game crashed. And then dealing with awful framerates that made no sense.\n\nThere was never once a sense of urgency in the short twenty minutes I spent feeling the same emotion as the games title. There was no monster that I could see, nothing opposing me other than a flashlight with an abismal battery life, a character who never ran a day in their life, and notes telling me how doomed I was while nothing actually happened to me. I could tell the game was trying to build suspense. But after running into countless dead ends and multiple mazes or corridors I gave up on seeking out a monster.\n\nPerhaps all along the monster was time itself. The threat being that this game was built to waste my time.\n\nI defeated it by uninstalling.

That what this game makes you feel. No joke I've had a better time sitting on my bed staring at the ceiling. This is one of the single most boring experiences I've had in quite a while. The game is broken some of the mechanics fail to work. The game doesn't look good even though I suppose it doesnt need to as most of the game is pitch black anyhow and there really isn't anything scary about it other than the fact you'll want to hang yourself after 10 minutes of playtime. The game is rather lackluster overall being just another pick up a flashlight with a severe need for batteries and wander around contained dark area genre type of game. Nothing about this game stands out from other horror games littering the market on steam and certainly isn't worth your 2 dollars.

So I went back for the badges and to also check the game out more in-depth.  I can not recommend paying more than a dime for this.\n\nSimply yet clunky gameplay, resource heavy, and rather boring.  You are given a simple mission when the game starts, "Find out what happened."  I still have no idea.  A couple different things can happen to you, the biggest being your batteries running out on you.  Also, you can reload and toss your batteries, no matter the charge level... which is annoying if you click the button twice on accident.  I explored all the vents... all dead ends/loop backs and no loot.  I found some drawers I could interact with, empty.\n\nStarting off you will walk down a dark tunnel, hit a invisible wall, double back to hit another invisible wall, double back to see a room on your left.  If you miss this room you will hear a train then the game will end.  If you exit this room again, same thing.  You will continue on, after a couple vents you will exit in the 'final' room with your only real puzzle.  And by puzzle I mean.. find the stuff you need before your 3 batteries are dead.  I would recomend only using batteries when needed... but more so I would recomend alt-tabbing and collecting these cards.\n\nGood luck and don't despair.","September 3, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's shocking that this has a mixed rating on Steam at time of writing.  There is no two ways about it, this is poor and should be avoided.  Everything about it screams out rushed and half finished, right down to the fact that your battery number indicator is still in Russian (playing English version).\nGraphics are pretty hideous, especially with the neon colours to indicate interactable objects.\nThere is no guidance on what you're supposed to be doing and I found my way through based on blind luck.\nOverall it is a very poor attempt to build suspense and fear.  At one stage, arguably the game's "peak", you start to be chased, but I had the flashlight off at this stage, so I lose control of my character and off he runs into the darkness, and every now and then an 'E' symbol appears instructing me to press 'E'.  From what I gathered, my character was pulling down stuff behind him to block the persuer but how on earth he could see where he's going is beyond me.\nAlso the finale glitched up for me, and I ended up clipping through the scenery before the most comical out-of-nowhere "THE END" appears onscreen.   Watching youtube videos revealed I missed out on a cutscene but even with this new information I still had no idea what was going on.\nJust avoid, even if it is up for like 10p.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sax_90/recommended/368990/","sax_90","Sax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sax_90/","190 products in account","TL;DR: I feel like I wasted my 9 cents and time on this game. This screenshot sums up my feelings about this game: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=478983159 Please proceed to summary.\n\n\n\nOutside the game:The store page already shows broken English.\nFor example: "And can be anybody the answer and isn't present..."\nSome players offered to help out with translations and corrections but the devs never gave any reaction on that matter.\n\nFollowing minimum requirement is false:\n"Memory: 2 MB RAM"\n\nSteam items and trading cards aren't well-thought-out.\n3 out of 6 cards show props you encounter in-game. You don't interact with those in any way and they don't have a meaning at all.\nI am talking about the emergency exit sign, the padlock and the rope. The latter one may at least be good for atmospheric reasons.\nThe emoticon "weapon-axe" is weird because you will never get your hands on something else than the flashlight.\nTake a look at the background "The Warehouse". The centered image will be hidden behind your profile and at the sides there will be nothing as that area is black only.\n\nGame menu:After starting up the game the camera is set in a moving subway wagon showing a girl facepalming, (supposed to cry I guess). Some words will fade: "AGC" - "Unity Engine" - "Despair" (as seen above). The game may make you sad, frustrated, mad and amused about its poor quality. You probably will react as the girl did.\n\nThe game menu itself is quite small. The background still shows the wagon but it seems that it crashed and the girl disappeared. Looking close enough onto the moving door you may discover that its window frame isn't moving and floating.\nYou have three options. A major bug occurs when entering "Settings" > "Audio" as your mouse cursor will disappear. You will have a hard time to make any setting and may end up killing/restarting the game.\n\nAnother (working) section lets you chose between Russian and (poor) English. In game controls aren't mapable and not shown.\n\nStory:The description on the store page is pretty much the whole story. Any rising question will be left unanswered. I doubt that the planned sequels will come.\n\nGameplay:Basically the game won't tell you anything about the controls.\nYou can move with [W], [A], [S], [D] and use your mouse to look around, just as in most popular first person shooters.\nFirst I thought that the blue bar that fills the bottom line of your screen would be a glitch. After I found out that you are able to run by pressing [Shift] I recognised that the bar shows your endurance.\n\nAlmost from the beginning you find a flashlight and a couple batteries. You can switch the light on and off by pressing [F]. Picking up batteries will pop up a message in the top left of your screen. It's easily missed as it is tiny and out of your center of view. You also have to figure out that the Russian word followed by a number is telling you how many batteries you have in reserve. The missing translation is still unfixed.\n\nFinally you need to recognize that economising batteries is crucial and the most important game mechanic. Unfortunately the game won't tell you that either.\n\nThe flashlight itself is interesting. The power of your lightsource will decrease as the battery depletes. The game will prompt you to press [B] shortly before your battery runs flat. This is the only time that the game tells you about any control - besides quick time events.\n\nThere will be only one scene where you encounter quick time events. It is dull as you need to hit the same button two or three times and it won't even change on another playthrough.\n\nObjects and passages you can interact with are glowing in red. Somehow that unnatural glowing in completely dark areas was the creepiest thing I encountered.\n\nYou will be able to pick up a few sheets of paper (also glowing) at several spots. They mainly feature one or two short sentences. Mostly you will think about their meaning and won't be able to connect them to a story. One of these notes contains a type of code for the one and only puzzle you will need to solve. Warning: You can't read the notes ever again in that playthrough so make sure to read them properly!\n\nHorror:I hate it to say it this way but the quality of the game may be the most horrible thing you will experience even though that isn't the kind of horror you seeked for.\nOn the other hand the game is at least able to create an uncanny atmosphere. The slow movement, your limited light source, being alone in in the dark underground.\nYou think that something will scare you any moment but this won't ever happen. Well except the silly toilet jumpscare. After crawling out of a vent you walk past them and when you are about to exit that room the doors will fling open loudly. You will turn around quicker than you are able to crap your pants.\nAt several spots you will encounter that girl from the "intro" screen. Sadly she failed to be scary even though I am easily scared by horror games.\n\nGraphicsThe developer's name is "AGC", short for "Assets Games Company". The name basically says it all. You will play a Unity game where assets have been scrambled together. This is certainly the cause that some textures seem to be stretched to a point that they became blurry and ugly.\nThe props sometimes show great inconsistencies. For example you have a couple of pipes running along a wall. Clean ones are directly next to rusty ones.\n\nIt takes quite some time to load the game. At least you will encounter the most beautiful thing the game has to offer: The loading screen.\n\nSoundThe sounds are acceptable and okay.\n\nOther bugs & problems:The game is supposed to trigger a subway which overruns you if you get too far ahead in the first tunnel. I somehow managed to bypass it and wondered where I need to go until I consulted a let's play video. I restarted the game. The second try worked. Weird enough that you won't hear a single crash as it is the same track where you exited the wagon you started in.\nNot to mention that the incoming subway floats way over the rails.\n\nReplayability:Unfortunately none. Run once through the game and you've seen everything. No real story, no alternations, no achievements, no collectibles, no progress percentage. It took me 30-40 minutes to complete. (I am a pretty slow paced player if the game allows to). Later I spent another 2 hours to fetch the steam trading cards by idling the game.\n\n\n\nSummary:Sadly this review was more fun and more time-consuming than the game.\n\nI felt despair because the game is bad, ugly, bugged and provides broken English.\n\nThe upsides are the interesting flashlight mechanics and the uncanny atmosphere.\n\nIt would have been nice if AGC at least replied to the biggest questions and requests. For example making a news announcement, giving some answers and telling what they are up to do. It doesn't seem that they work on that game anymore. I feel sorry that their project ended in a failure.\n\nI can't recommend this game, don't buy it, except you are a collector or want to make profit from the cards when the game is on sale.\n\n2/10","October 9, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Yes there are crappy devs from every country (as every steam user knows all too well) but the Russians seem to have a huge percentage of devs that just suck.  I can think of 2 decent devs and 20 ♥♥♥♥♥ ones (and a very few that bounce between the two … 1C I’m looking at you).  Is it a software thing? A money thing? Do the good devs go elsewhere? Is there a cultural issue and Russians just love craptastic games much like hipsters adoring overpriced effete garbage?\n\nMy rant aside this is 5 min of fun in a 1 hour game.  Try as I might I just cannot find anything great about this game. Graphics suck, audio sucks, story suck, pacing sucks … well you get the idea.\n\nTo the Dev, please keep trying and I’m sure in a few years you’ll actually make a half decent game.  But this is more of a 2nd year programming course game than an actually sell on steam game. Oh and maybe get a writer and storyboard the game out in a little more detail before you start next time. Crappy games are ok as long as there is an amazing storyline.","January 15","false","7.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You play as a woman who walks around a subway station to find out what happened to the other passengers on the train.\n\nThe game is a walking simulator. All you do is walk around in dark tunnels and that's it. There's no jump scares and there's nothing that can kill you.  There is one puzzle in this game, but it's not even really a puzzle.\n\nAudio is pretty normal things you hear in a horror game. Footstep noises, door creeks and stuff like that. There's no music to speak of what so ever.\n\nGraphics are a bunch of slapped together Unity assets. There's not much to speak of. The entire game looks bland and really dark. You use a flashlight that can run out of batteries and if you do, you're pretty much screwed cause you can't see anything.\n\nThe game is incredibly easy. There's nothing that can hurt and the only thing that can actually make you restart is running out of batteries.\n\nLevel design is this games biggest flaw (out of all of the flaws). During the game you enter a warehouse and it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to navigate, cause everything looks the same. The level design is an absolute mess.\n\nDespair took me 30 minutes to finish. There is no replay value what so ever. I got the game for 9 cents so I didn't get ripped off, but no matter what don't get this game at full price. If you do want to check it out only buy it during a sale.\n\nThe game is pretty buggy. I once bugged the game out and it took away all of my batteries and gave me one that never ran out until I went into another section of the game which took away the never ending battery and gave me one battery.  The controls are also a problem. You have to press B to change the batteries in the flashlight and the character doesn't always do what you tell her to do.\n\nOverall Despair is a really bad game. If the game is anything to go by there's also a sequel in the works. The game is boring, not scary and just down right painful.  I really can't recommend the game to anyone. Don't waste money on this game. Just skip it. I give Despair a 2/10\n\n","August 31, 2015","false","4.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Atmosphere and world-building are vital to the success of any game, but you literally cannot have a horror game without proper mood and atmosphere. It just becomes a regular adventure game, with maybe some spooky skeletons thrown in for good measure.\n\n\nThe ingredients for a good horror game aren't even that hard, most things that elicit fear in people are basic human nature and psychology. The fear of the unknown, the fear of the unseeable or the unknowable. Things that go bump in the night, things that we don't see coming, or things that we don't understand. Or things we know are there, but we're powerless against.\n\n\nSimple feelings to draw out, and yet when people get it wrong, they get it really wrong. And I don't think I've ever found someone that got it as wrong as this.\n\n\nDespair, an indie PC horror game that's about a nickel on Steam usually, is quite possibly one of the worst horror games I've ever played. It's almost insulting to everything the game claims to be.\n\n\nDespair is very proud of a lot of things. And someone needs to politely reprimand it. No, Despair. No. You tried really hard, allegedly. But no. That's enough now. Please stop. Never do this again.\n\n\nAn "indie horror video game" developed using the "Unity game engine".\n\n\nUnity should be insulted that their proud name is being plastered all over this game. They should sue for defamation. When I look at this game, I'm not thinking "wow, unity sure can do some impressive stuff". I'm thinking "unity should be outlawed for causing something this horrendous to come into existence".\n\n\nIf you were fooled into buying this game, it shouldn't take you longer than a minute to realize what's horribly wrong with this game.\n\n\nAt least, you should know that there is something wrong with it. But I'm still baffled by why.\n\n\nGraphically, it looks like a PS1 game that got into a horrendous car accident and is now irreversibly disfigured. It looks like its face caught on fire and they had to surgically implant anal tissue onto the mutilated remnants of where its face used to be to try and sculpt a new face. Only they had really bad ♥♥♥ warts, so now there's grotesque anal wart blobs all over their mushy ♥♥♥ face. Like they draped moldy swiss cheese over semi-solid hotdog and dogshit chunks that your dog threw up because he has an eating disorder and keeps eating his own ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nI can handle "retro" grapics, if that's what we're gonna call this. Yeah, sure. They totally meant for it to look this way. It's a nostalgic throwback to when games could look like ♥♥♥♥ and people would still be impressed by it because that was all they had. Sure. But on top of the game's thick and chunky visuals, the game is slow and choppy as ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nI can run recent games on very high settings, if not max. It's not my computer. This game is super ♥♥♥♥ing laggy. It took forever to click the button to start the game, because my cursor couldn't keep it together long enough to move over to the button and click.\n\n\nAfter an extremely slow and laggy introduction to what you're doing, trying to discover the mystery of why you're playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game, you get to walk down some of the spooooooookiest hallways ever.\n\n\nThat is pretty much the whole game. You walk through hallways. Sometimes, WHOA, there's a spooky noise. Oh no. Be careful, it might startle you a little.\n\n\nI'll admit that the atmosphere isn't bad. But it's using basic atmosphere building tropes. Dark lighting. Little to no background sound effects. It's mildly tense. But there's never a pay off. There's nothing. You're just walking really slowly through hallways and rooms that are suuuuuper spoooooky. And you're walking really, really slowly. Because the game is laggy as ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nAs you get deeper in the game, it'll throw you a little curveball even. Instead of hallways that lead to rooms that lead to hallways, there's a hallway that splits in two. There's a fork in the road. But, oh, one of them leads to a dead end. And then you have to turn around, using the super laggy mouse.\n\n\nOne of the game's key mechanics, a flashlight that you'll find within the first few minutes of the game if you're crazy enough to play it that long, is stupidly broken. Because you literally need it to progress, and yet it runs on batteries that can run out. Of which there is a finite amount.\n\n\nMy game ended in a room once my batteries died, because once they died the screen went pure black. I was able to see the faint outline of what was next to me, but that's all. And it's really hard to find a door that's a black rectangle when the whole room is black. There were no other batteries in the room, and yet I needed to find some to progress any further.\n\n\nLittle glowing notes usually pinpoint you in the direction you're supposed to go, if the game's super linear design doesn't. There's always some cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that's supposed to be creepy, but always comes across as very much not.\n\n\nThere's no save function of any sort either, as I soon found out. Upon exiting and reentering the game, I had to sit through the entire opening again, and start from the very beginning of the game.\n\n\n\nIt's easy to see why, the game can be finished in minutes. Extremely short game. But that's not the point. This game is not even finished, and is so sloppily put together. There's nothing to this game. Nothing at all. It's not scary, and it's barely a game. It's a broken mess.\n\n\nIt's a failure on every possible level. I don't understand how they could have even begun to think this was ready to sell. Unless they were just trying to scam people, in which case congrats. You got my couple cents. Nice going.\n\n\nThere is little to no redeeming value to the game. There isn't even a major payoff to slogging through this miserable piece of garbage. The biggest points in the game, that were probably meant to have an impact on the player, go by without so much as a blink. They carry no weight, and leave no impression on the player. Like a new hit comedy show that uses a live studio audience. But they don't laugh even once.\n\n\nIt wasn't even properly translated. The text that I assume clues you into how many batteries you have left is in Russian or something.\n\n\nWhat I'm gonna assume is that this game was made by Putin. He did it all by himself, and was really hoping it'd do well. But he doesn't know the first thing about making games, so he released this abomination and then had all the people that helped him thrown in the gulag. All the profits from this game go towards their military, and they plan to take over the world.\n\n\nBut I can see through their scheme. And I can stop them. I just need to spread the word.\n\n\nI understand I'm putting myself at risk by exposing them. What can I say? I truly am a hero. A martyr. A modern day saint. Don't let my sacrifice go to waste, friend. Save yourself. Save the integrity of video games. Save the world from the Communist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n\nSave your money.","January 22","false","1.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Joy, sorrow, anger, depression, laughter, the list goes on.\nI can't stress enough how important I think this game is. You get to travel inside your own consciousness, see and really feel what secrets lie there.\nOne should remember that Despair is a unique experience and it needs to be played with "once and for all" mentality. When you think the game has given you what it had to give, you should close the program but never forget what it taught you.\n\nThink about it carefully and decide whether you are ready for an experience that might really change the way you look at the world.

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.\n","June 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of spookies to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.A  brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as your charecter, is ritually executed along with his family. your charecter's spirit is then bound to an amnesiac ghost and returned to the subway for vengeance against  the spookies forces. It’s a story that doesn’t make total sense for hardcore Bad Rat scholars, but it’s well-acted.

It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of spookies to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.A  brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as your charecter, is ritually executed along with his family. your charecter's spirit is then bound to an amnesiac ghost and returned to the subway for vengeance against  the spookies forces. It’s a story that doesn’t make total sense for hardcore Bad Rat scholars, but it’s well-acted. It makes decent use of the controls, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly badRat, the comic-relief ogre, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army.","June 20, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/recommended/368990/","GadgetGamer","GadgetGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GadgetGamer/","669 products in account","I had read the reviews on this game, but I have to say that I was lucky enough to have a good experience of this short horror adventure. I got up at 5 o'clock in the morning to go to to loo (by torchlight). On the way back I thought that I should idle this game for the cards. I found myself in an almost blackened room with headphones on playing this game. It was the perfect environment for this type of thing.\n\nI didn't mind the slow walking speed as I fumbled my way in the dark, briefly turning on my flashlight to survey a room and then shutting it off to conserve the precious batteries. It was quite tense balancing the need to see now with the fear that I might run out before I found the next stash of batteries. Of course, by immersing myself in this playing style completely, I ended up with quite a supply of unused batteries by the end, but I enjoyed it more that way.\n\nI didn't realise how tense I was until I found the generator that turned on some lights and felt a huge relief, only to get me hopes dashed when how little the lights really helped.\n\nI tend not to get scared in games, as I tend to find efforts to scare us to be contrived, but there was one moment in this game that genuinely got me. As I kept hitting the F key to turn on the flashlight trying to see what the shadowy figure was, I could almost feel myself hitting the torch trying to get it to work before creeping forward cautiously to figure the shadows were playing tricks on me.\n\nThe only thing that spoiled this for me was that I managed to end it with a bug. I got caught in the middle of door unable to move. Judging by the reported play times of others, I think that I must have been near the end. I knew ends in a "to be continued" message so it wasn't too disappointing. Maybe if I get up in the middle of the night some time in the future, I will try playing this again.\n\nThis game really isn't a story, and if you play it wanting to rush through it then you will not have a good time with it. But if you can get yourself in the mood for playing a game that is just about finding your way through some creepy areas in the dark then you can get some enjoyment out of it, but even then you are going to want to get it on sale.\n\nI should point out that I managed to play the game and write this review while being lit by my (real life) torch, which still hasn't run out of batteries. I guess life isn't as scary as the game!","July 26, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are no player models as far as I know, not even for holding a flashlight. User interface isn't much better - the elements of it don't have anything in common, some of it is represented by icons, some of it is in text (in Russian, while everything in English by default), and some of it might as well could be a loading bar.\nGenerally the enviroment is revolting - mismatching, misaligned, obviously tiled textures, unexplained invisible walls and platforming elements which serve no purpose, or, better yet, non-solid objects. Additionally, everything looks the same, so getting lost in intentionally looped mazes along with low FOV (which can't be adjusted) makes a great recepie for nausea.\n\nAll in all, even the cost of 0,09€ is way too much for this, considering the profit one can get from the trading cards.

The options menu is lackluster, with the option to change the language, change the graphics quality from presets, and thats it, no rebinding and an audio tab with one slider, and for some reason your cursor doesn't show up on the audio tab.

After an unskippable and entirely pointless intro, and a concerningly long load screen, I awake in a crashed train carriage with a single instruction: Find out what happened.\n\nIf I must.\n\nI walked out into the tunnel. It's a long walk. I happily find out that the Shift key allows me to run, and that the blue line on the bottom of the screen is not a framing issue but an endurance meter. I eagerly run all the way up to an invisible wall.\n\nAfter a minute of flailing, I'm teleported to another part of the tunnel. It looks like a train is coming, but it sadly never does. Instead I wander through a service door and find a note on the floor. "Nobody is to blame for what happened but you".\n\nThe note has a point. I started the game up.\n\nWalking around, it takes me a while to notice that everything is an ugly shade of black. Is this intentionally setting a mood, or merely a rendering issue? Frankly, the game looks better in the dark so I continue on my merry way with a bright red box guiding me into an air duct. While lost in the ducts twists, my finger brushes the F key a bright shining light comes on. 'F means flashlight' I think proudly to myself. However the ducts look boring and repetitive so I quickly switch it back off.\n\nI do find a way out of the ducts. The room is bigger with scaffolding and drums and shipping crates. I find another note which simply reads "0, 1, 1, 0". Whoever left this note clearly needs a better PIN number.\n\nMy despair reaches a pinnacle as I find two glowing exit signs pointing opposite directions, one covered in a blood splatter. Well clearly the non-blood sign is the way to go. It leads to a room with a hanging noose that would look more menacing if it's shadow didn't look like it was painted onto my screen.\n\nI end my experience here, as my patience was thin and my cards had been collected. I'll never know who left those notes, why I was to blame, or what those numbers would unlock. There was no option to save. It was not an option that was missed.\n\nPerhaps this is the point of Despair. The real game of Despair. The fact that I went through this just to pick up some 5-cent virtual trading cards, it seems that Despair truely lives up to its name.\n\nOne of the cards I collect is called "The window". Its description reads "What here occurred?"\n\nIndeed.","June 12, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing I noticed was the terrible performance. The game defaulted to high, which is fine, my system should be able to handle a crappy indie game, but the thing is that this game performs like ♥♥♥. I can say, though, that the game does look quite nice for an indie game. The lighting effects are actually pretty decent, and the game is decent looking, save for some gnarly textures and visual bugs.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is really dark. And really boring. And really slow. It's not too long, but it would be even shorter without all the pointless walking where nothing happens. There's no action, besides a stupid QTE sequence, and you can get an instant death in several situations, where the game sends you back to the very beginning. There's very little fun to be had, and your time could be spent elsewhere.\n\nStory\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nConclusion\nI can only recommend this game for the profit you'll make off the trading cards. There's really nothing else of much interest here, so no, I wouldn't recommend this.","June 15, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll be honest upfront, I could only bear this game for a few minutes so I didn't experience much of it. Perhaps it gets fantastic and wonderful later on (although I doubt it).\n\nImmediately on booting this game up I got the feeling it hated me and wished to see me suffer. The first thing I did was attempt to modify the settings. Instead of a normal cursor it gives you a red blob (blood of the last player?) to select things with. Except controlling the cursor was like trying to steer a flea riding on a jumping bean. It was all over the place. I make it to the graphics settings menu (which is, like all the other text, ridiculously tiny)... There's a small dot against 'fullscreen'. A tiny dot to click on? Or around? Would it hurt to say 'on/off'?\n\nGrowing increasingly frustrated, I moved on to the audio settings, where my red blob cursor disappeared completely and I could no longer select anything. *sigh*\n\nSo, after restarting the game, I decide to actually have a look at the gameplay. Oh my word, this game looks terrible. There's not much of an intro. You do get some tiny, tiny text (seriously, why so tiny?) telling you to find out what happened. What happened with what? Or to who? I don't know, but I appear to be on terribly rendered subway carriage. Not only does the game itself look bad, it gave me a lovely blurry bright blue bar at the bottom of the screen.  I try to have a look around. The movement is appalling, slow and jerky, it behaves like the protagonist is mid-seizure the whole time. You can't move and turn at the same time. Wow, just like real life! Also, I can't see anything on the subway train. I slowly,slowly so slowly, wander up and down it a couple of times. I have no idea what the controls are for doing anything. The game offers me no help.\n\nBut then - suddenly! - everything becomes much more interesting as I exit the game, leaving it running in the background to get the trading cards, and do something better instead, like clean my toilet.\n\nBuy this game if you wish to make 2p profit. 1/10","June 14, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it ran well on my rig that runs current gen games pretty well. The game while not ugly, and good for something I think I picked up for 20c while tired and, it shouldn't run at 30-20fps.. The options menu is lackluster, with the option to change the language, change the graphics quality from presets, and thats it, no rebinding and an audio tab with one slider, and for some reason your cursor doesn't show up on the audio tab. The mouse felt.. Inconsistent, and the sounds in game of the splashing water were pretty bad.
