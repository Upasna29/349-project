Well, Tobe's Vertical Adventure is a Side-Scrolling... Er, Up-n'-Down-Scrolling(?) platformer where the idea is to get from the top of a cave to the bottom and then make your escape back to the entrance, all while collecting gems and animals as you descend/ascend. It offers two different playable characters for singleplayer and multiplayer story modes across four different worlds, each with four levels. So lets get started shall we?\n\n\nFirst of all I'd like to mention the presentation. The majority of the game is represented in the form of sprites, with some art slides that are used as cutscenes and such. The style of the art is nice; it's a simplistic style where everything is gratuitously round for some reason or another. I'm being told it's cute, but something about the hips of both characters being twice the size of their heads puts me off... Anyway, it works, but it's nothing I can say is spectacular. The in-game sprites also look okay and have decent animation to them, but I noticed that a fair few of them were blurry or lacked sharpness, specifically the character sprites. Overall, it's a quaint artstyle, but it's nothing to write home about.\n\n\nAudio is also just okay. Not a lot of music to listen to; There's the menu music, one track for each world, and then some cutscene music. Once again, none of it is /really/ good, just kinda okay. I suppose I liked the 1st and 3rd world's music the best, seeing as I remember them the most, but it's still all... Whatever y'know? Sound effects as well, which really wouldn't even be noted in this review if it wasn't for the fact that many sound effects occuring at the same time will cause the sound to increase in volume exponentially. Collecting gems becomes a little less fun when you start hearing "ding, Ding, DING, DDDIIIINNNGGG" as you pick them up in groups.\n\n\nPut hey, as long as the gameplay if fun, right?... Er, well, it's okay. That's the word of the day folks. As previously mentioned, you start at the top of the level and must make your way down to a chest at the bottom. You'll encounter stage-specific traps and collect power-ups such as balloons and ropes... Which is to say those are the only items you collect. Balloons allow you to float down for a short period of time and ropes can be thrown to the ceiling where they'll hang down and you can climb them. In all honesty though, I never really /needed/ these items. Aside from using balloons to break my fall simply so I could go down a vertical shaft a little more quickly for my own convenience, everything can be done almost, if not just as easily without these items. They /can/ occasionally be used to make speedruns easier, but speedrunning, while encouraged, is not the main focus of the game.\n\n\nThe worlds don't have a whole lot of diference in them either. The first one is just a cave; there are some enemies that walk back and forth, nothing really special. The second world is an ice world that introduces horizontally positioned ropes, and has invisible blocks as one of it's level gimmicks. There's also a trap that's, like, an impossible-to-see fake wall that'll drop on you from the background, but it only appears twice and it's where you'll be running so fast that you'll pass them without a second thought. Third world is the lava world, so there's lava and stuff. This world has these bubbles that'll pop and bounce you up when you land on them, which make the platforming a little more interesting. Thing is, these bubbles reform waaayy too fast, so you'll encounter vertical shafts with unavoidable bubbles in them so that you can quickly ascend, but on the way down will only bounce you up and reform before you fall beyond them. Lastly there's the pyramid island. There's some shooty traps, there are some annoying spike traps, and some crushers. Nothing entirely notable really.\n\n\nWhat IS kinda cool about this game is the escape bit of the levels. Once you get to the bottom, you have to unlock a chest which causes the cave to crumble while you make your escape. You have a limited amount of time, which can be extended by 10 or 15 seconds depending on how well you do on the chest unlocking QTE. At this point in time, the level changes, destroying certain walls and platforms to allow for certain shortcuts and various hazards. It can also make getting the collectibles easier, but you also have a time limit, so you kinda have a risk/reward thing goin' on there. You can even see what blocks will be destroyed when the cave crumbles, so you can semi-plan your escape route on your way down!\n\n\nFinally, lets talk about the characters. There's not a whole lot to say about them; both can grab ledges, wall-jump, and roll. Tobe, the yellow one, is faster and can do a short wall-run. The controls for the wall-run are fairly clunky and imprecise though, so I'd always screw it up at vital points in time. Nana, the pink one, on the other hand is slower, has less health, but has a double jump. This double jump allows her to make ascend quickly, break a long fall, take short cuts, and basically wall-climb. She is by far the easier character of the two, as reflected by the stricter speedrun times in the achievement sections. The game was short enough as it is, but even after clearing the game 100%, Nana got me through it in a little under a half hour.\n\n\nAnd that's kinda the whole problem with the game. It's pretty short, and what little there is of it has a lack of substance. Playing through the game as both characters was probably an hour's work, and that's with doing the previously mentioned 100% completion. And that's not even mentioning the various glitches I've come across, including but not limited to being clipped inside of a wall consistantly after being hit on a particular level, or stuttering scrolling during co-op play. Match that with head-scratching desgin choices like unnoticable but sparsley placed wall traps, or quickly respawning bubbles, and this game is a short, unpolished, substance-lacking "meh" of a game.\n\n\nThe one place where this game shines to it's fullest though is it's co-op, which is still flawed in a way thanks to the lack of duo-controller support and the fact that it's local-only. Still, in co-op, there are some extra moves you can pull off such as head bouncing or pulling the other player up a ledge, which made for some interesting multiplayer-specific shortcuts. Two players also collect gems and animals more quickly and efficiently, making the experience a touch more streamlined.  Good luck finding someone who'll play it with you though, even if it would only be a half-hour.\n\n\nBut hey, that's all just my opinion. Cross reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you. Though personally, there's juuuust enough wrong with the game to lean it towards the negative side of meh, and I really wouldn't pick it up unless it was on sale or something.","September 7, 2015","false","11.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Wall jumping in particular is a pain but really there's just a lot of weirdness here.\n\nThe neat thing about this game is the way levels start you off going down, then hurry you back upwards with more paths unlocked. It's actually generally pretty clever level design and only a few levels really spoil this by forcing you to wait for an obstacle to be out of the way.\n\nThat being said it's also fairly glitchy and clipping through walls/platforms is not an uncommon occurence. Not a huge hindrance but it's there.\n\nThe music and graphics are fairly standard 16-bit type stuff, nothing really special.\n\nThe control scheme is also quite awkward and if I ever thought directly about which button to press I'd always end up pressing the wrong one. It's just strange.\n\nThis probably isn't a "bad" game but it's not one I particularly enjoyed, it's a very "meh" game more than anything. It's also really short, 16 levels that can be completed in a few minutes each. Probably not really worth it for the price, that's also a part of my rating here. Honestly it's possible to have some fun with this game but it's not a high-quality experience even still.","October 19, 2014","false","5.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

The music's catchy and really slick, the art and spritework is topnotch and cute, and the game is very much playable and charming. The game also sports a co-op mode where you can get a friend locally to play the game with you. Plus the game has bonus extras for collecting allt he critters and meeting goals set by the game itself.\n\nThe only real big downsides to this game is that it is VERY short and often jsut a wee bit buggy with climbing walls and such, often leading to lost time or clipping. However it's a rare occurance and doesn't take too much away from what is a short and very cute game.

As the titular Tobe and his would-be girlfriend Nana, you embark on a quest to loot every island you come across and making off with as much gold as you can carry. A simple plot for a simple game, it sets up Tobe's most interesting feature.\n\nEach level is structured like that of a cave, starting you off at the top and forcing you to make your way down to the treasure somewhere at the bottom. When you finally get your prize, the cave begins to collapse opening new paths and sending you scrambling for the surface before time runs out and you are trapped under the rubble. It's a cool mechanic that I haven't seen other games do, and works well given the somewhat nonlinear level design that lets you choose from several different paths going both downwards and upwards. Being able to run off one side of the screen and pop out the other also allows for more creative traversal, which is the game's strongest asset.\n\nBut aside from this much of the game is rather clumsy, especially in terms of controls and movement. Essentially you move as a mix of Sonic 2's underwater levels with the original Prince of Persia's acrobatic hijinks. Tobe can run up walls, slide under gaps, and dangle from hanging branches, whereas Nana swaps the wall climb for a double jump. This sounds great on paper would work fantastically with the open level designs, if only the characters controlled with any consistency. Button presses register only part of the time, your jump is terribly weak which makes scaling walls frustratingly unpredictable, and movement as a whole feels like Sonic plodding through a muddy swamp.\n\nThe second problem is the game is alarmingly short. I completed all 16 levels in just over an hour, which for the price feels quite insufficient. Theoretically you could double this time if you plan to play through with both characters, but they play so similarly I don't believe it to be worth doing so.\n\nAll the while I was playing I couldn't help but think how much Tobe's Vertical Adventure feels like a flash game awkwardly dressed up as a full game and put up on Steam as if players wouldn't notice. If it wasn't for the terrible controls I could still recommend it at sale prices, but unfortunately they ruined my enjoyment of the game and I wouldn't feel right advising others to purchase it. I'm quite disappointed to have to say it too because the level designs, art and music are not half bad, but a platformer with bad controls is like a sandwich without bread. It just doesn't work.","January 12, 2014","false","1.1"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","1"

There are three modes, each with the same set of 16 levels: Tobe, Nana, and Co-op. Tobe has basic controls while Nana is slower and has a shorter jump. However, Nana can double jump, which beaks the game (you can get almost anywhere). You're given ropes to get up to places more easily and balloons to make longer jumps, but I found myself rarely using them. Animals and treasure chests are placed throughout the level to collect and some are put in tricky places (as Tobe, at least). For a small game like this, the soundtrack is nice.\nMy gripes with the game are its controls and its length. Sometimes the controls were unresponsive/odd (on an Xbox 360) controller and there were unpolished aspects. As said before, it's the same 16 levels and the game only took me a couple of hours to beat. If it interests you, I'd only get it at 75% off.","July 14, 2012","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything about controlling Tobe feels clunky and awkward which makes traversing each level frustrating rather than fun. Considering that the latter half of every level is against the clock such imprecise controls just result in an unpleasent and unsatisfying gaming experience.\n\nNavigating the confusing menus and UI is equally frustrating and, even though you can redefine the game controls, you still have to use the hard-coded defaults to operate the UI. This means that even when dismissing in-game dialogs while you are playing (i.e. when you read a sign) you still have to use the J and K keys.\n\nWhile the art is quite cute and Cave Story-esque I can't see much else to recommend here.","June 13, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/105700/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","This doesn't seem to be a very popular game and with only 18 reviews (at the time of writing this), nearly half of them are negative. It seems that most of them are complaining about the unresponsive controls or glitches, which is a surprise to me because I never actually had a problem with either. I suppose there are a few minor bugs, like the options returning to default every time you open the game up again, but it's certainly nothing that interfered with my experiance. I did however have to re-map the keys. It wasn't much trouble to do, but it made the largest difference. The way the controls were originally set up made the game very difficult and hard to navigate the character. For anyone that may be having the same problem- I set it to the WASD keys for movement and J, K, L for running, jumping, and to use balloons/ropes. For me, this method worked perfectly.\n\nSomething I didn't like about the game the lack in variety between the two characters. You can play as Tobe, his girlfriend Nana, or have both of them at the same time as a sort of co-op if you have a friend in the room. This will be an impossible feat though unless one of you, if not both, have a controller. Many people in the other reviews very positively recommended Nana, and I don't understand why because although she can double jump, her controls are very clunky and over all, she just feels incredibly clumsy to handle and harder to navigate. She is much slower even when running, and therefore she has a has a harder time getting through timed gates and getting away from enemies. Although her double jump can reach places Tobe can not, I still didn't find Nana worth playing as because Tobe can just use a rope. On top of that he is much faster, more agile, and has wall run which is over all much more useful. Nana also had a very strong and strange weakness that caused a lot of deaths and added a difficulty to the game that it did not need. When she is hanging from a rope or a ledge and jumps, the first jump does absolutely nothing. She gains no vertical altitude from it what so ever and falls straight away. It is only the second jump that does anything, and it barely does much. It definately does not have the same effect that her double jump has when standing on a solid surface. So I would not recommend Nana, but Tobe is very acrobatic and acrobatic, and will quickly over come obstacles and climb things with a very stream lined feel.\n\nI feel that I should also warn about the lack of depth in story. Although this won't bother everyone, some people like a more immersive story. You get a brief slide show about Nana wanting to look for treasure, forcing Tobe to go with her who just wants to stay home and play video games, and then upon completing each world you get a short scene each time that more or less says "The treasure isn't here. It's on another island" sort of thing like how Super Mario Brothers did with, "Your princess is in another castle." The way they did the story did feel natural to the game and fit in. I thought it was cute, but looking back on it, I do wish there was more to it but I guess with a simple retro style game as treasure hunting, you don't really need a complex story.\n\nThis game does not have much replay value, and it isn't some amazing experiance, but I do recommend it because it's still very enjoyable. The platforming is very fluid and fun, and it was a great feeling to just rush through the level without much of anything slowing me down after some practice.","October 9, 2011","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is basically no story. Controls are given in non-gamepad instructions when your gamepad is plugged in. There are 4 worlds, but they have the EXACT same look and layout just with the color of the blocks changed. You can jump, roll, and have 2 abilities. Jumping is terrible, it is super slow and floaty. You will wall jump and barely move out to the side. Half the time when you jump you think you can make it but your guy never will. Some of the worst actual platforming I have seen in a platformer. The rolling is inconsistent because you have to be holding sprint, moving to the side, and then press down, but it doesn't work half the time. You cannot use direcitonal pad, as only analogs work for some reason. Every level you go to the bottom and then just run back up to the top. There is a little bit of destruction but its basically just the same thing.\n\nThe poor level design and the time limit on getting to the top make it so if you die you have to restart, and if you accidentally press the wrong button because they aren't labeled correctly on the pause menu, you have to restart the level.Both of the abilities are finnicky and poorly done. The rope doesn't shoot up above you and you can never tell where it will go exactly. The balloons if you let of them you drop, as opposed to toggling, which makes more sense.\n\nAll in all the lack of proper player control, the poor platforming, and the reused uninteresting level design and repetitiveness just screen free flash game, but they charged 5 dollars for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/105700/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","This doesn't seem to be a very popular game and with only 18 reviews (at the time of writing this), nearly half of them are negative. It seems that most of them are complaining about the unresponsive controls or glitches, which is a surprise to me because I never actually had a problem with either. I suppose there are a few minor bugs, like the options returning to default every time you open the game up again, but it's certainly nothing that interfered with my experiance. I did however have to re-map the keys. It wasn't much trouble to do, but it made the largest difference. The way the controls were originally set up made the game very difficult and hard to navigate the character. For anyone that may be having the same problem- I set it to the WASD keys for movement and J, K, L for running, jumping, and to use balloons/ropes. For me, this method worked perfectly.\n\nSomething I didn't like about the game the lack in variety between the two characters. You can play as Tobe, his girlfriend Nana, or have both of them at the same time as a sort of co-op if you have a friend in the room. This will be an impossible feat though unless one of you, if not both, have a controller. Many people in the other reviews very positively recommended Nana, and I don't understand why because although she can double jump, her controls are very clunky and over all, she just feels incredibly clumsy to handle and harder to navigate. She is much slower even when running, and therefore she has a has a harder time getting through timed gates and getting away from enemies. Although her double jump can reach places Tobe can not, I still didn't find Nana worth playing as because Tobe can just use a rope. On top of that he is much faster, more agile, and has wall run which is over all much more useful. Nana also had a very strong and strange weakness that caused a lot of deaths and added a difficulty to the game that it did not need. When she is hanging from a rope or a ledge and jumps, the first jump does absolutely nothing. She gains no vertical altitude from it what so ever and falls straight away. It is only the second jump that does anything, and it barely does much. It definately does not have the same effect that her double jump has when standing on a solid surface. So I would not recommend Nana, but Tobe is very acrobatic and acrobatic, and will quickly over come obstacles and climb things with a very stream lined feel.\n\nI feel that I should also warn about the lack of depth in story. Although this won't bother everyone, some people like a more immersive story. You get a brief slide show about Nana wanting to look for treasure, forcing Tobe to go with her who just wants to stay home and play video games, and then upon completing each world you get a short scene each time that more or less says "The treasure isn't here. It's on another island" sort of thing like how Super Mario Brothers did with, "Your princess is in another castle." The way they did the story did feel natural to the game and fit in. I thought it was cute, but looking back on it, I do wish there was more to it but I guess with a simple retro style game as treasure hunting, you don't really need a complex story.\n\nThis game does not have much replay value, and it isn't some amazing experiance, but I do recommend it because it's still very enjoyable. The platforming is very fluid and fun, and it was a great feeling to just rush through the level without much of anything slowing me down after some practice.","October 9, 2011","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cute platformer with nostalgic music and nice artwork, but as with almost everyone who gives a negative review, I have a problem with the controls.\n\nThe button colours in menu do not reflect the colours of an Xbox controller. Cancel is ( A ) but is coloured red, accept is ( X ) but is coloured green. A neutral colour would be better.\nYou can't jump if you're in the middle of a roll.\nYou must press UP if you wish to climb something (auto-latching would be much more suitable)\nThe controls are also insensitive and imprecise.\nIf these issues are fixed, it would probably be a great game, but as it is, I can't stand playing more than a few minutes at a time.","August 29, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
