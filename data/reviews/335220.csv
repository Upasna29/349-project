You have set orbs you have to manipulate certain colors into all at once, and while this sounds easy enough, it can get complex. I have had to stop and think about what I'm doing more than once.\n\nMy only recommendation is to make the "rules" for each level a little more obvious. It wasn't very clear until I started to play the second and third levels. That said, toward the bottom before each level, it inidicates how colors will be knocked out. (Horizontally, vertically, diagonal, alternates, etc.) And on the actual puzzle screen, the bottom left is how many times you have to get all those colors into the special orbs.\n\nThe art is soft and beautiful while the music leaves a calm feeling as you work toward success. This is a lovely game and I'd definitely recommend it for a nice casual play.","January 17, 2015","true","1.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

The mouse cursor keeps disappearing.. (although choosing to use the customer cursor helps, its not a fix) It skips here and there and overall is fairly unexciting. Disappointed. :/","January 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","16","25","4","0"

When you start the game,you're greeted by some very beautiful music that makes you just want to leave the game open and listen to it forever.   The music alone had me in love with this game.  The only problem with the music is that the only way to turn off the music is to turn off the game volume all together.  It'd be nice to be able to leave the game sounds on and just turn the music off.\n\nThe best part about this game is that you can just relax, enjoy the music, and click randomly.  The game doesn't penalize you, there's no time limits, no closing wall, nothing.  You can take as much time as you want or no time at all and just click like a mad man.  There's no punishments.  Granted, you only have a limited number of clicks, but other than that, you can go crazy!\n\nOne nice feature is that you're given a custom mouse pointer when playing.  It's a small, and to some, insignificant detail, but I really enjoy it.  You can disabe it if you find it annoying, though.\n\nBtPaU doesn't technically end.  You can just keep going back in and playing the same levels over and over again.  Is  it repetitive?  Yes, but most of the games we play today (GTA is a big example) are repetitive.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is that you cannot alt-tab.  The game breaks completely if you do, and you have to restart it.  If you put it in windowed mode, it breaks.  You have to restart for it to work.  Oddly enough, after I changed it to windowed mode and restarted, the game started back up in full screen.  Later when I played it again, it started in windowed mode. BtPaU seems to have serious issues when alt-tabbing or switching from full screen to windowed.  In this day and age where people tend to multi task, or even have to minus the game to deal with something, I don't understand why developers don't allow their games to be alt-tabbed/minused.\n\nPerhaps the best part about this game is that it tells a story in a unique way.  Generally, puzzle games are just puzzle games and nothing more.  The story itself is simple, but it's there.  It's really impressive that a simple puzzle game like this has a story that both makes sense and ties into the simplicity.  This is really great work on the developer's part.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nAmazing in-game music.\n\nCan be replayed endlessly.\n\nSimple, easy game.\n\nCan be played however you want - either plannning out your clicks, or just clicking like a mad man.\n\nCheap price.\n\nSimple story.\n\nNegatives:\n\nAlt-tabbing and changing from full screen to windowed breaks the game.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","April 20","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/recommended/335220/","cerebralpulse","Mio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cerebralpulse/","3110 products in account","But to Paint a Universe is a a really pretty and zen-like puzzle game that is done well.\n\nAmong the positive aspects of the game, it has a Story mode, with a simple but effective story over-laying the main part of the game - a basic matching game, with slight differences in each level, keeping it fresh throughout. The music isn't too annoying, and there is no time limit, only a move-limit, so this gives way to sitting back and thinking, relaxing, and the reason I give it a zen-like description. The game is a good length, and would take the average person no more than about 4hrs to complete. There is also a time-mode, which I haven't tried due to not being very good at speed-run type games.\n\nThe only real negative was that I lost my mouse cursor on the first start of the game - whether I was in windowed mode or fullscreen, was the same problem - this was quickly remedied by restarting and in the options there is an option to use the custom in-game cursor, so this makes me think it was the way the game was meant to be played; though it is a little odd it wasn't on by default if this is the case.\n\nConclusion: A good game for puzzle-lovers; with nice aesthetics, and soothing atmosphere, I recommend it to all.","December 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It plays much like the connect 3 versions going all the way back to SEGA Swirl but in an Endless Mode.  Unfortunately if you don't click in the middle of a T you're going to miss some of the orbs.  OTOH, it allows you to click on singles for 10 points each.\n\nThe soundtrack is very nice, and the story seems a bit cliched.  Not terrible, but pretty familiar territory so far.  The Narrator could have done to go back and reread a few lines over again.  Sometimes his lisp was a bit heavy, and sometimes he wasn't reading the words on the screen.\n\nThere's not much in the way of adjusting resolution, it's either Full Screen (which looks to be 1600x900) and Windowed (same resolution I think).  Languages are in British English and Japanese.\n\nSadly, while I feel this game is undercooked and could have gone a bit longer in the mechanics dev, it's serviceable enough once you understand what it is lacking.  I wouldn't mind my niece or nephew playing this as the music is very calming and the game seems easy.  As a plus or minus depending on your view, going to the world map uses plain gray spheres to select levels.  The downside is this also includes story elements.  So clicking on prologue will take you back to the story prologue (act 1 is 2 spheres over).  If there was a color indication or a different symbol I think that'd help.  Not that a person has to fear, the game shows "Click to Skip" before every cut scene.\n\nOn the whole, it isn't a terrible game, and it functions as it intends to.  So I'm saying yes if you've got a small child who wants to play a puzzle game that won't tax their brain.","June 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
