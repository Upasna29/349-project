The story and the depth of it are most memorable, so for a game of its age, it does incredibly well. Due to change of hands, the title has been milked ever since, making this as the one and only decent game of its series. There are slight compatibility issues which are to be expected for such an old game, however there are several fixes out there. It's a shame that there was never a remake of this.","May 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/259190/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Alone in the Dark (4): The New Nightmare is a 3rd person survival horror game which was released in 2001. Some may say that it's a ripoff (see Resident Evil), but that's not entirely true. AITD4 is a reboot of the series which is placed in modern times. There are two playable characters with different, but interconnected storylines (similar to RE2), both have average playtime of 4-5 hours. The game has unique soundtrack (created by Low Distortion Unit) which is really atmospheric, scary and menacing. The game offers you limited amount of ammo which strengthens the element of survival horror. It also has puzzles which aren't that difficult (if you actually read in-game's files). There are powerful weapons such as double barrel revolver, triple barrel shotgun, plasma cannon, grenade and rocket launchers and other special weapons. I should also mention that the game also utilized a flashlight which is used for seeing dark areas, for puzzle solving and even as a weapon (see Alan Wake). The PlayStation 2 and PC ports have better FMVs, models and backgrounds, runs at 60FPS, however, the music is badly ported and sounds barely like the original (PlayStation 1). The Steam version of the game has a broken launcher and that's why I suggest getting the GoG version instead (or have them both?). With the proper launcher you can select any rendering resolution, but only 4:3 resolutions are recommended.\n\nAITD is a truly scary game. The mixture of good soundtrack, atmosphere (including rain and thunder), flashes, sudden screams, supernatural monsters does it's job. Be sure to play at night and/or with headphones. Generally underrated game.","June 12, 2014","true","13.6"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","1"

The music and the sound effects are very well made and give the game a good athmosphere. Overall runs faster than the Psone copy i still have!\n\nHowever, the game has its downsides. You can't change the resolution, so you'll be stuck on 640 x 480. Controller support is almost obsolete as well, even though i was trying to set my controls with my 360 controller, i'm thinking it might work on the arrow buttons on a rather older gamepad model. The cutscenes never show up, unless i alt+tab and by then the game might crash and quite frankly i don't want to do that every cutscene.\n\nWas it worth the 5.99€? Not necessarily, if it wasn't just a mere version of the 2001 copy. If they had actually cared about modern customers, they would've fixed all of those problems. Now i'm left thinking should i be mad that i wasted my 5,99€ on this game or do i keep playing putting the problems aside?\n\nI can't decide between recommending this game and not recommending, so i'll give it a thumbs up just for the nostalgia that i've got for the title. If you're expecting a fully working game, look away. If you don't mind about the half-bakedness of the game, pick it up.","July 24, 2014","true","1.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neverknowsbests/recommended/259190/","neverknowsbests","NeverKnowsBest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neverknowsbests/","101 products in account","It can easily be argued that Alone in the Dark is the series that created the survival\nhorror genre. The first game was released in 1992 for the MS-DOS and laid the groundwork\nfor the genre. After a couple sequels the series fizzed away, until Resident Evil came\naround and recreated survival horror. So obviously the original had to come back to the field\nand compete, and what it came back with was Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare.\ngame starts with Edward Carnby, a private detective, finding out that his partner is\ndead off the coast of Shadow Island. Edward soon learns of some ancient tablets that can\nunlock a secret power. Edward teams up with Aline to find the tablets and avenge his friend's\ndeath. Their plane is attacked by some mysterious creature, forcing them to parachute, become\nseparated, and become stuck on Shadow Island.\nHere the game makes you decide which character you want to be, either Edward or Aline. Each\nhas their own storyline and adventure, which intersects at certain points. The gameplay\nis what you would expect from a survival horror game. Your character controls like in Resident\nEvil, where up moves forward and you pivot. The game also uses pre-rendered backgrounds,\nthat are in fact very detailed and dark. The game has a great atmosphere that is mostly\nfocused on darkness. You will grow to fear the darkness and the nightmare creatures that\nlurk within it.\nAnd like most survival horror games, the game has a heavy emphasis on combat and puzzle\nsolving. What is different is, while both characters will see their fair share of both,\none is more prevalent in each character’s campaign. Edward has his trusty double barreled\nrevolver and will always have it in hand. His story involves mostly fighting the nightmare\ncreatures. The enemies are very tough and ammo is scarce, making you have to know when\nto stand up and fight, and when to run away. Aline starts off in a huge mansion and must\nsolve the puzzles littered through mansion to advance. It is interesting how they separated\nthese two gameplay mechanics, allowing you to play the game the way you want. But whether\nyou are solving puzzles or fighting monsters, the darkness will always be there.\nThis is a great return of the original of the genre. With the separate campaigns and\nthe beautiful but dark graphics, the game is full of tricky puzzles and terrifying enemies.\nhis is another strong reason why you should be afraid to be alone in the dark.","December 23, 2013","true","3.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

If anyone plays Resident Evil 1, should know this is somewhat similar in the gameplay, and game plot as well.\n\nKeep noted however, there are bugs and glitches in this game, so please save carefully. Also another note that the saves are limited so dont save too much, but you will earn some along the way, would suggest go scavenging on items and dont waste all ammo since enemies are either too much or endless to kill, they WILL come back at some point in some areas, excluding bosses of course.\n\nI was able to beat it while saving cautiously, so have fun and dont end up trapping yourself or otherwise you will have to restart all over again, that includes if used up all ammo and dont know a strategy to run through the enemies.","June 1, 2015","true","13.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I am aware that Alone in the Dark series is older but the gameplay in this game is inspired by Resident Evil and not 1992 game . You may need to use third party software to use some controlers properly but I don't mind using keyboard .\n\nMy PS1 version did not have a working CD2 and apperently Steam Version has same problem with part 2 of this game ( I hear there is a work around but I have not tried it )\n\nAmong all horror games on PS1 The New Nightmare was the best looking game having superior visual effects,textures and 3D models. It may not be relevant to a new player since you won't be impressed by graphics in 2015 but this game pushed the console to its limits .\n\nProbably the most important thing for a Horror game is great atmosphere and this game is all about it .In the dark surrounded by shadows you will meet few characters and they won't bring you comfort. Walking through dark corridors not knowing what is ahead , what you need to do or if you have enough ammo to fight what is coming . On a side note I love camera angles in this game that add to gloomy mood ( if you playing as detective watch out for camera angle from the window of the house it is ♥♥♥♥en cool )\n\nPerhpas this game was a little too cryptic for its own good or maybe a little too hard but it just seems that people don't praise it as much as Resident Evil or Silent HIll . I would say that gameplay could have been better , some enemies respawn infinitely which makes it diffecult to move between certain areas with little space to manuver . It's just a hard game in terms of puzzles and ammo conservation .\n\n\nAlone in the Dark :The New Nightmare is not the funnest horror game I played but it still holds up because it is just so atmospheric and better looking  side by side than survivor horror games of same era .I would probably not recommend it if you never played a PS1 horror game with tank controls but it is a very good game .","September 25, 2015","true","2.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Those of you familiar with the Resident Evil series of games will instantly know what to expect and how to play/control this game. If you are looking for a Silent hill game on steam I think Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is your best bet. Unless you have not played RE HD Remaster yet.\n\nYou can play as either Edward Carnby, a private detective looking for revenge or Aline Cedrac, a university student specializing in ancient Indian culture. Each character has their own unique adventures on Shadow Island and while they will interact at times, each must rely on their own strengths to solve the puzzles and complete the game.\n\nEdward's game relies on weapons and combat and features more monsters while Aline's game consists of more puzzles that require you to use your wits. You can play either character first although for maximum enjoyment I recommend playing as Edward Carnby. He is the stronger of the two characters, and you will learn the layout of the mansion quicker and easier while playing as him.\n\nP.S : Don't forget to download the 'patch' that let you play in 1920x with High Resolution.

Plays like a OG resident evil game warts and all, Fixed camera and tank controls.\n2. Graphics are OK.\n3. Atmosphere is scary\n4. 2 playable characters, one more focused on combat and one focused on puzzles\n5. OK combat\n\nCons\n\n1. Controls are bad and I had to use third party russian hack to use controllers.\n2. I had to use a no CD crack to get the final part of the game because the game insisted on inserting disk 3 (WTF lol)\n3. Its Short (Maybe like 4-5 hours per character.\n4. Kinda easy towards the end.\n5.

Danger threatens from every corner. The slightest shadow could be hiding deep secrets, or concealing worse nightmares... Can you see beyond your fear?\n\nEdward Carnby, the supernatural detective is back! And this time it's for revenge. Carnby's best friend, Charles Fiske has been found dead off a mysterious island off the coast of Maine, Shadow Island. Carnby's investigation quickly leads him to Fred Johnson who informs him of Fiske's search for the three ancient tablets which, when placed in a specific location, will unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with Carnby to pick up where Fiske left off and reopen the investigation in order to recover the tablets. Carnby accepts the mission to find and destroy the murderer of Fiske and avenge his death.\n\nThe original survival horror franchise continues with a pure blend of intense action and suspenseful adventure. Alone in the Dark immerses the player into a dark and strange atmosphere where conventional rules do not apply. The player must overcome his natural fear of the dark unknown and control Edward Carnby through a deep and highly detailed storyline. Armed with a flashlight and a pistol, Carnby must find the necessary items to survive as well as the clues which will help him escape his ultimate nightmare.","February 23, 2014","true","196.3"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","0"
