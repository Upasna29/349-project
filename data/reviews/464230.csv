Then there's also an achievement for finishing 50 of the 60 levels under the lowest par time, which is also very, very hard.\n\nOverall, this simple but challenging physics puzzle is worth at least an hour of your time.","May 20","true","1.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","2"

I'm not a native speaker so sorry for mistakes.\n\n\nPros:\n- cheap\n- there are cards and achievements\n- interesting concept\n- well done fluids physics\n- a large number of levels\n- nice OST\n\nCons:\n- single OST\n- little story\n- it is impossible to kill anyone\n","April 27","true","7.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

The puzzle is not hard but you need to have precise control to move water to destination. Generally an average rating game with casual gameplay. Worth the dollar.\n\nPro:\n1. Simple movement but require premise control\n2. Casual gameplay, no stress\n\n\nCons:\n1. Not supporting 21:9 resolution. There is no in-game option menu to adjust resolution, etc\n2. No sound at all. A bit dull when playing.\n\n","May 15","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Some things seem rather unpolished yet, such as some walls having holes through which the fluid can slip on accident with it hits the wall with too much force. When I start the game I get a CMD-like window that doesn't disappear until I exit the game, but on fullscreen it is unnoticable. Further, there seems to be no IG-sound - at least not for me, maybe something is wrong with my files. However, these are minor inconveniences that don't really influence the overall game experience.\nThe overall functionality of moving the board to guide the fluid works really well, and the level design is fun and challenging, although once you know what needs to be done, rushing through the levels to gain crystals is easy. I'd have wished for some more text guidance in the beginning, some explaination what each Wizard wants to teach me or any sort of background story. At the moment, finding your way around the beginning stage of the game seems more trial and error. However, for its price its a good enough game and I thoroughly enjoyed it :)","April 30","true","4.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Sounds easy? Wait a few levels, it gets challenging after a while.\n\nAdvantages\nNice concept of the game overall\nCreative levels\nRealistic physics of your potion\nPleasant hand-drawn graphics\nVery low price for fun content\nAchievements and cards are nice bonus\nDisadvantages\nSoundtrack could be more developed\nBuggy here and there - after minimization graphics sometimes get bugged (http://prnt.sc/ay841h), can't turn on sounds after turning them off\nSummary\nIt's a fun game in its simplicity. For people complaining that there's a low ammount of content or anything like that - it was designed this way, to be a nice and little game to play for a while and have fun. There's quite a lot of levels with a variety of difficulties, so it's totally enough to spend few good hours in the game to pass it. In my opinion, it'd be very nice if mouse control would be added. Luckily, it's not heavily bugged game, so I can sincerely say that it was a pleasure to play it. The only thing that could be upgraded is a soundtrack, but it's a minor thing - except that, I totally recommend this game for what it is.\n\nPersonal score\n8.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","April 29","true","3.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Well it starts off SUPER easy, at first I thought wow have I unintentionally purachsed a game intended for 5 year olds? All I had to do was guide a droplet of water through a colour and into the goal, it was a piece of cake! But I was wrong, after quickly running through the first few levels feeling very smug about how good I was at a game I was sure was meant for children it suddenly progressed to a level beyond diffcult when I had to start seperating the water droplet into 3 or more droplets and simultaneously juggle them all into the right colours and corresponding goals. That's when I got angry. That's when my cat ran out of the house and down the street, that's when my family huddled together in the basement and bolted the door, they knew what was coming. The fiery gamers rage within me had once again been ignited by a Steam game and no one was safe.","May 3","true","2.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","5","7","6","0"

Everythings functional, but theres not much there to hold my attention. There's this weird theme going on with the wizard that appears in the menu and such that never gets explained. There's only one music track and its very generic and forgettable. I know that this was originally a mobile game but I don't get why it's being sold on steam.\n\nPros:\n+ Fully functional\n+ Concept seems interesting\n\nCons:\n- Only one music track\n- Boring\n- Little story and nothing is explained\n- When I opened the game it runs this super shade command prompt window that made my anti-virus freak out\n- Spelling and grammar errors\n\nThe concept is interesting and could work as a fully fleshed out game, but it really failed to hold my attention for long. I only played 5 minutes and by then, I was already bored and regretting my purchase. So I suggest staying away from this one unless it gets fleshed out a bit more. I've already sent a refund request.","April 25","false","0.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Too much viscosity for water, or most other liquids for that matter. The "elixirs" behave more like a gelatinous-blobby substance... thing.\n\nThis game was initially designed for devices with accelerometer but for PC we decided to add WASD and arrow controls, that made the game even more difficult and entertaining!\nNo, I'm quite sure that made the game easier. Which is good. I love easy games. And this game is pretty easy, although maps 2-5 and 5-5 did cause some despair. The time requirements for getting a 3-star rating in individual stages are well balanced - they cause just a little bit of frustration but are far from impossible. There's a good chance you might complete Aqua Teeter in one sitting and before cards finish dropping. There are 60 levels total but you only need to 3-star 50 of them for the most difficult achievement. I love seeing that kind of thing, it deserves praise. Good value for money, recommended.","May 10","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
