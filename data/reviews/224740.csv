I've stuck with the game, and it's development has interested me enough to hold my attention to the present day, January 2015.  I've even gone and made a bunch of YouTube videos, which I'll link  - those should give interested parties a good idea what actual gameplay is like.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txpuYpTUyo\n\nAugust 2014: My Hours Played don't reflect my actual play time; I've been loading this game directly from the .exe (which is a thing you can do, and which more Steam games ought to do, I'm looking at you, Skyrim).  Also, sessions that crash apparently don't get added to your Hours Played.  Expect crashes, this thing isn't even in Beta.\n\n*edit* Apparently they do count!\n\nThis Early Access offering is a good example of the way Early Access should be done - the game itself is only nominally functional - there is currently no save function, for instance, there are still many bugs and crashes, and the interface is undergoing constant revision.  Many planned features have yet to be implemented, and the game itself could stand some optimization.\n\n*edit* I'm testing the 'internaltest-' build which has, among other things, a save function.  It crashes more than it saves, but still.\n\nThe value of an Early Access game is the opportunity to participate in feedback that will shape the direction of the game.  Submit suggestions, tweaks, typos, bugs and playability experiences to the Devs.  They've shown themselves to be very responsive, and actively solicit player feedback (on the Gaslamp Games forums), and the whole development process has been the model of transparency, with weekly Dev Blog updates and a Twitter presence.\n\nClockwork Empires has a lovely aesthetic, and great potential, but it's nowhere near finished.  Wait for full release (projected to be ~9 months) if you want it feature-complete and polished.  I'm in it because the Development Blogs are great, the Devs are active, and I enjoy contributing my 2 cents worth.\n\nThis is a game on the same shelf as Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Spacebase DF-9, et al.  It's a city builder sim; there's no direct control of your citizens, who you direct largely by creating jobs and juggling priorities.  The setting is a sort Victorian-era English colony; your soldiers wear red coats and wield muskets, your menfolk sport glorious handlebar moustaches, and your colonists (literally) gossip about things like the Monarchy.  It's brass, elbow grease, laudanum, dodos, and cabbages everywhere.  You already know if this stuff appeals to you or not.\n\nAlso appearing: fishmen, dark cults, insanity and ritual murder.  Still in the works, tentacled horrors, secret geometry, and Lovecraftian modules for your Lumber Mill (!).\n\nIf you do get this game, get involved in the Dev side or you're missing a great opportunity; check out the blogs, read the forums, share hilarious stories about mass starvation and game-breaking bugs.\n\np.s. I forgot to mention cannibalism.  Cannibalism is always hilarious.  I don't know if fishmen count as cannibalism, but I'm pretty sure your fellow colonists do.\n\np.p.s Read the system requirements.","August 15, 2014","true","109.0"," 246 of 285 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","246","285","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainAK/recommended/224740/","CaptainAK","Lieutenant A.Kouassi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainAK/","177 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATED REV 42E: The Devs have been focusing on bug fixing and mainly changes within the User Interface and Farming area of the game. The U.I has had an overhaul in terms of the character selection menu and information panels. They tell you more about each character, their mood, emotion and progress towards desires. Each character's current effects now show bars as to how it affects their mood within these panels.\n\nThe Farming and Kitchen has been addressed in a sense that instead of mass lists of recipes, the vast majority of standard food you can find, gain from hunting and farming has been condensed into a simple "Make food" job where the colonists will use any standard type of food they can find. I much prefer this because it is at the end of the day what you order anyway, all food you can.\n\nMilitarily, the barracks function and NCO has been fixed so they now properly train into Regular troops from militia.\n\nOverall, not a bad update at all however as I have previously stated, the game is very much playable and more of the game "content" in that regard, new items, clothing etc, should be coming in the near future because it would seem most systems are now functioning as intended and have been fixed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATED REV 41D: Constantly changing and evolving, CE is more stable than ever. So many changes in the latest builds from REV 38. The majority of issues have been addressed to the state that you can pretty much play for however long you like. Once you start getting larger populations however you may still encounter the odd bug or issue. On that note the Devs are reaching what I call the last loose ends. Fixing the remaining issues that people encounter and adding in the systems left.\n\nThe UI has been updated massively and there are various new systems in place such as the events which are now much more refined. There is a starting property ownership system in place which is going to be built on to eventually include owning clothing, various objects and so on. The workshops have been overhauled and recently just added in is the new Military Barracks which replaces the old system of training. You assign a Military Officer or Militia NCO to the Barracks and he/she will start to train troops into Regulars.\n\nThe favour system has also been recently amended. For example you can now recieve a prisoner work group which will assist your colony doing various tasks for 3 days. Many now have a time frame. The squad of Regulars led by an NCO also assist for 3 days (or is it 5?) for example.\n\nAll in all a lot has changed to list, including minor changes but the game has made substancial progress certainly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATED REV38  : So much has changed since my last update. This is now Clockwork Empires in the Official stable gameplay stage now. You can play without any major issues, no crashes or that. They have added removal of buildings, planning changes, new User Interface elements and refined Combat mechanisms and A.I for colonists and elements alike. If you were following this previously, then now is a pretty good time to join in the fun and development of Clockwork Empires.\n\nThe team is constanly updating it, each update bringing much better features and now that all the bug bashing has really been done, it is content that is being brought in. Cults have been revamped, basic diplomacy is now functioning with minor factions like bandits and so on bringing all sorts of events that your decisions can affect your colony and how long it survives. Far too much to list but the future of CE is very bright indeed!\n\nUPDATED: REV33: By far the best update that has been implemented. Now with complete re-designed mechanics and Graphics, the game runs certainly, much smoother and MAC support is now in the works with basic features working. The game has came a long way from the past 2 builds and with new features such as bandits, new animals, refined combat and economics and UI the game is definitely coming together. Again I would still be waiting a couple more before buying but in terms of my level of "playablility", that stage has almost been reached.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Review:\n\nWhile this is Early Access.......very very early. I have to say that this game has huge potential. The developers are keen and very open and the game itself is the perfect management game for those who loved traditional city builder games crossed with a bit more things to do such as combat, defence etc.\n\nIt is based during the Colonial-Early Industrial period and already the developers have nice features set out. The game itself does have a sense of humor thrown in and the like such as having to fight off Fish people and all sorts of creatures. In future they plan to add bandits and all manners of factions and allow you to ally, trade and conduct diplomacy for your newly starting colony. There is also a map set out what looks like it will be a sort of campaign style base in which you choose where you would like to set out your next adventure for the Empire and start to form new colonies.\n\nThe artstyle in my view fits perfectly along with the current mechanics which are currently implemented it really does look and function well. If you play it you will see just exactly what this game could offer in the near future and even now.\n\nThe game is one of a kind and unique in so many ways. If you don't mind investing in such games then by all means take it into account but if you want a finished product then you will have to wait. I would say another month or so and this game will get better and better......hopefully :) It really is up to yourself but I can say this certainly. If you decide to invest your money in this EA game.\nYou will not loose out. The Devs are like PA Devs in that sense but even better. They are constanly interacting with community to fix things, release experimental build updates pretty much from 2 days-1 week. Really are making significant progress and fast.\n\nEDIT: And I was correct when i said a month or 2. Saves are practically on the table with loading now as are basic defences. Many fixes and performance improvements to allow smooth running of the game and ruled out majority of crashes. Now they can finally give it a few weeks, start working on the games mechanics and content more rather than bug fixing. For now anyway :D\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn that note: The team plan to adopt a monthly update schedule which will release major build updates to the public. If you would like to assist in testing or just mess around with it early then they have an opt in "experimental branch" which as it suggests is "experimental" but enough to keep you playing. I can see the team relating to Prison Architect in that sense as they always keep the community interested and up to date and these guys are constantly fixing and addressing issues with their game so very active :D\n\nAs I am constanly testing the Experimental builds which are updated regularly with new things to check out and suggest, I will be updating this throughout each build, or when I can :)","August 17, 2014","true","77.9"," 87 of 103 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","87","103","0","0"

From the well-designed menu, to its enjoyable graphics, Clockwork Empires is a gem in the making. Your job is to start a colony, and to do so, you're given a certain amount of colonists and some materials.\nThe wonderfully written tutorials will also provide you the necessary knowledge to build according to your colony’s needs. While building, you'll also have to keep your colonists happy and well fed, as well as safe from all hostile units, such as the dreadful fishpeople.\nThe graphics are really enjoyable, and the scaling used on certain objects/units will certainly create a laugh or two.\nTo accompany all of the above, some nice music is put to good use, leaving the player relaxed and ready to build a new empire. Or get his whole colony destroyed by the fishpeople.\n\nPros Excellent tutorial, with some humor to it;\nWide variety of materials;\nGroovy graphics;\nEnjoyable soundtrack;\nWell designed crew micromanagement;\nLarge maps with plenty of resources;\nDetailed tabs with resources available, current jobs/actions being performed, and even an event log.\nI've decided to add a "Neutral" category, as they aren't gamebreakers, but could improve the gameplay if polished.\n\nNeutral Sudden change of background music can sometimes be annoying;\nCould use a couple more tooltips, mostly to tell the player where to get whatever is missing in the city;\nOnce in-game, the only way to go back to the main menu is by closing the game and restarting it;\nCould use a delete option on the saved games, considering the files are somewhat big and you can't overwrite them;\nThe characters don't stop moving when you pause the game;\nThe AI could be improved, since characters don't stop moving while hauling/exploring, even if they're being attacked, and they also seem to choose a random table/place to go drop something.\nKeep in mind the game is still in Early Access (EA), and the "Cons" mentioned below will, certainly, be tweaked and/or polished as the game gets more and more updates.\n\nCons Excessive amount of hostile units from the very start, although sometimes it's bearable;\nLack of "Game Speed" function makes the game boring at times;\nInability to remove/cancel pretty much everything.\nVerdictI'd give it a 7/10 Considering its EA status and it has an active development team, the game is bursting with life, and you can expect it to be a lot more polished by the time it gets its full release.","April 7, 2015","true","16.2"," 62 of 72 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","62","72","0","0"

If you are wanting a polished full featured game hold off on buying this. However I've been involved since closed testing and have seen wonderful improvements and the foundation laid for many exciting game features over the last several months. The developers are passionate, experienced, and active in the community. Getting in now will let you help shape this fabulous game, and of course let you enjoy it now.\n\nMany games hype what they hope they will be and have to scale back often leaving fans disappointed and skeptical about any games previews. Gaslamp Games have been hyping what already exists in Clockwork Empires. Many of the features are rough around the edges and a number are not included in the current public build (8/15/14) because they are not yet ready for prime time but they do exist. The talk of colonists having personalities and memories isn't smoke and mirrors. Once all the pieces are polished and come together Clockwork Empires will delight and horrify you.\n\nIt is a gem, rough and unpolished now but full of promise. And the developers release rapidly and responsively so you will not be waiting months for news. One week in closed tested we had 7 days that saw three full new versions (with significant changes) as features came together and they responded to tester feedback. While that was a very busy week they have a track record of consistent and fast updates.","August 15, 2014","true","37.6"," 70 of 88 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","70","88","0","0"

Despite my first thought of "Mwahahaha! Thank you, Great Cthulhu!  Take my money!," I decided to show a little restraint and kept an eye on Clockwork Empires for a while before making another Early Access impulse buy.   At $30.00 I found it rather pricey for an Early Access game as other reviews have commented, but I finally decided to give it a try.  Clockwork Empires is still very much a work in progress, it's features a mix of the impressively well done (production chains function far more smoothly than in games from bigger developers, yes, Tropico franchise, I'm looking at you) and desperatly in need of attention (the Load function appears to be a placeholder and it's just plain ugly).  One thing I found particularly interesting is the colonists personality traits and observing how they influence behavior.  Those with the "Morbid" trait, for example, seem more likely to eat "Long Pork" (it's people, yes, your colonitsts can engage in cannibalism) even if there is other food available.  Based on the regular update history and developer responsiveness in the forums, I believe that this game will get finished - although it may take some time given the features that haven't been implemented yet - and when it does it will be a great game.  It is most definatley playable in it's current state, which I'd estimate at about 40% if the developer ultimately implements all the features they've hinted at.  A lot of the other 60% is going to be polish.  If you're interested and can afford it, I'd go make the $30.00 investment in supporting developement.  The game as it stands is already capable of providing hours of delightfully twisted fun, but then again I'm the kind of person who laughts while I watch the local wildlife maul my colonists.","March 1, 2015","true","111.6"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","37","41","7","1"

(you only see an icon of a red fluid but not even its name)\n\nControlling armies is hell, all you can do is to set a rally point where they will go or not, thus combat is very clunky.\n\nBut despite all of this cons, it is an overall enjoyable build but I really hope they chisel it much much more. The devs are quite active, the game has a very nice atmosphere, I definitely recommend to play it but with a big disclaimer that if you want a finished, seamless experience, rather just follow the game for now.","March 23","true","20.2"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","28","29","2","0"

After 30 some odd days and 35+ Settlers the game crashed. No big alpha is alpha, and unlike most games the Devs do actually pay attention to comments and reviews. I just DIED inside after losing such a great colony. If you don't mind some early bugs and balance issues (basically alpha in a nutshell) then give it a go. Just don't expect everything to be perfect just yet.\n\nOn the subject of bugs, since the Devs read this and respond. I may as well throw down some of the things I've come across after a good day of playing.\n\nBandits EVERYWHERE!\nI love the bandits, the whole Idea is a great addition, especially those bandit camps full of goodies. But too much! During one very short playthrough I had already fended off some fish folk twice, and bandits 3 times. After I watched the walking tank take out the last of my armed forces I admitted defeat. The the same basic thing happened a few more times. I'll be honest, I did rock some notepad plus in the events folder and tone down the number of bandits. It seemed to help make it a bit more balanced. If I was lazy and let the armed forces do their own thing I would still take casualties, but with some decent planning, a few clutch land mines, and fortifications. I managed to hold the line.\n\nKILL THE RICH MAN!\nSadly after discovering that the upper class was doing nothing to contribute, and THEN discovering that they were also distracting my workers. I was forced to execute my entire upper class population. I'm sure their are big plans for them but damn they are mighty useless. During a situation where everyone needs to pull their own weight, it was just not appropriate to have them around. I mean come on! This is a frontier colony! What are we going to do with Capitalists and Poets!?\n\nNo Chair for you!\nI had to basically make the choice of not building chairs or tables. They basically broke my production chains. The time it would take for every citizen to walk to the food stuffs, and then all the way to whatever random table they decided was good. Compared to the time it would take to huff it to the stock pile and scarf it down right their simply made it worth it to save my wood for other tasks.\n\nHunting Bug Maybe?\nFor whatever reason my citzens would not hunt. Maybe a bug, maybe just that game. But whenever I set them to hunt they would drop their current task and remain idle. If I removed hunting from their tasks, they started working again.\n\nI pick things up and put them down!\nEvery once and a while a work crew will decide that the building they are working on requires a dance. They begin to pick up logs, then move them to another stockpile spot and drop them. Then begin the process over again. I've also observed them doing it with planks while assembling modules. Usually the same plank or log.\n\nNeed an ability to cancel/delete/remove anything. The only real game breaking aspects of the game is the inability to say delete the job to build a refinery that seems to bug, or remove a module that's in the wrong spot. Or tear down a building all together. Remove a stockpile. farm, etc.\n\nRemember the game is still in alpha, so if you pick it up. Take some notes and send them over to the devs. The game can only get better that way.","November 20, 2014","true","138.2"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

I love the concept, love the art, just really love this game. What i don't love is the game breaking bugs and glitches, however there is great news, its in Early Access, so these will eventually get ironed out.\n\nNow this isn't my first Early Access rodeo, I've gotten burned by some games on here, and I've found some real gems as well. This I really believe will end up being a big hit for the type of game that it is. They just need to get past the usual issues that come with developing a game. And considering the regualr updates I've seen this team roll out, I can say that this won't be one of those cut and run type titles we all have heard about or worse. So know that if you are considering investing in Clockwork Empires you won't be wasting your money.\n\nOther than that I'm sure you have already looked at other reviews, pics and vids, and already have a good idea of what kind of game this is. What you may not have gathered is the awesome sense of humor and just the odd otherworldly attitude that this game offers. Which, if its indictive of the story, will just be awesome. Even if your not sure about purchasing it yet, put it in your wish list and keep an eye on it.

They're really fun, and ridiculously time-consuming. Clockwork Empires is a great addition to my collection of those. It's got a lot of survival aspects, and the game is really customizable in play.\n\nFirst, you've got two- technically four - kinds of settlers - which, i'd like to point out, are all unique; i've never run into two settlers that look EXACTLY alike. There's always some little difference, at the least. Anyhow, a total of four types, technically. Really there are two: Overseers and Laborers. Overseers are further divided into three types: Regular, Skilled, and NCOs (Sergeants). Regular overseers have no special skills, and most starting options just have these. They're useful overall, and the majority type of overseer you'll get, so yeah. Then Skilled overseers start with one or more skills that are higher than the others. NCOs (Or Sergeants) come prepared to be soldiers. You normally only get one when you start the game. Otherwise, you need to make a barracks and assign a regular work crew to it; eventually that overseer will be skilled enough to be called a Sergeant.\n\nEach settler - overseer or laborer - also has traits. Characteristics which make them unique - and they really are unique. Some traits are beneficial, others can be detrimental. But it helps you figure out who would be best working in what job, which is really nice. Say an overseer wants to be a farmer, or is a pioneer (Like working outdoors). Then you'd assign them to be a farmer. If they like doing paperwork, assign them to the diplomatic office or make them a scientist. It really helps give you a way to streamline and enchance production capabilities. Laborer's also have traits, but they rarely make an impact; laborer productivity is mostly determined by overseer productivity.\n\nYour best strategy is making sure your overseers are comfortable - but you've still got to take care of everyone, or you'll have people going on strike, cults forming, and/or people killing each other. Early game can be difficult, but once you've got enoug farms to support yourself, it's fairly easy to just keep upgrading your support base to slowly accomodate more and more people.\n\nOnce their basic needs are taken care of, you've got to focus on comfort, and focus hard. Services like churches, pubs, and fancy foods make everybody happy, and both workshops and homes need to be properly decorated. Otherwise, your workers and overseers will slowly get angrier and angrier. Eventually, they'll come to work less often, and for less hours. Then, if it gets worse, or just doesn't improve, they'll eventually just stop working. It can sometimes be ferociously annoying, but the dynamic of it is just fantastic. And yes, it can be counteracted; eventually, they'll get it out of their system, and come back to work. It'll repeat all over again if nothing changes, though.\n\nCombat in the game can be...frustrating, at times. Only your NCOs and laborers assigned to their squads will ever fight. Otherwise, your people just run away as fast as possible - which is often equal to the speed at which they're being chased. Then they stop to find direction, and take damage. And the process repeats. So it can sometimes get frustrating, especially if your NCO has been killed, or you don't have a barracks, or such like that. But otherwise, it is fairly nice; though your troops wil ldie easily against Obeliskians. Just saying. I'd advise using at least 2-3 squads per group of them.\n\nOverall, the game is amazing. It's not quite gotten finished yet; there are still bugs, crashes, and some lag problems to be addressed. But overall, the quality of the game is that of a finished product; it could just be polished and refined to make it an even better finished product. If you're looking for something well done, and you don't mind the occasional crash, i'd recommend Clockwork Empires.","March 6","true","51.6"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/224740/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased Clockwork Empires back in July of 2014 on their website for $30 and I got a steam key too. I knew that the game was nowhere near finished, but I was excited to try it anyways. After all their previous creation, Dungeons of Dredmor, was a pretty decent game -- so I had faith that they'd do a reasonable job on this one. A cozy Steampunk-Themed Citybuilder/Survival game with Dwarf Fortress inspirations, that's right up my alley! However the game was absolutely riddled with problems, and I don't mean glitches/crashes/bugs (which it had hundreds of), I mean core, fundamental problems. The interface is extremely clunky and nothing felt intuitive. No hotkeys for building modules or foundations, no quality of life features. The camera moves at a snails pace vertically, but warp-speed horizontally. Escape and Right-Click never act as you expect them to in a city-builder-esque game. Guess what the module-rotation hotkey is (Hint: It's not R). Guess what the foundation cancel hotkey is (Hint: It's not Escape).\n\nMicromanagement of your colonists is fairly tedious too. These people somehow lived full lives without your help, but now without your orders they will literally stand around until they go insane from hunger and eat each other. They won't even try to go hunt wild animals for food without your precise guidance. Colonists work in crews, under an overseer, which is sort of a higher class citizen than your generic worker. You need to make sure your workers don't bite off more than they can chew in terms of jobs by isolating what each work crew is allowed to do. For instance, you want to make sure they don't cut down 50 trees and run out of food while they do it; you want them to only chop down a few trees and then immediately put that lumber to use. Otherwise you'll have a giant stockpile of lumber and no food. ( I guess you could theorhetically use it to make coffins for all your soon-to-be-dead colonists? )\n\nOverseers randomly pick a task for his crew to do, based on what he's allowed to do, but you can't tell an overseer "I need you to do exactly this". He'll just arbitrarily pick something to do, which is why you must constantly manage what jobs are available to make sure they don't overdo one job and ignore another (like cutting down 50 trees). If work crews are stationed in a particular building, they will only do jobs associated with that one building... and if there are not enough jobs in that building and too many workers, you'll have a lot of idle time. This is honestly just the tip of the iceberg. For better or for worse, Clockwork Empires has a lot of depth when it comes to managing your  men.\n\nIn a game like this, there's two ways to do it properly. Option A: allow you to control every little aspect as much as you'd like. Give direct orders: move here, do that, build this, kill that. Micromanage each individual exactly how you please and they will obey commands like a robot. Or, Option B: focus on macromanagement. You're like the Queen Ant and you tell the workers what do. I want a house here, a farm there, and I want these trees chopped. Well unfortunately Clockwork Empires doesn't operate like either of these, instead it's more like Option C: manage an insane asylum of murderous cannibals.\n\nWell it's been about 2 years since then. Here's the part where I tell you "but all of that is all fixed now, and the game is great!", right?\n\nActually, everything I wrote in those paragraphs above still applies today. It's a bit better now, but still riddled with fundamental issues. I actually just played right before writing this review and the game crashed on me. Sure, the game has more features and things to build (I think), sure it's a little more polished around the edges, and dozens of game-breaking bugs have been fixed... but the game is still cumbersome and unintuitive at it's core. It still crashes (A lot). The game still doesn't have hotkeys for buildings or modules, which are extremely important. Why are they putting this off for so long? The game would be a lot more playable if it had proper controls, I think that goes without saying! The config.xml file allows you to change the few hotkeys that do exist, but when I tried to change WASD to arrow keys, they didn't work at all. (The developers said they're working on fixing this keybinding problem, but it's been 2 years since I mentioned it so... who knows).\n\nAnother issue, and this one really worries me, is that the game takes a very long time to save and load. For a game that crashes non-stop, you really want to auto-save every couple of minutes, but because saves take a long time to complete... it's quite a dilemma. To make matters worse, you cannot select how often the game auto-saves (I checked the config.xml file to be sure, there's no option for auto-save interval), I think it's like 10 or 15 minutes by default, not sure... but losing even 10 minutes in a game like this makes you want to quit entirely. Since auto-saves are essentially a pop-up window with no warning, it's very easy to accidentally crash the game by trying to do something while the game saves. I've learned to take my hands off the keyboard and mouse entirely whenever I see the save window appear. Maybe I'm just being impatient, but I feel that optimizing save times should be a priority for the development team right now.\n\nThe last thing I'll mention briefly are the games visuals, sound and overall theme. They're fantastic. This game has a lot of style and you can really see that they had a clear artistic vision when creating this game.\n\nSo, ultimately, is Clockwork Empires worth buying? Maybe some day, but not right now, and not anytime in the near future. Time cures all wounds, so I'm sure that if the developers keep at it this will be a fantastic game one day... but it's also possible that they will grow weary of the project and try to get it as bug-free as possible, then move onto something else. A lot of these issues I've described seem to be issues with it's foundation, problems with the way the game's code was written, and might not ever be able to be fixed. That worries me, mostly because I WANT Clockwork Empires to be an incredible game, because I love these type of city-builder/resource-manager/survival-horror/dwarf fortress-style games.\n\nRating: N/A, game needs a lot of work","May 22","false","8.1"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","4"

Jolly great fun!\n\nMy first game was like this:\nI had a food problem until I toggled on hunting on for all work crews, the bison herd of 10 got turned into bloddy bits and eaten raw by the starving hungry people rather fast. Quickly ran out of food and had to provoke a fish people attack by stealing their egg to get extra food in the form of fish person steak. It was a success at the cost of half the colonys brave  people, but the remaining colonists fed well in cannibalistic feasting on their dead fellow colonist so that helped with the food problem. The last 13 people was 40% solders so it might have been possible for me to have had a food industry based on fish people flesh. But sadly the game crashed as I tried to cram 8 beds into a small house. Great fun! Its shaping up to be a tasty treat if I may say so!","August 15, 2014","true","0.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","32","42","0","0"

Think Children of the Nile.\n-Unique and personalize colonists, each with traits and background history, memory of events that affect them in-game.\n-Worker pathfinding/fulfillment habits seems smooth so far, alot better than COTN, they don't seem to mind walking far to get food or resources.\n-Fish people! Finally a settlement/city-builder game that gives us a decent "enemy" system and practical combat control.\n\nThe Bad:\n*Game is in pre-alpha, bugs and shortcomings are expected, but this is my list of current faults with the game as of September 2014.\n\n- Needs visible resource counter, at least for the basic resources. Commodity menu is too clunky, takes up screen space.\n\n- Buildings and farms cannot be demolished once built. Really plays havoc with settlement planning and general game play. (Devs say demolishment would be added soon, let's hope so!)\n\n-Drag control for laying out floors and storage/farm zones glitchy, doesn't seem to want to select where you want it to. Really messes up your game when laying out farms and buildings, especially since you CAN'T demolish any of your mistakes.\n\n- Once a building is built, you can't add space or furniture to it later on. This means there's no room for expanding your production or residential buildings. Annoying when you realize you need more ovens in your current kitchen. I don't want to have to build a new facility every time I need to expand....Please change this!\n\n-Job/Work queue system broken/unfinished, in addition to no-demolish, any game you start right now would eventually go down the crapper as you find your kitchen orders are not being assigned/worked on and undeletable farms suck away your labour pool.  End result, your people starve to death, unless you grow just cabbages. Even then, work queue bugs would eventually render food production moot or simply crash your game. My longest game as of yet is 5 hours before it either spirals into work queue-death or game crash.\n\n-Save game function is broken, fog of war does not save, so every time you reload the fog of war is remapped through the line-of-sight of citizens. Graveyards/Storage Zones would unregister but still show up visually on map, so you'll have to rezone them everytime in different places when you reload.\n\n-Maybe the ability to create 2-storey buildings? No? Ok...\n\n- Work Parties list menu UI icons are too big, takes a LONG time to scroll through the list to find what your looking for. Needs to be scale down to display more without need to scroll miles. Buttons to prioritize and cancel work orders on queue don't work yet.\n\n-Random error crashes, game crashes if you exit to main menu and load another game. Makes game unplayable in the long-term as errors are persistent with your saves, meaning starting a new game every few hours or so.\n\n\n***\nI believe the first Alpha game I ever touched was DayZ on Arma 2. First Beta would be Minecraft, the game that probabbly started all this Early-Access pandemonia. Minecraft was pretty polished when I first jumped in, I actually liked the beta better than the full release versions (too much stuff now, got confusing - especially with blocky 16 bit graphics). DayZ was alright as well, despite the cornucopia of connection issues, long load times ,and outright cheating going on, it was playable. And by "playable", I meant I actually had fun playing it.\n\nI bought Clockwork Empires with this in mind, thinking while it was unfinish, it would still be interesting play-test of a cool steampunk settlement/city-builder (a genre that desperately needs new games) that would offer some continual if limited gameplay. What I experience was my first taste of what a pre-alpha really was...\n\nClockwork Empires can be best describe right now at its current stage (September 2014) as an unfinished Monopoly game board with missing pieces. You have some squares missing, no chance cards or hotel pieces, and you're playing with half a dice.  Your not going to have a lot of fun, and you're going to have a headache trying to figure out the rules as it is. Though there is still some merit hidden in the dark corners, namely in Clockwork's growing but faulty game mechanics and subtle hints to its lore. Being pre-alpha, I'm really hoping Clockwork's devs are willing to make the effort to make this game into a true gem it deserves to be instead of just out to swipe our hard-earned $$$.\n\nWhen you first start a new map (currently two maps available), you're treated to a seemingly enormous map space that's smoldered with black fog of war, except the small area where your colonists and soldiers stand in wait of your orders along with some starting supplies. There is a text based tutorial, no interactive how-to here. Its not too bad, but I can't help but feel a game of this size and complexity really needs an in-game pedia and help menu, I'm sure the devs are working on that as I speak.\n\nAt first glance, the setup is similar to Banished, another city-builder (Banished was actually how I found Clockwork, I was yearning for a combat element to the challenging but otherwise tranquil gameplay of Banished). Mouse over map artifacts show there's a great multitude of gatherable resources scattered throughout the map, done in a way similar to Children of the Nile. Trees can be chopped for logs, boulders mined for building stone, half a dozen variety of ores, foragable berries and fungus, etc. All resources gathered in the game are done by a single click or drag over the resource area followed by a selection on an option wheel. No need to build mines or extraction facilities, just drag or click and your colonists would dig the stuff up for you with their bare hands. Storage faciilties (which are free) can be built but not mandatory. Your colonists simply drop items on the ground if needed. This is a nice touch, at least for me it means avoiding the expense curve that was Anno's resource extraction system.\n\nAdvance items are produced through a production chain that's almost as detailed as that in the Anno series, but production of items is not automatic, but actually require the players to manually place "Orders" through production buildings. A bit annoying at first when you need lots of building materials like planks on hand, but eventually I realize this lets me control the raw material supply, and not have to deal with pillaging of stockpiles by citizens - as was the case with Children of the Nile.\n\nAs of now, all buildings are available to be built by the player, at least no tech tree I can discern. The player needs to custom layout buildings and place machinery/furniture, "Sims"-esque style. No more blocks of identical clone buildings, which adds a lot to the variety and customization to the game. Of course, as of now you can't demolish buildings or remove/add existing furniture (Really devs, how could you have left that out at this point?). Another wierd thing, placing multiply furnitures requires you to re-select an item after you placed the first item. Placing items like a dozen beds for a bunkhouse can be tedious, requiring you to move and click back and forth over and over again. Item hangover I guess is something the devs are still working on. Exterior options for buildings are limited, a few lamp posts and signage but you can't change the look or color of walls. Adding the ability to save a blueprint of a custom building would be a great plus here, at least when it comes repeat placing of homes or watnot.\n\nEach colonist is a definitive individual, with traits and memories of events that carry tangible in-game effects. Think State of Decay. This is where CE really shines, and I'm hoping the devs would turn this and other things into a playable game. Till then, I would wait for at least a beta-level stage before buying.","September 22, 2014","false","38.9"," 55 of 87 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","55","87","0","3"

I hate to start with that, but I must, because as of now (32B) it is buggy, sometimes broken and incomplete. That said, this is EARLY ACCESS, so it should not be complete right now. If they were to sell it as a full game in it's current state, it would suck, but that is not what it is. As early access, it is great. It has some fantastic ideas, great art style, and tons more on the way. The devs are also fantastic, everything they do, they post, and are quite open with how the development process is going. If you are curious you can go check it out at gaslamp games.com. They are supportive of the fans and, more importantly for early access, take ideas into acount and try to make the game better. As of now, it is fun, but broken, once it is fixed and complete, this could be a great game. I am talking three number hour counts. Once you figure out the game ( not much of a tutorial right now) it is hard, but not unfair. It does not bash you over the head with random sudden problems and go "deal with it" like other colony sims. ( I am looking at you, tropico tornado). If there is a problem, it is either a known one that you can prepare for to stop it, or, you just did not keep an eye on the cultists. Building is also great, because you can build you building how you like, and decorate them how you like, so you don't have the good old thirty identical houses thing. It's great fun, and looks to be better once it is done. Also don't let my low hours fool you, I got earliest access, so played that, and also steam is doing weird things as far as keeping track of hours goes. Also when you people get hungry, they don't just die, they resort to cannabalism. how many other games do that? and fishpeople, giant beetles, cultists, eldritch horrors, poets, drugs, alcaholism.......","November 16, 2014","true","5.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The only real problem i have on this front when it comes to this game is that it does tend to crash alot and i'm not really sure why, this has prevented me from experiencing alot of content that the game has to offer which is a shame as there is alot more to this game than your average colony/town building game. so in short if you dont like crashes or bugs...stay clear of this one for now.\n\n--Features--\n\nOk this is probably one of my favorite games of the genre at the moment purely because of the games wacky (and sometimes dark) sense of humour. so far i have needed to choose policies related to faction attitudes (how my colony will react when it spots some people fromanother nation etc.) and some related to a small cult that formed in my colony. Different colonists will react differently to certain policies (xenophobes wont like it when you make friends with fishpeople for example) which is something i absolutely adore as it makes your colony seem more alive and more entertaining especially when you get people with the "strange" trait then things start to get really fun. there are also ways to gain influence from the empire that can be spent on extra materials, food, more colonists or more soldiers.\n\n--Conclusion--\n\nOverall what clockwork empires does it does REALLY well and i applaud it for its wacky whilst sarcastic sense of humour and if the bugs and crashes dont bother you or you want to help the Devs find them, i cannot stress enough how much you should get this game as it is a true joy to play and i just wish i could play more of it without it crashing.","June 23, 2015","true","24.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

Sometimes completely, sometimes you'll get a script error that will merely disable a critical part of the game, such as your colonists ability to eat food.\n\nYour colonists will ignore cooked food and eat the raw sitting next to it, and then be unhappy about it.\n\nYour soldiers will decide mid-battle that now is the appropriate time for a nap and wander towards a bed while being killed the whole way there.\n\nYour manufacturers will ignore the stockpile next to their factory and take their finished goods to the other side of the map.\n\nYour citizens will wander into enemy territory to collect goods.

Really not for this price.\n\nGameplay is very similar to Towns.  You have the same basic DF-lite build-your-production-engine-even-though-you-don't-directly-control-anyone kind of experience.  There are what appear to be enhancements to the Towns model in the social class system and the work crew composition, as well as an interesting improvement in the way buildings can be customized and extended.  There's no third dimension, which may prove to be a terrible mistake or may prove to be a brilliant simplification.  There's also no documentation or tutorial, so you're sort of left to figure out what all of this stuff actually means yourself.  It's also sluggish and prone to crashes, the UI's full of TBDs, and you can't save your game.\n\n\nThe style is engaging, the artwork is promising, the gameplay seems like it will eventually be tunable into something both fun and challenging.  It's worth keeping your eye on this game.  But it really only works sometimes, if you don't look at it too hard.  And it's not a real game yet.\n\nYou can't blame them for turning to the Early Access model.  I mean, that's money you don't have to pay back after you ship, why wouldn't you do that if you could?

It's not a bad response. In fact it is the kind of friendly response I expect from gaslamp games.\n\nI like gaslamp game, and a steampunk dwarf fortress clone is a cool concept, but for 30$? No... I'd rather buy gaslamps other game with its expansions (dungeons of dredmor) for three of my friends. It would cost about the same. The main issue is that Clockwork Empires is a glacial game in which nothing you want to get done, gets done. A friend of mine told me to not assign lots of tasks all at once, but even with one job that needs to be done, it just doesn't get done. The reason for this, as I see it, is the "work crews" system. None of your colonists will do anything that another work crew has decided it wants to do. If you want them to cut trees, only one crew will do it while the others sit on their thumbs. Building a workshop? No, not if someone else is doing it. The only place where this system works is in the workshops themselves. The work crews will dutifully attempt to fulfill whatever task you set them within the workshop you have assigned them, BUT they won't usually do anything except work within that workshop and even when they are assigned the workshops they tend to do the tasks you set at a fairly casual pace. Another issue with the work crews is the overseer. Each work crew has one. The overseer is basically the leader of each work crew. Even the military squads have overseers (called COs). Why is this an issue? Well, losing one of your workers to a bandit attack is no big deal, except that it will slow the work crew down a little. Losing the overseer though means that the workcrew is immediatly disbanded, leaving all the workers in that workcrew jobless. Workers who are not in a work crew DO NOT WORK. They don't do a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing when they are not in a work crew. This is mitigated in military squads by a recent change by the devs which makes military squads automatically assign a new CO when it dies. By the way, you can't create new work crews. You need to wait for overseers to immigrate and then they start new work crews. This game would be fine if it weren't for the work crew crap. If every worker had his or her own will and could do tasks independantly of one another, but they can't. In Dwarf Fortress, losing is fun. In clockwork empires, losing is often tedious and frustraiting. Why? If it weren't for the work crew mechanic, you might actually be able to prevent whatever it is that caused you to lose.\n\nThe graphics are nice, and the music is appealing. Hell, the controls are way easier than DF or other DF clones. but the workcrew stuff makes Clockwork Empires far too tedious. All the flashy lights, pleasant sounds, and simple controls in the world will not make up for bad gameplay though, and at 30$ you are really better off buying something else. I'll throw this in the bin where I put other massively overpriced games.","April 16","false","10.9"," 46 of 81 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","46","81","0","6"

Apart from no audio during my first game (restarting fixed this), the actual gameplay seems to work pretty smooth - no gamestopping bugs. The tutorial did an ok job at explaining the basics, but it still needs more explanations on how the game works.\n\nHowever the interface still needs a bit of work, where some buttons simply have no use, and some orders are kind of repetitive. Still, the interface works, and the game is playable already in this state. The biggest problem I found is how little you can see about whats going on in the colony. Colonists are ordered in work teams, but aside from counting them, there's no easy way to find out how many they are. And there's little visual distinction between them apart from their fancy names. This made it hard to figure out who was doing what, and micro-managing becomes extremely tedious.\n\nThe game is very flavourful, and there's lots to do.

Playable up to 2 hours before crash. Witty and fun gameplay with indepth economy/crafting system. Game's price will not decrease.\n\nCONS: It took me about 9 hours to exhaust the fun of this game. It probably would be a lot less if it didn't crash constantly and had a save feature. The game is a mix between Banished and Sims if you've played those. Combat AI is pretty good but workers fail to properly prioritize and pick up tasks (I.E. letting crops fail, not helping other work crews, etc.). Buildings are easy to place but hard to edit during placement (sometimes crashes on renovation too). Population and supplies mostly come in the form of "Immigration" and "Colonial Ministry" events that are somewhat random and frustratingly slow at times. Once jobs or objects are ordered, there is no way to edit them. The price won't increase upon release so no harm in waiting until it's better.","August 19, 2014","false","13.4"," 53 of 96 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","53","96","0","0"

Enjoyable to expand your colony and build things, but the game's pace can be extraordinarily slow. Everyone walks at almost all times, and there's no fast-forward. Everything in this game is an investment of time and patience, which is good-ish in that there's something about it that keeps you interested, but the AI just isn't there yet to ensure that workers actually WORK. They really need to work on optemization, AI, and a bucketload of random events and content. Also the addition of roads, lights, and fences would be nice.\n\nAnyway, it's early access, and fairly satisfactory for at least a few hours... And I just realized now while typing this that the price is $30.

However, each update sees a slew of improvments and features.\n\nThe game plays out EXTREMELY slow. As a matter of fact it's more of an idle game at this point than anything else. While buildings take forever to build and characters move sluggishly without the much needed addition of more time controls, you are given random events that you must respond to depending on a few factors of your colony such as your prestige. If those don't keep your attention, checking in on your colonists may.\n\nEach little person has a full panel where you can check every thing about them including their desires and memories. The latest update gave them "mood bars" which includes a gauge of how sane your characters are at any particular time. Keep a close eye on them, and you may even see your little people start a cult bent on what? ... Well nobody real knows.\n\nClockwork Empires is all good fun, really.

The fact that there are no options to either reduce graphics or gamemap to potentially speed up gameplay is a real downside to the game. The other problem is that the recommended processor doesn’t give the actual speed, just a processor; I’m not a computer whiz so saying “Intel i5 Processor or Equivalent” really means nothing to me, so I don’t know if the problem ultimately is my game or my PC.\n\nSecondly, the game is just too hard, and not in the good challenging way. My colonists are getting super upset because I can’t provide proper food, because I can’t build a kitchen fast enough, because bandits keep coming to wreck everything. If the game is going to make it slow to start things up, it should give more leeway before the enemies start making things difficult. I don’t mind having to work to get things up and running, but it is just down right frustrating when I can hardly get things started before bandits come to curbstomp me.\n\nThirdly, the UI/issues commands needs some work. This is probably related to the first point of the game being very slow for me, but trying to drag an area of the map to set commands, before clicking to do something like “Cut Trees” is far more frustrating than it needs to be. Either the drag box doesn’t encompass everything I want or, more often, the command doesn’t process as I have misclicked what seems one pixel away to cancel the command. It’s a nice idea with the radial command wheel, but I think have a simple alternative as well (i.e. being able to select an object in another dialogue box to issue commands) would go a long way to solve this.\n\nAnother point to briefly mention is that other reviews have mentioned the poor tutorial; it wasn’t great but in all honesty I never really use tutorials, I am a firm believer that a game should be intuitive enough for me to be able to pick it up as I go a long, and this game seemed to do that.\n\nHowever, all criticisms aside, this is a game that has the potential to be really fun. If you’re browsing these reviews and thinking if you should buy it, I’d recommend putting it on your wishlist and following updates. If you’d like to give it a go, wait for a sale to pick it up then, otherwise this is a game to really wait for the devs to patch a few problems.\n\nI should stress again that this game is still in Beta, so don’t take this “No” recommendation as a sign to steer clear. If I could I would give this a middle rating.\n\n","May 23","false","4.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

Instead, I want to limit my input to conceptual matters based on my love for H.P. and the macabre in general.\n1.	RNG: One of the best parts of this game is the RNG, or as I understand it, inability to break the game (not terribly) by exploiting. My main suggestion on this matter is to expand SUBSTANTIALLY is this department.\na.	Add more variables to the variables. You are all on the right track, by implementing things like “should we kill the crybaby who doesn’t want to keep the suspicious goods” or “only teach the fishpeople not to damage crops.” However, it seems as though there needs to be more choices and more random occurrences/events within the colony (we can call them pop-ups for now). Even something so, seemingly mundane as “Jon Smith has been harassing Jake Doe by waking Jake up to try and get him to leave the cot. Usually Jon proceeds to harass until Jake gives up the cot in favor of trying to fall asleep on the floor unmolested rather than in a cot being constantly berated.” (Sorry that was a longer description than needed, but I hope you see my point.)\nb.	We also need more difficulty in the game…I am not entirely sure how or even where to increase the difficulty—but I definitely am NOT suggesting that it become more difficult to gather resources or take longer to turn nodes into bricks. Instead, I mean there should be more difficulty in what events occur. As some others have mentioned, I can currently get way too far in the game without anything bad really happening. Even the Obelisks only killed two of my people before leaving, never to be seen again. It’s not that I feel having a totally random event kill your entire village in a frequent manner is a good idea, but I try to think in terms of the entire premise of H.P. Lovecraft’s mythos and world. This is a world of doom and the never ending struggle against the ancient ones (and more as you all know). It just doesn’t seem like the game is difficult at the moment. As a last point of clarification on this issue, I DO want more difficulty, in part, as a result of RNG; but in a form akin to Call of Cthulhu tabletop games. I suggest that the developers act more like GameMasters of CoC and don’t allow players to go 30 or more days without consequence and little decision making (that likely leads to consequences).\n\nP.S.: Yes, this is a copy and paste of my discussion. I did this in hopes of Developers and other players will read it and chime in.","July 4, 2015","true","52.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

To say I don't recommend this game isn't implying that this game should never be bought and supported through it's development. As an everyday gamer who expects a finished product, you will end up disappointed.\n\nClockwork Empires is realistically ambitious for what is to come. I will point out the cons of what should be worked on/improved/fixed to create an absolutely fun and intriguing game in the future.\n\nCon's\nNot optimized well at all so despite an I7 processor and 12 GB of RAM, this game has a low framerate averaging around 30fps.\nCan't delete the building plans of placed Gabion fortifications. Also can't remove buildings as well once they have been placed and built.\nI have personally experienced issues with soldiers not always responding to bandit threats near my settlement, I assume this is because they attack and there is no notification deciding what to do with a raiding party of bandits.\nI've found that the difficulty of fighting opponents isn't too hard as their frequency is either not often enough or the mental stress is has on my settlers is minimal and easily removed with a single bottle of beer.\nAlso this is a preference, having at least two story buildings would vastly help with customizing buildings and developing a more realistic atmosphere to the game.\nAs a development to the previous point, colouring buildings or modifying the actual structure after a building has already been created would help.\nOnce I have over 10 work crews it's painstaking to try and find a specific crew if I wish to view their skills to assign them to a different job. So possibly when the search bar appears to select a crew for a building, there can be a button that will directly view the crew.\nDespite the low fps and jittering of my fellow settlers, the most brutal experience is waiting for my game to finish saving.\nA glitch I've noticed is that once a high population has been reached, when people go to bed sometimes they will simply stay standing while sleeping right beside the bed.\nWhen the mouse is hovered over the day counter, it will always say "Day 1".\nConifer tress will appear in the ocean and sand areas.\n\nBut as a personal message to the developers, I hope this helps in any way. Thank you for the effort you've put into making a Lovecraftian game. I enjoy it very much and can't wait for all the additions you plan on giving the game.","November 28, 2015","false","13.2"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","40","73","2","3"

It becomes a hassle at times for characters to get to appropriate work stations, and sometimes get confused.\n- Improving AI job selection and ranking work sites.  Currenlty there's no way to guarantee what your workers will do unless you painstakingly micro manage what work sites are available for them.  For example, it'd be nice if I could rank the importance of building a house over a carpentry shop or kitchen, or if I want stone mined over clay if both sites are selected.\n- Create another 'job' title for workers.  Set workers to specifically clean up messes or clear terrain.\n- Creating more infrastructure.  It would be nice to decorate my village a little.  Place roads, build lamp posts, etc.  This could even fall under the job to the workers who clear terrain.\n\nI can think of far more, but I'd really like to see this game put more emphasis into growing a user's town.

HOWEVER, as of right now, the $30 pricetag is absolutely ridiculous. Half the time saving the game crashes it, trying to utilize any of the functions in the game crashes it, and playing it for more than an hour crashes it. I realize that yes; this is an alpha, and it's early access. But you don't slap such a high price onto such a badly unfinished game. The AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and unfortunately there's nothing particularly negative that happens with the Lovecraftian elements as of yet (which I know will be implemented later).\n\nWhen the game is finished, I'll be more than happy to give a review again, but as of right now, I do NOT recommend purchasing it. Wait until there's more done.\n\n*edit on 1/19/15*: Having played the game some more at the request of the developers, I attempted two times, got about an hour to an hour and a half in each time and it crashed.

It is though very early in developement. The general concept is similar to other tactical, economical simulations game. Their gratest imrpove though is the idea of not having individuals appointed to all kinds of jobs by the engine, but to have a whole group do the tasks as one. This brings in the dynamic and speed often missing within the games, also it organizes the order of jobs and economoics.\nThe idea and setting of the game is also one I highly appreciate, for it promises to become a very well done steam-punk game, whereof there is way too little on the market in my oppinion. At least in this sort of genre, mind you. Already there are a lot of interesting mechanics in the order of production and economoy to be seen in the early access, and I look forward to see what else they might include.\n\nThen there is the studio and their individual personallity, mirrored in the story and character of the game. Their humor is awesome and I loved it all the time when playing Dungeons of Dreadmore. It is because of this former game that I went into early access with a lot of trust and faith in this studio! They might have chosen a more tricky set up of a game here, but their idea - or the one I see from the game - is that of a semi mysterius-industrial culture simulation game, with a lot of humor. Thanks to that I see an interesting game evolve here, that will have lots of things to offer for people who enjoyed to play Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Facturio and the like. At least, in my point of view.\n\nLike other Early-Access Projects they do well on including content step by step and simultanously balancing and fixing or repairing priviosly included stuff and mechanics. Also the game-concept itself can be viewed as object-oriented. That is important on a perspective of game developeing: Since it is OO, they >can< take concepts and content of the game and put it into a later phase of the developing. Where other games might fail because the developers have too much to synch at the same time and write together, here there is the option to evolve step by step, which is crucially important.\n\nAgain, this is just my oppinion, based on what I see as a player, without having actually peaked into the code yet. For anyone interested, all you as a buyer need to have is pacience. So far I had a good nose with my picks, and this is one that will grow slowly but steadyly. Though personally I already highly enjoy playing the game (despite minor crashes and bugs I can ignore), for those who have higher standards the game should have grown enough latest by the end of the year. So far they keep going with their monthly updates, which is a huge plus, so they might be even quicker.\n\nTo the devs: Keep the work up! You're on a good way and it's definately worth all the trouble! Best luck and finances!","February 23, 2015","true","9.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You start with a small band of colonists, and a set of supplies, and are charged with creating structures, feeding your colonists, and building a supply chain.  The game is a Victorian/steampunk thing with a good dose of Lovecraft. This Lovecraftianess comes out in a few ways, one of your colonist stats is actually "Madness", there are fishpeople (Insmouth Folk) around, cults, forbidden knowledge etc.  It's an odd intersection with steampunk, but it's done well.  The supply chain is fairly generic, which doesn't fit in well with the otherwise quirky nature of the game.\n\nThe graphics are functional, not bad, but not great by any means.  The music, suits the game well, but could use some more variety.\n\nThis game has been a great model of Early Access: the devs have made frequent and meaningful updates since the game came onto steam ~2 years ago.  The game as it plays today is nothing like it was when it first launched.\n\nI think the biggest con right now may be that they devs seem to be planning on leaving early access, which implies they think the game is nearing completion.  However, I really don't think it's anywhere near ready to go, or at least it would be  a sub-par game if it were released in anything near the current state.  The UI is still ugly, building placement is still very difficult, the production chain is far to hard to manage, there are far too few events, etc.  But, Gaslamp supported Dredmor for quite a while after it launched, so I wouldn't be super concerned about that.\n\nPros\n+Good, cute, quirky charm and settings\n+Good Early Access game\n+Decent variety of environments, crops, and animals (could use more)\n+Really big maps\n+Killing and butchering fishpeople is very satisfying\n+Comical Lovecraftian happenings\n\nCons\n-Needs more music variety\n-UI is still God-awful, and that's with years of improvement\n-The game seems to be coming out of Early Access, which it doesn't look to be ready for\n-The price is quite steep for a game like this; the art assets in particular fall pretty short of the $30 price point","May 23","true","54.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've kept an eye on this game for awhile, but I hadn't bought it until it went on sale when they released the first Beta patch. It's not the most intuitive game in the genre, but it presents the world with style and more UI polish is something that will come in time.\n\nThe creatures in the world, the writing and the variety of options are impressive. I have read a lot about how some of the AI traits evolved, for example when they first started experimenting with the playable alpha they realized that alcoholics were actually good soldiers, because they could forget the horrors of the battles they had been in.\n\nFor those who are familiar with Gaslamp Games previous work, Dungeons of Dredmor, they will know that Gaslamp cultivated an enthusiastic community and embraced their work after the game was released. I am confident that Clockwork Empires will be the same way after it reaches 1.0.

Which has now been delete so as not to confuse.\n\n\nThe game is challenging but is a work in progress. Since the new updates it is becoming not overwhelmingly difficult which does mean a far more enjoyable and relaxed game play.\nThere are still many improvements that many players have mentioned in forums and disscussions which I'm sure the developers have been keeping track of.\n\nThe main ones are:\n- Slow/sketchy gameplay after reaching about 80+ population\n- Population capped at 100 (Believe this is going to be resolved once colonists start claiming houses thus being able to multiply)\n\nSome of the recommedations I think would be good in next update:\n- Resources; Once the kitchen is built and work crew assigned. Food cooked here should count more for decreasing hunger in colonists. Thus helping to lower the chance of running out of food.\n- Trading with Allies and Neutral Tribes\n- Colonists that are armed (such as hunters) can also help army defend colony\n- Limits to how big you can build buildings\n\nThere are other little peeves but they'll probably be teethed out as these improvements are made.\n\nAll up Clockwork Empires is starting to become a game I can see myself enjoying and if you like management/Stragety/Building games then I'm sure like me you'll see the potetial of this game and where it's head.","November 23, 2015","true","204.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's an indie game and costs about 1/2 as much as the Witcher 3. So is it at least 1/2 as good a value as the witcher 3? No, not even one tenth. Is it polished enough to issue it as a finished game? No. In fact I would dare say it's currently in alpha.\n\nIt's broken and rough, for instance if you go into the options menue you risk being overwhelmed by the plethora of choices, such as music; On or Off. That's right, On or Off. Do you want to change the volume? No problem, just exit onto the main menue and... Oh wait, you can't, you need to exit the game, then restart it, and THEN on that starting screen you can change the volume. But not much else. Every time the game loads, you're pretty much past the point of certain that is has crashed again (nothing moves, the music stops), and THEN it starts.\n\nBetas can work, as long as you've got a somewhat stable and solid setup. Clockwork Empires combines the helplessness and slow ♥♥♥ pace of the Settlers with a grueling difficulty level close to that of Banished. The AI or AS rather, is what you find yourself relying on, yet it fails again and again to complete even the simplest of tasks, creating bottlenecks and downward spirals for your colonies.\n\nI've seen them wasting days picking things  up and dropping them, picking them up and dropping them, again and again. And you wonder why that vital building project isn't being built, that's why. I've seen them pick up resources and then heading out into the wilderness to gather more of said resource. Because whenever I go out to gather stones, I always bring some heavy boulders with me, because why not. It only gets better when said colonist gets spooked by some wildlife, drops the resources in the middle of nowhere and runs back home empty handed. The cooks finish meals only to gobble them down the second after and just, wow. I could go on.\nThere's no prioritizing certain projects, unless you want to pause every other project, and even then with a work crew assigned to do just about everything, they're still mostly Idle, chatting away, and eating ten times their body weight, doing pretty much everything except the one thing you need them to.\n\nIn 10hours, I've played 2 Colonies. Only 2 you say? Yes, because this game is SLOW! There's no fastforward button, buildings are erected in real time, colonists plod along in a zombie like pace etc. In both cases I've found that starvation is very hard to counteract, mostly because you don't start with any staple crops. The first time I started in the arctics, could grow nothing but cabbages; they sowed, reaped, and ate the produce right away while standing in the fields, didn't have the time to process or stockpile it. Hunting is unreliable, foraging doesn't yield enough, so what to do.\nThe second time I started on a savannah, got chilli, tea and sugar. Does any of those sound like staple crops to you? At first I thought I could get by on hunting, but no. The meat dropped by the giant beetles apparently taste horrid and doesn't satisfy, and in either case isn't plentiful enough. Not even when they go cannibalistic do they manage to fill their bellies. Apparently eating a whole human isn't enough to satisfy their hunger needs once they're starving!\nDespite my best efforts to get along with the fishpeople, one of my moronic colonists went and raided one of their hatching piles when I wasn't looking and hadn't told him to, and as a result, I now get constant, endless, raiding parties whittling away at my starving colonists. My colonists' staple diet now consists of fishpeople steaks. Which they hate, and are STILL starving.\n\nWhen you need overseers you get workers, when you need workers you get overseers. There's always too much/too little of either or, and they apparently rely on different conditions. For instance, I managed to get a -66 relationship standing with my own empire using a diplomacy office (I kept asking for food, apparently they didn't like that). So now I never get any overseers, which means that if one of my current overseers die, I'm pretty screwed. You can't promote workers into overseers or anything like that, they are special snowflakes and if they die, which usually you have zero control over, it can be really bad. Again with the unstoppable downward spirals.\n\nOh and you can't name the workteams either. So you can end up with The Happy Soldiers tending to a cabbage patch, and until they get skilled enough in farming, there's no quick way to see what they are doing without clicking on them (usually it just says Idle anyways, lazy bums). I get it, you have a high soldiering skill, but you're farmers now so shut up and farm.\n\nThe game has plenty of those catch 22 moments that prevents you from enjoying it. In the savannah, there's apparently very little stone to be had, but it isn't obvious at first glance and I didn't know just how limited the colonists were in how far away they can move. I figured I needed a trade office to get stone. Guess what the trade office required to be built? Yes, stone. In the end, I solved it, but it's one of those cases where there's no way you could have known that it was going to be an issue and could have prepared for it in advance, since nobody told you. If you see a bunch of stone piles scattered around, you probably figure, hey I got stone, no problem. But you don't realize how little those piles actually yield in the end. And the tutorial only gives a generic runthrough (no mention of how to solve the food problem though), same for every enviroment, when it clearly shouldn't be.\n\nAnd you need to build a kitchen to cook. How bout a camp fire, and some tents for shelter that degrade over time. Who sends out colonists to sleep on the dirt and without proper crops to grow, apparently these people.\n\nSo TLDR; it isn't balanced properly. And being forced to rely on the slow and moronic AI while nothing really happens that requires your attention, makes it that the game could just as easily be on standby without you. It isn't FUN to play is what I'm getting at. I can see a lot of potential with the idea, but some serious work is required to get it to a functioning level, and since the devs have the audacity to charge this much for a broken alpha version of the game and dare to say it's almost close to being finished; makes it so that I strongly doubt it will ever reach that potential.\nI would be happy if you prove me wrong though, so by all means, aim to do just that. But for now, for this price and claiming that it's almost finished when it's clearly not, gets a downvote from me.","June 3","false","19.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It reminds me slightly of "Dwarf Fortress", only with less features (For now, at least) and graphic interface. Worth every penny and I do not regret purchasing it.\n\nEdit (04.05.2016): Some time has passed, couple of patches been released and I've decided to give it another try. Aaand, on the bright side: I loved the individuality in your citizens. Everyone has it's own traits, habits, manias, goals, fears, etc. They could get scared, angry, crazy, depressed, etc. They could have suicidal tendencies, communist thoughts, planning a revolt or a riot against you, join a cult and praise some ancient evil or rob your storages and run into the wilds to form a gang, so you never know what to expect from your citizens and you should keep an eye on troublesome ones... They can make friends and enemies among other settlers and that is a pretty big and not that common feature in games.\n\nWhat I did not like is, there is no subterranian layer and you can only build on the surface and also, there isn't much space for your creativity, as all the buildings are square-shaped and pretty much looks the same. The difference is the utility and decorations, but that's about all... And this is a buzzkill after you got a while playing the game, everything starts to feel the same.\n\nAlso, the updates are reeeaaally slow. It takes about 2-3 monts for a new update, so maybe I'll check on this game later. But for now, there isn't anything else to report.

There are not many different building types that you build (which can take a while and all you do is watch and wait) and besides that there is really nothing to do. 100 colonists max is also not a lot to work with. It's way, way too easy, there are no challenges, no real goals just nothing to do there. Also the game constantly crashes and the UI and menus are horrible in their current state.\n\nI will certainly update this review if anything more should be added or improved.","February 23","false","44.0"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

I bought Clockwork Empires because it looked like a cool project, a Dwarf Fortress kind of game - a game that could produce the fascinating situations that arise from the complex interaction between your colonists and the enviroment they inhabit.\n\nI felt like I wrote a fair and balanced review, based on my experience with this game.\n\nI decided to play it a bit more, research its mechanics and the basics of how this game works and its community. This brought me to realize I was wrong, my earlier review was not fair.\n\nThis game doesn't have any working mechanics, this doesn't have basic functions, this game is not just in the very early stages of development - Clockwork Empires isn't developing at all.\n\nNobody knows how this game works, not even the people developing it. I read the official forums, and\nI see that the problems people are having, are not because of the bugs or them misunderstanding the various functions of this game. It is because there are no functions, there is no logic or reason to anything going on in the game.\n\nIt is chaos. No reason, no logic, no basics - nothing to rely on. It is an utterly incomprehensible mess.\n\nThe developers will at some point have to realize there is no way they can salvage this. Like other early access developers, there will come a point where they will be forced to abandon this project.\n\nhttp://clockworkempires.gamepedia.com/Clockwork_Empires_Wiki\n\nThat is the link to the Clockwork Empires wiki. A place one goes to when you need a basic explanation of how something works in a game. The wiki contains no answers - no facts - no basics. Just rambling steampunk fantasy texts, but nothing in relation to how the game works, because it doesn't.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nDon't buy this. This is just a fantasy project. This will never turn into a game and you will have wasted almost 30 Euro on absolutely nothing. It is steampunk fanfiction visualised into some kind of bizarre abomination of a computer program.\n\nFirst I thought it might end up as a finished product, since the developers are so dedicated and obviously invested time and money into this. I get the feeling they put their heart and soul into this too. Sadly they built the foundation of their dream on top of quicksand, so no matter how much they work on this - it will inevitably sink down into the depths.","September 28, 2014","false","6.9"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsparagusKid/recommended/224740/","TheAsparagusKid","The Asparagus Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAsparagusKid/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-----------\nUpdate\n\nStill recommending you hold off on buying.\n\nI have figured out a big part of the problem.  The dev team needs to fix the pacing and needs management.\n\nYou need too many facilities on day 1 and your settlers work much too slowly.  Keep in mind that you start with around 9 people and they all work SLOWLY.\n\n* You need a lower class house for everyone to sleep in.  Building it will take about 3 days.\n\n* You'll need a carpenter, which gets built relatively quickly but still a little too long. - And assign an overseer to it.\n\n* The lower class house will also need beds, so you'll need cloth, which means you also have to build a textile workshop (this is where it starts adding up) and assign an overseer to it.\n\n* In order to get the flax you need for cloth, you'll have to make a farm for it and assign an overseer wtih a team team to it.\n\n* Keep in mind, these buildings take stone and wood so you'll need to have overseers wtih teams gathering those as well.\n\n* You need to feed everyone so you have to build a kitchen and assign an overseer to it, preferrably with a team.\n\n* The kitchen needs food to cook so you'll need to make another farm and assign an overseer with a team to it.\n\n* There are going to be bandits and fish people attacking soon (even if you decide to avoid conflict, your people will seek it out) so you need to build a barracks and assign an overseer with a team to it.\n\n* The CONSTANT fighting is going to require the services of a Barber (doctor) so build that and assign an overseer to it.\n\n* Within a few days, people will be complaining that they're sleeping below their station and they want a church.  To build either of these, you'll need a ceramics workshop so build it and assign an overseer to it.\n\n* You can forgo the church but it just adds more fighting because of cultists.\n\n* Settlers DO NOT DEFEND THEMSELVES - EVEN WHEN ARMED.  This is insane.  Once your guards have been whittled away, a single enemy will slowly destroy your entire settlement.  And even if they are eventually stopped, they kill valuable overseers making it impossible to keep up with the overwhelming basic needs of the settlement.\n\n\nEnd of update\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHave "played" for several hours now.  Moves SO SLOWLY and takes forever to get anything done.  Feels more like a screensaver than a game.\n\nI was excited about this game because of all of the hype around the intelligence of the people making it and how intricate behavior would be.  It doesn't feel intelligent AT ALL.  There really isn't any good information presented to the player to help them know what's going on or why.  This game needs a TON of work in making it easier to understand what's happening with the people and the settlement.  Help me out a little.\n\nFishpeople bring me gifts, drop them off, then proceed to attack and kill everyone.  Just keep your damn gifts, fishpeople!  I haven't even done anything to provoke an attack, much less the non-stop fish raids.\n\nSettlers with rifles just running around and getting killed by fishpeople instead of defending themselves.\n\nAgain.... takes forever for colonists to get anything done.  They are demanding buildings that can't be provided because they can't even take care of the basics in a reasonable amount of time.  Waiting literal hours for jobs to get done is insane.\n\nAs I write this, I'm down to 1 Overseer, fishpeople have been in my town, killing people, non-stop for reasons I don't know, and there is now an army preparing to invade me.  Losing like this would be great if I felt like I had anything to do with it.  Instead, I feel like the devs just have some lazy code in here.\n\nFINAL\nFar from intelligent.\nFar fom done (hopefully).\nFar from fun.","November 18, 2015","false","54.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

There is no way to deconstruct and some structures will bug out and not work (had my storage area just stop working so no one would stock items there as well as my woodshop just stop producing planks). like I said the game is fun and could go places but there is the folly of early access, most people will buy and never play again due to the bad taste it leaves in your mouth.

It doesn't matter the settings I put it on, nor actions I take in the game. Getting past day three without a crash hasn't happened yet. Save games are buggy as well.\n\nWhile I enjoy games of this type immensely and this is a pretty nice look for the genre, there are a lot of kinks to work out. The finished product should do well, but the price point is a question in my mind. I rarely pay that much for a game and when I do, I like most people, expect a bit more in terms of options and customization.\n\nIf you enjoy these types of games, my advice would be to wholeheartedly purchase the game. Just be prepared for an inordinate amount of frustration with the crashes.","September 14, 2014","true","41.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And then, it sat there unsused for a while.\nUntil about today when I picked up and actually played it.\n\nWhat follows are my thoughts.\n\nI have a crappy computer in regards to high end games. Its a laptop, assembled by HP. Its a pretty good laptop and it runs a lot of the games I like to play. It can't run games with too high graphics (Like portal sometimes) but it gets the job done. It has issues running Clockwork Empires. The camera panning is super laggy, and in all directions. Due to this, I might miss some things. Also my citizens lag around everywhere. I feel this needs corrected.\n\nThe tutorial is good at teaching you the most basic aspects of the game, but fails to teach you about add-ons and modules, something that will become important later.\n\nEverything is called a 'node' here. Like, 'Clay node' or 'Rock Node' Why not just call it 'Clay' or 'Rock'? Its petty, sure, but it needs to be said.\n\nYou are able to click and drag a white square about your world to get bigger jobs done. It works well, but again, its lags about  and doesnt start where I clicked orignally. Usually it starts somewhere below where I first clicked.\n\nYou have stockpiles that allow you to visually see all the things you have collected. I like that. However it doesn't do a good enough job to inform me of my resources. I almost want to ask for just the amounts to be applied to the UI, as I feel it would be better to keep track of things.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and compare this game to Sim City 2000. (The best one in my opinion). Sim City 2000 made it quite clear what you needed, and where you needed it. If you needed more housing, you'd know right away. I feel the game could benifit from a similar feature. I realize the citizens tell you what they need via Icons and that's neat, but far too many of themoften go unexplained. (Happy faces, sad faces I can understand. A purple swirl? I couldn't know what that means.)\n\nSo here's a shocker. Its worth the higher price. Its a great game of what I'm able to play well enough.\nIts got a sense of humor that only exists to those that read everything. "Enough of this! I am going to go and eat tasty rocks." I laughed at that. Keep it. its wonderful. I'm going to use that quip later, I know I will.\n\n\nThis game has tons of potential but only seems to work on a computer that is not a potato.\n\nTL;DR Summary:\n\n+ Humor\n+ Options\n+ Music\n+ Decent UI\n+ Graphics are fine for what it is\n+Humor\n+ Tutorial is funny and gets the point across.\n\n- My Laptop stutters to play it\n- Menus are a bit long winded but I don't think there is much you can actually do\n- Loading takes a while\n- Tutorial leaves a few things out\n- I've suffered two crashes from loading alone\n\nOverall; I'd say this is going to be a great game but jeez it needs work.\n\nI'd say Wait. Wait for it to improve more. But I would totally buy it again once it works on some of its biggest issues, as listed above.","March 13, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not happy whith where it was I dismantled it but it still saved to that position though deleted, leaving 2 kelns but only 1 showing up in the module placing menu.\n\nAnother Issue I had with modules was placing a module outside of a building by mistake, the supplies needed to nuild the module were still being delivered but the module couldn't be deleted.\n\nThis issues with the modules are minor compared to the fun and steady gameplay that I've been having and that the game is now actually playable to the point it is reviewable.

There are some moments of watching paint dry. Crashes now few and far between. So much fun to be had. And plenty of potential to build on from here. Devs: Good job, well done. Delighted to have been proven wrong in my previous reviews.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nWell: One year later. A reply by the devs. What else can I do but download and give it another try.\nNo crashes, and the game has improved. This is getting close to a proper early access release.\n\nAt this point the game plays like watching paint dry. I will be trying again. There is soo much potential. And the team is starting to tap into that potential. The job system is STILL bugged. buildings go idle, and ignore any new production orders. THis one has a long way to go.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThere have been some upgrades, devs are working on the product. That is good.  The game is actually getting better. But just not anywhere near good enough not even for early access. Jobs are simply not getting done by the toons. who are standing idle. Basic stuff that should be caught not by users, but by devs.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEarly acces... Very early access.... Still too early access.\nFantastic potential. Cannot wait for th eupgrades. But the current version crashes too often.\n\nWait for the upgrades: The devs may have messed this up completely looking at the trouble they have getting the load/save function to work. Check out the dev forum.\n\nAfter the 'major' upgrade on 10/18: Still completely unplayable.

Unlike other pre-release titles I have supported, this is actually in continual development.  There are no other titles I will happily restart a game with when a save file is no longer compatible.

Different facets are being developed and integrated all the time, and it's compatible for most systems (I believe Linux is in the works - some graphics cards are still incompatible, but I don't know when or if they'll address that).\n\nThe updates are regular and thorough, and the development team is very welcoming of input, suggestions and bug reports from players new and old. They're clearly extremely attentive and they care a great deal about making this game the best they can, and as fun as possible, which is an important factor for me. I admit I haven't forayed much into the Cultist side of things, but I've yet to really balance the ravenous insanity with a productive colony (got to keep working, don't you know!).\n#\nDon't complain if your game crashes, or script errors appear - take screenshots, snag .dmp files and saves, and throw them on the forums! (https://community.gaslampgames.com/) They get looked at and either put on The List to fix, or addressed in short order.\n\nTL;DR - definitely a game worth investing in despite (expected) bugs and crashes, and I am glad to have done so.

Lot's of potential and  look forward to making a more approving review in the future, though at this point, due to non-responsive commands and the constant game crashing, I would not recomend getting it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHIS IS MY REVIEW AFTER PICKING THE GAME UP AGAIN\n\nI've had hours of gameplay without a single crash and though still a bit floppy on the commands, more responsiveness that he game is actually playable and very enjoyable, the visuals seem to have been slighlty polished and newer options have been added.\n\nThere are still some bugs happening, for example I went to place a module, was a furnace for the metalworks, which is lacking some responsiveness here in the sense that the module is not always placed on the first click or exactly where you want it. Not happy whith where it was I dismantled it but it still saved to that position though deleted, leaving 2 kelns but only 1 showing up in the module placing menu.\n\nAnother Issue I had with modules was placing a module outside of a building by mistake, the supplies needed to nuild the module were still being delivered but the module couldn't be deleted.\n\nThis issues with the modules are minor compared to the fun and steady gameplay that I've been having and that the game is now actually playable to the point it is reviewable. Looking forward to continue updating my reviews and waiting for future updates.","August 28, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game needs to be optimized and some rough edges need smoothing out but compared to alot of early access games on the market this one is good.","December 26, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's an Alpha release - only the most deluded would expect no bugs or issues however the devs listen, feedback and have no shortage of ideas (read their blog!). Their sense of humour is wonderful as is their support for the community - ideas really do get implemented. Unlike other pre-release titles I have supported, this is actually in continual development.  There are no other titles I will happily restart a game with when a save file is no longer compatible. Speaks volumes.\n\nDon't listen to the idiot trolls that pervade Steam; if you like this genre, have a go - you'll probably not like the addiction that comes with it. Just remember it is not finished ... dear me .. try to remember that!","January 4","true","323.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mixes the humor of Dungeons of Dredmor with the addictive yet relaxing gameplay of Banished.  The developers write thorough and candid diaries and churn out meaningful and regular updates, and this is one of the few games that I'm actually happy to follow along for the development process.","January 12","true","58.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bugs are presant and after 19 hours it is not so playable.\n\nPlus points:\nIntricate, difficult, good humor, novel setting.\n\nMinus points:\nBugs, balance, bugs, the information system and bugs.\n\nThe game comes with a basic tutorial but while this is helpful it doesn't teach some of the important points. Can I for instance add to a building after it has been built? The answer, no but the blueprint idea makes it seem as if I can.\n\nThe starting choise of area is nice but it does not go over any of the good or bad points of each area. Maybe this is deliberate to give the feeling of exploration but a little extra info would be nice.\n\nThe bugs, all the bugs. While I haven't met any totally game breaking bugs yet I have met ones that make it very hard ot keep playing. My worst bug is a caricter not eating, he is still with a task (that has been cancled) but he will not go to eat. Some build jobs will not complete. Build jobs don't work right. I've also had floors disapearing (but still being the in game). Person images disapearing. Tool tips disapearing. Traded items still apearing in inventory but not usable (as they ahve been "sold"). Mine workers walking to the edge of the map to "get to the overseer" (who is in the town but in the mine). The game uses about 30% of my CPU but is slowing down at above 30 people with plenty of computer resorces left. Cancel buttons not working (Esc still works). Can't cancled the building of fences or gabions. There seem to be not only no way to change the key bindings but also no way to see what they are. I can't find a time accellerate, but maybe there isn't one. People also seem happier sleeping on the floor in a nice building that a bed in a simple building (but this could be a game choise).\n\nThe game is constantly being worked on, so this is not a dropped project but bugs are still very presant.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nStyle: 9/10\nGraphics 6/10 (partly due to bugs)\nGuidence: 5/10\nBugs: 3/10\n\nOverall: 5/10 wait for the bugs to be fixed.","May 23","false","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be frustrating to work through and does little to illuminate game mechanics.\n\nThe game is receiving updates and the developers look to be actively tweaking systems to improve gameplay and resolving bugs.\n\nAll said, I've enjoyed the time I have spent playing the game so far. The game concept and play are entertaining. The difficulty is reasonable and gives a sense of challenge and achievement when playing.","June 3","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had been looking for a game like this and I'm very meticulous for my research and my pickiness, ask my husband. =P That being said...the video had me hooked...the campy, dark humour with a Lovecraftian tone?! I ended up watching player made video's and decided, despite the higher price, I NEEDED this game. No regrets. Bugs and all I love it!\n\nThe Dev team is constantly working on things...even on the weekends...and with colds. I've gone through a slew of patches with them. I'm doing the experimental patches, to hopefully help catch some of the bugs. These guys are working their tail feather off, and I think they are getting unjust reviews here. Hence, me reviewing...which this is my first game review, that's how much I am loving this game. The community on their official site forum are really awesome folks, haven't run across a "troll". A bit of teasing on my lack of lingo, but I'm okay with that, heck I expect that. It is all in good fun.\n\nOne of the things I did notice on reviews was "slow" pace or the need to speed up the in-game time. I don't think that would work...it is, afterall, a Time Management game. You have to actually play the game, set the tasks, don't over assign so the poor little colonists just get all bottlenecked and confused. I have no patience, again ask the husband, but this game has my focus. I did step away for a bit and didn't pause, came back and well it wasn't pretty...bandits and fish people attacking and slowly eating my people. One by one. It was funny to watch. Yes, I'm twisted. Why this game appeals to me so much.\n\nAnother thing, it is early access, still. Which means you will have to restart, there will be bugs...big company games release full games with more bugs than this one has now...For me it was well worth the price. Oh another really cool thing with all the restarting I've done...not one single game was the same. Not even remotely. It's a mystery bag full of twisted fun. I highly recommend this game for those that like a good challenge, are willing to work with the issues knowing they are being fixed as FAST as the Dev's can and are a bit twisted...liking and/or loving Lovecraft is just a really awesome perk.","June 5","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
