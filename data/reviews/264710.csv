Can't do it anymore.   There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts.\n\nThe freedom.  The solitude.  The Unknown...    It's all out there, hidden beneath the waves.\n\nSubnautica is the game I have been waiting for.  In a strange way, it feeds the sea-hunger inside me somehow.  Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived, but that's how it works for me.\n\nI stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips.  Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks?  I did. Definitely got my attention, as I recall.  It was an Early Access release, so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself.  My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too, but it didn't matter.  I wanted that game.  Badly.\n\nI bought it.  I played it.  I built things and survived. I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again.\n\nIt's an alien ocean on an alien world.  Curiously, the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar, in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place.  There is indescribable beauty to be found here, side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious.  It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world,  as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask.\n\nRemember.  YOU are the intruder down there.\n\nTake a deep breath and immerse yourself completely.\n\nWelcome to Subnautica.","April 16, 2015","true","385.7"," 1,046 of 1,070 people (98%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","98","046","1","62","32"

If you're reading this review, you know about all that. I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games, and I have played quite a few in the last months.  Here is my personal impression of this one.\n\nGraphics are incredible. I know everyone has said this, but it needs repeating. On the lowest settings, it still looks awesome! Some clipping and such, but it never really bothered me much.\n\nIt's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own, but not enough to make it boring.\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game, keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water, it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily, but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation, I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far.\n\nHere is what any new player needs to know:\n\nExpect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't.\nExplore. Even the dark and scary areas. They usually have the best loot.\nStorage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review.)\nPredators are everywhere and you are not one of them. If it can eat you, it will.\nIf it can eat you, it's usually in a scary area.\nYou WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared.\nGive it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online, and once you do, do it very sparingly. Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out, the more valuable this game will be.","December 26, 2015","true","100.6"," 822 of 844 people (97%) found this review helpful 111 people found this review funny","97","822","844","111","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamexotic/recommended/264710/","gamexotic","Bloodgroove","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamexotic/","2172 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter 41 hours, I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game.  It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water.  The game will be very different depending on which mode you play, because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without every having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment.  In hardcore, you have to be extra careful, because once you die you have to start over.  At this point, I'm glad I did not pick hardcore, because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable.  There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death, like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nThis game is amazing.  That can be, and is, said about many games.  But there is nothing like Subnautica.  I had been waiting for 19 years, ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive, fun, but ultimately flawed Sub Culture.  Finally, we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline.  With that said, Subnautica has flaws.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIn all it's glory, there are a few nags, some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game.  First, I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start, because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load.  This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly.  In any event, I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.\n\nAlso, The learning curve is very steep.  There are no instructions for anything, and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does.  There are some basic descriptions, but they're very poor.  For example the current generator says it generates current.  When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.\n\n\nThe third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles.  There is much debate about the actual depth of the game.  Some say it goes on forever.  Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60,000 meters.  Some have said 20,000 meters.  Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths, which sounds pretty epic.  In any event.  The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about.  The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters.  (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency.  I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)\n\nFourth, the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly.  This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode, but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on.  As a result, you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water.  Which leads me to the next problem in the game.\n\nFifth, scarcity of food and supplies for making water.  At first, everything is plentiful and readily available.  Salt, while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for, seems to respawn readily and limitlessly.  Coral, while seemingly limitless at first, begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay.  Moreover, I have seen no indication that it respawns.\n\nFood, which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks, can disappear amazingly fast from an area.  After 41 hours of gaming, I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean, plus the surrounding depths of fish.  It's amazing how fast they diminish.  The only solution seems to be to put respawning, or faster reproduction, of the fish in the game.  I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all, which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save.  There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups.  Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited, and all you have to do is look further.  My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter, energy, and other resources to find food.\n\nBecause of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game.  The devs claim it causes people to explore more.  I'm not satisfied with that response, because the reality is this:  if people have no motivation to explore.  If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink, they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently, a fix is being tested in the experimental mode, but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.\n\nSixth, and my final gripe, and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth, scarcity of resources.  Copper, Quartz, Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first, but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on.  Quartz is practically used in everything, because you need it for glass and rubber, which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles.  Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources, which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly.  Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources.  Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem, that there's plenty in the depths.  The problem is that it takes more and more energy, food, and water to farm this stuff.  You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources.  This really need to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity.\n\nBoth of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity, with the argument that resources are scarce in real life.  I would like to point out, however, that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life.  Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person.  Also, if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game, diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates.  The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams.\n\nThe Good:\n\nBased on my criticisms, some might get the idea that I don't like the game.  That couldn't be more wrong.  Subnautica is, hands down, simply the best underwater game ever made.  There's no competition.  The environment is rich, full of wonder, and among the most immersive games I've ever played.  The world is packed full of fascinating creatures, beautiful vegetation, and unparalleled undersea effects.  The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine.  All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.\n\nIt's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever, at least among those who have played it.  In my opinion, the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves.  The amount of stuff you can do in this game, and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing.  Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica.  Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations.  Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out, like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past.  I just hope they maintain the trend.\n\nSubnautica is an oustanding game, worth its price about three times over.  It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state, I would give Subnautica a 9/10.","February 18","true","134.7"," 714 of 735 people (97%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","97","714","735","42","13"

It has had some amazing upgrades since the beginning of its early access, demonstrating that the devs are invested in the completion of this game.\n\nNot sure if you want to buy it?\n\n- When you start Subnautica you begin in a futuristic survival dingy. The graphics are somewhat cartoony, but in a way that's easy on the eyes. This is tempered toward a more serious tone. The water effects are amazing. If you've ever gone scubadiving or serious snorling this game's going to bring some strong nostalgia.\n- The main objectives of the game are not here yet. 2015. Updates are frequent though. Several a month or just one big one per month.\n- Right now, the things you'll be doing are gathering resources and building things.\n1\nThis is far from the boredom of most survival games. The things you can build are truly unique. There's also a lot of advantage to building a base besides storage. The devs listen to what we've asked for and a lot of module components to be bases have been given that are purely to allow you more aesthetic and functionality options that look incredible. No grunge here. This game gives you sleek, clean, and beautiful everything.\n2\nModules. This is a big part of Subnautica. As you advance in your understanding of resource gathering and building various architecture you'll find yourself coming upon " fragments ". These things are debris from your crashed ship that can be analyzed using a specialized device. After the analysis is complete you'll be able to build more advanced bases, submaurines, and components to your everything.\n3\nWild life. Recently a bunch of new wild life has been added to the game that are rather awesome. The wildlife was already awesome, but now as you explore you're much more conscious of just where you are.\n4\nConscious of your environment. This game is the first to make me very conscious of the different environments I'm in. Lighting changes dramatically depending on a number of circumstances, but altogether the effects are such that you begin to realize you must develop a strong presence of mind.

Even though it is still in early access, the developers have done a very nice job with what is available as of yet. The fact that the game constantly encourages you to report bugs (which so far are pretty rare, surprisingly) allows me to trust that this game is only going to get better. Not only that, but some of the features/creatures that are planned for future updates (check out the Subnautica Wikia to see what I mean), have got me absolutely giddy.\n\nThe good:\n-I love survival games, and while I would probably enjoy most of the popular survival games available on Steam, Subnautica managed to really stick out for me. Subnautica takes place (98% of the time) submerged underwater, which is really a brilliantly fresh approach to a survival game.\n\n-Subnautica takes place on an alien planet, full of fascinating life forms. This really appeals to me, probably because I've always been a huge fan of games such as Pikmin (Gamecube), that are stocked full of unfamiliar biologies. The creatures in Subnautica aren't too cheesy though, esspecially the larger ones... The larger one's are either stunningly magnificent and/or terrifying.\n\n-The environment is beautiful, and yet equally eerie. There are multiple biomes that make up the planet of Subnautica, and each biome has a unique ecosystem for the player to discover. Some of these biomes are cut-off from early game becuase of how deep they are, meaning that you have to craft things such as a spare oxygen tank or even a submarine to reach.\n\n-Instead of being able to eventually upgrade your character to fight off the larger-scale hostile creature(s), Subnautica currently has a bit of realism to it. Of course you're not going to try and fight off a giant angry serpent with claws pertruding from it's face. Any normal human is going to NOPE the ♥♥♥♥ out, which brings a bit of a horror-feel to it. (Currently there is really only one creature that is like this, but the developers are working on animating new creatures that are way larger, and/or waaay more terrifying)\n\n-With the above said, the player is able to fight off most hostile creatures as they are smaller and more practically killable. Still, even these creatures tend to attack out of no-where which gives a nice element of surprise.\n\n-There is plenty to craft and it's not exceedingly annoying to do so, either. Instead of being stranded with just the clothes on your back, the player is left with some advanced technologies left over from the ship-wreck that allow you to craft complex things (such as a battery or high-tech machineries) out of basic materials found in the ocean.\n\n-Also, underwater bases. Currently the bases you can make are pretty simple. On the exterior, they are basically just tubes with the option of adding windows, but I've seen pictures of bases some people have made in the Experimental Mode that look amazing, so it's appearant that bases with much more complexity will be brought in soon.\n\nThe bad:\n-Not much to be said here honestly. I guess one thing I would like to see is a better indication of a hostile creature losing health. Maybe not a health-bar, but something. I find myself having to continuosly knife things that may have been dead a while ago. I mean, I know they aren't going to drop to the ground because they are underwater, but it would be nice if there were some sort of death animation.\n\n-Also, another thing that bothered me during one of my playthroughs is the radiation. The ship that you ejected yourself from before the start of the game explodes pretty early in the game which causes a huge radiation leakage in the surrounding waters. A few of my playthroughs this wasn't a problem, and you can craft a radiation suit and even stop the radiation leakage altogether with the proper equipment, but in one particular playthrough the radiation instantly surrounded my escape-pod before I even had a means to craft a radiation suit or build a new base. I'm not sure if this was intended, as it seemed to be a one-time occurence for me.\n\nOther than that this game has been great thus far. I even feel as though this is going to be one of those games that I will obsess about. If you like survival games, but are bored of fending off wolves or zombies, this is a great alternative and I would recommend it to anybody.\n\nCan't wait for the final product. :)","July 23, 2015","true","15.1"," 163 of 167 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","163","167","9","4"

In most survival games players usually have the advantage of being able to craft weapons for killing off an enemy, just not in this game. In Subnautica, you have practically NO means to kill or harm predators, and this alien planet is teeming with all sorts of things that want nothing more than to pick your bones. Beng human on earth, we take comfort in the knowlege that we are the #1 predator. Now let us put a human in an alien ocean that is filled with massive marine predators that have no true enemies. That combined with a lack of weapons gives players an insight on what it feels like to be prey.\n\n\nPros of subnautica\n. great open-world environment\n. easy to follow plot\n. great diversity of creatures\n. atmoshperic environments\n. realistic graphics (in experimental)\n. tests player's ability to manage resources\n. non-offensive survival\n\nCons of Subnautica\n. can get boring in between updates\n. loading screen may take some time\n. some pcs are not compatable with this game\n. (currently) plant and animal resources do not regenerate\n. there are some texture bugs\n\nI still would like to give this game a YES to those who enjoy survival, crafting, aliens, underwater, and open-world games. Please keep in mind that this game has a lot that needs to be added and fixed. Subnautica has a lot of potential, and I look forward to seeing the final product.","November 29, 2015","true","321.2"," 184 of 194 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","184","194","10","0"

Just Yes.\n\nThis is the perfect example of what an EA title can achieve when it isn't wasting resources trying to be an MMO during development.\n\nIf you enjoy playing survival games, and can appreciate the atmosphere\setting of being stranded alone on an ocean planet - I highly recommend you pick this little beauty up.\n\nThe scavenging and crafting system is unique and fantastic to use. No remembering recipes - you are a technologically advanced humanoid - blueprint database and fabricator for you from day 0! (This doesnt make it easier btw)\n\nIn order to survive and progress, you must scavenge the resources available to you - sand, rocks, minerals, metal scrap (from your crash landed ship) aquatic fauna & flora etc.\n\nYou must eat & drink to survive, and this is done by hunting the local fauna. Be careful though - not all are harmless!\n\nCertain "fish" will allow you to fabricate different resources. For example the bladder fish allows the extraction of drinking water when returned to the fabrication systems. Other fauna grant a certain amount food, as well as either an increase or decrease in thirst depending on the species.\n\nOnce you have established a method of staying alive, its time to build your submerged base and really start exploring the massive ocean & underwater cave systems.\n\nBetter resources are often at greater depths, meaning you must equip yourself with enough O2 to make your dive. This can be as simple as an o2 tank on your back, or perhaps you can find enough resources diving to build a sub and go even deeper?\n\nOverall, plenty to see and do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/264710/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSubnautica casts you as the lone survivor of a colony mission, stranded on a faraway ocean planet. It being Early Access means there's no real story or goal here other than survival, but there's plenty to see and do as you putter around the seas. Your escape pod has a basic crafting device and some storage to serve as a home base, so your first steps will be scavenging materials off the ocean floor and building essentials like knives, flippers, oxygen tanks, and food. Basic recipes for these things appear by default in the crafting interface, and more appear as you find new materials, so it pays to grab at least one of everything. There are a few hangups in the crafting progression, like figuring out how to make lubricant or finding enough silver to break into advanced crafting, but on the whole it's clearer and more engaging than most crafting systems.\n\nOne major draw of the game is the ability to build undersea bases, and thankfully that's one of the first things you can do. Basic building components generally require only the most common materials, so you can have your own sealab up and running within 15 minutes if you know what you're doing. They're very much worth building, too, because you can set up water purifiers, submarine docks, storage systems, and a couple cosmetic options like aquariums and picture frames that display your screenshots. There's some kind of structural integrity system I don't get yet that limits how big you can build them, but I've seen screenshots of sprawling underwater complexes so there must be a lot more to it.\n\nThe progression seems to be to build a base, build an analyzer to get new blueprints from the wreckage you find, and then build vehicles to let you travel further. The map is not procedurally generated but it is huge, with many different environments to explore. Alien sealife is extremely varied and serves as one of the ways to limit you, as it can be hard to tell what's hazardous, and you'll need components from the wildlife too. Parts of the ocean are also irradiated from your ship's crash, so that's another gate to overcome. Even after three hours I've only explored a tiny section of the ocean, but that's included coral tube caves, seaweed forests, an abyss filled with glowing polyps and quartz, and an actual island with some very unpleasant inhabitants.\n\nIf you can't tell from the screenshots, the game is gorgeous. Despite being an alpha, everything that's been put in the game is extremely polished, with only a few placeholders for item pickups that I've noticed so far. The flora and fauna are very well animated, though fish can get hung up on geometry pretty regularly. The sea floor is actually deformable, both through your base construction and just digging through sand, and I've found a few hidden caves that way. Movement is swift and responsive, the interface is clean, and the sound design is on point. There's not a ton to do besides build bases and submarines and explore the ocean, but there's a lot of ocean to explore, and Subnautica is built well enough to make it a very, very fun journey.","November 27, 2015","true","6.8"," 141 of 148 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","141","148","5","0"

I gathered resources and made some tools (but had to read the wiki and forum posts to get me started), then built a small underwater base just below the surface and a small submersible vehicle.\n\nMost survival games make you stare at crafting menus for hours and Subnautica is no exception - But uniquely, you can get to look at a pretty backdrop of your choice while doing so: In my base, I put my crafting station on a window overlooking a nearby coral reef and an unusually-shaped rocky outcrop.\n\nEventually I made friends with a shark-like thing in the nearby kelp forest, then accidentally ran it over in my submersible and felt bad about it afterwards - Until I lost 2 submersibles later to a larger fish while trying to explore the sunken space ship wreck and barely escaped with my life both times, taking the long swim of shame back to my base. Karma in action?\n\nWith my third submersible I started exploring a cave system when I hadn't yet got any vehicle upgrades (like the visual "sonar", which displays a transparent wireframe of the nearby terrain to help you navigate) - I ended up getting very lost, panicked a bit, then eventually died of dehydration before I could find my way out because I didn't pack enough potable water. :P\n\nSubnautica is a very immersive and beautiful looking alpha in which you can lose yourself really easily, even in its current late development state (at time of writing) - Buying into early access titles can be risky, but the devs are pretty transparent about their future plans for the game and actively update it, while it already has several hours worth of replayable content. Survive (or go creative mode with invincibility), build bases and vehicles, explore a hand-crafted alien ocean, view awesome sights, avoid hostile flora and fauna.

This game is a borderline horror game at times because of how scary the deep sea is, especially and alien one. The sense of exploration in this game is amazing, the map is huge and you never know whats around the corner. The crafting is similar to minecraft but doesnt feel like a chore. As this is an early access game there are some bugs and texture pop ins here and there but they are minor and to be expected. Something that I think is amazing of the developers and something that I use whenever possible is a button in the pause menu that takes a screen shot of the game and sends it to the developers to show them any bugs or glitches you come across, this needs to be in EVERY early access game. Overall my only issue with the game at the moment is that once yo uget everything settled and you get a feel for things the sea becomes less scary (until a reaper shows up and scares the effing crap out of you).\n\nPros:\n-good exploration\n-cool fishes\n-cool ship designs\n-beatiful graphics\n-best water physics ever\n-button in menu that lets you show the developers bugs in the game\n\nCons:\n-little to no tutorial. (I only knew what to do at the start because I watched so many lets plays of this game)\n-map kinda feels small once you start exploring more\n\nIdeas for developers:\n-more gentle giants\n-more fish, big or otherwise,\n-a map\n-multiplayer\n- more submarines, theres two in the game and I think one or two more would add more to the game\n-tameable predators, you can kinda do this with stalkers and I think it would be cool if this were expaned\n-more to do on land\n\n\nI will update this review every so often as the game is updated and I play it more. But as the game is, I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games and are looking for a game to get hooked onto.","February 22","true","79.6"," 128 of 135 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","128","135","12","0"

After the game is finished and released, I'll rewrite this review.\n\n\nI've always been a huge fan of survival sandbox games.  Just because I might like this game, doesn't mean you will.  If you like survival sandbox games, I believe you might enjoy this one.\n\nPros The game is beautiful\nIt runs pretty good on my system. On "Recommended" I get about 160fps and on "Max" I get about 40-50fps.  The game is beautiful on both settings. (My Specs)\nIt's a pretty solid game.  I've run into very few bugs and I use "Experimental" on my update settings\nThey seem to be pretty good about keeping it updated and adding new things all the time\nIf you do experimental on your update settings you can get most of the updates pretty early, before others\nThere's a decent amount to do in the game and it keeps getting better\nA huge ocean to explore. With the right gear and sub you can go pretty deep.\nUndersea BASES! How can you go wrong?\nOffers a ton of items to craft as well as mini and large subs\nIt's a unique idea for a survival game. You're not running around killing zombies.\nYou can now explore the ship you crashed in the ocean.\nAll kinds of fish and I think they keep adding more, I keep finding more that I haven't seen before.\n\nCons The game would be amazing with some sort of mulitplayer.  Doesn't have to be a ton of players, even co-op would make the game so much better.\nDoesn't seem to be many threats, at least not at first.  You have a large fish that attacks you, but he really doesn't do much damage.  At night things get a little better, but even then it's not that exciting.\nI've had a few graphical errors. Nothing major, just a little annoying at times.\nWouldn't mind having the graphic settings in game.  To change your settings, you need to exit the game, change them and reload the game.  Though in time they may offer that. I've seen other early access games start off the same way just to offer in game settings later.\nWouldn't hurt to have a bit more of a story to it.\nWould love to see some sort of objectives. A reason why you might have been in the area where you crashed.  Are you looking for something?  Looking to find a home? I don't mind scavenging and building, but that gets old after time.\n\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game.  If you love survival sandbox games, this is one to try out.  If you're just looking for a nice, solid game for a decent price that offers a ton of replayability, here you go.","May 30, 2015","true","13.1"," 124 of 133 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","124","133","11","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/264710/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhat this game is aboutThis game is a survival game at an aquatic environment, rather than survival on land. Like all survival games, the primary need is to fulfill the need of your body, which is food and water. As most of the game will be done underwater, there is a third resource : oxygen. Starting with a small life-pod, eventually you could build up small submarines, submarines with docking bay, and eventually big underwater bases with docking bays, observatories, and much more.\n\nThe game is about exploring undersea wonders on some alien planet. You could eat small fishes, like we do, but there are dangers at the sea, from the stalkers that could chase you down to the mighty Sea Emperor that could destroy or heavily damage your submarine. This game brings lots of beautiful visuals, from the sun-drenched Safe Shallows, to the dark Mushroom Forest, to the Kelp Forest with tall kelp trees, all biomes are well-made, and well differentiated with each other.\n\nThe fauna of the game is also astounding, there are Reefbacks that are akin to whales on Earth, to Stalkers that are akin to sharks, and many more. Every life form is interacting with each other, so expect the stalkers (sharks) eat fishes now and then. The fauna is astounding, especially the feeling when you met a Reefback for the first time.\n\nWhat is great about this game\nFlora and Fauna\nAs mentioned above, the flora and fauna of this game is great. Every biome has their own life form, every life form has their own habitat. This creates a feel of biodiversity, and creates a living sea that you could explore and exploit, if you will.\n\nBuilding Seabases\nI am a huge fan about building a "player base" game. The UI to build the game is really good, it's easy to snap build your seabase. You would also be informed on how strong your bases are. What is great is that building bases at huge depth will be harder, as you will need more reinforcement materials, where bases on shallow seas will allow you more windows and glass corridors for you to gaze outwards.\n\nFlooding\nI am a huge fan also of this feature. Upon taking damage, your submarine, or your base, could be flooded with seawater. The flooding system is quite realistic, as the compartments at the bottom will be flooded first, then the upper comparments. You could install bulkhead doors to stem the flooding, but to truly stop the flooding you must weld the hull breaches. At some depths the pressure is too severe that your ship could not be fixed at all.\n\nWhat could be improved in the game?\nResources should be more balanced\nAs I know, rare resources like quartz are not respawnable, this could create frustations. Fishes should also be numerous, and if able should be tied to how the player exploit the type of fishes. If the player over-fishes, they should be penalized with the lack of fish, but if the player conserves the fish, they should be rewarded.\n\nMore content\nOf course, we need more content. The seabases now, while good looking, still lacks components. We have one decorative elements : the aquarium, and one furniture element : the bench. These should be expanded, for example to include beds, laboratory equipments, desk, chair, and many more.\n\nBugs\nThere are still bugs around, most notably is that if you put your seabase on the waterline, it would look that your base is flooded (although it is not). And also some random falling down from seabase if you install glass windows.\n\nVerdict?A great game that should be bought.","August 17, 2015","true","26.0"," 110 of 115 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","110","115","7","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/264710/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAbout the game...Subnautica is a beautiful survival game set underwater on a mysterious planet.  The game is based around exploration and creation (you will need to feed yourself and craft things to aid your survival).  Being at heart a game of survival, it's survival of the fittest as always - and guess what?  You aren't the fittest...\n\nDuring a mission to colonise systems in space, your ship crashes.  In-game space ships just aren't what they used to be, so it should be no surprise to find yourself bobbing about in a tiny escape pod with absolutely nothing other than a wetsuit and a gadget embedded into the pod called a 'fabricator'.  As you have nothing to fabricate (other than lies to excuse your expensive spaceship crash), it's time to leave the escape pod and explore the great underwater world below you...\n\nI should just mention that this underwater world is NOT Earth.  There is nothing down here that has ever been televised by National Geographic, and so it is down to you to discover what's safe and what's not.  You'll be clueless about what to do, but that's part of the fun of the game: figure it all out - just as you'd have to if this were real (no 'Tour Guide' in the escape pod to help you out either).  There are curious, dopey looking, one-eyed fish just chirruping away (yes, really - begging to be caught just for doing that), there are happy purple mushrooms you can pick, and then bobbing happily towards you is a larger stripey creature, both funny and cute-looking with a snout like a cheerful sea-horse.  It's underwater Skyrim, you think to yourself as you smile, ready to pet this delightful creature with open arms, but you realise as you start to be sliced into little bits of tuna that this is no friendly pet after all.   It might be cute but it has more teeth than you, sharper teeth than you, and a razorblade tail too (I trust you don't have one of those either).   No, it's not all nice in Subnautica - not when you go deeper into the game (pun totally intended.\n\nThis must be the strangest 'survival' ever because (before you become dinner or drown) it feels almost zen-like!  Trying to survive is never supposed to be zen-like but the game cleverly lulls you into a fuzzy warm blanket of security before it bites you - and remains zen-like until you get bitten again.  It's unique with this quality.  If you DO have the misfortune and inconvenience of dying (and you will), you will become conscious again, gasping for breath in the escape pod as you read the sorry one-line tale that you died and so lost some of the stuff you'd foraged for - yes, including that precious bit of copper you know you will never find again...  But it's not frustrating and there is no starting over.  You will simply have lost some of what you were carrying at the time. As far as difficulty goes, the developers have added both an extreme perma-death option (you won't revive if killed) and the opposite pure sandbox experience which offers the freedom to build without worrying about hunger, thirst, limited resources etc.  Personally, I prefer the moderate 'survival' option where food and thirst matter, but if I die I just reappear in my rescue pod or base and can continue from where I left off.  Every gamer has been catered for.\n\n\nAbout the world of SubnauticaThe underwater world of Subnautica isn't procedurally generated and I'm actually glad of this because it is obvious that the developers have taken great care in hand-crafting every last detail of this world with a purpose in mind for each cave and crevace.  It also means that the developers could in theory add new worlds as DLC (and I hope they do).  Different areas of Subnautica offer different life-forms, and the area is pretty large to explore so it certainly hasn't become too familiar yet (I've played for over 200 hours now and there are endless places I haven't even been able to reach).  For each new game you will spawn in some random spot on the map so the location of resources will vary and the game will always feel different.  You'll need to fabricate tools both to survive and to explore further by finding metals and other resources on the sea bed, and craft equipment that will allow you to explore further and build.  This underwater world consists of several biomes of different flora and fauna.  Deeper, darker waters hold more menace, and the more vicious predators are unleashed in darkness, stepping up the survival element and the risk of exploring an unknown area.\n\n\nBuild-a-BaseSubnautica has an exceptional base-building feature.  You can build anywhere - a useful touch to set up oxygen and nourishment quarters in deep dark waters far from your original base.  The building tools are so easy to use, with pieces snapping into place naturally.  Having a base or two not only gives you much-needed recovery platforms, but also enables you to build as much storage as you like, keep aquariums full of fish for when hunger needs to be attended to, and build equipment to manufacture more building and equipment pieces.  You can also develop two submarine types depending on the resources and blueprints you uncover - and these enable you to explore much further than you can by swimming.  With the simple combination of a Sea Moth submersible and a pile of resources, I'm currently building a base deep below the crashed Aurora so that I can explore the site at leisure and have somewhere to return to when oxygen, food or hydration levels are low.  It's a superb addition to the beta, the building pieces are gorgeous (check out the store-page screenshots for an idea of how good they look) and they have added much longevity to the game because it is now possible to reach deeper, more far-flung areas of the ocean.\n\n\nFarming FrenzyOne of the latest updates offers players a way to be self-sustaining without depleting the sea of all plant and animal life!  You are now able to breed fish, hatch unknown eggs that you might find, and grow food-generating plants indoors and out.  It's all very easy and intuitive.\n\n\nAbout the Early Access state...This is no half-baked development.  The screenshots are enough to show just how beautiful the game is already, and they really don't even do the game justice.  It's easily the best diving game on Steam right now (sorry other-diving-games - you might be good too, but not Subnautica-good).  The standard version is very stable but you also have the choice to opt into the 'experimental' version which is the daily updated beta that the developers upload pretty much every day.  The experimental version will always be less stable than the fixed beta releases, but they show just how much the developers are adding to the game.  It's fun to be a part of Subnautica's evolvement, and there are now hours and hours and hours of gameplay compared to when I wrote this review originally over a year ago.  Thedevelopers treat problems as absolute priorities and work with the community - they truly represent what Early Access is all about.  They will even let you vote for new features using Trello to prioritise which things get done first.   In short, you won't be wasting your money on this particular EA project.\n\n\nIn summary...If you like the idea of exploring a strange, alien underwater world, enjoying the freedom to build a base and figuring how to survive without starving or being lunch for some strange one-eyed creature or something, then the game is already something to look at (you can even opt out of the survival element and just explore freely instead).  There is something absolutely compelling about the game: raw survival, yet therapeutic exploration coupled with the achievement of finding and crafting something new.  I highly recommend this already-epic game into which I've now sunk (yeah, see what I did there?) in excess of 200 hours!\n\n_______________\n\ntl;dr: just buy it - now.","January 8, 2015","true","293.8"," 107 of 111 people (96%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","96","107","111","18","8"

Exploration is fun, meaningful and often scary, but so far the game has a way of pushing me to explore further and deeper to get all those precious materials needed to craft and even just to survive.\n\nAlso, I may hate the ocean, but I can't deny how good it can look at times. And while the game still has optimization issues (like popping and the such) in it's current build just swiming around can look flat out beautiful.\n\nAnd let's not forget how good the vehicles feel already. From your initial Seaglide to the Cyclops all 3 vehicles currently available feel really good to use (the first time you enter your newly built Cyclops is so good) and will only motivate you to explore even further.\n\nDo I recommend it even though it's early access? Of course, even in it's current state it's well worth the price tag. And if the devs keep going the right way this game will be huge eventually. Also, if you are interested in VR the game is a prime candidate for that sort of upgrade down the road.","February 2","true","75.4"," 138 of 153 people (90%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","90","138","153","64","0"

Simply put, however, the game has INFINITE potential. Many would describe this game as underwater Minecraft, but there is much more to it than that from a design standpoint. Upon entering the game, the first noticeable thing within the game is the incredible design.\n\n\n\nWhen entering the ocean, your senses are bombarded with bright colors and haunting sound design. The ocean itself is a vast environment with multiple biomes to be explored. The depth, (pun intended) of the game is great, allowing you to learn about the formation of certain materials, through the gathering mechanics. From sand to gold, and emery to the not yet implemented Unobtanium, picking up the materials needed to craft the next structure is a treat in itself.\n\n\n\nOne thing that is truly beautiful about the game is the suspenseful sound design. Though the soundtrack itself could be described as bland, subjectively, the atmosphere that the oceanic noises provide is incredible, to say the least. Working in tandem with the said sound design is the overall LOOK of the game. Set in an alien ocean, vibrant colors can be seen left and right. A perfect example of the beautiful atmosphere the look of the game sets is the incredible sunset that occurs at the end of every day cycle. Though the game itself is already a treat to play as it is, there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\n\n\nThe game is quite obviously still in Early Access, as many of the core mechanics of the game have not yet been implemented. Visual glitches are aplenty as well as much to be wanted in terms of content. With all this in mind, Subnautica is definitely a game to look out for in the coming months of its development.","July 13, 2015","true","41.2"," 121 of 132 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","121","132","8","0"

The game has a vast environment containing biomes such as underwater forests, lava, enormous mushrooms, and even islands. Moreover,  Subnautica  consists of submersibles, such as the well-known Cyclops, and several other craftable materials, tools, and machines that enhance the player's gameplay. Not to mention, the fact that the game is enriched with diverse creatures, makes the player feel as if they were at the bottom of Mariana's trench, or just a marine biologist's wet dream if you will. As a matter of fact, the deeper you go the more creepy it gets. In the depths of this incongruous ocean, only hearing your own breath, makes the player experience the sheer terror of being deep in an exotic ocean first-hand. Thus, in all honesty, I pronounce this game one of the most immersive games I have ever played on Steam. That said, I would give thanks to Unknown Worlds anytime for developing this game.\n\n\nPros\n\n--Spectacular graphics\n--Wonderful, diverse environments\n--Extraordinary diversity and creativity in regards to the creatures\n--Great audio\n--Simple crafting system\n--Smooth controls\n--The developers, in my opinion, are promising\n\n\nCons\n\n--Items in your inventory do not stack\n--Thirst and hunger decrease rather quickly\n--No multiplayer ;(\n--Not enough customization for bases\n--There are still many bugs that may get on one's nerves\n\n**The game gets very lonely; however, for someone like me, I would not really mind.\n\n\nAll in all,  Subnautica  has true potential. Unlike games such as The Forest,  Stranded Deep, or  Minecraft, you survive  underwater. Furthermore, from what I have gathered from my gameplay,  Subnautica  is astonishing in Early Access, and I can not wait to see how it will develop henceforth into being a much greater experience for it's players.","May 23, 2015","true","47.6"," 125 of 139 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","125","139","11","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninstorm/recommended/264710/","roninstorm","Ronin Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninstorm/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI did my best to stay away from wiki's and tutorial videos before playing this for the first time just under a week ago.  I eventually capitulated around 10 hours in when I was really struggling to figure out how to get a Moonpool.  Turns out, I needed to find an appropriate tech fragment and, after that, problem solved.  Since then I've looked up about a half dozen things but tried to largely keep my experiences of the game to be drawn directly from the game.  Here's my take:\n\nThe game is excellent, at least for the first few hours, at leaving you wondering what everything is and what it does while still allowing you freedom to poke and prod at your immediate environment without dying.  Sure, the first dangerous critters are pretty obviously dangerous from afar and make a distinct roar before charging you, and aren't death-or-glory killbots so you can run away or scare them off.  This makes for an environment you can experiment with, even in Survival mode where you need to manage food and water as well as health and oxygen.\n\nThe ocean looks and feels great.  Motion washes in a way that feels pretty good, like you're in water (which, of course, you are).  Basic resources aren't too hard to come by.  Indeed, the biggest early restriction is oxygen, but you don't dive too deep for too long at the start and can always just come straight back to the surface.\n\nThere's a marker to show the direction to your escape pod on your HUD when you're roughly facing the right direction (and haven't gone a very long way from it).  Makes it possible to get home even when you're still trying to figure out what to eat and what might kill you.\n\nRadiation, from the crashed ship I believe, keeps you boxed in on one side and away from some really nasty predators that would literally eat you in one.  You'll deal with that later.  For the start, the radiation hurts and provides a soft "wall" to encourage you back to places more suitable for your (lack of) experience.\n\nAs you find more things, your fabricator -- the device on the escape pod you use to convert resources into useful equipment, cooked food, etc -- gives you more options.  This is good in that you don't start swamped with options, a bunch of which aren't useful to you yet, but it's also unhelpful in a game otherwise lacking a tutorial (at this stage).  Means that you might know something exists (for example, the Moonpool) but not see the option to build it anywhere.  That's fine in that one of this game's strengths is exploration and discovery, but also confusing.  Perhaps an option to show unavailable construction options might help?  In any case, while the game is Early Access, the wiki and an occasional youtube video should get you through the rough spots where you're missing the prerequisite item that reveals the appropriate construction option.\n\nI deliberately waited a long while to make sure that this game was both receiving regular updates and was in a stable, playable state.  I'm pleased to report that the game seems very stable after 20+ hours of play.  There's a few performance drops now and then, though rarely for more than a couple of seconds, even on a very high power computer (i7, 2x 970's, 16GB RAM, SSD), and I notice some report more regular performance issues but I've not really seen them.  Optimisation is usually a late stage process in development so I'm not worried.  Thus far, no crashes or serious glitches whatsoever for me.\n\nThe ocean is surprisingly large and your ability to explore is somewhat capped by what equipment you've built so far.  I find you have to push to the edges of your exploration capability to find the new resources you need to make getting there easier in future.  Often you're looking for a new tech fragment, or a resource that only appears in a particular area, or below a particular depth.  But by shifting areas or depths you come across more dangerous environments, not least of which is that you need somewhere to retreat to in order to refill your oxygen (and empty your inventory of resources you've collected).  By inference, I believe I've seen less than half of what there is to see, perhaps only a third, though admittedly I'm cautious so I tend to take fewer risks than I could.  My deepest dive has been around 550 metres, with my deepest base at around 450 metres.  I believe one can get a lot deeper than that...\n\nSo, to sum up, or tl;dr ...\n\nAn excellent underwater exploration game that manages to be somewhat gentle in the beginning, while offering more for more risk (or just more guts, I guess).  Stable, looks good, still a few bugs here and there (easily reported from within the game), but very playable and worth your time to investigate.  Developer is active and open.  I eagerly look forward to future updates.  Think I'll be back to playing next, actually... :)","September 24, 2015","true","26.2"," 78 of 79 people (99%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","99","78","79","9","8"

It is incredibly polished for a game in early access, the graphics are great, and the atmosphere is a solid 10/10. You get a real sense of scale, some monsters that may be implemented would be 10, 20 times your size. And the audio in this game. Just wow.\n\nIf you want to experience this game fully, you definitely would have to have a good pair of headphones, as there is alot to hear, from the roaring of the Reaper Leviathan, (It's scary as it sounds!) to the quiet ping of the Cyclops as you explore the depths of this alien planet.\n\nThis game can get pretty spooky, as it gets very dark at night, and basically everything is out to kill you. There is even a fish that will swim towards you and explode. Sometimes, it can get prety tense having to swim up from the floor some 60 metres down to the surface with a limited supply of oxygen, though you can craft al osrts of things to assist you in your diving. The map, though, is not randomly generated, but is made by the devs as they produce the game, and the map is large enough so that you feel you are in quite a large ocean planet.\n\nTo sum upp, Subnautica is a great game, though at the current point in time, is somewhat lacking in content, and I dont feel a reason to come back to it when I leave to go do something else. One thing that would make the game far better as well would be a multiplayer, co-op gamemode so that friends can join you and you can stuff around and do all sorts of things together.\n\nGrahpics 8/10\nAudio 10/10\nGameplay 7/10\n\nThank you for reading my review.","August 1, 2015","true","21.1"," 75 of 79 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","75","79","7","1"

See, I actually know what I'm talking about, you doubting lot! But anyway, I digress...\n\nSubnautica has some serious issues and bugs, but frankly, with the almost CLOCKWORK release of updates, bug splats and general patches, this isn't so much a problem as a nuisance at worst, and an interesting (if troublesome) trip at best. One of the most glaring bugs I've found recently was a strange inability to open Bulkhead Doors... however, this was made even MORE strange by the fact that it only affected some doors, even within the same base!\n\nAside from that, the game is (in lack of a more profound and impactful word) absolutely mind-implodingly mega-gorgeous. I shït you not when I say that it's one of the most incredibly beautiful games I have ever played. Rarely do graphics justify a game's existence, however (unless it was developed by the dullards at Crytek that is), but Subnautica does several other things so bloody right, it not only earns its right to be, but does a jolly li'l victory dance to celebrate its existence, too.\n\nExploration, for example, is harrowing and dangerous, but also incredibly immersive (no pun intended) and HIGHLY rewarding, as you can only gain access to new technology by finding tech fragments in new and unexplored biomes. Beyond that, you'll also need to explore to gain access to advanced resources and interesting new databank entries, which as a huge fan of Metroid Prime, I can REALLY get behind with a lubed-up dïldo in one hand and my turgid cöck in the other!\n\nFurthermore, the sound is lovely, with effects being realistically muffled by water, and the creaking of a buckling hull giving an eerie sense of "Oh shït, oh shït, oh shït!" as you run down a corridor within your deep-sea base, frantically searching for the leaks in your base's hull so that you can weld 'em shut.\n\nWhat the game does lack, however, is a sense of direction or "meaning", in lack of a better word. Unlike the aforementioned The Forest, you don't have a tangible goal (yet) in Subnautica, beyond the very basic "survive" one, and also unlike the aforementioned Space Engineers, you don't have as much in terms of tools or freedom either. So setting up a functioning and (possibly even moreso difficult) aesthetically appealing base may be an alluring if albeit daunting task at first, but once that's done, you kind of lack the creative freedom that many other survival-based sandbox games may offer.\n\nBut aside from my various minor complaints, I should mention that I bought this game for the full price and I haven't regretted that purchase for even a single second, so with that in mind, I can't give this game anything but a hearty recommendation. 8.4/10","May 8","true","113.6"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","70","75","16","7"

It almost seems unfair to put it in that category, because even if that is what it boils down to, it's so much more fun than all of those games.\n\nIf you remember when Minecraft first came out and people were just blown away by all that you could do, that's this game all over. As I write this review the only thing even close to an objective besides "survive" is to seal up the holes on the crashed spaceship to stop it from leaking radiation.\n\nSo you're thrown into an unfamiliar environment with lots of hostile wildlife, sounds familiar, doesn't it? Except every creature is imaginative and beautiful to watch (when it's not bearing down on you) and share only vague similarities with actual wildlife. The environment feels like an alien world, as beautiful as it is harsh, and everything that isn't sand can be melted down into something useful to you. Collecting things is generally easy, except when it comes to rarer metals, but with proper planning you can stock up on everything you need or want.\n\nThe most satisfying aspect is what you can do with all those materials. Build a gravity gun, a knife that cooks fish when you cut them with it, a time stasis gun and an electric razor that builds YOUR UNDERWATER BASE. In said base you can dock your minisub to recharge it, store all your crafting mats, build an aquarium or five (which you are free to use as fresh food without getting into trouble). Careful you don't overextend your base, since the pressure can crack the hull and flood sections. Of course you can always lock those sections off with bulkheads until you can fix them. Or you can take your minisub and dock it inside your MEGASUB, in which you can build all the same storage and crafting systems to make a mobile base of operations as you search for new areas to find new materials in.\n\nBy far the best positive of this game though is how much the devs are working on it. In the few months I've owned it it's updated several times. Most early access games update every now and then, and those updates slowly add in new content and bugfixes.\n\nNot Subnautica. Subnautica updates fairly regularly and each time it's a game changer. A new device, a new biome or a new building available. When I started playing this, you couldn't board the crashed space ship, you couldn't dock your sub with your base, there were no bulkheads, no gravity guns, no upgrades for your equipment and only the very basic elements of a base. Everytime this game updates its reason to celebrate and heralds a new set of stuff to try and build. I almost dread the idea of there ever being a full release, since that would mean slower updates and less to look forward to. At the moment this is the game that keeps on giving and those of you who haven't played yet have got several hours of discovery ahead of you already.\n\nThe devs have expressed a desire to not focus on weaponry in this game, instead going for a peaceful coexistence with the planet as opposed to aggression against it's inhabitants. Yet they expect you to catch smaller fish to survive and most things that you can't eat are hostile to you. This is honestly the only thing I find disagreeable about the game's direction so far. Preserving wildlife is one thing, but if said wildlife is bearing down on you with extremely large teeth and intent to make a meal of you, I think using deadly force is justified. The knife and gravity gun are your only real offensive options (though I've heard of people ramming fish with their sub and simply patching up the hull afterwards). Propelling an angry fish a few hundred feet away is funny, but it doesn't really help when that fish swims back into the area you're searching for valuable materials and takes a chunk out of your backside while youre not looking.\n\nHopefully they include a bit more weapons soon. I'm not asking for Ratchet & Clank levels of armament here, but a harpoon gun wouldn't go amiss.\n\nHeck I'd be fine with crafting the harpoons to be honest.","September 1, 2015","true","207.1"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","65","68","8","0"

Sure the item list isnt 200 pages long, but the ones that ARE in, including some vehicles are very neat and if what is here is any indication of what's to come this thing will be spectacular.\n\nEven at this early stage, there are several "modes" to suit your mood (full on survival with hunger/thirst/etc, no hunger/thirst, etc).\n\nI own and have played a bunch of this kind of open exploration/craft/survival game and this is hands down already my favorite, even after playing hundreds of hours in many other games. After this, they all look so stiff, and are all basically a zombie clone.\n\nAlso, this is one of the few games, and the ONLY early access game I've ever gifted to someone else and thats after playing it for just 2 hours.\n\nIf you are listening Devs;  You guys are on the right track, keep this up and you will have a truly stellar hit with this thing.\n","July 2, 2015","true","102.4"," 62 of 64 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","62","64","4","0"

Basically, after you get upgrades for your cyclops and seamoth, and build a substantial base, you have no other goal rather than to explore.\n-Also, there is a bit of a grind for some of the items you need to get the upgrades. Basically, you explore, find a new fragment, see what you need, then go get it. The main part of this process is the exploration, like I said earlier.\n-Survival seemed like it was rushed, without any emphasis on dehydration or hunger. Basically, you need to eat every so often, and drink slightly more often\nNow for the pros.\n+Gorgeous environments\n+A very refined and easy to understand tech path. You start in the safe areas, learning the oxygen system and how to acquire food and resources. Then, it gently nudges you to explore more for more resources, like silver. This leads into the slightly dangerous area, which easy to notice enemies that make loud noises when they attack for easy identification. This is also where you get your first sort of defense. Once you acquire the resources from this area you have the items to create the first sub, which allows you to explore more, and so on\n+Amazing updates. Seamoth update brought to the table something I thought was amazing.  Instead of the basic upgrades things normally have, these were completely innovative and cool ideas. The sonar is possibly the coolest upgrade in any game I've ever seen. Also the nonlethal torpedoes are interesting and useful in their own right\n+THE DEVS TAKE PEOPLES VIEWS ON THE GAME SERIOUSLY. We said that it would be cool to explore the main ship, and they gave us the update.\n+Really easy to build and cool bases.\n+AMAZINGLY COOL ANIMATIONS. The seamoth docking animation for the moonpool and cyclops are beautiful. Also the bulkhead opening animation is great.\n+EXPLORATION IS EXTREMELY FUN. When they released the idea for the lost river, I didn't think "what loot would there be", I thought "how amazing would this be to look at from a seamoth." Exploration is the main point of this game, so it is expected to be good. How this game does it is phenomenal. It drives you to explore without the promise of items or loot, but with the idea of how cool things would be. You wonder what would be passed that kelp forest, so you go through and you see the great multitudes of flora and fauna that just make you want to see what else you can find.\n+JELLYSHROOM CAVES!!!!!!! All the cave exploration is ridiculously cool. You get to see what lurks in the dark trenches of the ocean of an alien planet. You get to see all the cool formations, and beautiful flora. Also, jelly shrooms.\n+Reefbacks are adorbs. ALL THE ANIMALS ARE UNIQUE AND INTERESTING. Sandsharks hide in the sand, stalkers look for scrap and can be friendly, bonesharks are freaking scary, and Reaper Leviathans are ridiculously scary\nThe pros outweigh the cons, definitely, for someone who enjoys exploring","October 5, 2015","true","23.5"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","68","73","11","0"

A game where you can't carry over 44,000 tons of mass, a game where you have to decide what to pick up rather than scoop up everything that looks shiny. Sleek graphics and usually sleek animations with it. Fun submersibles, excellent detail of various separated underwater biomes.\n\nBut Jesus Christ I've never played a horror game more terrifying than looking out over a vast expanse of seemingly empty water and seeing a submarine-sized death snake lunging its roaring jaws at me and latching onto my pitiful little sea moth. You know what? I've never played a horror game more terrifying than looking out over a vast expanse of seemingly empty water and simply WONDERING if I'll see anything at all. Or swimming through a field of red grass and having my whole house suddenly rumble from the bellowing groans of some unseen beast. I'd spend half an hour just trying to build up courage to explore the next biome, for fear I'd encounter some sort of massive Lovecraftian horror. You can never tell if a beautifully detailed environment will hold a bunch of harmless tiny fish or if there's a gigantic behemoth waiting to swallow you whole. Or a bunch of tiny fish ready to snap at you, and a gigantic behemoth that ends up being passive and friendly.\n\nIf you don't know what the biomes are and where they are... and if you don't know just what sorts of behemoths await you in this game... you might end up like me and spend several hours just looking at the edge of the initial reef, towards some big seaweed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself over the idea of swimming just a couple feet into it. And sometimes you'll be right to do so.

He told me that this is an early access game and let me create a new game. We were supposed to spend weekend with together, I spend my weekend with his computer, gradually ruining our friendship.\n\nThen I returned home and immediately bought this game. I've consumed all there is to it for now and I'm genuinely scared about what will happen when it's released (and for the devs: I'm hoping for a few Cthulhu easter eggs when it's released).\n\nSerious review now:\n\nThe game has it's flaws but for an early access they are very understandable. They've nailed the atmosphere (not sure about the music selection though), nailed the main dynamics of the game and completely nailed the "Transparent Development" thing. I don't know whether developers will turn this into what they've promised but I'm already happy with the ratio of the amount I've payed and the time I've enjoyed playing it.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple: you're stranded on an alien oceanplanet, a water world if you will, and all you have is your crashed lifepod with limited amount of energy. You collect stuff from the ocean - fish for eating, metals and minerals for crafting - to build a sustainable life under the sea and try to find out what made your ship crash. I'm not fond of "collect, craft and survive" type of games but this one COMPLETELY NAILED the underwater life. I mean you genuinely want to discover your surroundings with a great example of typical human curiousity. The creatures, biomes, habitates everything reminds you of where you are; a never-seen planet that contains countless mysteries (for now they are pretty much countable though).\n\nLastly, the dev team. They are REALLY into this game and their community. They listen to what players say and show how they're doing through several tools - Trello for checking what they're doing, what they've completed and what they're planning to do, commit log (or changelog for non developers) that shows all the code or asset commits and an active discussion board. But there is one thing that is WAY more useful than those tools: build-in bug report system. It is awesome, it is simple, it is non distrupting whatsoever. You just press F8 while playing the game, type your comment or bug report and then you submit it. Simple as that.\n\nI don't usually trust early access games and I don't usually support them. But this one is amazing as the way it is already and I honestly want them to be successful as fudge.","April 10, 2015","true","12.8"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","92","58","63","17","0"

The fact that it's in the pause menu makes bug reporting SO MUCH EASIER because you can report a bug the second it happens without going onto some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ forum that no one reads.\n\nAdditionally, this game is really pretty but in an art style type of way. The unique creature designs and genius inclusion of bioluminescence makes everything pop.\n\nWell done, devs.\n\nEdit: I highly recommend opting into the experimental build of the game in order to even more closely follow the devs' development process and participate actively even better.

The game pits you, the lone survivor of a spacecraft crash on an entirely oceanic planet to try and survive against all odds. I will say now - for maximum enjoyment, do NOT look up or research the game's intricacies. Yes, I know most people - including myself - will often watch videos or vigorously devour a wiki's contents for information before purchase, but I can say with confidence that I avoided doing so with this title, and was pleasantly pleased (and continue to be). Learning what is what is a great part of Subnautica, and it feels...right, in a way.\n\nI can also recommend that if you have a fear of the ocean depths, and wish to overcome it somewhat, that this can help - it's rather therapeutic. As well as surviving the depths, this game features food and water (toggleable in game modes), base building, vehicle piloting and creation and voxel terraforming.\n\nSubnautica is yet another great title from Unknown Worlds, and I hope you give it a try.","May 31, 2015","true","40.6"," 41 of 41 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","41","41","4","0"

If I was pressed to come up with another term, I would have to go with pants-sh*ttingly terrifying.  See that extremely useful pile of scrap metal at the mouth of that cave?  Don't you dare try to pick it up  unless you would like to permanently modify the scent of your computer chair.\n\nAnd you better believe I'm going to keep playing it.\n\nThe game is fun, nice to look at, and much more unique than the other survival games that are currently bloating the shop.  With the ability to construct your own bases and ships, survival is just the surface of the gameplay.  Rarely do we get to experience a game that builds such a desire to explore.  Just when you thought you've seen all the creatures this alien sea has to offer, you stumble across a cave full of entrancing pink jellyfish, or a monstrous horse-shoe-crab-whale.\n\nWith the recent addition of underwater bases, a little bit of my faith in early access games has been restored.  As steam citizens, we are far too used to dissapointment while watching games develop (or... not develop?... starbound?), and this team shows promise.  If you need a new game to put your faith in, try Subnautica.\n\nRating\nVisual:\n8.5/10\nAlthough the textures could use some polishing, I absolutely love the overall appearance of the game and can not wait to see more areas and creatures added.\n\nAudio:\n7/10\nThe music does a great job of providing a sense of loneliness and inensity when necessary, but the transitions should be smoothed an dperhaps modified so the "intense" moments become less frequent, increasing the effectiveness.\n\nStory:\n-/10\nThere is a brief cutscene at the beginning regarding your ship crashing to the planet and you being the only survivor.  Hopefully, the developers can come up with something a little bit more elaborate and original.  That story seems like a placeholder, and as such, I will wait to post a score.\n\n","March 19, 2015","true","4.1"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","91","49","54","18","0"

But not in its current state, I rarely truly say to anyone they should get a game when its in early access because most people complain about bugs or the game being unfinished.\n\nHowever if you would like to join an amazing game company for an amazing journey whilst they create this game then I say WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\n\nI played each of their prototypes for this game and have been following it since they first posted about it a while back now. It looks amazing for an early access game and they are continously developing new things with regular (almost twice daily it seems) updates to their experimental version (although not particularly large amounts of content added), eventually I believe there is meant to be a variety of submarines with interesting hull breach ideas hinted at and equally some customization involved with them, I believe as for the gameplay the species will be continously added upon until you are immersed in a living and breathing underwater otherworldly ecosystem, but for now you are given a handful or interesting and nice species instead, as for what to do with these species I believe they are adding scientific tools for DNA sampling etc after all you were on your way to make the planet habitable.\n\nThere is also a simple and friendly feedback reporting system in game so you can highlight bugs and glitches quickly which helps them sort them quicker\n\nEqually to remain on top of their development they are extremely open and post everyting on their Trello: https://trello.com/b/yxoJrFgP/subnautica\nAnd also on this site for more specifics as to what was added/changed last : http://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/checkins\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","32.1"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","59","70","0","0"

Check back every few months for a little tidbit extra.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yes.\n\nI wont tell you about the amazing visuals, sound, and loads of new content being rolled out by the responsive devs, Ill leave all the good points to the other 94% of writings on this game. Instead ill tell you why the 6% of negative reviews arent representative.\n\nIve read through about half of the complaints and the primary complaints are lack of content, and some lag.\n\nPeople: The devs themselves currently claim there is only about 2 hours of content. This is well known. This is no secret. If you come and buy a game whos makers are TELLING you this, and then complain of (Current) lack of content, you shouldnt downvote the game, you should downvote youir own lack of research. And besides, theyre working really hard to fix that already and are doing a great job of it with regular community updates.\n\nAnd yes, as you also may of noticed the game looks AMAZING. While there are video settings, some computers simply cant handle the beta-optimization of this game. The devs already fixed many lag issues, instant memory crashes, ect. but its not perfect. You will need a modern/decent computer to run this, but not state of the art.\n\nNote: many older performance-related reviews are now irrelevant. Take them with a grain of salt.\n\nHowever, once again people, there is a minimum system requirement DIRECTLY underneath the "About Game" section of this page for god sakes. Read it. Once again, many who bought the game and did not like it, did'nt glance at the current needs of the game, and therfore should blame themselves for poor foresight, and not the devs for poor game design.\n\nAnd they're working on further improving performance.\n\n\nAnd to top it all off, there are almost no game breaking bugs, just small nuanced visual glitches like hollow objects, fish stuck in odd rocks, ect. Very minor and easily ignored. No inventory wipes, no spawn glitches, no stat swings, or sudden drops in thirst or hunger, and the game will even try and warn you when a crash is about to happen, giving you precious time to save and restart to continue where you left off.\n\nSo please, for gods sake, remember that every issue with this game is simply out of the devs control at the moment. Early access games are sometimes laggy, buggy, and with lower content than the finished versions. The fact that games spend time in this early stage is no ones fault. Just be sure you know what your buying when you buy it.\n\nBUY THIS GAME.\n\n[End of Game Review]\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor those posting to the tune of "Dont give this game a negative review if you want it to fly"  ect. When I wrote this review, I thought the way I could make the biggest impact is by writing directly to the wary buyers who might be looking at old, outdated, or non-game related complaints as justification not to support this game. And where better to write to them than here in the negative reviews?\n\nFor those singing to the the other tune of "Dont skew the stats" ect. Doing simple math:\n\nAs of 8/15/2015, there are 4,509 total reviews for Subnautica.\n\nThis means that 1% of that is 45.09.(The equation is 4,509 x .01 = 45.09)\n\nThis means that AT LEAST 45 reviews would be needed to change the visible stats at all. So seeing as this review is 1/45th (0.02222) of what we would need to change anything for the devs, lay off. The added bonus of being seen far more often by the people who actually need to see it (Catious buyers) far outstrips the harm being done to this amazing game.\n\n\n\n\nAnd to make this abundantly clear: THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A NEGATIVE REVIEW.\n\nFurther Edit:\n\nThe date is now 11/18/15, and many many changes have come to subnautica since I origninally drafted this snarky attack on ignorant steam shoppers.\n\nWhile many of my comments ideas still stand, Subnautica no longer has only 2 hours of playable content. While I estimate first time runthrough at about 15 hours if you take your time, I dont know the official opinion on game depth. Ill leave it to you to read up on exactly what theyve pumped out this month, but I can garentee you will get your money back in playable value. (Seamoth update is hype)\n\nFurther optimization, and the game crashes even less now... ECT ECT.\n\nThe game is still going strong in every regard.\n\n10/10, would leave negative review again.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n3/23/2016\n\nIn the name of fair play, I will have to now throw a warning to the wind. For some, my assesment of graphical stability is now overly optimistic. Ocassional drops in FPS do occur.\n\nThe recent geeneral visual upgrades means the game performance was somewhat impacted. While its nowhere near gamebreaking, some people may have more trouble on minimum graphics than others. It should be noted that this happened as a result of a MASSIVE shader and water texture overhaul, so its to be expected. This is by no means a case of Dev neglect.\n\nCareful review of minimum system requirements and common sense should avoid any major issues. Game is totally playable.\n\nDevs are working on a fix ASAP! All my other comments stand 100% to this day.\n\nEDIT 5/19/2016:\n\nI am happy to say all performance realted issues are solved despite all the graphics improving in texture, vibrancy, and depth.\n\nNew balanging changes and model updates, MORE CONTENT!","August 8, 2015","false","90.5"," 2,269 of 3,523 people (64%) found this review helpful 1,208 people found this review funny","64","269","3","208","100"

Something about not being able to see what’s beneath you when you are in the deep dark areas. Or seeing a faint, glowing light  in the deep dark abyss. Or being alone on an underwater planet where any creature of any size could grab you at any second. OR The deep distinct hum of the massive Reefbacks you can hear while in the deeper parts of the ocean. It’s the feel of isolation, exploration, and survival that brings this game together.\n\nSubnautica is an underwater exploration/survival game. It's a game where you can build advanced technologies to survive on an uncharted planet that is completely covered in ocean with a variety of flora and fauna that is native to the planet. The game starts as your huge ship called the “Aurora” explodes and is sent crashing down to the surface of a planet. You manage to survive in an escape pod only to find  yourself on planet 4546B. A waterworld, where the entire planet is covered with an ocean. From there you can explore the ocean,build a variety of submersibles, build sea bases, and discover and record the flora and fauna of the planet.\n\nThe devs seem to put a lot of love and effort into their game by constantly giving us great updates to improve the game. One thing I love about the game is you can take pictures in game and put it as a picture frame on a wall in your sea base, I don’t know I just really thought that was neat.\n\n\nIf you love the ocean and its strange creatures, or if you love exploring  and building sea bases then this game is for you. I always wanted an underwater game where you can explore and see its wildlife face to face. I felt like someone had to make a game that you can do this and Subnautica fills that need for me :D\n","March 8","true","80.3"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","40","42","7","0"

The last time I enjoyed a submarine experience that I loved was back when I played Aquanox 1 and 2. To put in perspective from the feelings I get from this:\n\nImagine the fictional documentary from 2005 called "Alien Planet". The documentary was somewhat dramatic in discussing future exploration of planets with life on them. Now take this, and merge that concept with a open world survival game. But hold on, we are not finished: NOW, merge Finding Nemo with it and you have yourself a beautifully crafted experience.\n\nTo sum it up, it is all about diving and surviving off the ocean when you are forced to jump in a life pod while your space ship goes asunder in orbit; where you find yourself on an oceanic world. Even though it may seem like just some typical survival game, it is not. Did I mention open ocean exploration? You have to gather raw materials and craft things; to which you can use to expand your survivability.\n\nOn the other point of this game, it is just beautiful. The Algorithms employed randomly generate a very beautiful ocean, with several biomes and many places to explore. The sea life such as schools of fish will glint in the distance and giant but harmless hardback creatures will slowly wander. There are all kinds of unknown life forms that you must take extra caution in avoiding until you know they are safe.\n\nThe geography of the ocean floor biomes is also well done thus far. Coral reef biome will have lots of mushrooms, tubes, flora and other formations. Then you go into the deeper sea and you find small fissures, volcanoes, towering sea creep; as well as much more depending on the biome. All in all this artistic delight is as fun to play as it is to look at and hear; the developers clearly have be putting attention to the detail of immersion in this one, while making the experience wholesome.\n\nThis review is being done in early alpha phase; and considering its very early status right now, I assume that this game will evolve into a jewel that the gaming industry has been waiting for.\n\n10/10 - I have never felt so immersed before.","June 3, 2015","true","43.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","37","38","2","0"

I RARELY write reviews for games on Steam.  Infact I believe this is my first one.  However... I cannot keep playing this amazing game without spreading the word on how AMAZING it is!  BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!\n\nDoes it have issues?  Well yeah, it IS Early Access!  However the dedicated developers work tirelessly to ensure that any bugs/suggestions are met with diligence, and their hard work has produced a game that is... quite frankly... my favorite survival game of all time!\n\nFirst the Cons:\n1. Bugs are still out there!  Little problems WILL pop up in your game, no question.  I still run into them on a regular basis.  I will say however, they are almost NEVER game-breaking.\n2. THIS IS NOT A SEARCH AND DESTROY GAME!  This is a survival/exploration game, so if your looking for awsome scifi-weaponry, go buy Halo.  This is a game that forces you to adapt to your environment for your survival, hunting small fish and growing crops while avoiding the predators.\n3. Patience is required!  You must be willing to spend many hours looking for materials for your creations.  if you want a fast paced arcade style game, this isn't for you.\n4.  JUMPSCARES!  AND LOTS OF THEM!  There are some awsome looking creatures in this game, and most of them want to kill you.  Life outside your submarine/base ain't easy living!\n5. If you have a fear of the ocean (many people do, I get it) don't buy this game.  it recreates the feel of the ocean so well, it could cause problems for a phobia.\n\nNow for the pros!  Buckle up, because this is a LONG list!\n1. These creators have some incredible imaginations!  The creatures in this game are beautiful, and all of them behave in unique and natural ways.  From the cute little Peepers to the enormus Reefbacks, and from sleek and deadly Stalkers to the HOLYCRAPTHATMONSTERISEATINGMYSUB Reaper Leviathan... the whole world is ready to be explored!\n2. The boimes... holy crap the BIOMES!!!  You can't take it all in in one session.  You will spend HOURS exploring your world and not even scratch the surface of its beauty.  Forests of kelp towering like buildings, expanses of bright red grass lining canyon-like formations stretching for what seems like miles, bright glowing forests of mushrooms teeming with bio-luminecent creatures... and thats just a couple examples!  There are nearly a DOZEN of these places, all ready to be discovered!\n3. This game is most definately an exploration game... but it ain't dull!  Literally EVERY biome has something that can kill you!  You are always checking your suroundings for enemies while you gather precious resources to feed your growing undersea empire!  Some you can fight..... some you cannot......\n4. While you don't posses any deadly weaponry, the technology you DO possess is all you could ever need.  This game taught me you don't have to slaughter everything in sight to survive in a game like this.  Instead, you can create defensive systems that drive away dangerous predators, and can actually learn to live WITH them!  I have a base inside a Kelp forest teaming with Stalkers, and I've learned how to co-exist with them without bloodshed.

The wreckage of your ship, the Aurora, is an adventure in itself.  The reactor cores inside must be repaired, or radiation will flood your home miles away.

The choice is yours.\nBut be warned... there are dangerous creatures lurking near the ship.....\n7. The price.

Its kept me enthralled since the moment I first logged into it a couple of days ago.  The scenery is gorgeous.  I mean seriously.  Whoever is doing the artwork has obviously done his homework and then some.  Subnautica is a game that focusses on crafting, building and exploring.  It does these things well=even in early access.  When you finally build your first Sea Moth you will be psyched!  Multiply that feeling X10 when you eventually build your cyclops and can actually dock your Sea Moth INSIDE it.  Then you can build a fabrication machine and storage lockers inside your cyclops to use the cyclops as a mobile base.  Of course by that time you will have a stationary undersea base as well, and the size and configuration of that is limited only by your imagination.  After 20hrs of game play, there are only a couple of things that I havent created yet(like a thermoelectric plant) but I just found a HUGE undersea cave filled with luminescent plants and creatures to explore.  That and the crashed space ship is supposed to be explorable once you have an "anti-radiation" outfit.  Maybe its just because I wanted to be a scuba diver when I was a kid but I am mesmerized by this game.  I will be looking foward to updates and added content in a way that I have never done for a game before.  My only complaint about this game is that I just lost the last 5hrs of game play when the game crashed.  It was the only time the game has crashed on me so far.

The best description I can think of is: Don't Starve meets Finding Nemo with the humans from Wall-E tossed in.  The graphics are gorgeous, the sound design top quality, and both remain consistent to present a cohesive experience.\n\nGameplay:\n\nPrimarily this game is engineered as a "Survival Sim" and contains the usual mechanics that entails (hunger, thirst, monsters to hurt you, resource gathering and management, crafting and base building) - note:  It does have a non-survival mode which does not include hunger & thirst.  What sets it apart from (most) other survival sims is the strong setting.  Base building and vehicles are a particularly strong aspect (especially when they are under siege.. having power suddenly go out while desperately trying to weld holes in a wall shut while it fills up with water is an intense experience).  The ocean setting provides many opportunities for the game to deliver a very solid "building" experience while at the same time keeping you on your toes (there ARE things lurking in the deep dark!)\n\nThat said, this game is obviously currently in early access.  The story is significantly incomplete and chunks of the world are still missing.  There are also a number of mechanics and items that are obvious placeholders for future buildout.\n\nBugs:\n\nI can only speak for my particular setup (an aging Intel i7 930, AMD Radeon HD 6900 video card, 16 gigs of RAM).  While I encountered no crashes I did encounter mild stuttering in heavily fish-populated areas.  Gameplay wise I did encounter several bugs and annoyances.  However most of them were of a "new mechanic recently implemented" nature rather than a "broken" nature (such as the submarine getting beached upon spawn in).\n\nEarly Access Dev Interaction:\n\nThe developers are active and accessible via a number of outlets including the Steam Forums.  Additionally they are very active on Trello which is consistently updated and accurate.  Updates seem fairly frequent - about once a month, sometimes slightly more.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIn my opinion this game is early access done right.  If you've any interest in survival/crafting games and have the patience to watch a game grow, you absolutely owe it to yourself to take a long hard look at this game.","August 23, 2015","true","19.3"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","31","32","2","2"

There are a few actions you'll find yourself struggling with due to wonkiness, like having to grab creepvine seeds from below where they actually appear, or needing to aim at just the right spot to get fragments to scan.  Resource scarcity will become your biggeat problem early on - nothing respawns, so as you scavenge for metals/minerals and food, they get used up for good.

I enjoyed it at first, but like many Early Access it just didnt have enough to hold me for very long. So on this one I just went away for awhile. I was not really into testing it, but I just ' knew ' it would progress. It has. I am now finding it to be really enjoyable, and it will hold your attention with plenty to do. It is not complete, but it sure is worth having in my mind.\n\nIt is a ' sorta of survival ' game. I say that because of the real flexibility in how you want to play it. Just choose the one you like.\n1. Sandbox. Build, explore, no limits.\n2. Easy. You need to explore and have resources, but no worry over O2, food or water. No perma death.\n3. Survival ( Normal ) You need everything, food, resources, water and O2.. however if you die.. you lose no progress. No reset to last save. You are penalized by losing random items and amounts from your inventory. Reset at your closest base. ( thats your current carried inventory, stored / base items are safe )\n4. Hardcore. One life, one death.\n\nNormally in survival games I am all Hardcore. This one is different. Most survival games you tend to die early.. and they dont really involve the detail here does. As in research, building etc.  Subnautica is different. You dont really face any dangers early but yourself. If you think its a good idea to dive to the depths with no gear for it.. and  you get eaten or die from depth issues.. thats you..\n\nTo really be able to get to the good stuff you need to really be able to build, survive and not be tied to one / two bases.. you need to progress to higher techs / tools. It takes time. So even I cringe at investing hours and hours of caution, exploration and research to build up a good base camp.. only to die and lose it.. ( yeah.. IKR ?? Mr it aint survival if you cant die!! lol. ) But being penalized by loss of items, or equipment seems fair to me. If I die I dont lose my hours to build base.. but I might be naked of some cool stuff. Ok.. I can cope. Thus I dont even really consider it survival.  It's sort of survival.\n\nI DO consider it a good game.. and from where its at now.. it will only get better.\n\nIf your curious.. get it. You wont be dissapointed.\n\nIt is EA still tho'.. so it ' aint perfect ' But its waaay better than a lot of finished games. But isnt that more and more a case?\n","May 12","true","64.6"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","29","29","0","1"

Then I saw FRANKIEonPCin1080p give it a go. So I decided to buy it to try it for myself, and I was pleasently surprised. This game is amazing, a couple of flaws but the postives outweigh the negatives. The deal is simple, your ship, The Aurora, a terra forming vessel, is hist by a "Mysterious energy pulse" Sending you crashing down in an alien sea where you must survive.\n\nI'll start with negatives, and get them out the way. First off, there isn't much to do at the moment. You can build a base, which is quite easy as I was given the tool to do that in my life pod (I'm not sure if everyone gets the builder tool in their pod, but I did) So Building a base was the first thing I did. After that I built the tier 1 submarine, and whizzed around for a while collecting food and resources, and that's all I've done, and all you really can do (From my experience so far). The next negative is not really a problem, but it can get annoying at times. Frames can drop, to the point of being a 6th grade powerpoint presentation. Apart from the, that's where the negatives die off.\n\nNow for the positives. The graphics are interesting, in the sense of the art style. The various fish look so good, giving you the real sense of being stranded on an alien planet. The water is some of the best I've seen. And the look of the various plants is stunning, and the terrain is well done, featuring caverns, caves and forests of seaweed. Which can be home to some nasty predators if you don't watch yourself. Next up is the crafting. I LOVE IT. It looks complicated when you first go into the system, but it's so simple. And when you have all the requirements for a recipe, it 3D prints the item right infront of your eyes, which is something I've never seen. The controls are responsive, it feels good to play, the submarine controls are similar to Star Citizen's gameplay, wherever your mouse points is where your submarine will want to go, but it can feel a little bit slugish sometimes, espeacially in caves.\n\nOverall, this is one of the early access games where you actually get what the devs say in the descritpion. However there are some periods when you don't hear a thing about the game. However when we do hear something it's usually really detailed and good. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival sandbox games and are looking for a somewhat new approach to the genre. And $20 dollars USD is well worth it, certainly giving you what you payed for.","April 6, 2015","true","13.7"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","6"

It's great to see that after 30 years of PC gaming I can still get totally engrossed in a new game and excitedly await every new update.

I have no worries about the future here as the devs are really close to the players and actually share their backlog/current work items publically!\n- Lack of fully implemented story mode or goal driven narrrative, though the framework is there and being worked on.\n\nI have never had more fun with an early access title than I am having with Subnautica.

Concerning the fauna and flora this title is detailled and plausibly modeled. In combination with the great matching sound effects and music Subnautica develops a unique atmosphere that you will find only in a few other games e.g. Metroid Prime (GCN)/Super Metroid (SNES) or Treasures of the Deep (PS1).\n\nOn daytime (in the game) it is a pleasure to discover the underwater world, collect and store materials and use them later to produce items in your safety capsule. Later on you will be enabled to build your own submarines and underwater base. In the early stage the capsule seems to be the one and only place were you can feel safe. Especially when night time approaches your mood changes radically. It is harmful out there. During night time I always develop goose bumbs because of the shock effect when suddenly a creature appears and bites you. You can hardly await for the next daytime to feel safe and carry on your discovery journey or make screenshots ;).\n\nWhen playing Subnautica you will forget the time. When you  loved Treasures of the Deep you will love this game too.\nEven though it is an "early access" title it plays very smooth. Yes, it has got some bugs like crashes. When loading a saved game to continue gaming it crashes often on my machine (Lenovo W540 mobile workstation, playing in full graphics quality and highest resulution). Regarding drawbacks I have noticed some minor collision problems with objects when interacting with the environment (polygon intersection). Another deficit of this game is that within the actual build no missions are included like they are in Treasures of the Deep. But the dev-time is still in the design phase and maybe they will implement quests etc.\n\nWhat is very interesting (when I noticed right) is the fact that each time you start a new game from the beginning (no save game) the topology of the ocean, position where items are placed and your start equipement is diffrent from the last one. Which is cool and an additional motivating factor of this game.\n\nHovewer in this early stage Subnautica makes a strong impression, especially in technical atmospheric context, and makes great value of your money spend for this game.\n08/10\n\nFor the final build I would be very happy to have the opportunity ... :\n- to load my own models/maps into the game or\n- have an editor to design them by my own,\n- quests are warmly welcome,\n- grow my own see food on the ground of the ocean,\n- more usage of the digging/terra morphing ability.","March 24, 2015","true","19.5"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

With an abundance of poorly made "cash-grab" games, Subnautica proudly stands above them as what an early access game should be. Developed enough to be worth playing yet with constant updates adding multiple new features per update.\n\nThis game offers a fresh concept of survival not based on scavanging destroyed buldings and killing zombies but by exploring the ocean's depths and living off the sea life that inhabits it. Exploration is the key point of this game while survival is a secondary goal that must be met in order to continue playing the game.\n\nPROS\n---------\n+ For an early access game already plenty of features\n+ Few to none game breaking bugs\n+ Constant updates\n+ Beautiful scenery (looks better then some AAA games)\n+ Few games like it\n+ Soundtrack\n\nCONS\n---------\n- No real "endgame"\n- Not much really stopping you from surviving\n- Can be awkward for beginners to pickup\n- Some major updates require a restart\n\nFINAL REVIEW\n-------------------\nI normally don't reccomend early access games personally I think they are a loophole in selling a half-finished game, Subnautica is not like that. This game is a breath of fresh air in the early access survival game genre offerring hours of gameplay and  high quality content. For those of you over at /r/thalassophobia this game is a perfect way to explore your fear or facination of the deep unknown.","August 6, 2015","true","28.2"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","0"

This amazing gem simply compelled me to leave my remarks. For my first play I played for many hours straight, in survival and was just working towards creating my first vessel when I crashed, having foolishly not saved I lost all progress, but after a moment of horror and frustration at myself Im ready and willing to "dive" back in. Just this time ill make frequent use of the in game save feature.\n\nOne the best Early Access Games Ive ever played.\nThe graphics are what really drew me in, very beautiful game to just swim around and explore.\nInventory management, and crafting is very simple to use and friendly.\nThere are few issues but it is Early Access and for having only been realease in December its off to a strong start.\n\nCant leave in game feedback because the feedback menu opens but everything is shoved up into the top right. Some feedback I'd like to give to the developers\n\n-A time based autosave, perhaps save every 10 minutes and or saves on exit.\n-In addition to the inventory would be nice to have a character equipment panel. Fins and tanks that are clearly equiped to my character, and are even visible on yourself should not take up inventory space.\n-The pipes are a nice addition but I believe at some point they should have some sort of way in which they have to attach to something, the way they simple "float" mind air disrupts the realism.\n-Its a minor detail and some would disagree but one the first things I noticed that I think could use some touch up is a climb animation for the escape pod when you leave. It just seemed unsettling how you simply "warp" to the top of your pod.\n-Im sure as others hope and perhaps its in the works but multiplayer option seems like a must. Surely a ship that size crashing would have at least a few more survivors. ;)\n-Speaking of the crashed ship, love its beautiful desing, and use as a landmark back to the pod, it would be a nice a addition if maybe say as an "end" game concept you could find away to withstand the radiation and explore the large ships interior.\n\nAgain I dont leave reviews and apologize if this is not consider the proper feedback. But I do hope the developers glance upon my review if not for the suggestion but even just to let them know, Thank you for this wonderful piece I look forward to more.\n\nTo fellow consumers would I reccomnend this game even in these early stages?

Subnautica is a very pretty, stylized game, from the white sci-fi plastic surfaces to swimming in the dark above a seafloor of bioluminescent plants, you invariably end up spending the first minutes looking at everything until that “10 seconds of air” warning …\n\n\nThe game, as the name implies, take part mostly under water, diving amongst corals, fungi, fish, and vines, and the game uses this to present a unique set of challenges; you have to deal with managing air, not swimming too deep, and having to unlock technology to dive deeper and into caves and wrecks.\n\n\nYou play as a survivor of the terraforming space-ship, “Aurora”, which has crashed into the ocean of an alien planet. Not far from where your life-raft landed is the main ship, and all over the place there is wreckage; it is this wreckage you need to utilize to build a survivable platform and eventually get off the planet.\n\n\nThe immediate challenge comes fairly quickly, as you need to asses your situation, repair your life-raft and sort out food and fresh water; there are emergency rations in the raft, and you can find a few packs on the ocean floor, but eventually you’ll need get creative. The raft comes with a “fabricator”, that lets you build basic things from the materials you can find, which will help you create a source of clean water, while there are fish and plants around for food. Pro-tip: Build some pipes, 5-6 of them, and place them tightly around your life-raft – while the raft will float around freely on the currents, small pipes don’t, and they’ll help keep the thing in one place for a while.\n\n\nAn interesting step from the developers is that while you can hunt for food, the only lethal weapon available is a small knife. The game’s designer, Charlie Cleveland aka Flayra, has purposely sent the game down a path where you have to deal with your environ in a non-lethal way, such as bringing food to pacify some of the more predatory marine life. This puts Subnautica in a stark contrast to many other survival games, where you often become one of the predators.\n\n\nProgressing in the game requires locating “fragments” of different technology, spread across the place. Get enough fragments of something, and you’ll have a blueprint, ready to be used. The game, at this stage, doesn’t really tell you about this, but from the start you have access to the blueprint of a handheld scanner, and eventually curiosity leads you to try scanning these fragments, and builds up your available tech. Constructing items from the blueprints then require raw materials, that you gather from the ocean floor and salvage from your crashed space-ship.\n\n\nBase-building in Subnautica is, of cause, also “subnautical”, where you’re placing structures on the sea-floor and making little hatches to get into them. As you’re building these under a lot of pressure from the water above it, the lower you build them, the more likely they are to break. This seems logical, but again an area where the game neglects to really tell you anything; when your first base floods from lack of structural strength, you’re simply informed that it broke, and you should fix it and/or change it. Some hints are given, such as brief messages about reduction in strength as you replace titanium walls with glass. These help, but only if you notice them.\nSubnautica_2016-04-17_00003Another odd thing with bases is there is only a single total HP, and no localized damage. Add a lot of glass corridors behind a closed bulk-head, and suddenly a room somewhere else pops and lets water in. Adding glass in 1 section weakens everything apparently.\n\n\nNow, the one thing we’ve skipped so far in the review is sound. There is sound, and it is awesome, and helps set the mood (and warn of dangers), but there is not really a lot of it, nor should there be – there is just about enough, though some of the machinery could use some diversification in this area. One place that is sorely missing out is the sound-pack for the player. There are some grunts and what I assume is meant to be screams of pain, but they are only available in something sort-of male. People have requested a female option, but developers say this would take an excessive amount of time, so don’t hold your breath.\n\n\nAn area, where there could be room for improvements, is the map – it’s static. Play a 2nd round, and you’ll find that things are largely in the exact same locations. There is some randomization, e.g. tech fragments spawn in fixed locations, but the type of fragment, as well as whether any spawn in a given slot, is semi-random. Biomes, wrecks, caves etc are, however, static, and maps are easily available online for anyone who wants a leg up.\n\n\nFinally, the game is, currently, single-player. This works, as survival games are about surviving, and especially in Subnautica, where you’re the only land-animal in a vast ocean. Even so, the game would lend itself nicely to Co-Op, even just 2 player Co-Op, where you have to cover the needs of an extra player, and work together to distract hostile marine life, while harvesting plants and minerals. This is again an area that would require significant effort, according to the developers, and currently not being worked on. Multiplayer beyond 2-player could be a bit of a stretch due to the static map, and actual PvP would run counter to the design of not having lethal weaponry.\n\n\nIt does feel somewhat polished, but at the same time lacking in several areas. There is a public roadmap available via Trello, and in-game option for submitting bug-reports, though I’d be inclined to only submit major bugs as you’ll currently encounter far too many smaller glitches to be able to get much playing done.\n\n\nBammsters’ Rating:  Design 8, Challenge 8, Fun 7, Replay 6, Price 8, for an overall rating of 7.4 out of 10.\n\n\nSubnautica is currently available on Steam in Early Access for 19.99€ on Windows PC, Mac and SteamVR, and continues to undergo significant development. An XBox One version is currently also being developed, releasing any day now, and if successful, a PS4 version may also get made.\n\nThis review is based on the Development Build 30230 March 2016, and meant to reflect that Subnautica’s development is still ongoing.","April 17","true","15.3"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

I only really got a couple hours of moderately entertaining gameplay at its current state. Don't buy this game expecting it to keep you entertained for a week yet. I would definately recommend at least following or wishlisting it though. The potential is certainly there, and the devs have been devoted to its progress with healthy concern for keeping the playerbase informed while getting community feedback.\n\nEdit: As the updates come, the playability increases. The addition of modular bases and giant submarines certainly adds a lot to work for. However, I still find myself twiddling my thumbs after I've done everything I could think of.

The different biomes are all beautiful in their own ways, building your base is fun and relatively simple, but the game does give you some challenges with finding fragments for blueprints. It's not impossible to gather blueprints, but some of them are harder to find and get to. My favorite play mode is Hardcore, since you REALLY have to focus on survival if you want to keep your character.

It's beautiful, the mechanics are fairly simple, and the crafting system isn't tedious or boring. Resources seem to regenerate regularly, which means I don't have to explore far and wide just to survive; exploration seems to be for advancement, which I really like. The sound effects and music pair up with the visual perfectly. There are some objects which seem to lack textures, but that's not unusual for an early access game. In the beginner area (which I haven't yet left,) the hostile creatures aren't overwhelming, and food is plentiful, making learning the game non-stressful and rather pleasant. I can't wait to get to a point where I have more than just the basic starter gear and resources, so I can construct a base, vehicles, and so forth.

There are also many other reasons  why i did quit Tf2 and i dont think i need to talk about all the flaws of Valve and TF2 here.\nAfter i did quit playing Team Fortress 2 a friend got me into Payday and Payday 2 and also i play Awesomenauts alot. But since i lost Team fortress 2 i somehow feel lost and im always lurking around on steam to find new great games to play. Like 10 or 11 Months ago i saw Subnautica the first time on Steam in the "coming soon section", there werent many informations about the game and just a few concept arts but i instantly fell in Love with the idea and the game itself.\n\nI lurked the Internet to gather any information i could find about Subnautica, i started making up my own ideas and concept arts, it was the first time i was actually really hyped for a game (except fallout 4 right now). The idea behind subnautica has always been extraordinary in my eyes. Underwater/Diving games vanished 2000-2005 completly, i remember when i was a kid i used to play alot of diving simulators on the PC, of course underwater levels still exist and so does diving but there havent been many high quality games focusing on Underwater adventures, in fact the only game i remember is FarSky, i actually liked the game but it was more like a underwater minecraft with arguable quality.\n\nSo i visited the Subnautica site on a daily base and soaked up everything it did spit out.\n\nSadly i was not capable of backing the Game because i really despise Paypal. As an excuse, i got like 5 friends with paypal accounts doing it vicariously for me.\n\n2 months ago the day finally came, early access, i instantly forced my good friend Don Karnage to buy me the game for christmas because i had been broke. Like a real comrade he did it with not to much resistance.\n\nWell now im here, after 90 hours in experimental mode and im writing this review here (Captain Obvious)\n\nSo where should i start?\n\ni think i start with the Devs.\nThe People working on Subnautica are from the Studio "UnknownWorlds Entertainment", they made Natural Selection (another great alien game) and are currently working on Subnautica and Natural Selection 2. Subnautica is not the first "Early Access" game i bought and not the first process of gamedevelopment i accompanied as a customer. But without a doubt the development of Subnautica is so far the most enjoyable and accessible i have encountered. The Devs do a great job in communicating with the Community and really try to integrate us, the players, in the Development process. There are multiple ways to communicate with the Devs. like the Subnautica forums, the steam discussion  forums, Trello, Sketchfab,Facebook and other social media. You also have a great insight in the game process so far, On trello you can see  what is being worked on and you can vote what has higher priority for example a new creature or a new tool.\nThe Devs usually read posts in the forums with gameideas and if they are good they will be added to the game, they have a plan they follow but they are open-minded and allow us to bring our ideas in the game to. Only negative thing i see right now is that subnautica gets alot of attention, actually nothing bad, but there are people who are really hyped about the game and who have alot of more or less unrealistic wishes and ideas and they spam the forums with no  malicious intentions, still i think it is hard for the devs to keep track of the people who really have eleborate ideas and concepts. Due to this high level of communication and also ways to report bugs the game runs smoothly and bugs or glitches get killed off quickly. In experimental mode you get 2-4 updates daily that add new tools and creatures to test and optimize,add new areas and terrain or fixes bugs. On normal mode there is a weekly update.\n\nAbout the game itself.\n\nIt is one of this games you just cant stop playing because after every update there is something new to discover, also its one of this games you just cant stop looking at.\n\nIt is absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe Alien-Creatures reaching from Huge Peaceful Whalelike Mantarays to Dangerous yet beautiful Fish that  mesmerizes you with their shiny colours and then take your head off, There are funny looking fat manatees that will Gas you if you get to close and other fascinating creatures. The entire Biomes are well made and just gorgeous. At this moment the amount of Flora and Fauna (Creatures and Plants) is not that big, also not all biomes are implemented yet and the ones that exist are not finished yet, new creatures,new plants, new islands and new areas and biomes get added from time to time and i hope the finished game will have all the planned Biomes and tons of creatures ranging from small and peaceful to huge and terrible. But i have no doubt that this will happen, it might take some time but the Devs give their best to add everything they had planned, for example nearly all creatures from the concept arts are already ingame or being worked on.\n\nThe Game itself is beautiful and has nice graphics but doesnt require a really good Computer which is really nice , my Computer is from 2011 and i can play most of the latest high end graphic games on low-medium without stutters, Subnautica runs fine on the highest settings.\n\nIn my 90 hours i havent experienced a single crash although i messed around with the game a lot.\n\nThe Controls of the game are smooth and easy to learn. The concept of the game is to explore and craft and you can play it on different "difficulties" for example in "freedom" you dont have to worry about Water or Food you can just explore and only have to look after dangerous creatures and Oxygen, in "hardcore" you have to eat and drink and also when you die you dont respawn you have to start a completly new game and lose all your items.\n\nThis review is not done yet, i will keep working on it and change things as the game changes, i know im still missing some things but i hope this review helps you a bit to decide if you should buy Subnautica, My suggestion is clearly a "Ja Kamerad"\n\nMiles","February 19, 2015","true","109.6"," 95 of 150 people (63%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","63","95","150","15","2"

But after doing a little bit of exploration, I guarantee you that you will be blown away. What sets this game apart from other survival games is its beautiful environment. You can see just how much thought the devs put in making the game. Every biome you explore is vibrant and different. There are many hidden caves and places to explore. Each place has a different atmosphere. One minute you feel safe, the next, you feel like you're being hunted. The ocean is just teeming with life, from small harmless fish to scary leviathans. Oh, and you can also build you're very own submarine and underwater base. This game is definitely a must buy if you're a fan of survival games. It's amazing how good this game already is even though it's still in early access.

But as this is an early access title that is more than acceptable. With the right development this will be a great game in the survival open world genre.\n\nI really think the idea behind this game is what makes it shine, so many generic survival games out there this one brings you a totall unique experience of being trapped in the ocean of an alien planet. The visuals expesially at night are amazing. The crafting system is extremely user-friendly and well done, overall with my first baby steps in this game I am really amazed. I have looked at over 200 early access titles and this one is easily in my top 10, buy it now if you want to support the devs.\n\nHere is the video version of what I just said if you prefer it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdOJ3VwKQN4","December 19, 2014","true","19.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

The game is being sold at amazingly cheap price. Of course price range depends on where you live in the world, and is subjected to change without notice of course.\n\nI only started to poke around to find out what this grand game has to offer, and so far it's jam packed full of wonder, excitement, and will give you plenty of reasons to ooooh, and aaaah over.\n\nSo exactly what is the story of the game? Well simply put you crash land on an alien world which you will start to colonize. Mankind for whatever reason has decided to explore for other worlds to inhabit, and it's your job to do this BUT, you crashed landed, and there is no way back home. Suffice to say you are out of luck getting any help from Earth so it's up to you to shake the cobwebs out of your head, get a grip with reality, and get to work.\n\nYour first order of business is to gather materials to create food, tools, and harvest coral to create water.\n\nNow certain fish give have different advantages when you cook, and eat them. Take the wee bitty peeper, this fish will not only feed you, it will also sustain you has far as water is concerned, and it give you enough time to convert coral into bleach which will allow you to create fresh drinking water.\n\nTools do break after too much use so keep that in mind as you smack away at the coral, and trying to defend yourself from the Sand Shark, and the Scary alien looking half croc, and I don't know what creature.\n\nDo I like the game?\n\nI sure do, it's one of those titles we don't see all that often, and when it does finally poke it's head out of the sand you can rest assured that it's going to be one of the best games made in a very long time.\n\nIt's not too often that a game feeds the imagination, and this game does just that, it fills you full of wonder, and it does bring back those days when you were young when everything is new, and all you had were questions.\n\nThis is what this game has done for me, it has allowed me to open my mind, explore, and get lost in an environment that is just beautiful, and deadly.\n\nWell folks, thanks for reading this small article, and I hope you take the time to purchase the game, and take a stroll through wonderland.\n\nFinally a game for grown-ups, and kids alike.\n","December 16, 2014","true","119.8"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","36","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicarray/recommended/264710/","cosmicarray","meth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicarray/","23 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSubnautica is a scy-fy-esque, underwater survival game that places you into a primarily underwater world filled to the brim with vibrant plantlife and fish.\n\nWhat does this game need to be great? Content. They could very literally just implement bountiful amounts of content and that alone would hold this game at a very elevated stature to not only mine, but I feel quite a few others viewpoints.\n\n\nThe good news is that the Devs *seem* to be very active, but that is completely expected with brand new titles.\nThe bad news is that at any given moment they could cease update production and we'd be ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.\n\nSubnautica is a great game, conceptually, but to obtain that solid, justified "great game" status in my book it needs to have MUCH more content, and a bit more overall polishing. Now that is crazy considering the fact that it is a brand new title, but hey, the devs did great work in my book.\n\n---------------------\npros and cons\n---------------------\n\nWHAT IS GOOD: (pros)\n\n- The graphics were designed very, very well. I was, and still am wholeheartedly impressed with how immersive the graphics alone are. The devs have blended the perfect mix of vibrance-to-shadowy-darkness ratio, allowing you to feel sunbeaten and safe on the surface yet utterly terrified of the unknown once you get deep enough.\n\n- The sound is very good, I'd like to say that I utterly despise the soundtrack they have implemented (it's a mix of random nightcore-ish club music-esque tracks with some easy going starts to them. I think that if they just took the music out entirely and created in depth, immersive sound for most actions and/or places in the game that it would add even more layers of immersion while also making Subnautica have that deep complexity factor.) Overall, though? I love the sound. That, matched with the graphics make this one of the most immersive games I've played in a while.\n\n- The immersion. Once you start playing this you're almost 90% of the time going to be very literally afraid of what could be below you. A friend and I joked about going too deep and realizing the entire ocean floor was a creature, and as unrealistic as that sounds, that's the kind of thing this game makes you think about. At least until you get a feel for the creatures in it, then... well... Just read my "cons" table\n\nWHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED/CHANGED: (cons)\n\n- Fish AI. What can I really say? It is very basic, and you have to essentially have a staring contest with a creature for them to be any danger. This game is completely relying on that fear of the unknown, but once you get over that, this game becomes kind of boring actually. There's no real danger, beyond what psychological tricks this title plays on you with that ever prevelent "unknown" feel.\n\n- Crafting. Crafting in this game is the biggest let down. Everything is given to you. There's no trial and error, no experience, no interaction. It's utterly linear, hand-holdy, and very very bland after you use it more than about 20 times. What they really need to do is take a lesson from Minecraft, for example, and let us find our own way in Subnautica. You're telling me that I just automatically understand how to create a fully functional submarine? That I just have some inate knowledge to create a Stasis Rifle? No. Fix this. It's unrealistic, creatively limited, and a bit frustrating considering all the other amazing elements of Subnautica.\n\n- DANGER. Implement a creature that comes to the surface and ♥♥♥♥s your ♥♥♥♥ up if you don't fight back. Make a creature that can actually see you from a distance away and comes-a-huntin'. Make a creature that blends in with the rock and grabs you as you swim past. Right now, even on HC mode, playing is a bit lackluster due to the fact that you can literally get away from anything. There's no real danger about any aspect of this game. I literally fear forgetting to eat something more than I do the creatures in this game. That's not good.\n\n- Map. It's essentially always the same. I know this is a very unfair critique so early on, but I feel I need to say it for future purposes. Subnautica would IMMENSELY benefit from having some type of minecraft-esque procedural generation map functionality. With JUST how limitless the underwater landscape can be in terms of map creation, I'm VERY sure that with time (and perhaps some of the resources that the devs have obtained from the early access) the devs could implement this, and should implement this. After just a few playthroughs the map itself becomes a bit hollow, but overall they've done a great job in making me come back for more map-wise.\n\n- Survival. Your food bar goes down far too quickly, as stated in most other reviews I see. As I said above, I quite literally worry about forgetting to look at my food meter more than I ever have about dying from a mob.\n\n- Realism. Everything is so perfect in this game, there's no survival aspect once you really boil this title down. It's all: "Go collect this" and "Go collect that" then "let this 3d printer thingy do your work for you, because why not?" Everything you create comes out perfect. Hell, even the knife you make out of VERY basic resources comes out with perfect branding on it as if you had just purchased it from a market. There needs to be that procedural grind, that feeling of "wow, did I really make it all the way here from when I spawned in?" Overall? I just think they should either completely remove the hand-holdy crafting system or revamp/overhaul it to the point where it doesn't do 80% of the work for you.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nI know I was a bit harsh here, but generally this is a good game. I wouldn't have critiqued it so harshly, or even wasted my time typing this if I didn't absolutely know that the Devs could easily turn this into one of the best games of the genre.\n\nI'll be revising this as I play, and as the game is updated. I'll also provide in depth changelogs of my edits, so that you guys know what you are buying. On more of a straight to the point level? Yeah, I recommend this game. As of right now (3/8/2015) this game has the replayability factor yet fails to have enough content to go all the way. I keep wanting to go back to it, yet I know there's nothing to do. This will improve as the game updates, obviously, but it won't make the fact that in another 20 minutes I'll have every bit of new content they update in my inventory go away. This game needs to make me feel like I've created something, not pushed a button and had it created for me.\n\n\n\nEDIT: 3/10/2015 (1:40 PM)\nI have added a "pro's" list encompassing some of the things I love about Subnautica, as only having a "con's" list was a bit unfair.\n\nEDIT: 3/10/2015 (2:08 PM)\nI have added a "realism" button point in the cons section, as well as did an overall polish of the review in its entirety.","March 8, 2015","true","6.2"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","0"

This is a relaxing, VERY atmospheric game. You swim around, and discover the ocean and it's strange alien orginisms. This is why, the game is better without tutorials and wikis.

The game is also very vague when they want you to get a certain material to craft something, such as vehicles. I do recommend this game very much. Now is it worth $19.99?

I have played about 30h now and never had a crash or game breaking glitch (besides very rare animation glitches)\n- Frequent updates with new content -> it grows fast\n- Great simplicity. No overloaded menus. Very streamlined experience from the beginning.\n- Highly immersive. It doesn't try to be very realistic in all areas, but that doesn't stop you kind of "feeling" the environment.\n\nPeacefulnessI like this game especially because of the peaceful gameplay with a high focus on exploration.\nThere are no lethal weapons (besides a small knife) and the developers stated there wont be any in the future. This and many more gameplay mechanics encourages a peaceful lifestyle with the environment and not against it.\n\nSure there are animals who want to eat you - after all it's a survival game - but there are ways to defend yourself without killing them. Which brings me to the next point:\n\nSurvivalIt's not a hard game, and it doesn't try to be. As I mentioned, the gameplay focuses on exploration and that's what I bought this game for.\nThe survival aspect is merely a tool to encourage exploration. Dying isn't punished very much (at least at the moment) so you can enjoy the gameworld without much frustration.\nThis doesn't mean however that encounters with scary big fish while exploring a dark cave aren't tense however!\n\nTechyMost survival games set you free on a deserted patch of land with literally nothing, so you have to build crude weapons and shelter with literally sticks and stones.\nThat's not exactly the case here. You are stranded because your huge mining-spaceship got wrecked on this planet, so there is quite a bit of technology at your hands. You have to find some blueprints and materials first, but you are able to build some cool tech like submarines and nice-looking seebases with the help of sciency fabricators (with lasers and ♥♥♥♥!)\n\n\nBottom LineThis game is different from a "standard" survival game in quite a few aspects gameplay-wise. Combined with its eye-pleasing graphics and beautiful open world its a very nice fresh touch to the survival genre.\n\nAnd to everyone waiting for "No Man's Sky" -> This is your game to fill the time.","January 15","true","55.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Then you will appreciate Subnautica!\n\nSubnautica while still in Early Access, represents the inginuity of Unknown Worlds, the developing indie studio. After their RTS-FPS title Natural Selection 2, they decided to change gears and make a radically different game. No major AAA studio released an underwater exploration/survival title. Only "FarSky Interactive" an indie studio published an underwater survival game called "FarSky." That title while impressive falls utterly short of what Unknown Worlds has already accomplished in Early Access.\n\nIn Subnautica you are able to explore beautiful undersea environments. They are filled with exotic creatures crafted by U.W. (Unknown Worlds): some resemble creatures from Earth's oceans while others are radically different to represent the alien-ness of the planet you've crashed on. The peaceful exploration mixed in with intense confrontations with dangerous fish constitutes Subnautica's greatest strength: an underwater exploration simulator. The weakness of the game is simply in it's premise: minimal violence. Unlike Natural Selection 2, this game isn't about violence. Subnautica revolves around exploration and imagination.\n\nProvided you appreciate the mystery of the ocean depths, you will love Subnautica.

First You fight to survive, then You explore and then You retire in Your own subnautical paradise ...\n\nSome tips for those who are in the very beginning:\n\n- There is a container inside Your pod with some starter resources to save You some time. You can store some excess stuff there also.\n- Fixing sparks in pod is just cosmetic. Does not change anything at the moment.\n- Craft two or three oxigen tanks and keep them in Your inventory. This will give You more time to navigate and search important materials for survival without need to surface because of oxigen running out. Less stress and more productive diving fun.\n- Fish and waterplants can help You to deal with important survival issues in more than one way. Some species of fish in this game are much more than just "another random source of the food".","December 25, 2015","true","90.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It's also absolutely terrifying at times.\nMy game play as shown here is quite inaccurate because I've been playing offline for a lot of it, my actual time is more like 15+ hours and this is still just early access. Exploring this planets oceans is really, really fun!\nAt the moment you can build a small submarine, a big submarine and as many highly customisable sea bases as you like with more big features trickling in every few weeks. The ocean of this game does a great job of actually seeming alien and as such it can be very scary exploring as you have no idea what you may discover.\nThe survival aspects are very manageable at the moment but do have a tendency to get a bit tedious as the game continues, however you can play in sandbox mode where the survival elements are stripped out allowing easy exploration. The games map is huge but can feel a bit samey after about ten hours. However i think this is because the map is hand crafted so much of the outlying areas haven't been properly furnished yet so this will probably improve in time.\nAnd finally, this game (so far at least) is an excellent example of a developer using early access as it was intended for aka they really listen to the community!\nThey constantly update their Trello board letting you know and up vote what things they are working on and you can easily talk to them through a bunch of methods including twitter.\nOverall 9/10, really impressed!","April 16, 2015","true","29.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The idea is so unique, it's the only survival game on another planet (That i'm aware of.) You spawn in a life pod, after your ship "The aurora" crashed on the planet after an unknown weapon hit it. The game is based almost entirely underwater, which I like, you catch fish as a food source, or you can grab plants from the Island, located behind the ship. You can build underwater bases, submarines, weapons, etc. The only thing I could possibly dislike is the fact that there is no multiplayer, but I'm sure they will add it.

At all times, I was feeling -something- about my surroundings. I found myself admiring the beautiful view in the safe shallows and kelp jungles, found myself jumping at every bump and chirp in the bloodgrass plains, and most of all, I was genuinely paranoid and terrified of the Leviathans near the Aurora.\n\nSubnautica, though it could be called many things, and indeed does these many things well (adventure, sandbox, survival), it truly comes into its own as a horror game. The atmostpheres designed and the creatures to go with them truly instill a sense of fear into the player, as you go deeper, you'll be asking yourself if that was a tail you just saw out of the corner of your eye, or maybe it was just a Spadefish. Unlike most horror, it comes naturally rather than simply hitting you with a jumpscare and demanding that you scream. The setting ushers in an organic feeling of genuine fear for your surroundings, waiting for something that may never come.\n\nWhile this game has many strengths, unfortunately, it has its flaws too. Though it's early-access, and issues are understandable, and indeed expected, some of these things could be well avoided. My biggest problem came from the system of combat. On my first night, I found myself with only a pair of flippers and a survival knife, in desperate need of food. However, upon exiting, I was set upon by Stalkers, and, in my rush to defeat them, I found myself scoring only a hit or two before dying and being forced to go back to my escape pod. Upon further investigation, I learned that, even when not panicking and flailing, it is still exceptionally hard to hit an enemy, and indeed anything that moves, during combat or otherwise.\n\nWhile there are many, many features one might go over, in essence, this game is stellar, providing a refreshing twist on the increasingly stale survival game genre. Despite its high demands of your computer, I find myself able to run the game with only minor issues on a low-end GPU. I would strongly reccomend this game for any who are looking for a true horror experience.","November 23, 2015","true","78.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

And even though the genre itself is quite oversaturated by now, Unknown Worlds take on it is unique enough to capture your attention.\n\nWe already know how to survive zombie outbreak and even apocalyps. But what about surviving crash in the middle of the ocean?\nGather materials to allow you to dive deeper, to fight with sea monsters, to get better gear and build your underwater safe-heaven (that part is not in the game yet, but already has been talked about).\nSounds easy and maybe a bit boring, but it's pretty damn awesome, especially considering colorful underwater environments.\nAside from the setting, the game is pretty much your traditional survival game, which is not a bad thing because you know exactly what to expect from it.\nYou can as well play it with Oculus Rift (although it's not officially supported yet).\nOh, did I already mentioned that this game has the most open development approach I'd seen in Early Access? Yeah, it does - up to commit messages. Kudos to Unknown Worlds, it's pretty fantastic way to develop Early Access title!\n\nOn the not-so-good side of the game are:\n1. Little content at the moment. Gathering and building everything you can takes about 1 hour, after that you are left to just swim around the ocean.\n2. No saves. Which means every time you restart, you will start from a scratch. But since 1), it's not really a big deal at the moment.\n3. Bugs. A lot of bugs. Although, mostly they seem to be related to physics and wonky behaviour of objects.\n\nSo, to sum all that up:\nVery promising.\nStill very raw.\nLittle of content at the moment.\n\nIf you want more gameplay, I'd recommend waiting a few months.\nIf you want to join the dev process and help the devs make a better game - jump in. It's very good.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15PHM4VMfOk","December 21, 2014","true","5.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

They aren't technically bad, but most of them lack... I don't know, it's hard to describe... "soul". None of them are bad, not at all. But some may have a good base going for them, but they don't really expand on it and it gets stale after a very short time.\nThis is of course to be expected, as it is early-access. But we all have those games.\n\nThey looked pretty at first, but then the devs dropped the ball for one reason or another. And you're stuck with an forever "meh"-game that may have become something really cool. And we all know that sometimes that was the play from the beginning of some black sheep devs.\n\nBut this time, in terms of games like Subnautica, you can actually see how invested the devs are. They opened up their working list (I think its called Trello) and even have a neat bug report feature in the game. They are quite talky over Twitter and stuff as well, but it doesn't feel... marketing-ish - if you know what I mean.\n\nThe game looks (to me) gorgeous, has good sound design and kept (and keeps) me playing a long time, as this feeling of the "mysterious unknown" doesn't fade so fast as in many other games (for me this happened in The Forest really quickly). I don't even want to go too deeply into the details of the game (you can watch videos to get an idea).\nWhat I really want to highlight is that this game practically restored my faith in early-access at a whole!\n\nBefore that game I had pretty much had given up on early-access (EA? nah, that sounds bad :] ) as I bought so much garbage that got tossed by the devs in early stages. This game, this dev team is different and deserves more attention.\n\nTL;DR; --> We should keep looking for that yet unpolished diamonds in the piles of **** that stacks up under the early-access banner. Because they are out there... and we just have to find them, and support that companies and devs that care! I found my diamond for the next weeks and hope so much that I'll find more in the future.\nOver and out.\n\nIf you want to see some moving pictures, check this playlist or start with this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1yhsZCLKqPqhEM1BVmlDi49rcunzHUI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeoM44xJacI\n","April 16, 2015","true","20.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The waters are filled mostly with creatures that want to eat you or swim right past you. Though there is one nitpick with the creatures, the brambles that shoot spikes are extremely annoying and you can't kill them. When you're building outside and they shoot at you, they also damage your base which is infuriating. Solution? Use the terraformer and put rock around them (not ON them, you form rocks on them and they'll shoot spikes through it, needs a patch IMO) and that should stop them from shooting at you. The only other nitpick is that the draw distance is horrible but hey can you blame them? It's underwater physics, plus it's early access. Cool little thing is you get an achievement for reporting glitches or bugs that break the game. If there are some really annoying things about the game it's this: Moving items is an absolute bore and pain in the ♥♥♥, if you deconstruct ANYTHING that holds items (lockers, storage units, things like that), those items won't be there when you reconstruct them, so don't save after deconstructing something unless it's empty. Also one last thing, there's no efficient way to power the cyclops except putting 4 crappy looking solor panels on it, If you want to completely recharge the cyclops, you need 6 power cells, That's too many and takes up way too many materials. Every other power source (bioreactor, transfer rod or whatever that diamond rod is) weighs it down. There needs to be a way to dock the Cyclops or power it. Other than that, really fun game","December 22, 2015","true","31.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","17","22","7","4"

Compelling and well defined gameplay already fully functional. The ambiance and environment is already lush and immersive. Exploration yields  some excellent vistas and ominous moments while in survival mode as you find ways to reach further into the depths.\n\nOf course there are bugs/glitches, it is early access after all. Unknown Worlds provides a means to report what you run into WHILE IN THE GAME! The amount of development information that they allow players to see is astounding also. It seems almost unfettered access to what's going on almost daily at the studio. The dev team is very accesible and approachable. Easy to find in the forums where constructive discussions are taking place.\n\nWith the upcoming release of the Cyclops submarine and some of the other things on the horizon, I highly recommend giving this title a look. If early access is here to stay, players need to support the titles and teams that are doing it right on all levels and that certainly seems to be the case here.\n\nI'm having a ton of fun already with a minimal amount of  inconvenience from any kind of game breaking bugs thus far. If you're looking for survival gameplay in a well crafted and novel environment (without those pesky zombies) and what appears to be a ton of features in various stages of development already in the pipline, you should really consider taking this game for a swim.","January 22, 2015","true","38.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This game is very refreshing and feels new. This is what I've been looking for.\n\nThe game explained: Subnautica is a game of where you are a crashed pilot on an alien-type planet. The only thing that you have is the ocean. You are challenged to survive and build, which is a must-have for this game.\n\n\nThe Pros Amazing graphics - If you have the right GPU.\nRefreshing - No other games currently like this, and it is performing it's idea greatly.\nThe Devs - Development on this game has been fantastic and it contiunes to go smooth.\nAnd a whole lot more.\n\nThe Cons No game is perfect, and since this is an Early Access game it is expected to see cons.\n\nLong loading - Look, I understand it takes alot to set everything in place and make sure your system is ready, but I feel as if it takes too long. I've even lost interest in playing because I get sidetracked.\n\nSome bugs - I'm not going to start whining about this but of course there always are bugs. For instance, when you hit a certain fish with the knife it teleports away.\n\nLittle to no options - Look, we need more options for customization in the main menu and in game.\n\nCan be demanding for low-end users - If you do not have the best hardware, you may be in trouble. It's a very demanding game so it will use alot of GPU and CPU.\n\nThe Conclusion\nDo I reccomend this game? Yes. Even for it's flaws every update adds something new and fixes issues.

I was going, and I heard really loud screeches on the way down. I figured it was a reaper leviathan, and from what I knew they only spawned near the aurora, and I was on the opposite side, so I thought it was a glitch.\n\nAbout 20 seconds after that, a REAPER LEVIATHAN SHOT UP FROM THE DEPTHS AND CLAMPED ONTO MY SEAMOTH WHILE I STOOD THERE IN PANIC AND SHOCK AND i was forced to bail my seamoth and swim ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN to get back to my base.\n\nOnce I got to my base, I thought everything was all fine and dandy untill I entered my base. I notcied that apparently gravity hadn't worked properly, but then I saw THE GIANT GASH IN THE SIDE OF THE WALL and I realised that MY ENTIRE BASE IS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER so I got my welder and fixed everything and I was fine\n\nI was swimming back to my lifepod after that, and I ran into a kelp forest, which gave me some breathing room. I was wrong. 8 STALKER SHARKS started ALL CHASING ME and I DIDN'T HAVE MY SEAGLIDE So I had to swim into a small opening which lead to a cave where I was instantly greeted by those little Crash things, Who BLEW UP RIGHT IN MY FACE\n\nI escaped the cave, and got back to the lifepod without being eaten or exploded.\n\nIt's moments like these where you realise that these types of games are truly the best types of games.\n","June 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","10","10","6","0"

There will be a story, however.  The gist is you're sent to this planet to terraform it, but your ship blows up for some reason.  From there it's currently a mystery.\n\nQ: So what is there to do?\nA: Swim around, build new ships, observe alien life forms, explore underwater cave systems\n\nQ: Is this game polished enough, with enough content, to justify spending $20?\nA: No, but the developers have an "experimental build" system, so you can actually watch the game evolve HOURLY.  If that's what you like about Early Access, then I wholeheartedly recommend you purchase the game\n\nQ: Can the developers be trusted to finish the game?\nA: Yes.  Unknown Worlds' first retail game (Natural Selection 2, which I was an alpha tester of) was updated much the same way as Subnautica.  Except UKW earned enough from the sale of NS2 that their team is larger, and thus updates are much more frequent, as well as packed with more content.\n\nQ: How much do the developers communicate with their community?\nA: Their CM, Hugh Jeremy, is one of the best that I've ever seen.  He responds quickly and politely every time I've needed to speak to the team.  In addition, other members of their team browse their official forums and regularly post there to answer questions.  By far, one of the most well-communicated communities I've ever seen.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who like exploration games and to watch early access games evolve and change.","February 4, 2015","true","22.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

But i really want them to add Co-op so i can play with another person or a friend or 2..\n\nJust read this recently thought i might add this as it may answer the question to a lot of people who wants multiplayer...\n\nAdding multiplayer support to Subnautica is something we would love to do. In fact, the game was originally conceived of as a co-op experience. However, as we started to develop the game, we skipped multiplayer to be able to release the game faster.\n\nNow we find ourselves in a difficult situation: we all really want co-op player, but adding it would take us many months of work. We almost have to start over from the beginning, as it affects everything. If our small team decided to add multiplayer right now, we probably wouldn’t be able to improve any other aspect of the game for a very long time.\n\nSo we’re not sure what we’re going to do, but we’re not working on multiplayer right now. The most important thing is to make sure the exploration, crafting and creature experience is working well. Maybe before v1.0 we’ll figure out a way to hire another team to help us with networking, or maybe we’ll release a new version of the game later that supports co-op (like Klei did with “Don’t Starve Together”).”\n\nThat’s Subnautica multiplayer as it stands today. If the team consensus moves, we will keep you updated. We have to be honest about this: “we’re not working on multiplayer right now” means there is zero, nada, zilch, absolutely no possibility of multiplayer any time in the short or medium term.","February 26","true","20.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Or do you play them so you can make your own story, your own legacy?\n\nIf you play games to win, in it's current state, this game is probably not going to be something you'll fall in love with. Give it a few months and come back to see what state the game is in in terms of content. As it is now it's a little lackluster. I've played for ~21 hours, and I've done just about everything. There's still some stuff I want to mess around with, but if I was playing the game to beat it, I would already be done.\n\nHowever, if you play games for the immersion, this game is amazing. There's so much to explore. There's so many ways to build bases.

I did feel compelled to write it though because this game has surpassed any of my expectations I had for it including graphical, gameplay, longevity etc.\n\nGraphics are convincing and I'm hard to please, the reeds sway beautifully in the currents, the sun breaks through the surface of the water and casts light rays over the alien reef and makes me feel almost scared of the sheer scale of things. I desperately want to explore but I'm worried to go too far from my pod at the moment. I do know that the longer ranges of exploration will come with time invested in the game and it encourages me to go a little further with each dive, just to see what I can find.\n\nWithout rambling on too much I'll just finish off with this fact. I had said to myself that I wouldn't invest in any more early access games after feeling let down by previous devs. This game has rekindled my faith in the system, or at least made me feel that not all devs are out for a quick buck. This game has trully impressed me so far and I'd highly recommend it to anyone no matter what your usual genre is.

It sounds big, and angry and very, very loud and you have no idea where it is!\n\nYou spin your Seamoth submarine around to take a peek, nothing but darkness. Relieved, you turn back around and there it is! Right up in your face like some kind of jumpscare horror movie bs.\nThe good news, if you needed to go to the toilet, you just saved yourself a trip.\n\n*Quick advice* Don't youtube the big monsters right away, its a fun and scary as heck discovery. Don't ruin that part of the game for yourself, it is one of the more memorable moments.\n\nIn a more serious, but quick review, the game is great. It's still early access so bugs n' whatnot, but I get pumped for every update adding new goodies.\nVisually, the game looks great. The effects and lighting is really well done, from gigantic glowing mushrooms to luminescent cave dwelling spider things.\nThe sound, heh, the sound is amazing. I really want to know what the dev team used for the Bone Sharks and the big R's. Also all the little sounds are well done, from Peepers leaping out of the water to your character splashing around, the audio person has really outdone him/herself and I believe the sound is what makes this game so immersive.\nThe habitat building is fun, you can build some really cool looking undersea water bases (or above water if you want). There isn't a huge variety of things to build at the moment but more and more stuff is being added.\nFarming, pet keeping, gazing lovingly out the windows at the gorgeous coral reefs and running through your complex like a lunatic dealing with catastrophic breaches 600ft below sea level, trying to band aid the base and figure out what went wrong before it all fills with water and you drown.\nThe first time you build a Cyclops - I was awed, I really wasn't expecting it to be so big.\n\nOverall I highly rate the game as being worth the buy. It's only getting better and better. And things are getting bigger, including the friendly....and not so friendly fishies.

There's just not a whole lot of games out there that feature underwater exploration in an open-world sandbox environment. Like "Farsky", the game puts you in the shoes of someone who has wrecked at sea (this time it's a spaceship, not a submarine) and is tasked with surviving. While both games have multiple ways of killing you, "Subnautica" features quite a bit more in terms of crafting recipes, including the need to drink filtered or disinfected water. The crafting system is fantastic in that it gives you all the recipes and tells you what you'll need in order to make them..in other words, very user-friendly.  There are also a few different vehicles too! I honestly can't wait to see what else will be added to the game as it continues to develop.  Be warned however...at the moment, the save feature doesn't appear to be working.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXw0BmKThAw\n","December 19, 2014","true","4.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

They bore the pants off me. Hard to explain then why, with limited time to game these days, I've just sunk 40 hours into this and haven't regretted one of them.  Really, Really enjoyed it.\n\nPerhaps it's the novelty of the underwater setting. Perhaps it's the real OMFG tension of exploring and hearing or seeing a new creature, with no idea if that means I'm about to have dinner, or be dinner, or see my Seamoth mini sub torn to pieces. Again.\n\nAnd the views! I find myself stopping and gazing in newly discovered areas just to take it all in. In fact I do the same in areas I've been to or passed through many times before.\n\nJust a tip - not a spoiler -   for when you're a few hours into the game.  You're seamoth mini sub can be upgraded, and doing so allows you to go further and deeper to properly explore the map. Before I realised that I thought the bulk of the map was just bottomless water.\n\nAnd whilst discovering things yourself is fun, don't be afraid to hit the wiki or Google if you're confused about something.

I can almost guarentee this game is going to get out of Early Access.\n\nIts fun, theres quite a lot to do, tons to explore.\n\nIf you are looking for a game where you kill everything, this is NOT your game. This is a (mostly) pacifist game, where you are trying to coexist with the environment. There are some weapons you can use for self defence. But purposely going out to kill things is not worth the trouble, and not very fun.\n\nThis is a building/exploring/surviving game.

Immersion (no water puns intended) feels surprisingly strong when I play.\n\nI also like that the "survival" aspect of the game doesn't mean "OMG! The entire game is trying to screw you over from second one. Good luck, chump!" as in so many so-called "survival" games; it means what you expect -- you're marooned in an alien environment, and you have to survive.\n\nYou can play Subnautica with the survival aspects (the need for edible food and potable water) turned off, and just tour around, but at this early stage, the game loses its primary focus, and inherent drama, without the struggle, and you may get bored without these things.\n\nAlso, the developers did just added a savegame feature,  so you don't have to start from scratch if your survival doesn't go well.\n\nIn addition, there's  a Subnautica Wiki out on the `net already, if something stumps you (for example, I had to look up how to acquire a "Membrane" in order to create filtered drinking water).\n\nAnd I'd be remiss not to mention that the undersea world looks beautiful. The graphics and the environment design are impressive, even at this early stage. Again, I feel like I'm actually there, under the waters of an alien sea.\n\nAs of this writing, Subnautica's gameplay is limited to basic survival tasks, but I already dabble with the game more than I ever expected I would. It's like a quick vacation to an alien world.\n\nIf all this sounds like something you would like, and you can handle the fact that this is a work-in-progress Alpha test game with cool, but limited, gameplay at this point, then I recommend Subnautica wholeheartedly.","January 20, 2015","true","8.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

They have a plan, they have the team to go through with that plan, and they have the audience for that plan. They have released updates fairly often, as well as having an experimental branch (which I have not tried yet, as it is very unstable), which is updated ~3 times daily, or so I hear.\n\nRight now, the mechanics are very simple: eat, drink, build, progress. The world is not very "open", not North, at least. I went about 500 meters out before the sea floor became a 180 degree angle floor with no detail. This is not a bad thing, though. The area that HAS been developed goes even further than 2000 meters, as many have said.\n\nWhy do I not know if it goes beyond 2000 meters?\n\nBecause everything below 50 meters scares the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nSeriously.\n\nWhale-esque animals 5-20 times the size of your character, that like to do their best T-rex impressions.\n\nAside from me being a wuss:\n\nThe community is great, they're helpful, friendly, and share a common interest.\n\nIs it worth $20 for an early access game, even after what we've  all  seen with DayZ: SA?\n\nYes.\n\nThis is one of the 2 or 3 early acces games that I actually believe has a future.\n\nBuy it.","March 27, 2015","true","11.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

And to be honest, it is probably the very best ocean survival game that you can currently buy, even though it is still in early access. Mind you, this is a game that is based on an alien planet, and it still manages to do ocean survival better than most games that have the player survive in the very real oceans of Earth. The water of subnautica is particularly beautiful, and accurate to what Oceans are really like, assuming these alien oceans are similar to the ones we have. The largest issue I could note at the moment is a simple lack of content, which is exceedingly common in early access titles.\n\nSubnautica is set in a highly advanced universe, where space travel is possible, and probably commonplace. Because of this, the style of architecture and technology in Subnautica is quite advanced in appearance, actually becoming reminiscent of the style in games such as portal. This sets up the common dynamic of a civilized player exploring an untamed world. Hungry and presumably afraid, this space age individual must survive on a diet of alien fauna and flora. Swimming or gliding in submersibles, the player must continue to explore for what is at the time of writing this, just better chances of survival. the map of subnautica is extremely large, with a focus on exploration. Exploring comes with its own set of difficulties, though. You are not the apex predator of this world, and you will eventually have to outsmart rather than fight these aliens head-on. Most crafting and exploration is not for this, and is instead to further your own ability to explore, and combat these creautures while exploring.\n\nThe graphics boasted by Subnautica are particularly stunning for a game in early access. The oceans of subnautica are eerily realistic, providing some horrifically nice water and lighting effects. The lighting and sound design in particular push subnautica towards horror game status, especially for those with thalassaphobia. Picture this - you're swimming through open ocean, the bottom unseen to you. You can very clearly hear the agonizing screams of a very real threat, that you cannot spot in the hazy blue of the ocean around you. Paranoia and fear set in, and you so badly want to return to your base. This psychological toll on the player is surprisingly accurate to the feeling that you can get while diving in real life. What seperates this from real life the most, would be the constant stuttering and framerate drops that are still commonplace for even the highest end machines. I still find these to be worth the amazing sights. Hopefully these will be optimized out at some point.\n\nAnd of course, the negative part of this review. The eventual lack of content in any playthrough of this game. I will not spoil the content that the game does currently have, as that would defeat the purpose of exploring on your own, but I will note that most people will become bored within 10 hours of gameplay. Most of these different biomes are criminally empty, sporting basic ecosystems with very few different creatures or reason to explore them besides "fragments", which after scanning, usually leave you no reason to return to that biome. Some biomes are home to specific materials which after getting, are rarely necessary to get once again. Features such as farming and aquarium building are fun, but once done extensively, will rarely be reason enough to continue playing.\n\n7/10 at the moment. Definitely worth the buy, but it is in desperate need of story and overall content.","March 23","true","63.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

The ocean floor hidden behind the darkness of the depths of the sea, only accompanied by the hum of the seamoth's engine, and the occasional cries of the giant beasts that could be lurking just feet below you, to swimming around your new sea base, catching peepers and airsacks, one eye focused at all times, watching for the toxic manatee-esc beasts, or the horrid Stalkers, where the hunter could become the hunted with the swat of a garryfish's tail.\n\nOnce you get to a point where you can venture near the Aurura, the screams of the reapers will give you a feeling of almost helplessness, yet more of a push to delve further.\n\nThe environment ranges from the pleasant high-up sand of the platue typically near your escape pod, to the steep sloping stone down to a barren underwater desert of sand, almost void of life.If it wasn't for the noises youll hear within.\nThe giant mushroom forests, to the caves of the undersea vents, the kelp forests, full of stalkers and parasites, but home to easy food and resources.\n\nDependant on your luck, especially mid to late game, food and clean water collection *can* get in the way occasionally, stopping you from progressing for a short while, but it's never to bad.\n\nThe game, at the time of posting, is still in early acess, and the devs imply it will likely be so well into 2015, and they are heavily focused on the advice and suggestions of the community.

The game puts a twist on the regular survival game, forcing you to swim your way around a beautiful landscape going from shallow coral reefs to spooky dark depths, which may hold an unpleasant surprise. In the base ''Story Mode'' of the game, you play as a stranded crewman from the spaceship ''Aurora'', somewhere in a not-too-distant future. You start off in an escape pod with limited supplies & some diving gear; you choose what happens next.\n\nThe gamplay is honestly amazing; you feel like you're in control of your character, and the immersion (in the game, not the water *silence* ok) is very pleasing. The game does suffer from some bugs such as weird noise in loading screens, sometimes loading your game but not letting you use item bar, general AI feels weird when it comes in contact with the cyclops, and the render distance could be pushed a bit. Alot of stuff has been fixed by the dev team, which is pretty active and somewhat transparent about where the developpement is at; props to devs like these. Other noteworthy thing would be the ability to choose between regular survival and ''freedom'', identical to the other survival mode except with no food/water bar for those who dislike that mechanic.\n\nNonetheless, this is an amazing title that will catter to fans of diving, but also to those (like me) who would be terrified to go diving in anything more than shallow waters.  I recommend it to any survival fan, as long as you don't mind spending most of your time swimming or simply being under water.","February 11","true","15.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Honestly, that is pretty impressive for an Early Access title but most likely we just got lucky and chances are that we will encounter some bugs the next time we play.\n\nFrankly, everything from the graphic quality, stability and game mechanics, as well as the game optimization itself, were really quite impressive.  Credit here must go out to the entire Subnautica team who really have exceeded all expectations of what an Early Access game should be and hopefully it sets a new standard for other Early Access game developers to follow.\n\nUndoubtedly, from everything that we experienced while playing the game, Subnautica looks to have some HUGE potential.  Development on the game seems to be in very good hands as the team working on Subnautica has already shown us a glimpse of just what they are capable of achieving.\n\nThe future seems to be very bright for Subnautica and the good news is that the journey has only just begun.\n\nGreat job on the Early Access launch to the entire Subnautica team!","December 17, 2014","true","32.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

While my expectations were high, I was awestruck by how amazing it is thus far.\n\nSubnautica takes you on a journey through the waters of an alien, oceanic world. You start out in your lifepod in a safe, shallow area. You do a few free dives in order to satisfy your immediate needs: food and water, before slowly pushing further out and exploring deeper in order to acquire more materials and items needed to build vehicles and bases. While you have to eat and drink (in survival mode), survival is not really the point of the game. Instead, the survival aspect is there as a guiding force that gives you incentive to keep exploring through the breathtaking (literally -- watch your O2!) world you're stranded on.\n\nFrom a technical aspect, most of the content that is already there is well executed and actually quite polished. Several of the difficult things are already implemented. The fauna behavior is varied and life-like. Most of the game mechanics work really well, and the few bugs that I've encountered are minor nuisances rather than anything even remotely game-breaking. The devs have included a very easy way to provide feedback, and seem to really care about the product they're making. Although it's early access, this is a high-quality (pre-)release and I'm confident the devs have what it takes to make it into a brilliant finished game.\n\nOn the downside: This is early access, and obviously there are a few rough edges. While still massive, the content could still be expanded more. A few of the textures are WIP, primarily 3D representation of some items and materials. However, the amount of content, the stability, the balancing and polishing is still better than in several released games.\n\n11/10 would be stranded on a remote, alien water-world again. And again.","August 29, 2015","true","21.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is comparable to games like minecraft, but is very different.\n\nYour space ship crashes onto a water planet, and it seems, thus far that you are the only survivor. Luckily you managed to get onto an escape pod, and must now survive until, presumably, help arrives. This is an early access game, keep in mind, and is not finished yet.\n\nTHE GAME\n\nThe first thing you will see when you start a game in Subnautica, is your (very large) spaceship sinking in the distance. You start the game on your escape pod, which conviently has basic supplies for survival, but will not support you for very long.\nSo you have to dive in the water, and basically, survive!\n\nThere are three basic things that you need to take care of in order to live. Oxygen, food, and water. Keeping these things up is relatively easy once you get the hang of it.\nYou will notice as you start to craft things to aid you in your survival, that there are many advanced doodads that won't really help you 'survive' more, but will actually make the game very fun.\n\nCrafting is an important part of the game, and I like it a lot more than minecraft. Altough at this time minecraft is a better game, because of things like multiplayer, as an early access game, it is very good. I'm a huge ocean geek, and the immersion in this game is top notch. You can see your mask on the edge of your screen, when you look down you can see your legs with your fins on and your arms helping you swim. The graphics are beautiful, and when you find a mushroom forest for the first time, you will be in awe.\n\nBut there is also that feeling of uncertainty that you get when you are in your tiny submarine, going through open water, and when you look around, there is only that deep blue.. And it makes you wonder.. What is down there? Am I about to run into something?\n\nSpeaking of subarines, you can construct a little one that when you eventually build the bigger one that can actually be a mobile base if you wish, you can actually dock the smaller one onto it, and is done very well. And both need power cells in order to function which deplete eventually! So if you want to leave your base behind and go on an expedition, you will need to plan ahead!\n\nThat is what I love about the game, I actually wanted to explore what was around the corner, or that really deep cave that is rich with rare minerals, or go to that island that is very far in the distance..\n\nThere is no real end game. You can't beat it, but what keeps me going back is the immersion that you experience when you dive in the water, and I wish that I could play it with an Oculus!\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nAs this game is early access there are a few things that can withdraw you from the experience. You will definitely run into a couple of bugs, but even if your hard work somehow becomes inacessible, you can actually spawn any object in the game so, it is very rare to lose anything.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I do wish that there were a little bit more enemy types, but they are working on it. They release new things very often, and I can't wait to see the finnished product.\n\n\n","June 19, 2015","true","49.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I think that that is something amazing that is shown here, that set and setting alone can have a great deal on setting a mood, in this case, an alien ocean seeming as dangerous as it is idylic. That is something you don't really see in games anymore.\n\nOverall after my first impressions I think the devs are doing something truly original here and I'm going to have a good time playing this game (if you know what I mean)\n\n","August 31, 2015","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","1"

You're part of the crew aboard a terraforming ship on a year and a half journey out from the nearest major starport, one-way. Or rather, you were before a catastrophe happens that leaves you alone on the surface of some water planet in the middle of nowhere.\n\nDon't let the bright, tropicaly colored graphics fool you; this game gets categorized as 'Survival Horror' instead of 'Tropical Vacation' in my book because you and Lifepod 5 are sitting in an ocean full of alien life forms who would go out of their way to give human a try. Hostile creatures ranging from small parasitic Bleeders the size of your forearm to the loud and scary Leviathan-class predators inhabit the waters.\n\nStarting off with your futuristic fabricator within the lifepod, you start building tools with the resources in your vicinity and work your way up, eventually beginning to recover technology from wreckage of your assigned starship, building a small seabase to establish a base of operations, creating and operating a large submarine to dive deeper, and eventually making an exosuit to operate in some of the deepest depths of the shelf you inhabit. Just be careful down there, it's hard to imagine what sort of creatures have evolved to survive one of the harshest environments imagineable.\n\n----\n\nFluffy review aside now, I really don't know why more people haven't purchased this game. It's amazing and innovative; where other survival games treat water as a boundary this game embraces it, innovates on underwater graphics, yada yada. It's pretty and it makes you feel like you're in an endless ocean.\n\nThey're about ready to meet the final goals they'd originally set hopefully by the end of the year. Currently the early access is quite filled out in comparison to a year ago, though I admit the biggest issue I have is batteries not being rechargeable yet (coming in the next update probably!)\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a fan of survival games. Just know that the priority in early access isn't quality of life stuff like the afformentioned battery chargers. That said, they're nearing completion and have finally gotten around to implimenting QoL content!","May 24","true","59.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Maybe even longer. I've spent almost 200 hours in total playing the game. 20 of which I was probably staring at the beautiful scenery, water an light effects. And even though I've been into this game since early 2015, the developers still manage to amaze me every time they put up a new update. Every single update gives me a new reason to start another survival game. I think that the best parts of this game are its looks and sounds. Whenever you're in a safe zone, you really get the feeling of safety and happiness. Once you start going into the deep, you really get that voice in your head, telling you to hurry back to the safe zone. This is the first game I have ever reviewd. In my opinion this game deserves a 10/10. It is still an early access game and still has quite a few bugs if you start looking for them and get as involved with the game as I am. Though still, the team behind this game is doing a very, VERY good job and have managed to step forward with one of the best games I think I have played in the past couple of years. I would seriously recommend this  game to really anyone.","May 29","true","194.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

All in all, the experience with this Dev and this game has been 100% positive.  I still recommend buying it, this is definitely one of those "labors of love" for this developer.  We have left the "just a tech demo" stage of this one and are now seeing a game take form.\n\n***Original Review***\n\nOk, gonna keep this short and sweet.  As of the writing of this review, there isn't much game.  It is more a tech demo than anything at this point.  With that said, it is one damn impressive starting point for an early access game.  I feel a bit better after dropping the $19.99 required to jump into this.  The developers clearly love their game and this seems to be one of the EA titles to keep a close eye on.  With all that being said, if you are looking for a game to play and get into, look elsewhere.  This title is not ready for prime-time, but if you are interested and want to see it succeed, by all means PLEASE purchase this title immediately.  The more funds these engaged developers get, the more content we will see.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIs the game worth playing?  Not at the moment.  Is it worth buying?  Yes, if you want it to succeed and want it to live up to all of its potential.","February 1, 2015","true","27.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

But this is different, you’ll get to do it underwater where surviving in the deep pitch black darkness.\n\n\nNo one will hear your cries in the depths of hell.But for first time players, you’ll probably be tearing most of the time in the life pod as it will be your most visit haven when you venture too deep and die.\nSome may be curious or easily agitated when you found a life form called Crash when you get close to it, it is like a homing missile waiting to explode in your face. For players that just started the game will never expect it untill when you notice it is swimming to you. #Tears\nSurvivingOXYGEN\nWhats unique in this survival game is there is an additional element to consider in underwater survival is oxygen, as you dive deeper into the depths of hell it gets darker and pressure starts kicking in, as you happily explore the seabed getting your awesome loot you notice your SeaGlide ran out of power and forgot to prepare your spare oxygen tanks, or construct your Seamoth or Cyclops before your grand adventure into the depths, you’ll know you are doomed.\nBut do not panic, try to look for a Fauna called Purple Brain Coral, it produce oxygen bubbles and it can replenish 10 oxygen for each bubble.\nAnother Tool that is quite useful is the Air Bladder activating it will act like a buoyancy and send you floating back to the surface, it can save you as it is faster than swimming up.\n\n\nFOOD & WATER\nFood is everywhere, the fishes in the sea can be eaten raw at a cost of decreasing your water. So it's best to have it cooked at the Fabricator or by swinging your Heat Blade at the poor fish. But try not to cook too much than what you are required to, as cook food will start to rot over time.\n\nWater can be found on fishs when you cook them as well, but to make Filtered water by using the Airsack at the Fabricator which only +20 on your water, i will recommend Disinfected Water as it +40 the only difference is using Bleach (Salt Deposit+Coral Chunk) rather than Airsack.\n\n\n\nPros•	 Animations are quite well made (e.g Bulkhead, Docking)\n•	 Nice graphics.\n•	 Gets to build bases.\n•	 That underwater feels.\n•	 Aurora EXPLOSION.\n•	 You get to cry alone in your lifepod or in your seabase in the dark 500m deep.\n•	 Use Terraformer to build yourself a small cave. Make you feel like an EEL\n\nCons•	 There is no random generated map.\n•	 No multiplayer (For now).\n•	 Some FPS drops in some locations.\n•	 Updates are kinda slow but worth the wait.\n•	 Still not enough content but I am sure it will be a promising game.\n•	 Minor Bugs (e.g Constructor can't build, Fabricator not working. Just restart the game. Really.)\n\n\n9/10","August 25, 2015","true","323.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

But it has so much to offer. It has beautiful graphics, different levels of gameplay for those who just want to build and those who want a hardcore survival experience, and a few in between. The different biomes are so fun to explore and I love learning where to find which elements. Also, the building mechanic with the bases... definitely a plus.\n\nI think my biggest and only downside to this game, which might change as the game develops, is the lack of any kind of in game tutorial or help. I find myself alt-tabbing or leaving the game multiple times simply to figure out how to do something. Don't get me wrong, it's relatively easy once you've watched a let's play or two. But a little more in game info would make this game completely solid.\n\nThis might sound like a negative review, but this is a small price to pay for something so fun.

It's beautiful (especially in "Experimental Mode").   The world is enormous.  And every little thing you accomplish opens up more of the world to you.  If you're brave enough to venture out.  I've seen most of the world now I think (at least above the sea floor), but there's still a couple areas I'm too chicken to go into.  You can just HEAR something's out there and isn't happy about you poking around...\n\nThe game is clearly unfinished (see that "Early Access" label?), but there's already a pretty full game here.  And even with the gaps, it's already great at triggering my sense of curiosity, and a need to scavenge just a couple more things so I can build that next upgrade, or base component or ship, or explore that new cave I just found.\n\nIt's also neat to be able to watch how development is progressing and what the devs are currently working on.  They have a publicly viewable Trello account with several boards detailing their dev, design, and release history.  Updates seem to come monthly from what I can tell.  And even more frequently if you opt in to that "Experimental Mode" I mentioned earlier (basically gives you access to their internal testing builds).\n\nOn the other hand, since the game IS still unfinished, so there ARE rough edges.  For example the the way assets load into the world can cause very frequent framerate stuttering.  Personally, I'm not having trouble seeing past that stuff, but I'm sure it will bother other people.  Hopefully all that will be ironed out eventually.  The devs very clearly have a lot of work they still plan to do.","December 31, 2015","true","28.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There aren't a lot of games that focus on underwater gameplay -- and even fewer take it to space.  On top of this, despite its early access status, the game runs relatively well and provides fun and interesting gameplay right off the bat.  This game has powerful potential, and is fairly deep and very entertaining in the meantime.  More animal variety and density -- especially of harmless or helpful animals like reefbacks and floaters -- would be a good direction to move in.","January 5","true","9.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Despite that fear though, I have a morbid facination with the deep dark abyss and am addicted to exploration. I started out on hardcore just to drive the point home that I truly was afraid of any conceivable threat. I slowly expanded my reach throughout this underwater world, watching and studying creatures before then testing cautiously to see whether or not they were hostile or how they'd behave in my presence, in order to understand what tactics I'd need to employ in the future when encountering these creatures, when coupled with other stressful factors like low oxygen, hunger, thirst, or already being pursued by another predator. Surviving in the game can be rough at first but I quickly figured out what food sources were the most valuable and did my best to preserve them.\n\nOnce you can build a base, things become relatively easier. I recommend building a base deeper down, on the border of one of the more dangerous biomes, so that you have a source of oxygen/safehaven closer to where you will be taking dangerous expeditions. The devs have done a fantastic job at making a both beautiful and terrifying world, especially on the experimental version which is what I have played on for the most part, the nights are rediculously dark and the days can 'happily' surprise you with an eclipse as a incredibly close planet blocks the sun for around 15 seconds. This can be a shock if you're already pretty deep down but relying on the light of day.\n\nReaper Leviathans though... hoo boy, I mean looking at a picture of one doesn't make it seem all that terrifying, hell watching someone else be attacked by one isn't either. But when you're immersed in the atmosphere of the game and one of those things springs out of the gloom, man did I ♥♥♥♥ myself. Don't think I've turned a seamoth around that fast at any other stage. The sheer weight of them is what's scary, along with their roar, it's more of an aura that's intimidating as opposed to what they actually look like. Doesn't help that they can basically 1 hit you either :P. Even Reefbacks are pretty intimidating and they aren't even hostile, just the sheer size of that creature... you know that thing could probably kill you if it sneezed your way.\n\nBut yeah, this game is good you should get it, has bugs but you should expect that from early access... devs are pretty on the ball with updates however. I recommend playing on the 'current' (obviously current as in when this post was made, may be different now) experimental mode, game looks and plays a lot better... . (Just look up how to change to experimental mode, I'm not talking about the graphic settings in the initial menu)","January 16","true","81.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

You are the last survivor of a spaceship crash and have escaped with the bare essentials. You plunge into the seemingly endless ocean in hopes of finding food and drinkable water to stay alive. The ocean is beautiful and full of resources. It's also full of things that want to kill you. By far, the best part of Subnautica is not knowing what's around the corner, seeing the resources you need and finding out how to get those resources. You'll go from surviving to thriving but never think you're invincible because, like our own ocean, this alien world has some messed up creatures who will mess you up. Subnautica is fun. When trying to explain the appeal to people I say 'It's like Minecraft but underwater' which does the game a disservice. Subnautica has some truly great things that are unique to it. The environment, particularly at night, is beautiful on any settings or rig.

Now, I say realism because this game does take place on an alien planet, so the flora and fauna aren't technically real animals and plants, but this game will have you believing that they are. The animators are INCREDIBLE! The entire development team really is.\n\nThey are still in the process of developing the game, and they make a point of communicating with us (the players), in so many ways. They have a chat room on Discord where you can IM with devs on a virtually daily basis, they have multiple boards on Trello where you can leave cards for them to see, and there's an in-game bug report system as well. They're very responsive to community comments and suggestions. You really feel like you're part of the creation of this incredible game. They update it in small ways on a daily basis (I download at least two small patches a day).\n\nAt the moment, the game is sort of an open world where you go around and scavenge for resources, use them to craft futuristic technology, and advance up the tech tree to more and more capable vehicles and gear. These upgrades allow you to explore deeper and further from your home base. There are so many different environments in Subnautica, and upgrading your tech allows you to explore them all. There's a multitude of gorgeous bioluminescent plants, titanic creatures, as well as cute little ones that it's fun to swim with. The game will eventually incorporate a story component as well, so it's exciting to see that unfold piece by piece.\n\nYou start off operating out of a little life pod, but as you gather resources you're able to construct elaborate (beautiful) bases underwater (and you can build as many of them as you want). The views are spectacular out the windows, and there's so many ways to power your base, farm your own food, and basically become self-sufficient. You can even collect your favorite plants and animals from throughout the world and bring them home with you. Fish can live in aquariums within your base, and planters can be placed in which you can grow your favorite plants. This allows for a lot of customization of the aesthetics of your base.\n\nIt's impossible not to get immersed in this game. On multiple occasions I've found myself diving deep in the ocean and literally screaming at the top of my lungs (and probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off my in-laws in the middle of the night) when I unexpectedly run into one of the terrifying leviathins that lurk in the deep. My heart races and my hands shake. It's fantastic.\n\nThere's even more exciting tech and creatures on the way, and I personally am thrilled to be along for the ride. I'm still shocked this game was only $20. I've seen way worse games selling for $40+.\n\nSo, in conclusion I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game. Probably the best $20 I've ever spent. This game offers HOURS of play (I've currently got over 300 logged...I clearly don't have a problem...), and I've found it to have high replay value as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ice/recommended/264710/","Ice","Ice_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ice/","332 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSubnautica is a new take on the "survival exploration" genre. While the game is focused entirely under water, there's also a little bit of land to explore, mainly a small island so far.\nThe seabed contains different biomes which serves as a home for certain creatures and not all of them are friendly, in fact, a streak of brownish color in your underwear is guaranteed when getting jumped by a colossal sea creature out of nowhere.\n\nWhile the big unknown has a lot to offer, you'll need to build your own base at some point to serve as a sanctuary/production facility and storage area. The base building is surprisingly simple and has decent variety and more building options will be available in the future. The game also have a realistic "flooding" feature which basically means that if your base for some reason can't withstand the pressure or if some creature has damaged it (or maybe you're a fool and drove into it with your submarine), compartments will start to flood in a realistic way rendering the base almost completely useless until you've fixed the leaking problem.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the sounds are great, the theme of music is well suited and if you combine all of this you'll get a game with great atmosphere with a lot of depth (depth, get it? huehue).\nThe game is currently in alpha but it feels like a beta. It's very polished and already have a lot of content - and more content is being added with each ~monthly patch which makes you want to completely start over after each big content patch.\n\nMultiplayer has been discussed and a lot of players express their wish of having a co-op experience in this game (which would be awesome). This game is primarily focused on being a singleplayer experience so there are no plans on supporting multiplayer at launch - however, this is something that they are interested in adding after the initial launch!\n\nThe only cons with the game in my opinion is the inventory system which could use some UI work and the inventory is a bit too small. The small inventory is however compensated with an upgrade module for one of your exploration vehicles where you can temporarily store items - I still wish you could carry more yourself though.\n\nDo I recommend this game, is it worth the current price? Yes! Buy it already.","November 26, 2015","true","28.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I like a lot of games, but this is the first one I've felt the desire to write a review for. Hardly even know where to start! The videos and images are pretty self explanatory. It is an underwater survival, building, exploring game, all set on an alien planet. I'll get my one negative point out the way first. At this stage of development, there is no real story, or objective (besides not dying.) The problem is that once you finish building everything you want, there isn't much to do. Sure, you can explore around and see cool stuff, but the feeling of accomplishment diminishes. That being said however, the building and scavanging before that point is amazing! I usually delete my saves and start over with every new update released. That part doesn't get old. Even though I've done it all before, it is a blast!

Despite what some people may say, coming from me, who is a very critical person with games, this game is really good. The developers care about their game, update it atleast once a month, and in general I really have faith in this game. After playing for about 13 hours I was only about a quarter into this game. meaning that, yes, this game will literally take about 52 hours to explore/do everything. In summary, you wake up after crash landing desperately on a mysterious alien planet. You look around and just see a never ending ocean all around you and a gigantic crashed space ship that you could only assume you used to be in before you popped out of it with your pod.\n\nGraphics: 7.6/10 (Not amazing, but still a REALLY fun game)\nUI: 7.9/10 (Pretty simplistic, but nice)\nAnimations: 6/10 (Most animations are good, except for the falling)\nMultiplayer: 0/10 (Not implemented)\nSingleplayer: 10/10 (Works great as a singleplayer game)\nCrafting: 10/10 (Simple, yet intuitive)\nContent Amount: 10/10 (Lots of content)\nCommunity: 8/10 (Not a very big community, mainly because no multiplayer)\nAI: 8.4/10 (Very well done, but sometimes glitches out)\nBase Building: 9.8/10 (Very easy to understand, and doesn't take many resources)\n\nOverall Rating: 8.6/10\n\nThe reason I gave it this rating is because yes, the game is very well done, but the thing is that it doesn't have multiplayer, and is still in Early Access. I will probably do a revisit of this game once it's released (Hopefully it does release!) I do hope they also add multiplayer or else this game won't ever really have that big of a community.\n\nHow many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are?

Then you go deeper and things flip. Water Minecraft basically with some islands. But it is very visually pretty even on low settings. Day and night cycles are such a transitional flip as well. You think things look beautiful during daytime, well during night everything lights up (dependent on depth). The game takes some things from earth but puts it's own originality on the creatures in this world.\nGame is in early stages of early access so there are crashes, saving every so often is a must. There are the bugs and glitches but they can be forgiven as Unknown Worlds Entertainment is very vocal in the forums along with their road maps on their main website. Almost everything in the development is placed up for all to see and watch as they progress forward to a final release product. There are few early access game developers that do this, so this game is already looking bright. Aqua Nox style with minecraft (minus blocks) tossed in make this one to dive into.\n\n3/21/15 Currently you can play for a few hours and build everything. A couple hours of exploring will net you everything to see as well. However the developers have a ton of things they are trying to get into the game so it is no where near content complete.

The presentation is so tight, I'm left with the impression that the only thing missing is human.  The landscapes sprawl out and meld together seamlessly; their only barriers are the dazzling light effects that dance down from the surface and surrounding fauna.\n\nAt night, the world takes on such a different appearance that it requires another layer of exploration. The wildlife lays dormant and ripe for hunting.  At daybreak, you gather resources in the midst of schooling life and continue to devise a game plan.\n\nSubnautica is different; it doesn't feel like a job.  Instead, it feels like an expedition where the only stress is how small your starting locker is.","February 22","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's a lot going for this game - graphics are decent, the underwater setting is intriguing, initial survival is fraught with danger, and crafting/designing bases is fun.\n\nHowever! my character had "maxed out" equipment and seen all there is to do within 8 hours or so. I am flush with resources, crafted everything I can, explored the entire area, and no fish in the ocean can harm me. There needs to be MORE - more story, more craftibles, more to explore, more danger for endgame characters, more goals. It's a promising start, but it has a long way to go before it's complete.","February 6","true","66.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You hear sounds and you know that something is lurking in the deep dark... but what?\nYou can build your own deepsea station... how deep can you go?\nWhat kind of goodies will you find, once you reach the sea-bed at 600m depth. Might as well built a temporary station there, just to explore and then move on again. Of course, you will need a submarine for this. Don't forget to save the game, once you've made it. Just in case you crash it or it implodes under the waterpressure. Build some weapons.\nDid you find the island already? Or did I dream that?\n\nAll in all, for an early access game, it is really well made (with a few bugs here and there).\nIt is very addictive, because there does not seem to be an end to the exploration (and they seem to add new parts with the updates). There's new materials to be found and the old materials get exhausted, so you will have to move about (and built new stations).\nIt is not like you have to go and gather things the whole time. There's plenty of time to roam around and it's pretty easy to built a station somewhere. It seems like they found a good balance.\n\nMy favorite game for the moment!","July 13, 2015","true","35.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The presentation is so tight, I'm left with the impression that the only thing missing is human.  The landscapes sprawl out and meld together seamlessly; their only barriers are the dazzling light effects that dance down from the surface and surrounding fauna.\n\nAt night, the world takes on such a different appearance that it requires another layer of exploration. The wildlife lays dormant and ripe for hunting.  At daybreak, you gather resources in the midst of schooling life and continue to devise a game plan.\n\nSubnautica is different; it doesn't feel like a job.  Instead, it feels like an expedition where the only stress is how small your starting locker is.","February 22","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One of the best, if not the best, game I've ever played! The music is amazing. The layers to the gameplay are diverse. The colors and graphics are unreal. From the moment you're placed inside your small ship out in the vastness of the ocean you immediately feel a sense of urgency to get something together to protect yourself and survive. This game is why I've become a youtuber.

The presentation is so tight, I'm left with the impression that the only thing missing is human.  The landscapes sprawl out and meld together seamlessly; their only barriers are the dazzling light effects that dance down from the surface and surrounding fauna.\n\nAt night, the world takes on such a different appearance that it requires another layer of exploration. The wildlife lays dormant and ripe for hunting.  At daybreak, you gather resources in the midst of schooling life and continue to devise a game plan.\n\nSubnautica is different; it doesn't feel like a job.  Instead, it feels like an expedition where the only stress is how small your starting locker is.","February 22","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like how the Cyclops will tilt when you rise or sink into an object or is hit with enough force, aswell as the customizeblity of both subs with colors, names, upgrades, and in the cyclops furnature the lighting and graphics are great for what hardware is needed.

Something about being underwater and vulnerable from all sides with foggy shapes off in the dimly lit depths that really gets under my skin - and probably yours as well.  As they keep adding in new kinds of threats to the player in the undersea world I hope that paranoia mounts *just enough* so that I never feel completely safe when I go to the edge of the shallows.\n\nAs for the whole game: Overall it has a huge amount of potential long-term. It's already got a lot of attractive stuff about it right now.  Building structures is good. Underwater combat works pretty well.  The creature AI while unfinished shows potential for emergent behavior that makes the game more interesting.\n\nAlso this game is very pretty, and getting prettier with each update - particularly after they gave a huge overhaul to water surface.\n\nThe game is single-player presently, with the *hope* according to the devs of eventually making it multiplayer.\n\nPersonally I am looking forward to whenever they put multiplayer in the game.  Wanna make sealab cities and coop against raid boss tier massive sea monsters.\n\nI would say 'consider buying this now if it interests you enough from videos you see of people playing it.'

It's an underwater exploration game with a semi-survival aspect. I say "semi-survival" because it gives you the feeling of being more of an explorer or scientist rather than your classic survivalist. This game has a great art style and is quite original being that there are not many underwater exploration games. The developers are also very reliable . Unknown Worlds had previously worked on Natural Selection 2 from the beginning to the end of development eventually giving it to community developers after work on Subnautica had started. Allowing me to asure that they are actually dedicated to their work and arn't out for a money grab just to abandon the game later on as so many other games have fallen victim towards. For all you people who fear the open/deep sea, this is the game for you! From starting out on a nice, shallow, sandbar to exploring depths of over 2000m deep, you can see all that the dark, depths of the ocean have to offer! Atleast... when it comes closer to the end of development. Although it's a beautiful game, there really isn't much to do but explore. So unless you feel like wanting to support this game early on to speed up the development, don't expect a bunch of stuff right away.

It is actually good fun already and showing promise being a unique idea with excellent execution. I have to admit though, for a lack of a save function (will be implemented early 2015) I haven't even touched the survival mode yet. I only played freeroam so far and after crafting everything there is to craft I use cheats every time I start a game (no oxygen restriction, no damage, fins and a seamoth is all I need :). I just love exploring and roaming the underwaterscape! For a game this early in development there is already a crapload to discover.\n\nSecondly, there is the devs themselves. If you ever wanted the chance to see the full potential of EA being actually taken advantage of and to good effect, giving the players the tools to have insight in the goings-on  of game development and give feedback that is taken into account, don't let this opportunity pass. The devs are very active on the official as well as on the steam forums and there are multiple daily updates of their Trello-page. Content is added at a rate that I would just call mindblowing (been playing since Earliest Access a few months ago) and at stunning quality. Bugs are present, but nothing game-breaking so far.\n\nI'm convinced the game will be finished within the next few years and receive great after-launch support (the latter was the case with the devs last game). It is a great concept with a very able and enthusiastic team behind it that shows some of the best community-interaction I have ever seen.","December 21, 2014","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Unknown Worlds developers were pretty much active during this period, and although the progress does not seem very fast, but the game is already worth investing to encourage further work.\nHowever, I must note several really serious points:\n- The current food/water system is pretty tedious. Fish around the player's base depletes ridiculously fast, forcing the player move further each day just for the sake of getting food and water. Okay, but that's already done by all the other resources - they are not really plentiful, thus we have to constantly move around searching for them, and doing the same for food seems just overkill.\n- The current state of the seabase building is rather rudimentary - as soon as you construct the Cyclops, the seabase gets pretty much obsolete. The seabase definitely needs a way to create food - something like a fish tank, and a seaweed farm.\n- The water filtration machine is brilliant, but definitely needs an external inventory - it's fine if it will be craftable and you'll have to search for the blueprint, but as it is now the machine pretty much useless, as it can accumulate only one bottle of water.\n- Cyclops really lacks some functionality. Taking into account the technological development of Aurora, it just must have some mapping capabilities - even if will just store the sonar scanning data from the Seamoth, making it possible to review it; also it absolutely must have some navigation (actually even Seamoth should have it), maybe it should triangulate it's position from the beacons placed by the player, but this feature is really missing. Also, why Seamoth can be upgraded with a solar panel, but Cyclops can only work off power cells?\n- In its current state the game really lacks a story and some long-term goals. Otherwise it takes at most 10-20 hours (even without checking with the online wiki and maps) to get most of the map explored and run into nothing else to do.\n\nSo, even putting aside the "early access" words, after almost 2 years of development we have a stunningly beautiful underwater exploration game with a very good map, rather solid game mechanics, absolutely no story,  and nothing for the player to do after a very short time. Calling it a "sandbox" is way too much, as the gameplay is too much focused on exploring, throwing everything else overboard - thus, after exploring all of the map (which is pretty small actually), the players stays wishing for further updates, which will hopefully bring much, much more.","January 9","true","34.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I`m really looking forward to the next patch and the delights it will bring.

The last unterwater experience I enjoyed goes back to Aquanox (the first and better part). Of course, Subnautica is far away from a Aquanox like gameplay, but I'd like to compare the environmental aspects.\n\nIn terms of emersion, Subnautica is yet both genius and genuine. A subnautical world with its own flora and fauna so emersive that you want to stay in the game for hours, even when it's not finished yet.\n\nThe only questionable fear I have about Subnautica is, that when it is done, you're also done with it. And with 'done' I mean that you simply have enough from the subnautical environment. There are many possibilities for crafting and hunting and so on of course. But let's face it, it is a very limited environment to play in. At least this is what I personally think. But as always I'm quite curious to see what the developers will put into the game and how they are going to enhance the experience.\n\nAt this point I recommend this game very much. Not only because of Subnauticas unique gameplay and environment, but for the great love and patience the developers put into it.\n\nFor those who face a phobia about underwater / divings - don't use it with VR :-P","December 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Things will break, a lot). You can even see what commits/code changes they make in real time on their site if you so please, see the (anonymised) bug reports and if (when) you encounter a bug, you can submit it in-game with a nice graphical user interface that can add both your exact location in the game, a screenshot, some text, and your e-mail if you want them to be able to contact you about specifics. Every game should take a hint from this.\n\n\nAs every EA game it has bugs (pun intended. EA, gettit?), but in the normal branch it is actually surprisingly stable. I have only had one crash in ~6 hours play-time and it was while using experimental graphic settings. The bugs range from small stuff in the normal branch to the occasional huge game breaking bugs in the experimental branch.\n\n\nIf you stick to the start area it almost feels like a real non-EA game for quite a while. Really pretty and polished compared to many full Indie games (heck, even some AAA titles don't do underwater as good as this). You can play it as a survival game, with the need to find food etc., or you can play it as a sandbox and just explore. Both are fun, though the food stuff isn't quite advanced enough yet to be fun for long and outside the starter area it gets strange-looking and empty-ish quite fast. There's also a hardcore mode with permadeath if you have a death wish.\n\nIf you like supporting early access and see the game grow, this is in my opinion one of the best ways to experience that. If you just want to play, well it is quite fun too!\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However after seeing the developers, I decided to give it a chance. So far, I am blown away.\n\nThe developers are completely transparent in everything dealing with development. You can follow every step and see everything they fix and update. You can view the bugs people have been mentioning and see how it affects the game first hand. If every early access did something like this team is doing with Trello, I can only imagine how much more positively the community might react to Early Access games.\n\nWhile it is true that so far there isn't much to do in the game, I can clearly see where they plan on adding more material and it's extremely exciting to see where this game could head.

I had a problem which the community tried to help me fix and was soon fixed by the developing team. Thanks for the support. Overall the game is amazing - concept, gameplay, mechanics. Can't wait for the xbox edition. Only one problem is a tiny bit of fps lag at random points but that is probably because of my 4gb ram. One suggestion is that perhaps you can optomomize the vehicles because my fps drops quite a lot while driving them. Also could you try and let us save our f3 menu options?

I have to say I had my doubts, especially since I've sworn off Early Access games, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how developed this game is thus far.\n\nSure, there are some bugs, a long initial load, it's definitely framey in some areas, and there isn't really a story, but if it weren't for these few aspects, it would be difficult to even tell that it's in alpha.  ALPHA.  Even if they did nothing else to it (and there's a lot planned), I still got my money's worth out of this little gem.\n\nMy play time reflects learning the game and getting all the fragment (blueprints), not even exploring every nook and cranny the alien ocean has to offer.  If I hadn't used the wiki for a lot of things, I'd wager my playtime would be upwards of 50 hours.  How many FINISHED games can you say that for these days?  You can even give feedback and report bugs from within the game.  Updates appear to be roughly monthly at this time.","January 3","true","60.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, as of December 2015, there is certainly enough content here to warrant purchasing the game on sale, and unless you REALLY hate the core gameplay mechanics (watch some Youtube videos to get a feel for the game if you must), you can get a solid first playthrough of at least 10 hours with the content that is currently available. The game is gorgeous, plays very well, and is impressively stable (I've yet to see any game-breaking bugs or crashes). I don't normally recommend Early Access games because I don't believe that buying games based on a developer's promise that they will someday be playable and fun is a great thing for consumers to be doing in an industry where a lot of games come out of beta playing like total garbage, but Subnautica is different. I make the exception to my EA rule for this game because right at this VERY moment, Subnautica has enough content to fully warrant a price of <$10, and even if the devs never updated it again, I wouldn't regret my purchase. That said, the developers have a fantastic track record and HAVE consistently updated the game with meaningful content for the last year, so I have no hesitation recommending the game to anybody that's interested in survival games and/or doing battle with giant fish armed with only a knife.\n\nIt's a good time.","December 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Oh god! Or at least that’s what I thought before playing it; in one word I would say the graphics are Brilliant! I really found myself lost in the not only the sheer beauty of the game, but the submersion is like few others I have run across- I really feel as if I’m in the world and to me that’s something I always count as a major deciding factor in first person shooters/survival games. The only complaint I have is the game has a very weak story line, I often wonder if there’s a grand design or point for the game’s grand final; is it going to be quest oriented like the fallout or elder scrolls somehow? Are you going to be able to play with others online? (that would be a beautiful thing), or is it just going to be open world, defend yourself against underwater animals while trying not to starve, drown, or finally just die of boredom. I mean the graphics are truly fantastic, and the game play is out of this world, but it lacks the feel of accomplishment outside of crafting equipment, building an underwater base (which at this point in the game’s construction is still very limited in content). Granted I’ve only played the game a total of 20+ hours and it’s still very much in development, but I would really like to see something to enhance the storyline and add substance to character development.\nThank you for reading!\n","August 6, 2015","true","38.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Others may not have the same experience, but as someone with a paralyzing fear of the deep ocean, I can barely even play for too long at a time before my nerves start to get to me- at the very least I have to retreat to the safety of my base. I love it, though- the crafting is simple, logical and provides enough tools to do pretty much everything you'll need to explore deeper in the ocean. There is one exception and that's weaponry- offensive options are fairly limited in Subnautica as an intentional design choice and I think it works well. Something would feel kind of wrong in this game about going around mowing everything down with automatic weaponry. It is a bit rough around the edges here and there, as expected for an early access title, but the developers are transparent and regularly release new updates, as well as allowing the option to play daily experimental releases.

It is a game that is simplistic in doing what needs to be done crafting wise, but also enough of a challenge to make all the gathering of ingredients worth it. It also has adjustable difficulty levels which can add in hunger/thirst, or just have hp to worry about which can come in handy for new people to the game.\n\nThe ocean has some of the most beautiful sights to see which begs you to keep searching through to new depths, and rewards you with upgrades obtained by scanning or new types of minerals to use in crafting. The creatures also make all of these environments come alive, but also be pretty terrifying at times too with some areas having giant monsters out to get you!

Your goal is to survive, build and explore the world. An exciting and fun underwater survival game.\nThe game is very easy to learn, easy and comfortable interface and you really need to spend time with building your equipment as you will sometimes use up to half an hour searching for one material, this is a good thing as I get really bored of games where there is too many items too easy to craft.\n\nI hate being in deep water not knowing whats out there, and even then I adore this game. The only thing I want from this game now is Co-op, then it would be perfect in my opinion.\n\nModes It has 4 different modes in game:\nFreedom: Where you dont need to worry about food/water or energy loss\nSurvival: You need to eat and drink to stay alive, and energy is needed to use machines.\nHardcore: Same as Survival, but with Permadeath and no low oxygen warnings.\nCreative: You are invincible and can do whatever you want with no need for resources.\n\nThe game also has cheat codes and a bug report system.\nIt is an amazing early access game that needs your attention.\n\nConclusion I love this game, and even if I have to start a new game when an update is realeased ill happily do so. after some hours of playing you may think you have seen it all, but trust me I am still seeing new stuff as I go deeper into the depths.

However, it was not long before I realized the situation was more dire than I could have ever imagined: They could read my thoughts, my dreams and hopes, my deepest, darkest desires... And they used that information to make a game they KNEW I wouldn't be able to resist playing.\n\nSubnautica is, in short, AMAZING. Both strikingly beautiful and challenging, even in its Early Access state, its completely playable and play you will. I admit, I have not been a fan of crafting / survival games, having avoided most opportunities (such as MineCraft and DayZ) but Subnautica delivered the concept in a package that seemed perfect for me to finally dip my toes in the water.\n\nYou'll find yourself forgetting to breathe due to the wonderfully realized environments and the creative and gorgeous flora & fauna design. While alien in design, they still feel familiar without being derivative. I can not wait to see what new lifeforms and environments Unknown Worlds comes up with next!\n\nBeing an underwater survival / crafting game, one may be worried about the controls in this aquatic world. Do not fret, the controls are VERY intuitive and responsive. Swimming through the water is a breeze, whether it's just you or your crafted submersibles.\n\nWhile there is not too much to craft yet, the system is still robust enough to keep you occupied, as you'll want to push further into the depths to discover what lies beneath. However, be careful as there are not really any weapons, per say (other than some different knives)! The world is as dangerous as it is beautiful.\n\nSubnautica is basically the game I've always wanted, but never realized that I did. Unknown Worlds has, on their hands, what I think may be one of the most fun experiences I've ever had the opportunity to play, and I can not wait to see what they come up with next for the breathtaking world of Subnautica. Thank you, Unknown Worlds, for making this game (and for not actually reading my secret diary).\n\nPros:\n----------\n- Gorgeous, breath-taking environments\n- A day cycle that is calming and playful in aesthetic\n- A night cycle that is absolutely stunning due to the crazy amounts of bio-luminescent lifeforms\n- Creative and fun creature and plant design\n- Smooth, intuitive controls\n- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system\n- It's all about underwater survival -- No land lubbers here\n- Observation decks for my base -- nearly 360 degree views of the ocean around me\n- That reminds me: You can build an amazingly intricate underwater base!\n- Regular updates from a dev. team that is passionate about their project\n- From what I can see, a very responsive development team that responds to the community regularly\n\nCons:\n----------\n- Some creature / plant / environment interactions seem a bit limited at this point\n- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system\n- I have to wait for more content (but it will be worth every minute)\n\nFavorite moment (so far): Took my Seamoth submersible out into the deep ocean, beyond the Kelp Forest, and saw a lifeform in the distance. As I moved in closer, I realized it was MASSIVE and looked like a giant alien squid. Not knowing if it was hostile or friendly, I got scared and quickly booked it back to my base at the edge of the  Safe Shallows.","August 23, 2015","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Subnautica has that wonderous sense of exploration that most artsy games try but fail to reach.  The ocean is vast, mysterious and terrifying.  Minecraft is a poor comparison.  You CAN build structures and alter terrain in Subnautica but that is 2'nd fiddle to the heart of the game which is exploration.\n\nThere is tremendous joy in broadening your horizens from the shirt on your starving back in a cramped, floating life pod to your first tools and equipment, to your first undersea base, to your first submersible, to the gigantic Cyclops submarine that your submersible docks into.  Seriously, that Cyclops sub is BIG.  Finally constructing the beast and seeing it drop into the water before you is like opening the pearly gates.  The choir starts when you climb inside to discover you can actually build all your base amenities INSIDE the sub itself.\n\nGoogle up: "jacksepticeye maria", (You can name your sub, name goes the side and everything, he named his Maria) click the first youtube result and jump to the 9 minute mark.  The joy on that guy's face is no exageration.\n\nAll in all, feels maybe half done at the moment but what it does have is surprisingly well polished.  Hint to beginers: You can push your life pod around; like outside the radiation zone when your crashed colony ship blows the hell up.  The wikis are well filled already but definitely avoid unneccessary spoilers, totally worth it.  You will definitely need to look up some basic raw materials info the game names but does not explain/identify yet.\n\nNo regrets.

Beautiful, fun, and has developers that are active in the community with at least 1-2 decent or major updates monthly. There's a pretty good amount of buildings and blueprints to build things so far, especially if you use the developer code (cheats) so that you don't need to spend hours farming resources. I've spent 90% of this game using cheats and I've still managed to enjoy almost 50 hours of the game. The only negatives I've had so far are that the game is still in early access, so occasionally a reaper will spawn very close to you if you are in a few specific biomes, and that the game is very time consuming to find resources if you don't use cheats (Plus resources and fish don't respawn without cheats).\nGreat game, worth at least $30 in my opinion even though its priced less.","April 22","true","57.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He is the only survivor and the spacecraft, the Aurora, soon goes nuclear and turns a disproportionately small amount of the planet radioactive.\n\nNot to worry, because his escape pod is filled with just enough space age equipment to eat fish and yes, this guy is you. The goal of the game is to survive long enough to explore the planet.\n\nAs a survival sandbox game, it will probably be compared to Minecraft quite a lot. It's a completely unrelated game, let's get that out of the way. There's very little in the way of building, mostly exploring.\n\nIt's a very pretty game. The cartoonish art style is reminiscent of No Man's Sky and it has the most fantastic creatures. It can be unforgivingly hard at times, though, to actually maintain a seabase as it can actually leak. You will not be killing very much in the early game, as the most you'll have at that point is a small knife. Late game, you'll have a submarine, torpedoes, a freeze-gun, but you still won't be killing very much. It's mostly about going "ooh" and "aah" and the amazing looking game, which actually looks kind of awful on lower-end machines. You need a fairly decent computer for it to look really impressive.\n\nThe developers are fairly reliable and it's a game about admiring everything instead of killing everything (though I imagine it would be fun to watch people try to, as most big fish will kill you) so I definitely recommend it.\n\n","January 27","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I see you are checking out Subnautica reviews! Well I hope this review will be helpful in some form or fashion.\n\nAs I am sure you are aware from the Subnautica store page, this is a survival type game based in the ocean. What you may not be aware of (and the reason you are probably looking at reviews) is that this game is awesome! The devs are extremely active and posting new updates to the Experimental branch of the game seemingly daily.\n\nAlso, for an early access game, it feels quite polished already, the graphics are beautiful, sound track is awesome, and the crafting system is fairly robust I would say. I also like that the way you get more advanced equipment and structures is by scanning fragments, which forces you to explore the ocean :-)\n\nSomething else I would like to mention is the different biomes they have setup, so many awesome and wonderful things to see on the ocean floor, just watch out for some of the things that tend to live in the deep ;-)\n\nDefinitely a game I would buy again if I didn't already have it! If you guys want to see some gameplay, I have a Let's Play series on YouTube and there are many others as well.","February 6","true","33.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, as of December 2015, there is certainly enough content here to warrant purchasing the game on sale, and unless you REALLY hate the core gameplay mechanics (watch some Youtube videos to get a feel for the game if you must), you can get a solid first playthrough of at least 10 hours with the content that is currently available. The game is gorgeous, plays very well, and is impressively stable (I've yet to see any game-breaking bugs or crashes). I don't normally recommend Early Access games because I don't believe that buying games based on a developer's promise that they will someday be playable and fun is a great thing for consumers to be doing in an industry where a lot of games come out of beta playing like total garbage, but Subnautica is different. I make the exception to my EA rule for this game because right at this VERY moment, Subnautica has enough content to fully warrant a price of <$10, and even if the devs never updated it again, I wouldn't regret my purchase. That said, the developers have a fantastic track record and HAVE consistently updated the game with meaningful content for the last year, so I have no hesitation recommending the game to anybody that's interested in survival games and/or doing battle with giant fish armed with only a knife.\n\nIt's a good time.","December 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So I figured: Why not? The Ocean has always been compared to space, and much of the traits are similar. (Managing oxygen, building establishments to reach farther and farther out into the abyss, the feeling of weightlessness, etc. etc.) What I got was an absolutely beautiful and terrifying experience. The game starts you off in a life pod that holds a "Fabricator," Which is your key to survival. Using that and the availiable underwater resources, you begin your adventure by building supplies and tools to help you survive. You can build various tools, equipment, vehicles and upgrades that all hold their own unique purpose.\n\nNo game has even come close to achieving this level of atmosphere and immersion. Nothing compared to me harvesting creepvine while the stalkers were away. To exploring a dark cave with my Seaglide, managing my oxygen so I'd have enough time to get back to the pipes I had laid before. To heading out to the crashed Aurora in my Seamoth, crossing an impossibly deep chasm and hearing the Reaper's terrifying scream from the abyss. To the wild panic I felt when it grabbed me, with me desperately slamming the Electric deterrent I had installed on it previously to try and get it off. And to think that it's not even the biggest creature to be in the game.\n\nTHIS is immersion.\nReal terror, real joy, real wonder and Awe. I highly reccomend this to anyone that's a fan of deep sea (Or deep space) exploration, crafting, and adventure. I can't wait for the official release, and you can bet I'd pay twice as much for the same experience.

There are multiple bioms with many odd creatures in them, with much more on the way it seems. Check their Trello to see what the devs are working on\n(https://trello.com/b/yxoJrFgP/subnautica).\n\nCurrently, as of 3/21/15, you can do just about everything in the game in an hour or less, if you're fast enough, but dispite that, I've already enjoyed almost 24hrs of this game. I do recommend this game to anyone who like survival/open world exploration games. The art style kinda feels like that of the Windwaker, and I really enjoy the handcrafted enviroments. The world is huge, and yes, handcrafted. You can really feel the love put into every corner of the map, and it's far from done.\n\nStill in early access but what is in game is very polished and enjoyable.

But it's hard to care when your attention is focused on the beautifully-modelled fish flora and fauna. For an early access game, the graphics are stunning, and not only that, the music is great too. Each underwater biome has its own unique soundtrack, and that, coupled with the varied terrain, can be really distracting, and often leads me off-task.

The prospect of underwater survival was just too mouthwatering to resist, and having been obsessed with submarines from a young age, could not turn down the offer. I'll also do my best to review this without spoiling the game, because it's the mystery that makes it fun.\n\nSubnautica is beautiful in every aspect. The visuals, the variety of biomes, flora and fauna, and the sound effects are spine tingling. The ingredients of the game allow for exploration, hardcore survival and a huge element of creativity. From prepping deep sea dives, to creating lavish sea bases, it's all there.\n\nWhat's more - it's horrifying. Once you go beyond the familiar start-of-game biome, you'll discover there are more things out there to kill you. You go from apex predator to bottom-of-the-chain prey in split seconds. But you'll only ever find out once you get too close, and by then it's too late. It's a quick learning curve. Bone chilling growl? Teeth? NOPE.\n\nIn a way it's like Minecraft, meets Depth, meets Silent Hunter. You have the harvesting of resources like Minecraft, the fear of predators like Depth, and the claustrophobia of Silent Hunter. Maybe throw in a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent too.","September 8, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has to be (in my opinion at least) one of the best early access games out there. Even without further content additions there are hours upon hours of game time with beautiful graphics and is well worth the price tag as it stands right now.\n\nThe survival element is real in this game since many items don't respawn/don't respawn often forcing you to venture more in a quest to further progress on crafting or building as well as the fun task of searching for blueprints. Plus certain sea life that want to take a bite out of you.\n\nThere are different game styles depending on whether you want a relaxing near sandbox game on creative, no worry of drinking or eating on freedom, standard survival on..well, survival and the really challenging hardcore mode where death means death and starting all over again.\n\nThere are admittedly a few bugs still lurking in this game but it's easy to tell how the developers take them seriously with the many updates in fixing those found which brings me to another point, the developers are very active and put out content updates and fixes often, another reason I see this as one of the best early access games around right now.\n\nHighly recommend this game.","March 12","true","49.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That makes me play a lot less as I don't like to start from scratch every month or two.\nResource gathering is a bit tiresome because it always takes one to six slots of your inventory. Same type resources do not stack into one slot, so you're fairly quickly forced to return to your base. You also need a lot of storage to store everything you have. However, once you get a cyclops submarine and place some storage cases on it it's a lot easier.\nOne thing i'd really want to see in this game is some threat to your base. Once it is build it can only be damaged / destroyed by you. If there was for example some nighttime life form that could damage it (just a little is enough, make it flood) it would be a lot more interesting.\nYou're probably going to need a decent pc for this game. I had to replace mine to run smoothly (was quite outdated tho). As it is early access game performance is expected to improve.\nI rate the game in the current state 7.5/10. Every update adds a lot of awesome stuff and i'm really excited to see all the content that is to come.","September 6, 2015","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The prospect of underwater survival was just too mouthwatering to resist, and having been obsessed with submarines from a young age, could not turn down the offer. I'll also do my best to review this without spoiling the game, because it's the mystery that makes it fun.\n\nSubnautica is beautiful in every aspect. The visuals, the variety of biomes, flora and fauna, and the sound effects are spine tingling. The ingredients of the game allow for exploration, hardcore survival and a huge element of creativity. From prepping deep sea dives, to creating lavish sea bases, it's all there.\n\nWhat's more - it's horrifying. Once you go beyond the familiar start-of-game biome, you'll discover there are more things out there to kill you. You go from apex predator to bottom-of-the-chain prey in split seconds. But you'll only ever find out once you get too close, and by then it's too late. It's a quick learning curve. Bone chilling growl? Teeth? NOPE.\n\nIn a way it's like Minecraft, meets Depth, meets Silent Hunter. You have the harvesting of resources like Minecraft, the fear of predators like Depth, and the claustrophobia of Silent Hunter. Maybe throw in a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent too.","September 8, 2015","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He is the only survivor and the spacecraft, the Aurora, soon goes nuclear and turns a disproportionately small amount of the planet radioactive.\n\nNot to worry, because his escape pod is filled with just enough space age equipment to eat fish and yes, this guy is you. The goal of the game is to survive long enough to explore the planet.\n\nAs a survival sandbox game, it will probably be compared to Minecraft quite a lot. It's a completely unrelated game, let's get that out of the way. There's very little in the way of building, mostly exploring.\n\nIt's a very pretty game. The cartoonish art style is reminiscent of No Man's Sky and it has the most fantastic creatures. It can be unforgivingly hard at times, though, to actually maintain a seabase as it can actually leak. You will not be killing very much in the early game, as the most you'll have at that point is a small knife. Late game, you'll have a submarine, torpedoes, a freeze-gun, but you still won't be killing very much. It's mostly about going "ooh" and "aah" and the amazing looking game, which actually looks kind of awful on lower-end machines. You need a fairly decent computer for it to look really impressive.\n\nThe developers are fairly reliable and it's a game about admiring everything instead of killing everything (though I imagine it would be fun to watch people try to, as most big fish will kill you) so I definitely recommend it.\n\n","January 27","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a game that is simplistic in doing what needs to be done crafting wise, but also enough of a challenge to make all the gathering of ingredients worth it. It also has adjustable difficulty levels which can add in hunger/thirst, or just have hp to worry about which can come in handy for new people to the game.\n\nThe ocean has some of the most beautiful sights to see which begs you to keep searching through to new depths, and rewards you with upgrades obtained by scanning or new types of minerals to use in crafting. The creatures also make all of these environments come alive, but also be pretty terrifying at times too with some areas having giant monsters out to get you! Also for a early access game I have only had 2 major glitches which I was able to fix by quitting and reloading the save.\n\nAll in all I 100% reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world exploration games or love bioshock!\nPS This game takes its toll on your graphics so if your computer isn't up to scratch try lower graphics","April 3","true","39.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it's an early access game so that's expected. Overral however, it's simply a great game, definitely give it a shot :)\nGameplay 8/10\nGraphics 9/10\nOverral feel/fun factor 10/10","August 2, 2015","true","48.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This first thought was from the early access sticker being slabbed on. After I downloaded and played this game for three hours I came to this conclusion. This is one of the best early access games I have played in a while. When it comes to this game you should get this. The only issue with the game is graphics and no multiplayer. Other than that I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves survival games. I give it a 9/10 due to it needing a multiplayer update.

Subnautica is a survival style adventure game with some really unique features and what I'd definitely consider a unique setting. In an oceanic environment, the flora and fauna are stunning and, for an early access, rather varied. The updates have absolutely, drastically changed the feel of the game and the way that it flows in recent weeks.\n\nSome honest points to make:\nThe crafting system is fluid, but slightly scattered. My game bugged and an entire set of collectibles was absent, and I had to console command to retrieve the item. There are entire areas of unassigned landscape - you can't escape the early access part of it. At this point, there's little to do but explore, build your base, and farm for materials, but the story is shaping up to be an interesting one. I fully intend to keep playing and endorse the full release.","March 25","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because fear has dominated my experience with this game and I absolutely love it.\n\nIt must be said early on that this game suffers from performance and framerate issues.  It's early access, so it's forgiveable and will be fixed someday, but you MUST understand that buying this game now will definitely get you a product that does not perform as you hope it will. Buyer be advised.\n\nBeyond the performance issues this game is outstanding and only continues to improve itself.  The ocean is as vast and vibrant as you would hope.  It teams with different types of life many of which are not unlike our own underwater horrors.  The terrain is fun and immersive.  It has geological activity.  The day/night cycle is fast, bordering on too fast, but it certainly keeps you alert as night time is... less comfortable.\n\nWhich leads me nicely into my favorite part of this game - the sense of isolation and fear.  Reaching my escape pod sometimes borders on therapeutic it feels so good. In no other survival game that I've played has the feeling of "exploration" been so genuine.  New areas are as fascinating and rewarding as they are foreign and unnerving. My pod drifted out over some very deep water and I experienced one of my first real moments of true fear as I swam out to it.  Looking down into the black...\n\nIf you like survival and exploration games or if you as a person have the slightest apprehension of the real open ocean then I strongly recomend this game; as it will challenge your senses and illustrate the boundaries of your comfort zone.

Not only is the game fascinating, but the devs are probably the best around. They are very transparent with their development plans, updating their fans on the current projects on this site[trello.com], as well as getting to know people on the subreddit.\n\nBeyond the fantastic people crafting this game, you have a beautiful game set on an alien water planet. As you swim around the shallows, gathering supplies to begin crafting your new home, you encounter an alien ecosystem, complete with the smallest, cutest fish like the Peeper to the giant, terrifying Reaper Leviathan[vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net], whose howls and screams that echo the murky depths will haunt your nightmares.\n\nYou build power structures, habitats, hunt for fish, scan blueprints, while the sun and moon pivot about your head.

The storyline is isn't very long and you don't see too much of it in the game and most of the story is in little hints about other bases and lifepods found scattered around the map plus the signals which can lead you to some places to get more hints about what happened to everyone else. The game does only have one map, but if you couldn't find a certain biome there is little chance of someone being able to help you with the randomly generated maps.

But it has so much, I was suprised of how much depth there is for a early build game like this, I kept seeing new areas and new creatues. There are still, quite, a few bugs but the developers are very keen to make your experience better with a built in feedback system to talk about any topic and how you feel about the game.\n\nThis game is a great survival game but could use some refinement, for exapmle: the plant resources grow back but I have always been able to find more. The Tutorial is pretty bad and I didn't understand the fragement mechanic to unlock new tech but after about my second game I had figured it all out and found it amazing.

I love everything about it. The graphics, the gameplay, the sound, the theme. The first time you stand atop your life pod and look around you at the endless ocean and the hulk of your ship in the distance is astonishing. While the game is certainly not finished, the scale and need to explore the game inspires is what keeps me coming back.\n\nThe crafting system is rather simple, with the usual "combine these materials to make this" mechanic but it works. And the results are rewarding. When you finally get your first sub, it changes the whole way you play and allows you to go much farther and deeper than you could before. The base building is a lot of fun as well. Joining all the different modules together to create something unique is one of the things I love most and I can't wait to see what Unknown Worlds do with this system in the future.\n\nAt the moment, there is not a huge amount of content and depending on how focused you are you might get through it all in 10 hours or less, plus there are only fragments of a story right now but for $20, I think it's worth it and I personally am very much looking forward to it's continued development.","May 20","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The storyline is isn't very long and you don't see too much of it in the game and most of the story is in little hints about other bases and lifepods found scattered around the map plus the signals which can lead you to some places to get more hints about what happened to everyone else. The game does only have one map, but if you couldn't find a certain biome there is little chance of someone being able to help you with the randomly generated maps. This won't be a full review because the game is still in early access and most things said bad in reviews would probably be fixed in the full release of the game.","March 24","true","27.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For me, it's an example of a sandbox-style game done right.  As much as procedurally generated worlds are an amazing technical achievement, they lack what Subnautica has - a genuine attention to detail with regards to the world design.\n\nIt doesn't stop there though.  The crafting system in the game is really, really well done.  Some folks might find it restrictive if they have come to appreciate building things at block and wall level, but I personally found it nice to build bases with at a slightly less granular level.\n\nFinally, it's been a long while since I've wanted to upgrade my gaming machine to get the best graphics experience possible.  In most cases, you will get slightly nicer shadows, or slightly more menacing looking zombies.  I think in the case of Subnautica the experience would be absolutely amazing with all the graphics maxxed out.\n\nAll in all, a great game to add to your library!","March 24","true","33.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However with things like vehicles in this game it makes it even more addictive as you search for that one last part that youre looking for for the next vehicle.\nThe building in subnautica is both well executed and satisfying.

Review happily changed to recommended!\n\n###\n\nInitial review (deprecated).\n\n\nFirstly, let's clarify something:\nGet this game and play it, you'll have fun. I want to give the lovely Subnautica a big thumbs up, and I thought I would.... then I realized something after hours in the game:\n\nRessources don't respawn. None, ever. Fish, plants, minerals.\n\nI almost can't believe it.\nThis is simply a huge deal breaker. I went from super happy playing the game to hardly willing to launch it anymore.\n\nInfinite consumption of finite ressources is the long term horizon of the game, which means it's a checkmate from the start, no matter how well you manage.\n\nIn a nutshell, a growing radius around your base(s) will gradually become a dead zone, and you'll have to make longer and longer trips to places that haven't been plundered yet.\n\nIt means you can never reach equilibrium, a goal that's a huge motivator for me, unless you plan to stay in your base eating your crops all day, and that death and emptiness will prevail no matter what.\nIt is also inconsistent with the idea of being immersed in an ecosystem, which is the driving point of the game.\n\nYes, there is a welcomed farming update, a step in the right direction but it does not adress the long term inevitable doom of finite ressources and growingly depressing dead oceans. Where is the pleasure of exploring a thriving one, like on our enchanting first dive?\nAnd how does it make sense that fishes in a tank can reproduce, but not in the wild?\nEven if the player didn't exist, the oceans would soon be void of fishes just by the sheer actions of the predators constantly eating and chasing!\n\nThis dev choice is not even consistent with the will to design living, coherent ecosystems (while still maintaining the fun). This is NOT how things happen in nature! Incentive to explore should not rely on irreversible and total depletion: that's never why I went exploring in the first place. In the very long term, exploration cannot mathematically even be accomplished, because the point will be reached when doing so consumes more ressources than it yields.\n\nIt's pretty sad that such a great game is dragged down by this, although some might not object.\n\nTo get a more complete tour of the issue and make up your mind, please check:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/0/527273789693374590/#p1","March 22","true","58.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","27"

I love everything about it. The graphics, the gameplay, the sound, the theme. The first time you stand atop your life pod and look around you at the endless ocean and the hulk of your ship in the distance is astonishing. While the game is certainly not finished, the scale and need to explore the game inspires is what keeps me coming back.\n\nThe crafting system is rather simple, with the usual "combine these materials to make this" mechanic but it works. And the results are rewarding. When you finally get your first sub, it changes the whole way you play and allows you to go much farther and deeper than you could before. The base building is a lot of fun as well. Joining all the different modules together to create something unique is one of the things I love most and I can't wait to see what Unknown Worlds do with this system in the future.\n\nAt the moment, there is not a huge amount of content and depending on how focused you are you might get through it all in 10 hours or less, plus there are only fragments of a story right now but for $20, I think it's worth it and I personally am very much looking forward to it's continued development.","May 20","true","43.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it has so much, I was suprised of how much depth there is for a early build game like this, I kept seeing new areas and new creatues. There are still, quite, a few bugs but the developers are very keen to make your experience better with a built in feedback system to talk about any topic and how you feel about the game.\n\nThis game is a great survival game but could use some refinement, for exapmle: the plant resources grow back but I have always been able to find more. The Tutorial is pretty bad and I didn't understand the fragement mechanic to unlock new tech but after about my second game I had figured it all out and found it amazing. Awesome visuals, unoptimized to rather frequent framerate drops but amazing design with enviroments and creatures.\n\n8.5/10 (Alpha Build)","May 18","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just do it, do it now.\n\nThis is a really solid open-world, survival game, and it's still only in early access. It's hard to know where to begin, there are so many ways in which this game already nails it while still having build up and potential as the devs work on it.\n\nThis isn't an action game where you go in to kick butt and destroy everything. This isn't a building/devolopment game where you get to a place of complexity that gameplay collapses in on itself and has no longevity after the initial challenges are met. This isn't a puzzle game where there's a right and wrong answer to what you're supposed to do with a defined order of gameplay. This isn't a game with training wheels on it that's forgiving of all your mistakes while merely tricking you into thinking it's "open world."\n\nThis is a game that comes in and takes its place with as much simplicity or complexity as you want. You can call the shots and do things in the order you want, accomplish various aspects of survival organically without (currently at least) a plot driving you into a set storyline for game development. It submerses you in a world that is familiar yet altogether alien with new surprises coming frequently with updates. It allows you to build and develop your own experience without feeling cramped by a short-sided goal system that micromanages your every move. You can gather just enough resources that you're not in a constant state of emergency, and yet you are driven to keep exploring, keep gathering, keep doing more and working your way into the world of water you're stranded on.\n\nIf you have any appreciation for exploration, self-paced gameplay, gorgeous imagery, survival, and suspense and intensity without people shooting at you, zombies attacking, or a ticking clock... then go and dive into Subnautica and see for yourself how awesome this game is.","May 18","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I think it's important to note that I am playing Survival mode, where eating and drinking are required, you have a limited health and oxygen meter, resources are limited and you have to figure out ways to keep your base powered.\n\nSubnautica is a game I found out about through the Vinesauce stream. Even through the stream, I could tell that this game's mechanics were pretty deep. Upon actually playing it, I became hooked. Trying to figure out how to expand my base further as my storage and survival needs grow is incredibly engaging, and the sea is both vast and deep. In addition, it's pretty immersive; I feel actual amazement seeing what the ocean has to offer, and when I found land I was pretty legitimately excited. I'm also pretty excited to see what the future holds for the game, and will most likely be sticking around for version 1.0 and beyond. Fauna and flora variety is also pretty great, ranging from the simple, harmless Peeper to the explosive Crash fish to the deadly Reaper Leviathan, and the various biomes all feel varied and unique; even if some biomes, such as creepvine forests repeat, even those feel unique.\n\nHowever, if there's one thing I had to complain about, it's the lack of fauna respawning outside of the Crash fish; I'm pretty sure that I've depopulated the entire fish population near my base, giving things like observation decks and glass windows little purpose outside of letting me look at the seas. There's also a variety of bugs and missing features, but that's to be expected as this is in development.\n\nOverall, would I give it my recommendation? Yes. This game has become my favorite survival game and favorite early access game (since Kerbal Space Program left it last year), and I am really excited to see what the future holds for it.","March 18","true","81.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite how simple it is and the lack of 'things to do', the evironment itself will constantly be throwing new hurdles at you without the need for any quest arrow nonsense. There are intense moments of panic as the wildlife takes you by surprise, or you may even become your own worst enemy when you have a panic-attack freak out in an underwater cave and let claustrophobia get the better of you.\n\nIn fact, without ever intending on it, I think this is the best horror game I've seen in recent years.\n\nVery easily a 10/10, with content still inbound and coming in at a steady enough pace. I almost wouldn't even believe it were early access. Very minor nitpicking bugbears with some audio effect issues and glitches, but nothing that is too detracting from the awesomeness.","June 2","true","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Frog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YABOYLEGION/","195 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHonestly,\n\nI've only sunk 16 hours into this game, but I really have to crown it to be one of the best Survival games out there. Here are 10 good points I have to say about the game:\n\n1) No zombies.\n2) (very) active developers, with a development timeline on Trello, you can track their ideas and development progress.\n3) Actual challenging gameplay (at the start), which gets a little easier as you start building a base.\n4) Massive scary fauna, some of which will actually get your heart racing when you hear them coming for you.\n5) Interesting Biomes, some with fauna that looks really cute to look at, some with fauna that will mess you up if you so much as sneeze in their general direction.\n6) Unique base building, incuding different modules, defences, storage modules etc.\n7) Some semblence of story line (which is being expanded per update), take the crash sequence update for example.\n8) A pretty diverse range of fauna, from small cutesy fish to massive reaper-leviathans that will totally put a crimp on your day.\n9) Fish tanks (who doesn't want their own virtual fish).\n10) You can totally stab an alien shark to death, it's basically like being in the back alleys of Manchester.\n\nA few bad (or critical points off of the top of my head):\n\n1) No multiplayer / Coop, while this isn't a bad point, it may frustrate some players, not being able to shank alien sharks down with their chums.\n2) No way to kill a Reaper Leviathan, so once one has you in its sights, you better pray to sweet lord gaben that he misses you and you can get to that giant sea-shell you're so desperately clammering for.\n3) It feels very slow paced, again this is quite cathartic for some, it may not be for everyone.\n4) No real objective, the game feels lacking without a major end-game goal, apart from building a base.\n5) Saves are not compatable between updates.\n6) No mud crabs, I want the ability to have a mudcrab pet and call him "citizen snips", please add this asap.\n\nAll in all, I give it a 9/10, disregarding all of my semi-negative points (I'm english, I have to moan about something) I find  it to be a good game to come back to every time that they update it.

This is one of those early access games that is better then some full games, and it doesn't even have everything in it yet.  I can't wait for whats to come. Oh, and one last thing, the dev team for this game are one of the best, always talking to the community and listening to what we want.

But wow, the ambiance / atmosphere, paced music, polished graphics and style gripped me.  I have deliberately not played it since as I want to play the finished version fresh.  I would recommend buying this game 100% and have no connections with the developers like one of those dodgy IMDB movie reviews by a cast member lol.  If you want a chilled evening rather than a Black Ops 3 / CS manic run around (my normal fare) then take the time to explore this very well supported and much loved game.","December 26, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I then went on to watch some videos of other people playing and saw all the content I was missing and how much work the devs were putting into the future of this game and immediately re-purchased the game. This game is deceptive at first, it's pretty but seems to be sameish after an hour of fooling around until you realize how to unlock the more advanced gear and start exploring further and deeper and properly building up a beautiful base you actually want to live in. This game gets top marks for creativity, visuals, sounds, and replayability. There is quite a bit of placeholder art at the moment which was a disappointment to me but the art that is in place is beautiful. I look forward to playing more of this game (currently played around 6 hours across 2 saves) and discovering what the devs have hidden away in the depths. If you like movies like The Martian and Interstellar I cannot recommend this game enough because it will let you play out your stranded fantasies on an ocean-only alien planet.","December 29, 2015","true","16.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And exploring a alien planet in the first perspective is something that only video games, or interactive entertainment, can deliver so directly. It's a game I have been wating to be made for many, many years. And these fine ladies and gentlemen delivered like a Sir.\n\nThis game is fresh, fascinating, well designed (especially for Early Access), the presentation and sound design is solid, it has a lot of content for e.a., is already relatively polished and it is refreshingly non violent. - Although it does have some combat that is just enough to fit into this world of atmospheric exploration and amazing discovery.\n\nIt is also a game children can enjoy and their parents. Aswell as scientifically interested teens. And considering how many more or less badly executed products are out there for this target audience of family entertainment and education, this makes this game stand apart. Because you may not learn that much about biology, but you might find yourself ingrained with a love for life, nature, the sea and the exotic habitats our own planet can offer. Because after all well done science fiction also makes you see your own planet in a new light.\n\nWhen I played Subnautica for the first time, the sense of wonder and the atmosphere could almost be compared to my first time descending on an alien planet with Samus Aran on the SNES. Also there is also a relatively good amount to do already and, which I really like, you can turn off food, drink and energy demand, fully concentrating on the crafting and exploration part. A feedback function is directly built in, the developers are working quickly and thoroughly.\n\nAfter all is said and done, I'd really like to see a game like this as a representation for the diversity of interactive entertainment and not a view reduced to Mortal Kombat 23.","September 14, 2015","true","94.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are so many interesting areas to explore, and you can tell the devs put a lot of work into the details. You are on an alien planet covered in water. You crash-landed here, with no idea what type of world it is. You must learn about its inhabitants, and occaisionally eat them, even if they are cute. An awesome survival aspect, that doesn't include the over-used zombie infestation. Instead, you have marine animals, that are both aggressive and friendly.\n\nThe game can be peaceful, or scary, depending on what you are doing. There are lots of useful items to craft, resources to gather, and a few cool vehicles to make exploring even easier. One of them includes the giant Cyclops submarine. You can practically live in it.\n\nThe devlopers are very open with what they are working on, and there are large updates often.

Even though everything eats me :( and my base floods :( and my submarines constantly get destroyed by incredibly scary and noisy leviathan things :(\n\nIn all seriousness, until the subnautica team decides to add an autosave feature this game is about 6.5/10 overall. Loosing hours of swimming around collecting quartz is made incredibly tedious and very annoying after about 3 crashes. This is early access and you should be careful while buying it, as it is extremely buggy, yet it is also very fun to play.\n\nA couple of the main issues with this game are as follows\n* Crashing\n* Gets boring collecting materials after a while (main focus of the game is collection of materials, or so it seems.)\n*No auto-save feature\n*Frame rate, I have 2 gaming computers, one is a laptop, one is a custom built desktop. The desktop can run this game at an average of 35 fps (while dropping below this mark frequently) with a GTX 970 gpu as well as an intel i7-5820k 6 core cpu . If you have anything less poweful than the gpu / cpuI listed, you'd be wasting your money buying this game, as it would be unplayable or nearly so.","January 18","true","149.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

DAMN. This game is stunning, I've played it for a decent amount of time (All hours on hardcore, which I would recommend to anyone since it makes you really not want to die.), but all in all it lacks content. Sure it is early access so we can expect more  to be added, but it seriously needs more creatures (There aren't that many. Don't let the sounds fool you.) The biomes seem to repeat themselves a lot too. In my opinion the content needs to be tripled for it to become a fully fledged game.\n\nSmall pros and cons list for the sake of it:\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful game (with VR support)\n- Very atmospheric\n- Lots to explore\n- Surprisngly satisfying crafting system (imo)\n- Terra former gun (for making rock gentials. Get it!)\n- Supposedly will get better\n- Resources don't respawn! (YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE!!!)\n\nCons (Mostly related to early access):\n- Needs more content (creatures, biomes, crafting)\n- Crafting needs better explanation (In regards to the Pro: Yes its fun, but lacks proper explanation)\n- Buggy as hell\n- Unstable\n- Its early access.\n\nIts a mastapiece.

Subnautica is in its design phase, meaning the game is just barley put together, and still it menages to beat many other survival games with its atmosphere alone. However as stated above the game is only just being created, so there are going to be a plethora of bugs and oddity's. Yet, it was well worth the money because, it's a survival, exploration and experimentation game. Don't want to savagely nab fish and eat them? Load up the world in freedom and throw some console commands in and you have perfect atmospheric game to explore the ocean in. To add to this the game even has oculus rift support. In additions to all that the devs are EXTREMELY helpful from responding individually to many problems and they are very interested in listing to players input and suggestion.

It is a game that will inspire so many different games and it is a perfect mix of fantasy and survival. In order to survive you must build bases, submarines, other tools. There is so much potential to this game and I completely look forward to what they will add. I've played 3 hours of the game before writing this and I already have encountered very few bugs, if any. I have not tried the base building yet but I am completely in love with the Cyclops and the seamoth. Currently the only two vehicles in the game but both extremely useful in their own ways. The cyclops is the largest vehicle, able to suck in the seamoth as to bring it along with it do discover and explore new areas and creatures. Personally I believe that the game should be a little more complicated in the sense of different resources and requirements for building. I like a tough game but some people do not. All around I believe this game has amazing potential, I look forward to future updates and upgrades, and also I would absolutely LOVE to see a multiplayer feature! Just saying!","April 3, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
