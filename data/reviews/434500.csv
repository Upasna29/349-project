The control scheme and gameplay are simple, but it still takes a certain amount of skill, focus and strategy to not blow up. It reminds me of an arcade game. It currently only displays in 4:3, but the developer informed me on Jan 14, 2016 that a widescreen option will be included in an update, so that should allow the game to appeal to audiences with more modern equipment than old Bechstein with the 1024x1080 he picked off the street. I look forward to playing this in a more invested fashion.","January 14","true","5.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","14","20","4","0"

But that's just one of the game's many, many plusses - the background music is equally impressive and the graphics feels reminiscent of the older games I used to play, which I love. It adds a sense of nostalgia into your gaming experience, and that's always a big plus. With all of that being said, Battle Pixes is truly one of those games that are brilliantly impressive in their own fashion.","March 13","true","4.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Battle Pixels is for sure a difficult game. Whether the dev or devs intended for it to be very hard I don't know, but for me it's the controls that make the gameplay hard. To control a tank you must hit Z or X to select it, then click to where you want it to go. Easy enough, but it's rather fast-paced gameplay and you have to hit Z and or X and then click everytime you want to move the tank, which I find to be hard or almost too complicated for as simple as that sounds. Note that, -----> I <----- find it to be hard :)\n\nDespite that part with the controls (I don't intend to scare anyone away from buying this because of that), I certainly like this game a lot (Even with the 0.2 hours as of this review right now :D) It gets increasingly harder right off the bat too, I mean my whopping 0.2 hours so far was mostly spent on Level 3.\n\nI usually put up a score and such for games, but by the looks of it this game will get some minor updates in the future, so I'll hold off for now.\n\n-Edit: I got a response back from the devs thanking me for the review and how they'll look into what I've written here for future updates. Very nice and friendly devs!\n\nThanks for reading!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/recommended/434500/","underpr1","Undersniper1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/","1265 products in account","Played this game toward the end. I can say that is fun and enjoyable. It feel like the description said about 16 bit retro style. The game have in-game four types of update airstrike, time, shield and 1 hit. Each update will require some exact amount of points to use it each. Only one update per level can be used. You can try play past round to gain points. It have replay last game option.\n\nFor those who is his first time like me playing this type of game will force you to trying maximing your mind skills. Once you spend enough time you'll find it much easier. Don't get me wrong the game will eventually turns to more interesting. I noticed that in the menu it don't have some option setup to optimal resolution like 1920 x 1080 or such but doesn't matter when the game looks good enough to play it in any resolution. The ambient is fresh and run smooth. It took me 3 hours and half to finish but with more practice probably in 2. I would like to play this game again because it challenge you to do it better between level and level. Of course you'll need to be smart and very quick with both tanks. I can rate this game like 10 because looks good, gave me zero problem(maybe some very small slight), nice music and because i learned the maneuverability of point and click.\n\nMy pc specs are very basic as the any other laptop so i recommend any of you to get this kind of game. If you already own it then please share it to your friends so im sure they will like it as much as me.\n\nHope more stuff in the future like this.  10/10!","January 14","true","15.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Not a good starting level.\nBut the most problematic thing is the control scheme. To move a tank it is necessar to click it first and then click the target location. Afterwards the tank is deselected, i.e. it is necessary to click again to reselect. This makes the control nonfun.\nNote that in the current version the resolution is fixed to 1024x something, leaving a lot of space around the battlefield.","February 7","false","0.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Gameplay very simple, same as from original Tanks - need destroy enemy units and you win round. Great 16-bit retro style and soundtrack (I like it very much). But keep in mind, its hard game, I am failed a lot of levels! Need more practice for me :) Also, the things what I dislike are no support my resolution and force enabling fullscreen after complete levels.

I found this game lacking in its ability to gain my interest, let alone keep it but also found myself astounded that there are issues with the game aswell. Those issues as explained in the video are, no sound controls, auto swapping between full screen and windowed every time I died and the tank "forgetting" it was selected.\n\nPositives:\n+ Could not find any, sorry\n\n\nNegatives:\n- No sound control\n- Poor graphics (although they do boast it as a 16-bit retro game)\n- Lack of real content\n- Minimize/Maximize window issues\n- Control issues\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe only positive I could come up with for this one guys is that you'll only lose Â£1.59. There are better, more interesting games out there on the internet, through java in your browser that you can play for free.\n\nPrice as of 11/06/16: Â£1.59\nMy score: 1/5\n\nHappy Gaming!","March 11","false","0.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
