Oh it's not over until I teabag every last one of you alien mother f***ers" - Sam 'Serious' Stone, Serious Sam 3\n\nTHE GOOD\nThe Serious Sam series has always been an antidote to the shooters which may or may not have a player character who kills off people who are different to them because they look different, sound different and speak different languages, in where you have a whole lot of aliens trying to trample and shoot you from all sides, just like the 4:17pm on December 24th. There weren't any key card quests, no escort missions, and no real story which was involing in any way. The gameplay may turn off hardcore Serious Sam fans for the first few levels. Few enemies will attack you systematically while you kill them off in a straight line. After you reach the Shpynx however, it starts to hit the fans and the aliens who outnumber the amount of Steam gamers with light wallets will charge and generally blow you to pieces. Just like the good old days.\n\nTHE GREAT\nRemember when you realised that you could play co-op on some of your favourite games? It was the dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Pretty satisfying) wasn't it? Whatever gamemode that has co-op elements in this kicks all kinds of alien ♥♥♥, and there's nothing more enjoyable than decapitating a demon which you woke from it's slumber with something that resembles a laser whip from Star Wars. Be it Beast Hunt, Coin Op or just straight out Classic Co-op, it will be a helluva good time, especially with the customisation involved in it.\n\nTHE UGLY\nCroteam, we love your level design. Serious Sam TFE and TSE were fantastic! We'll blame SS2 on the annoying child that kept pestering you on the next Serious Sam game who said that his father/older sibling played it and he wasn't allowed to. At least you regained your thing with the singleplayer in this. For the most part. The first few levels have you going through corridors killing off enemies not for fun, but simply because they're in the way. There is little reason to like the first few levels for many people, which will turn off some players. Later into the campaign you get cannons and miniguns and so on, so fourth, but here's a comparrison. In the first level of TFE, you get a rocket launcher, a double barralled shotgun, a single barralled shotgun, you fight off biomechs and witch harpies (If you find all the secrets at least). In the first level of TSE, you get a rocket launcher, both shotguns, a sniper, a chainsaw and a flamethrower while killing witch harpies, arachnids and lumberjacks with pumpkins for heads weilding chainsaws. And the best you find in BFE is a shotgun, some ammo for the assualt rifle and a few kleers and gnarrs? I know which I prefer. Also, a few mechanics like sprinting, aiming and reloading have been redundantly been introduced, but those are mostly optional, so not too bad.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nOverall not a bad game. Worth getting on sale, but do not judge the game on the story and the singleplayer alone. If you get through to the sixth or seventh level, it will ramp things up a bit. And that's a promise.\n\nSIMILAR GAMES\n-Any first person shooter from Id Software before 1999\n-Painkiller and Serious Sam TSE\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","November 25, 2013","true","89.2"," 170 of 188 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","170","188","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/recommended/41070/","FrizSteam","Friz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrizSteam/","203 products in account","The Serious Sam series is some of my favorite FPS games I have ever played. I played the first 2 when they came out and thought "why don't more FPS games do this?" Sending hundreds of enemies at you is extremely exhilarating. I never seen any other game do this like the Serious Sam games. You feel amazing as you try to dodge hundreds of enemies and their projectiles all at the same time.\n\nI always thought The Second Encounter was the best in the series, until I played this one. It feels a lot more modern and I love how the enemies look when they explode into bits and pieces. They got rid of the annoying trap rooms from TSE (I always thought they were badly designed) and upgraded the level design. The physics engine makes the majority of the levels have breakable walls. This creates some awesome gunfights, when you have tons of enemies blasting things at you and walls are breaking all around you while you try and shoot back at them.\n\nThe Serious Sam series is also known for their final levels and just how brutal and awesome they can be. Over 1,000 enemies coming at you? Check. Nearly 2 hour level? Check. Huge boss fight at the end of the level? Check. Seriously difficult? Double check. I think this game has the best final level in the series. The music and enemy formations, just made everything seem so perfect. Good luck ever beating the level on Serious difficulty.\n\nThis game will last you around 15 hours on Normal difficulty. There are other game modes you can play and the real strength of the game comes from playing the Campaign on Serious difficulty. Every FPS fan needs to try this game.","May 2, 2014","true","44.1"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","65","68","0","0"

It was such a beautiful moment that it took me back to the first time i ever played Serious Sam - a unique,unforgettable and exquisite franchise that got me into the FPS genre.\nAbout Sam 'Serious' Stone: There isn't much to be said about Sam Stone, except that he is a total destroyer of  Mental's world. His serious personality has inspired me for so long and now in this prequel of the first encounter i felt his anger and frustration in level 11 when his whole squad was wasted. Oops, spoiler i guess.\nGameplay: You can start playing this game by choosing one of the 3 modes: Single Player, Multiplayer or Versus.\nFor me the most memorable parts i ever had with this game were in MP. I have never experienced so much carnage and fun that can reach the ridiculous amount of 16 players in co-op. I personally reccommend that you join the steam group called '7smoke'  in order to enjoy online play without any speedrunners. There is also survival mode that throws you into a battle arena of countless waves of enemies.\nFor those of you who enjoy playing solo, i must warn you. Don't click on 'serious' if you are a newcomer to the franchise.\nThe final mode is Versus and for me this was a bit of dissapointment in comparison to the brilliant Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter versus. The double-shotgun is ridiculously overpowered, the maps aren't that good, a lot of rage quit and tons more stuff that annoys me, but still could be fun if you play with the right people.\nWe must not forget that Serious Sam 3 BFE has full workshop support that has a lot of interesting mods from people that are really creative. So you can play christmas mods during the holidays, halloween events and etc. If you can't find the right map or character skin you want to play with you can create it yourself with the new Serious Editor 3.5.\nAnd to wrap this short review up i must tell you that Serious Sam 3 BFE is an easy 10/10 for me, but only because this is my childhood game and i love every addition to it. For newcomers that have never played Serious Sam before i can recommend this game with all my heart, and hope that this game will have the same impact on you that it had on me.\nStay serious folks !","November 28, 2013","true","166.2"," 81 of 105 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","81","105","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/41070/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Is this another typical shooter? Yes and no. The game play and the art style does it's best to differentiate itself from anything else.\n\nI'd like to first mention the fact you can choose a third person view. This game does it's best to give you every option in the book and by simply adding this just means the devs care. One thing about the third person view, when the player backs up into a wall (not facing it), the camera switches to first person view. This is done I'm assuming so we don't get any camera clipping through the walls. It can be annoying, but some will probably find that brilliant.\n\nWhenever there is scenery that can break, or that gives a reaction back when hit, I'm definitely a fan of. Serious Sam has a lot of weapons, some that can be used with variance. The hammer for instance, can break through wooden planks or when X is pressed (on an X-box controller), Sam instead of swinging forward, does a whole ballerina spin to knock everyone out. If Sam hit's a wall, dust comes off it! Not everything breaks, but there is quite a bit you can hit and still get something out of it. Heck, if that sort of close combat melee isn't enough, when an enemy gets close, hit the A button to do a custom melee take down. You even get a trophy to throw once you do this. Weapons are somewhat basic but as the story line progresses, they do as well. All basic movements are given in this game which is absolutely fantastic (sprint, duck, jump). One addition that may have helped would be something as seen in Dishonored, where you can climb certain obstacles. Once in a while, you may find yourself trying to get up a stairwell you simply cannot. It may not seem obvious at first, but after multiple tries you finally realize you were maybe not supposed to go there. The enemies in this game are by far differentiated from the rest of the FPS world. My personal favorite is this guy running with two bombs in his hands, and yells at the top of his lungs as he is approaching you. Most of the time you have no idea where this guy is either than hearing his voice, and it's a scramble to find him. Blood type can also be switched in options. Don't like red? Go green? Don't like green? Go hippie.... (seriously). The game provides quite a challenge on one player and can be very fun on local-coop.\n\nVisuals and sounds are really good. The menu is easy to navigate and brilliantly done. The game's graphics are quite consistent and have not noticed any chopping. Sounds are welcomed as well as dialogue throughout the game. Sam does make a few comments here and there when seeing or dealing with certain enemies. My favorite part I must mention though is the local-coop ability. You can choose to play with 2-4 players and CHOOSE the screen sizes if you are playing with 3 people. Amazing feature once you start playing with friends.\n\nI recommend this game as it has local co-op and is extremely fun with friends. Alone, it can still provide entertainment and still worth a purchase. If this FPS had no local co-op it would be rated as an average shooter at 7.4-7.5. Because of all the added extras, I'll have to give it\n\n\n\nRATING : 8.1/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B	Replay-ability	B	Overall 	B\n\nScreenShots :\n3 player local co-op screens.

I know that he has returned to an old coat as Serious Sam First Encounter and Second Encounter. Serious Sam 2 game was a noob game I am glad that Serious Sam 3 is again similar to the first part. But let's say straight errors, bugs, problems.\n\nErrors,Bugs and Problems\n\n1. Death Canyon on the map after spawn will you run to scrapjack use mutilator for him he pulls you and if it just so you will spawn spider  flies a few feet into the air and you lose a lot of hp or you will die\n2. Who survival server join first,enemies will attack him from the 80% who join,second  enemies will attack him after the first player die etc. It is a huge problem for survival map Deserted. It is very annoying and unfair!\n3. If the map of Death Canyon or in the Deserted you running bull may happen that strikes you 2x (or more in 2-4 seconds). It is very unfair and very annoying everybody know about it!\n4. Hammerbug The biggest problem in versus. Once you hold the hammer and sprints and change weapon or collect weapon  and sprint continue hammer will be fast (0.5 second 1 hit), it is very unfair and it is huge problem for map Demon Tomb.\n5. Laserbug Once you hold the gun example grenade launcher change it for a laser and start shooting with laser and sprinting along the laser becomes laserbug because you can shoot and sprinting\nand it does not make any sound so players do not have a chance to hear. You can kill noobs completely without incident.\n6. Error spawn in the map Courtyards of Death discover from behind the rocks. This happens when clicking rapidly after death to for a new revelation. Subsequently must run 1-2 minutes to the end of the map where you fall down. So you lose time and still have 1 death\n7. When you play last human enough so often happens when you spawn straight fall off the map. This error mainly concerned map Brkeen Chevap. Attention this it might happen within the normal Deathmatch,but not so often.\n8. If you vote exclusion of the player and the players are 8, and 4 players vote for approval and then one player leaves,who not voting,voting approval voting but nothing happens and you have to wait 20-30 seconds before the new vote available\n9. If someone kills in Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch in sometimes happens that you appear in the same place. But why? You have no chance if you're example between 4 players ...\n10. - If the map Death Canyon bull runs on player and you jump in front of him it can happen that you do not lose hp or a few.\n- Or it may happen that you thrown several meters into the air and you die or you have huge losses hp.\n\nLiked\n\n1. In leaderboards you can click on the player and it will show you a profile (it is helpful if you see a hacked player you can go fast block him).\n2. Game graphics (only if you have a normal details or more).\n3. Achievements are not so hard but one problem is 2 christmas Achievements and complete can it only days near to Christmas.\n4. Enemies.\n5. Story game.\n6. You can  play with up to 16 players in the campaign, versus and survival too, if you connect to the server with 16 players in the campaign and you will be a vote to survival then it will be survival server with 16 players.\n7. Bosses.\n8. You can choose from a large selection of characters.\n9. Nice Workshop where you can play a lot of survival maps and more!\n10. Sometimes bloody game =)\n\nStrange thing\n\n1. I don't understand why arsenal of weapons has 16 places and can be filled with 13\n\nI think this game is huge suprise for year 2011. Have a nice day AlenL i hope you fix something example 2,3,4,6,8. I give this game 8 points out of 10","December 27, 2014","true","563.1"," 74 of 105 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","74","105","9","14"

"Alien Hamburger, my favorite"\nSerious Sam 3 BFE is a great game. You play as Sam Serious Stone. He's the ultimate 80's murican. An action film stereotype. Basically Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, & Bruce Willis combined! The title is serious, but the game is hilarious. Great one liners, a comical plot, and monsters that are just over the top. The game play on the other hand is seriously smooth & fast. They added aim down sites which is a must for me. Game play on a controller is excellent. The game features, single player campaign, split screen, LAN, and online multiplayer with 16 player co-op! This is the way it needs to be, hats off to Croteam. (I'm talking to you EA, quit forcing me to play on your server, and give me local co-op or LAN!) Sorry got off track, OK I'm back. The music is just awesome. Mostly Egyptian style background music, but when action gets heavy the music gets heavy. As in METAL. This fits perfectly for blasting Aliens into giblets! The Serious Engine 3.5 is optimized very well, while load times can be a tad long. I found this game would run on almost anything in lower settings (Not your RadioShack Tandy, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you enjoy a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, has a nice arcade feel, replay value, 80's action humor, and offers great co-op game play just stop reading and buy it!\n\nDisclaimer: Adult Content, Nudity, F-Bombs, Gore.

This title is supposed to act as a prequel to the original Serious Sam remade in all its choppy HD glory a little while back. Yes - the alien invaders still want to annihilate earths human citizens and yes it's up to Sam and friends (if playing in co-op as I believe up to 16 people can join in on the action) to stop them.\n\nSerious Sam 3 does little, very little, to distinguish itself from the other titles in the series and it honestly feels a bit like a cut and paste job with an engine that now supports Direct x11. The feeling of deja vu sets in early with this one since there is hardly anything you haven't already seen in the previous titles. A better enemy variety would have been a welcome change but little is tinkered with here so it's waves upon waves of the same re-spawning enemies from the 1 and 2 episodes with only one or two new additions.\n\nI could never imagine playing this title alone and thankfully I had a friend with me to co-op right through to the end although we never really got to see the end because the game allowed us to pass through to the final boss without picking up a weapon from the previous stage that is required to kill him. Thanks Croteam! Who the hell play-tested your game? That just killed it for us as we promptly both deleted all local content from our drives and packed SS3:BFE away for good.\n\nAlthough I am sounding very negative about the game I still had fun with it in bursts. The gameplay is still incredibly fast and furious and the Direct x11 enhanced graphics do look rather awesome on a system that can beef up the game in the settings department - but - and its a very big BUT - Croteam are going to have to energize the next chapter should there be one because even for an old school off-the-rails shooter like this one things are starting to feel a little more than stale and tired.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 15, 2014","true","12.2"," 90 of 142 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","90","142","0","3"

Dont get me wrong, killing hordes of enemies is fun... but there is a point, where you are in a zone and enemies keep respawning, and killing them stops being fun an becomes a chore. Near the end of the game there is a section where you have to kill around 3000 enemies of all kinds, which takes you like an hour, all in the same place.\n\n-The enviroments: It tried too hard to have "realistic" maps, I mean, with a lot of detailed textures and real-world looking. In my opinion Serious Sam does good with less "serious" textures (which, by the way, dont look that good) and a more cartoony look. Half of the game seems to take place in the same city map and the other half in the same desert map.\n\n-The enemies: 85% of the enemies are the same from older games. This isnt a bad thing of course, but the new enemies they added are completely unoriginal and not fun to fight against. Alien soldiers that have human guns and just stand there shooting at you, also, they dont have projectiles you can dodge, but hitscan, which means that you cant dodge their shots. Wellp, imo that goes a bit against what serious sam is supposed to be.\n\nI had some fun with the game and enjoyed it at the beginning, but it got repetitive real quick and finishing it was kind of boring.\nWouldnt recommend this game for full price.","February 8","false","18.4"," 47 of 69 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","47","69","4","0"

To be honest, I have no idea what makes it a prequel - story-wise, you still keep shooting at various aliens until every one of them dies.\n\nThe concept is similar to what Painkiller has: you walk / run along and enjoy the silence and suddenly you hear loud music indicating the oncoming hordes, and I mean HORDES, of enemies. Once you are done with all of them you can proceed to the next section - by only hearing your footsteps - where everything starts over.\n\nYour guns are big, using them is very enjoyable and none have the option to be reloaded. You just keep pressing the button until you run out of ammo. Oh, and sometimes there are bigger enemies that are meant to be the bosses. Simple as that.\n\nSo, the core elements remained the same: it has always been a mindless shooter with Sam trying to sound as cool as Duke Nukem. My opinion is: sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he doesn't.\n\nUnlike previous instalments this game looks stunningly beautiful and even though it is already a 3-year old game it requires some high-end components so that you can enjoy the spectacle of blown up enemies and flying body parts!\n\nFor those who love this genre (or more like: subgenre) Serious Sam is a must!","October 1, 2014","true","22.4"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","0"

But at first it наваляет it in the present — and there burn it all with fire. At first sight, game in comparison with the previous parts didn't change at all: Sam strides on absolutely linear levels, turning enemies into forcemeat and occasionally distracting on search of hiding places. Periodically the hero lock in the conditional room ("conditional" because it can be and the huge plain) and fill up with tons of enemy meat.

Both of us having played every other game of the series, we relatively quickly decided that this part of the series is the least fun to date.\nThe third installment is much more oriented after recent "mainstream" fps games, lacking most of the classic and iconic features, clearly wanting to reach a wider, more casual, audience.\nDuring the whole 7-10 hour playthrough, you will face the same enemies with the same standard weapons. They replaced classics like the double revolvers with a generic desert eagle, the tommy gun with an m4. There is absolutely no variation in locations, as the whole game is situated in egypt, starting in a destroyed city almost identical to what Battlefield 3's campaign starts in, and then leading to pyramids and ruins, all looking basically the same. The huge variety of level design, that Serious Sam 2 had, is completely absent, as are the very funny and unique secrets from the earlier Serious Sam titles. There are still secrets in the game, however, they are so boring and anticlimactic, that you just stop looking for them, while you were going through entire levels again just to find that one funny hidden easteregg in Serious Sam 2 or 1. The biggest thing you can find in SS3 are the sniper rifle and plasma gun (which are secret only, which reduces the weapon variety even more) or some additional armor. Serious Sam 3 just doesn't dare to stick to its roots, but rather wants to attract a bigger audience by making itself way  too serious . It almost feels like just another generic shooter. Even Sam's oneliners just seem off and boring in this game.\nThey added melee executions to the game, which means you can run up to enemies, press "e" and instantly kill them with a short animation, which is fun at the start, but later becomes so spammable that it makes usage of weapons so absurd, because it takes much more ammo and time to shoot than to just one hit melee people. Bigger enemies cannot be meleed, and they usually stay back and spam you with infinite-range rockets or machine guns, making them annoying because you often lack effective long range weapons.\nNow, there are still good sides. The soundtrack is amazing, the gore is pretty nice and coop still can be fun. If you didn't like the "ridiculous"-approach of Serious Sam 2, then you might like SS3. If you, however expect, a creative, crazy game, you will be disappointed, just like I was. The whole game feels like a drag, like one long-stretched level, as you walk from ruins to pyramide to desert to ruins to pyramid to ruins again, and then finally to an unsatisfying boss fight resulting in the ending credits. After two levels you have seen all enemy types, almost all weapons, and all mechanics. There are no vehicles, turrets, almost no jumping puzzles, just straight up walking and shooting wave after wave of the same, annoying enemies, always with the thought "please be the last enemy" or "please let me exit this desert already".\n\nI was really looking forward to playing Serious Sam 3, I went in with a lot of motivation and I really wanted to like this game. But instead of another fun installment, this just became a generic shooter, with almost no resemblence to the series, lacking so many iconic features. That is why I don't recommend this game to fans of the series at all. It is the worst Serious Sam game so far, in my opinion.\nJust a quick list of things missing compared to earlier installments:\n- multiple locations (--> also varying enemies)\n- unique bossfights\n- iconic weapons have been replaced with generic ones\n- unique and rewarding secrets\n- a lot of humour\n- varying gameplay mechanics, such as vehicles or turrets\n- power-ups (including the Serious Bomb)\n- puzzles and jumping passages\nIt might still be a solid coop experience, but nothing more. Maybe people prefer the barebones version, that focuses only on shooting, but I'd much rather recommend SS2 or First and Second Encounter.\n\nTL:DR 10 hours of the same levels, enemies and weapons. Almost no variety and imo, the worst installment of SS yet, as it lacks almost all classical features.","January 4","false","9.6"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","0"

This is how I always visualized Serious Sam should be and not the cartoonish SS2 which did not make it into the limelight. If you've played the previous installment you will pretty much get the idea of this game. Hordes of monsters and variety of arsenal at your dispose. Cheesy dialog and tonnes of lead and gore.\n\nThe game stick to its root but added some interesting weapons and features and a dash of new enemies, which in my opinion is just nice.\n\nControls are fluid and the soundtrack is, well, annoying as usual with the rock solid sound effect. Up until now, there are still some servers running with a pinch of community playing co-op game but unfortunately for me, I wasn't in the US so ping was horrible.\n\nIf you are just getting this game for its single player mode, my advice is take it slow and steady. One step at a time will get you there.\n\n","July 20, 2015","true","9.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

I'm not even kidding. Start on hard or higher and never ever touch the quicksave/quickload keys.\n\nThe beginning of the game kinda sucks in that the enemies you fight are super easy and it takes a little bit to get out of the usual corridor-shooting stuff, but all was forgiven after about half an hour. The variety in enemy behavior, the variety in weapon usage, the constantly-changing arenas, the constantly changing visibility, the perfectly rationed ammo and health pickups, and the tension added to the game when you can't quicksave all mash together and make the big fights in this game wonderful.","November 25, 2013","true","62.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Clear the waves of monsters in a room, move on to the next point until you beat the level... Loading screen... Next level begins. Repeat.\n\nThis is a "Grab your bag of Doritos & a botttle of Mountain Dew!" type of game. You can fly solo and play through a number if levels in the single player campaign or go online and run in a herd of Sams to run and gun down various beasts with your friends. No matter the case, this a full-on hardcore adrenaline pumped game.\n\nAnother nice thing about the game is the graphics option, it really showcases the versatility and power that the pc platform has to offer. No really, it has so many graphics options you've never heard of that you'll read some if them and you won't have a clue. It's an adventure fooling around with those options all in itself and one might add the game looks beautiful in 4k resolution.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't really possess a story or a soul, Sam is as dry as a character can get... even moreso than Duke Nukem.

These features include sprinting, ironsights, weapons that suddenly have to use magazines, hitscan enemys and a really bad melee system.\nSome small-minded fanboy might say that I have the option not to use any of these but it is clear as day other aspects of the game had been changed to fit around your great new "features".\n\nSprinting allows you to walk faster forwards at the cost of not being able to shoot. Running and gunning always had been the core functionality of the game so this is a genius move. Optionality is not a counter-argument since enemy speeds have been increased to "counteract" the sprinting ability, making enemys such as Kleer annoying to deal with because they have 200 meter jumps which normally ended up in good shotgun range but now make a succesful dodge half as rewarding.\n\nWeapon magazines on the Tier 1 Shotgun and M4 are there to slow down your fast paced shooter and make sure you enjoy your time actively doing absolutely nothing.\n\nThe increased amount/strength of hitscan enemys ensures your run and gun fast paced shooter turns into a blow-trading cover based waiting-simulator. While the previous games had hitscan enemys that would instantly shoot on sight but have poor long-range capabilities the ones in this game have to be baited to shoot after which you wait out their shooting behind cover until you can return fire. Rinse and repeat with a lot of waiting. Waiting is fun I enjoy it a lot thank you.\n\nThe bad melee system allows you to instantkill certain enemys once you are close enough at the cost of being locked in a killing animation(it won't look satisfying the 2000th you do it I can promise you that). More waiting, thanks a lot. I would truly let this "feature" slide if it wasn't for the fact its the only way to get rid of the new giant bug enemy type which is merely a bullet sponge. It is less frustrating to use the melee instantkill on them en masse and works (it shouldn't) because their AI does not have a proper reaction to close quarters combat with the player.\n\nGraphics are grey, mediocre and uninteresting. Enemy designs have been reduced to tones of grey and red. For some reason the Doom mancubus is in this.\n\nOn the good side, the second half of the game gets slightly better as it attempts to ape the previous games. If you can wade through the first half, that is.\nThe music is also nice I guess.","July 7, 2014","false","22.8"," 76 of 135 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","76","135","2","15"

Serious Sam 3: BFE is a brilliant rendition of all the elements that made this game so seriously epic.\n\nStory:\nSerious Sam 3: BFE is a prequel to the Serious Sam The First Encounter. The world is under attack by Mental and his forces as Sam and his team must retrieve research data behind the Sirian weapon system that could be the key behind defeating the world’s most devastating foe. As all of Sam’s comrades fall and he pushes the forces of Mental down one by one the world falls into dust and it would seem all is lost. Using his trusty comrade Netrisca Sam is able to solve the Sirian puzzle and land right where Serious Sam The First Encounter Begins.\n\nCampaign:\nSerious Sam 3: BFE is divided into twelve levels that gradually increase in length. The levels start out rather short, but extend in length lasting reaching over an hour and a half each. There are six difficulties which scale brilliantly: Tourist, Easy, Medium, Hard, Serious, and Mental. Beating the campaign on Serious unlocks Mental difficulty, which adds a whole new element to the campaign. Even on Serious Difficulty you will essentially be slaughtering waves of enemies that will fall to your feet as if you were a wolf amongst lambs… The sea will run red with the blood of your enemies!!! The easier the difficulty the more ridiculous the slaughter will be, depending on how you play you may enjoy the easier skills. The campaign has epic puzzles and brilliant boss fights that keep you on the edge of your seat. Most of the bosses throughout the game are mostly just regular enemies that are slightly stronger; although, two of the bosses Ugh-Zan IV and Alcor Class Warship are brilliant new editions to the game that relate to the original story.\n\nGameplay:\nSerious Sam 3: BFE follows suit with the other games in the series. You play a complete and total bad ♥♥♥ modeled after a 80s action hero as you defeat thousands upon thousands of enemies. The game boasts fifteen weapons: Fists, Sledgehammer, Axe, Sirian Mutilator, SOP38 Pistol, 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun, Double Barrel Coach Gun, M29 Infantry Assault Rifle, XM-214-A Minigun, XPML21 Rocket Launcher, XL2 Lasergun, AS-24 Devastator, RAPTOR Sniper Rifle, C-4 Demolition Charge, and SBC Cannon. The combinations of epic weapons give you a huge diversity of methods to defeat the mass enemies that are ahead of you.\n\nJewel of the Nile DLC:\nJewel of the Nile is a fantastic addition to Serious Sam 3 BFE. This addition changes the dynamic of SS3 BFE by changing the game from a mass shooter to puzzle solving. The levels resemble more of a DOOM or Shadow Warrior style where you will be finding secrets and solving puzzles. The DLC includes three levels: Gathering of the Gods, Together Forever, and Born Again. These levels make the secret weapons more available and the jetpack from the final boss fight a featured element. This DLC offers amazing new features and includes epic boss fights to boot.\n\nHints:\n>I would recommend looking up where to find the secret XL2 Lasergun and ammo as if you don’t you probably won’t get to use it.\n>I would recommend looking up where to find the secret RAPTOR Sniper Rifle and ammo as if you don’t you probably won’t get to use it.\n>I would recommend looking up where to find the secret SBC Cannon because it’s just fun to use, although you will get it later in the game.\n\nResults:\nSerious Sam 3: BFE continues the brilliance of the series by pushing the foundation of the original and only making the series that much greater. I would recommend getting this game even if it’s at full price. With DLC added you and Steam Workshop support this game offers more than you could image. SS3: BFE plays like an 80s action movie where you play an amazing hero who runs in guns blazing and kills thousands of enemies while only getting minor scratches.\n\nPros:\n+With fifteen different weapons you will never be bored.\n+Twelve fantastic levels that are all unique and incorporate new features and elements.\n+Many different enemies, some new some old, that keep you at check.\n+Loads of secrets that increase replay value and make you want to scour the levels.\n+A jetpack for the final boss battle making taking Sam to all new levels (get it, because he can fly)\n+So much nostalgia, so much feels.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the weapons are secret and you will not get to use them if you don’t find them.\n-The sun shines into your eyes essentially blinding you at certain points in the campaign.","June 30, 2014","true","21.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/recommended/41070/","jojocscs","Jelour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jojocscs/","222 products in account","Serious Sam 3: BFE is a first-person shooter video game developed by Croteam and published by Devolver Digital. It is part of the Serious Sam series and a prequel to The First Encounter. The game's story takes place in the 22nd century, during Mental's invasion of Earth, as implied in The First Encounter. The game is set in Egypt and features a 16-player co-operative campaign mode, as well as 4-player splitscreen. The game was released on November 22, 2011 on Windows, October 17, 2012 on Xbox Live Arcade, while the PlayStation 3 version was released on May 13, 2014.\n\nLike previous titles in the series, Serious Sam 3: BFE involves fighting against many hordes of enemies in wide-open environments. However Serious Sam 3 has more closed environments than its predecessors, particularly in the early levels. There are also a larger number of enemies that can attack the player from a distance.\n\nThe player can carry an unlimited amount of weapons, including a minigun, rocket launcher, assault rifle and a cannon. There are 13 weapons total. 5 of them have a manual reload. The signature close-combat weapons from the first game, the knife and chainsaw, have been replaced with a sledgehammer with three modes of attack (vertical strike, 180 turn and full 360 turn).\n\nWhen I said the 360, I know you first thought of 360 Spin, also, no scope :)))))))\n\nThere is no regenerating health, instead there are health and armor power-ups scattered throughout the levels that the player must pick up. Additionally, the levels are full of secret areas, where health, armor, ammo and in some cases, weapons from later levels can be found, following the tradition of the previous games. Some weapons such as the Lasergun and the Sniper Rifle and their respective ammunition pickups are in fact secret-only, and otherwise are not found in the levels normally. There are no puzzles, however the player must find keys, pull levers and find environmental anomalies to progress.\n\nClassic enemies such as the Beheaded Kamikaze, Beheaded Rocketeer and Kleer Skeleton return in the game. New ones include the Khnum and Scrapjack (resembling the Hell Knight and Mancubus from Doom, respectively), as well as the cloned soldiers reminiscent of the Strogg from the Quake series. The Kamikaze has returned to his original design, rather than the Serious Sam II design. The Gnaar's design has radically been changed from the original game. It is now much larger, differently shaped and walks on all fours, unlike its bipedal counterpart in Serious Sam.\n\nRate: 11/10","June 23, 2015","true","10.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Here's the tl;dr:\n\n=======\n(steamfriend): so I really dunno wtf to do in SS games.\nOOO67VH: kill ♥♥♥♥\n=======\n\nNow, the review.  ----- 6/10 above average, barely -----  Thank you, Steam Friend, for prompting this review.\n\nThis review is for those who don't know Sam and haven't played the other SS games.\n\nUnlike Sanctum2, Borderlands2, Team Fortress 2, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2 (differentiated characters co-op), Serious Sam 3 is essentially:\n\n- wildly killing things.\n\nIn co-op, add these astonishing features:\n\n- several people running around;\n- i think they're killing things too;\n- dying;\n- running back to kill more things.\n\nSure, it's similar to Sanctum 2 or Borderlands 2 in that regard. It's snarky, like BL2. That's always a plus.\n\nBut there is a sense of teamwork in other games. Kiting (leading on a baddie to get his back turned to another shooter). Specialization. One-two punches. Syncopating bullet storms.\n\nOne, new to co-op, might wander in SS3 to a point where one is both lost and seeing zero baddies, and the game might stay that way for that person for 5 minutes. Lost, with 'fighting sounds somewhere over there'. That's silly.\n\nHere's the rub: there's absolutely zero incentive for others to notice, much less find the team and fight together. In 2013, that's also silly.\n\nKilling Floor/Left 4 Dead 2, OTOH, on Hard, requires that every single member take turns syncopate a bullet storm, have multitasking medics, for the entire team to survive.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I enjoy it, though. SS3 is a fast-paced shoot-everything-that-moves game.\n\nIt, like the other SS, has zero active story and purpose. It's like the original DOOM. The goal is to kill ♥♥♥♥ to get to a key, which unlocks a door, so that you can get to kill more ♥♥♥♥.\n\nDOOM reference!\n\nCo-op SS3 means only that more baddies are on-screen and more people are coincidentally playing in the same general map.\n\nI have bought it for a few friends. I did the same with Borderlands 2, Sanctum 2, and Killing Floor. We play the living hell out of those games. We've played SS3 just once, I think.\n\nBut I've played it for hours on solo.\n\nIt's fun. But it knows its place in gaming. So should you, before you buy it.\n\nBetter value than easily half the movies I've ever rented.","December 15, 2013","true","4.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

Serious Sam 3 has great gunplay and customization.\n\nThat being said there were several questionable choices made by the developers such as:\n\n-Extremely slow first few levels and super long levels over all: When all you have is the shotgun and imo boring assault rifle the first few levels are really rough, tons of hitscan and lame monsters like the technopolip a person might get the wrong idea about the game in general. Later it's a lot better though. Sad because the other Sams are fun the whole way.\n\n-Enemy trickle effect: Lets slowly let enemies pile into the playing field instead of doing them in nice clear waves so players get bored standing there killing 1-3 at a time. Okay. Yeah this speaks for itself, super annoying. Last level this is SUPER awful and annoying. Artificially extends the game length like a half hour at least.\n\n-Default Performance settings: Are all horrible, to get any kind of FPS out of the game unless your computer is crazy (and mine pretty good) you have to tweak settings a bit. Average Joe gamer is okay with 45 fps but he's usually on a console w/30 fps anyways. This is PC gaming and you should have your midrange presets giving midrange pcs 60+, preferably 100+. But instead its like 5-7 settings that don't get changed that really should so people claim this game has crap performance. Blame the preset options.\n\n-Technopolips: Super annoying to fight and when you only have the rocketlauncher to kill them it's just really all around annoying. They can shoot you thru stuff, kill you really fast and chase you around, all while being immune to small arms and having high hp, and ya know, flying. Slows gameplay to a crawl and makes it annoying and not as fun as it should be.\n\n-Enemies immune to small arms: No place for this in any SS game, terrible design. Makes weapon caches required, bad design.\n\n-Weapon caches: Infinite ammo gets really boring, enemies immune to small arms aren't interesting or fun. Make better more interesting levels please.\n\n-Brides: Slow gameplay down, take control away, pointlessly slow to kill because they gotta pop up a few times and you have to look for them, really annoying.\n\n-Space Monkies: Terrible, I C'4d the ♥♥♥♥ out of those pillars or logged off the game for a while every time i saw these. They hide and attack you around pillars. So there's several places where its just you chasing the stupid monkies around, they aren't really a threat but id rather be mowing down hordes of kamikazes and stuff. Slow gameplay to a crawl as well.\n\n-Dark flashlight sequences where you move slow: Slow gameplay, make the game scary, which i can't stand personally, i dont play SS to be scared but to have fun.\n\n-OP wrist lightning thing: Just really lame overall, looks cool, should be a gun or something.\n\n-OP Devastator: Fun but too much better than the rocket launcher, prefer sniper rifle and grenade launcher instead of weird OP combo gun.\n\n-Sam is _too_ Serious and swears constantly for no reason: SS1 TFE TSE were hilarious. I loved SS2's style even tho most ppl didnt. But SS3 my god man, you don't need random pointless love interest for sam, or him cursing constantly. So weird and out of place from the rest of the games.\n\n-Animations: 3rd person and some others are really bad.\n\n-Egypt: No more god damn egypt lol. Make levels bright and fun like SS2 or TSE.\n\n-Laser gun: NOT ENOUGH OF IT, favorite gun in the series!\n\nThat being said many good choices were also made:\n\n-Graphics: Beautiful, awesome looking\n\n-Sounds: Some great sounds (gore/rocketlauncher) Some not so great (assault rifle)\n\n-Gunplay: Overall fun, not as good as SS1 or SS2 as far as i'm concerned however.\n\n-Scrapjacks: Great new monster, pretty fun to fight, i prefer the T-rexes and big red guys from SS2 though.\n\n-Gore: Is great in this game.\n\n-Last boss: These games always have a gimmick at the end, look at quake or nearly any game like this, keeps the hectic tradition alive.\n\nIt seems from my review that I might of not liked the game but overall its pretty fun if you like serious sam games and can set it up for decent fps and make it thru the first few painful imo pretty terrible levels.\n\n6.5/10 (+1.5-2)","March 30, 2014","true","19.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Here comes the moment to talk about deathmatch, it is very sucky, the damages are not balanced, the collisions are crap and the maps are not so good, the deathmatch gameplay is very bad. If you play SS for deathmatch, don't play this one but if you like coop and new things, this game is for you.

Some new additions help the game feel fresh, such as a sledgehammer, and enemy-specific melee attacks. You can also complain about the CoD-like sprinting and iron-sights mechanics until you're blue in the face, but theres no denying that they make the game more fast paced and frantic.\n\nThe campaign can also be played co-op with up to 16 players, and the versus multiplayer is still as addictive and balanced as ever.\n\nSomewhat poor optimization here and there, but overall, Serious Sam 3 is one of the most complete and accessible games in the series to date.

Then this is the game for you.\nThe only modernizations that Serious Sam 3 went through were the additions of sprinting, melee attacks not involving a weapon, looking down iron sights of specific weapons (pistol and assault rifle), and reloading specific weapons (pistol, regular shotgun, assault rifle, and the Devastator), and these changes feel kind of... welcome, as they aren't abused. Other than that, it's a Serious Sam game. And it is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious.","February 17, 2012","true","68.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sure you can sprint for an indifinite period of time, and you can  aim down sights (I actually really like ADS), but rest assured, everything about this game is Serious Sam. You still fight hordes upon hordes upon hordes of enemies while utilizing a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of weaponry in gigantic environments. I'm not sure whether the modern city environments were either a send up to modern shooters or in fact a very clever message about the state of shooters today though. Multiplayer is pretty cool. There weren't too many people playing versus, so I didn't get the chance to try that out. Co-op on the other hand... You can have up to 16 people playing. While the most I've ever gotten to try out was 8 people (unfortunately, not very many people play multiplayer at all in this game), it was still an absolute blast having so many people contribute to a mindless violent orgy. This game is also quite well optimized, as I get a consitent 30 FPS on my craptop. Ths game is also on the 360, where I played the game's splitscreen (the PC version also has splitscreen, a very commendable move on Croteam's part) with a friend of mine who happens to be a big fan of COD, but is still very willing to try new things. I don't think I've ever heard him laughing so hard mindlessly mutilating enemies with miniguns and killer jewlery. The PC version also has excellent gamepad support, something more PC games should have. The only real issue I have with this game is it's pacing. It takes about 2 to 3 levels for the game to finally hit it's stride. Sure, this a sequence in the first level that reminds you that this is a Serious Sam game, but the next level is without a doubt, the weakest level in the entire game, if not the entire series. But after that travesty, the rest of the game picks up, and when it picks up, it's one hell of a ride. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone who is a fan of shooting things until they expire.

And thats mostly everything of the game. You run through (mostly very open) one way levels, killing everything, that gets in range and make it to the end of the level.\nVery impressive is the ability to shoot (most of) your surroundings into pieces, wrecking complete ancient egyptic temples.\nBeing an old type of game genre, you have no lifereg (only on the lowest difficulty) and always have to look for guns and ammunition (there are secrets and specials all over the map, like the laser gun and the sniper rifle).\n\nPlaying it in coop with other players, doing competitions, speedruns, deathruns and achievments, you can have a lot of fun, if you like just shooting massive waves of enemys.","October 10, 2014","true","58.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Thousands of enemies per level if not\n+ Elimination of annoying physics like recoil (that's right, there's no recoil or spread)\n+ The multiplayer co-op is actively visited and servers are always availabe for both BFE campaign and the DLC campaign\n+ Tons of secret areas and hidden items\n+ Expandable with DLC\n+ Bonus material available (OST, concept art, "making of" videos, etc.)\n+ Trading cards\n\nCONS:\n- Gameplay is a lot the same, except for the changing locations and areas\n- The story is very generic and cliché, but that's due this game revolving around the shooting massacre and is done somewhat on purpose\n- For a game that has a lot of secrets that you often have to jump and climb to, the jumping in BFE is pretty terrible\n- Although it does have pretty good music, it has very little variety in it\n\nA prequel to a classic and beloved series of FPS, set in a somewhat arcade style. A must for anyone who enjoys action and shooters in general.\n\nMy rating: 8.5/10","October 11, 2015","true","33.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

The aforementioned outrageous sh!t is  all here in Serious Sam 3: BFE.\n\nIt's a fine game to rush around and kill anything that walks around and attacks you. For that purpose, wield a 10 round Desert Eagle, a coachgun that can blast most enemies in one hit, a normal assault rifle, or a minigun and turn them into "Alien hamburger meat". If a gun doesn't work, then use an ancient bracelet and make enemies explode from the inside-out.\n\nCo-op is satisfying and it was very fun to play with a couple of buddies. Unlike some games, there is a "compass" in which it will inform you where and how far your pals are. This is very helpful when scouting around for hidden areas or to provide support. Once you experience SS 3 with a trusted friend, you don't ever want to go solo (again).\n\nSerious Sam 3: BFE did have some disappointing qualities. The level design is not impressive (especially for the underground ruins). Newcomers, like me, will have frustrations and tend to run around the map in circles when trying to find something to make progress.\n\nAs the game progress, it will then spam large amounts of enemies. To me, this is mostly annoying and repetitive. Sure, you may more targets to eliminate but it quickly becomes unnecessary to endure.\n\nThe A.I. has some bugs. A couple of enemies tend to get stuck or have troubles to choosing a target (if there are more than 2 players). Furthermore, their intelligence is mostly predictable and too easily exploited.\n\nThe plot is very thin and is forgettable. Unless you're a fan of the series for a long time, it will make you confused. To make matters worse, the dialogue is "cheesy" and the stale characters are not interesting (well, save for Sam as he's serious enough to be a main character).\n\nStill, if you want a game to play with friends and fight hordes of aliens, then get SS 3 at a discount. $49.99 for the game itself is too much considering my cons.","November 5, 2014","true","16.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

But upon retrospect the game really comes across as a squandered opportunity.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game is it takes place in Egypt. The location of the first game. Having the game be a prequel to the first game really didn't make any sense to me, and I believe 3 would have been significantly stronger if they made it take place in a different location.\n\nThis was something Serious Sam 2 oddly enough was stronger with. Serious Sam 2 took place in Alien locations that contrasted the Egypt and Jungle/Arctic/Medieval maps from TFE and TSE.\n\nIn general the game is fine and a necessary improvement over the HD games. But I really wish Croteam took more risks with this game.","March 1, 2013","true","41.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/recommended/41070/","Feyro","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/","533 products in account",""Let's get serious!"\n\nOf what the story is for Serious Sam in general, it wasn't fully told, or rather, didn't fully detail what went down in Sam's timeline before stuff went ka-blewy.  This game, it fully explains the backstory behind Sam's ventures into the past, and of what leads into Serious Sam 2 of him hopping from planet to planet to finding pieces of Sirian Artifacts.\n\nTo share a few gripes about it... it takes itself a bit too seriously.  Although it empasizes the old nature of arcade shooters of exploring to find secrets and stuff, about a third of the weapons are found through secrets only.  It's a let down, really, unlike the other Serious Sam games, you'd at least get to experience those other weapons once at the very most, or, make use of them quite often.\n\nThough Croteam boasts about the nature of their game, there is much to be seen for improvement.  Some effects can get a bit annoying at times, such as the lens flare, making it a tad impossible to see at times.  Their animations show their age as well, especially in third person... whoa-hoh-boy... if they didn't take this game too seriously, I'd have laughed along with them in their share of mistakes and blunders.\n\nTo the good about it, it does maintain that old arcade shooter feel of collecting armor and health, and of wielding enough fire power that's capable of taking down an entire city.  You can freely run amock throughout the levels running and gunning, executing certain enemies, messing around, or enjoying the gauntlets that are provided at times.\n\nIf you're a fan of shooters where health doesn't regenerate, and looking to have an enjoyable experience throughout them, this game may as well be for you.  It's fun, chaotic, tells a simple story, and best of all, it's Serious Sam.","August 4, 2013","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You should try MENTAL difficulty argueable one of the most difficult difficulties in gaming so far. Enemies won't only be smart they'll also turn invisable for several seconds & re-appear making the already hard game almost crippling.\n\nIf you are not able to handle the difficulty don't fret you can set the game to "Tourist" difficult in-order to experience the game's story line & fun game mechanics\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is every weapon in the game is satisfying to use even the little pistol you fire has a bit of "Umph" to it as you fire it, some weapons such as the Double Barrel Shotgun work well on enemies like Kleers but it's slow re-load time makes it un-reliable in fire fights where constant fire is required.\n\nThe Multiplayer on the other hand is unbalanced at best, what it boils down to is: Who has the best gun, and even still it's still has some cheap shots in it.\n\nOther than that this game is up to 16 Player Co-operative mode which is insanely fun to play with freinds.\n\nThis game gets a big yes from me and everyone should try it.","December 19, 2013","true","114.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And both of them gave me the same amount of fun when I play with my own friends. Anyway, here's my review :\n1.Graphics\nStunning graphics with intense amount of blood and gore along the game. Almost every aspect of the graphics beautifully made in this game. The only downside was the crude animation when the characters speak.\n2.Sound\nI love the soundtracks ! It really fits your situation in the game and the music changes each time you're in a new situation.\n3.Gameplay\nThrilling, fun, and challenging. I can't even survive the Normal difficulty after playing FPS for 14 years. I'm also not new to the gameplay style, since I played Serious Sam : The First and The Second Encounter Co-Op with my dad when I was 6 years old. The health and armor supply in the map is really low that you have to fight really carefully to conserve your HP and armor.\n4.Pricing\nHonestly,it's not really expensive. Your money will really worth it and you'll get what you pay for. There's only 1 DLC and the game is 100% non pay to win.

But upon retrospect the game really comes across as a squandered opportunity.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with this game is it takes place in Egypt. The location of the first game. Having the game be a prequel to the first game really didn't make any sense to me, and I believe 3 would have been significantly stronger if they made it take place in a different location.\n\nThis was something Serious Sam 2 oddly enough was stronger with. Serious Sam 2 took place in Alien locations that contrasted the Egypt and Jungle/Arctic/Medieval maps from TFE and TSE.\n\nIn general the game is fine and a necessary improvement over the HD games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hambone_marone/recommended/41070/","hambone_marone","The King Of All Cosmos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hambone_marone/","247 products in account","So many great homages to classic First Person Shooters have come out recently, with Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset, Wolfenstein: The New Order, Rise of The Triad etc... So, what makes Serious Sam 3 stand out from the rest?\n\nWell, here are a few reasons: This game is perfect for playing with a friend. The whole game of Serious Sam revolves around you plaing in huge, open-ended enviornments, mowing down wave after wave of literally hundreds of enemies. Playing by yourself is intense, challenging, and down-right panic enducing. With a friend, the intensity is doubled, and the fun factor just shoots through the roof. Trying to separate the waves of enemies into two different targets is really challenging, and it feels even more satisfying when you've got a buddy.\n\nThe game's also down-right hilarious. The developers and writers knew what kind of game they were making, and they don't take themselves seriously at all. The game rags on itself, common action movie tropes, practically anything related to action movies in general.\n\nThe weapons are just straight-up badass. They even have a double-barreled shotgun (DooM's famous "Super Shotgun") that feels just like the classic iteration. Some of the weapons are down-right wacky - like the canonball launcher, which literally flattens hundreds of enemies at a time. The gunplay feels solid, and you feel like you can dole out some serious damage-- a thing that's lacking from a lot of modern-day FPS.\n\nThe amount of customization in the PC version is stellar, too. You can honestly get lost in the graphics settings menu. Seriously, more PC games need to take a hint from Croteam and allow this lush, rich level of customization options.\n\nI love classic First Person Shooters quite a bit, and I guess that's why I'm even more happy with this product. I'll be putting tons of hours into it before DooM comes out. I also highly recommend you check out the other games listed at the top of my review, but pick this one up first and go blow up some monsters.\n","June 20, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Serious Sam 3: BFE has all the old school styled FPS traits: holding an arsenal of weapons at once, fast paced projectile dodging, and exploring all the levels for any secrets you can find. It also has the frantic Serious Sam combat that makes these games so fun, with lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of enemies attacking you at the same time. It may sound unfair, but you're built like a tank, and it's a welcome change of pace from new-school's realistic-ish, combat with a couple of enemies hiding behind cover kind of gameplay. Especially when you co-op it with friends, it is a lot of fun to dodge through enemy rockets and fireballs while laying waste to hundreds of aliens.\n\nIt does have it's flaws though. While this is certainly not the kind of game you play for the story, the story is very weak with too many cheesy lines for it's own good. Also, besides some execution kills you can perform on weaker enemies, it doesn't add much to the established gameplay of the other Serious Sam titles, and that's probably not really possible with an old-school styled FPS. Most unforgiveable though, the first impressions on the game are not that great, with the first two or three levels having few enemies and an overall closed in level design. Give it some time though, the levels will open up and it will start barraging you with aliens to slaughter.\n\nIf you don't take yourself too seriously (pun intended) and are a bit tired of the common cover based shooting, this game is good for some fast paced, old school macho action.","December 22, 2011","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/recommended/41070/","Feyro","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/","533 products in account",""Let's get serious!"\n\nOf what the story is for Serious Sam in general, it wasn't fully told, or rather, didn't fully detail what went down in Sam's timeline before stuff went ka-blewy.  This game, it fully explains the backstory behind Sam's ventures into the past, and of what leads into Serious Sam 2 of him hopping from planet to planet to finding pieces of Sirian Artifacts.\n\nTo share a few gripes about it... it takes itself a bit too seriously.  Although it empasizes the old nature of arcade shooters of exploring to find secrets and stuff, about a third of the weapons are found through secrets only.  It's a let down, really, unlike the other Serious Sam games, you'd at least get to experience those other weapons once at the very most, or, make use of them quite often.\n\nThough Croteam boasts about the nature of their game, there is much to be seen for improvement.  Some effects can get a bit annoying at times, such as the lens flare, making it a tad impossible to see at times.  Their animations show their age as well, especially in third person... whoa-hoh-boy... if they didn't take this game too seriously, I'd have laughed along with them in their share of mistakes and blunders.\n\nTo the good about it, it does maintain that old arcade shooter feel of collecting armor and health, and of wielding enough fire power that's capable of taking down an entire city.  You can freely run amock throughout the levels running and gunning, executing certain enemies, messing around, or enjoying the gauntlets that are provided at times.\n\nIf you're a fan of shooters where health doesn't regenerate, and looking to have an enjoyable experience throughout them, this game may as well be for you.  It's fun, chaotic, tells a simple story, and best of all, it's Serious Sam.","August 4, 2013","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlazeHedgehog/recommended/41070/","BlazeHedgehog","BlazeHedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlazeHedgehog/","596 products in account","It takes a long time for Serious Sam 3 to feel like a proper Serious Sam game. You get the impression that it started out as a different game (specifically a military shooter) that later became a Serious Sam at some point. As a result, you'll spend upwards of three hours in weird, awkward urban environments shooting assault rifles at mutants. It's not fun, but it doesn't last forever, and gradually, the game reintroduces the increasingly large armies of bizarre enemies that Serious Sam is known for.\n\nOnce it gets there, it's pretty good. I enjoyed it more than Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, or Serious Sam 2, but there's still something... off-putting about it. I don't think Croteam quite has a bead on what made the first Serious Sam game so fun. You're constricted a little too much, the objectives sometimes feel a bit too complex for this type of game, and it takes itself just a tad too seriously. I know, right?\n\nThough I guess I prefer this game's tone to the how other Serious Sam sequels feel like cartoons, so  the fact it takes itself so seriously might not actually be a negative.\n\nIt's also HARD. I had more trouble finishing this game on normal difficulty than any of the other Serious Sam games. The final gauntlet throws an almost offensive number of very tough, very big enemies at you. In spite of this, the final boss himself is a bit of a let down.\n\nAs is the case with most Serious Sam games, it's probably way more fun in co-op.","June 2, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/recommended/41070/","thecoolstarsabove","Petra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoolstarsabove/","210 products in account","For each step taken forward, another step was taken back.\n\nSerious Sam 3, where do we begin with you? I grew up playing all of the Serious Sam games, starting from the very beginning. I've played most of the spin-off games as well, along with that god awful GBA port. I'll say as much; Serious Sam 3: BFE, is probably my least favorite game out of the main series. It doesn't mean it was bad, but it certainly needs a retrospective in the development of the next game.\n\nSerious Sam is, for all intents and purporses, a parody game of the gratituous action flicks of the 80s and 90s. Unlike Duke and his bravado of being an unflappable badass, Serious Sam opts to take a more corny approach. He comes off more like Ash from the movie Army of Darkness than John Matrix from Commando. Full of self-references and indulgence for making quips about the ridiculousness of it all, peppered with plenty of black comedy, it works wonderfully by itself.\n\nSerious Sam 3 does get plenty of what made the original games did right. The guns feel fantastic, Sam is still a talkative hardass and most of the classic enemies have returned, with some minor changes. Running jokes, running and gunning, it's all great fun. The graphics are stellar and everything feels crisp. In games like these, the plot takes a backseat to the gameplay at hand, and for good reason. All we know is that Sam's gotta bust an alien army and save the world, that's it. Anything else acts as a transition between levels and sets up the scene. When it comes to controlling, there is only one flaw I can think of and it pertains to Sam's unusually heavy jumping, making platforming somewhat of a hassle.\n\nDespite staying true to the original Serious Sam, specifically the First Encounter, it is ultimately the biggest flaw - it stays TOO close to the original. All of the levels are in Egypt. You get a wide variety of: open desert, desert with shrines and temples, underground desert temples, and desert favelas. None of the creative, interesting levels from the Second Encounter or Serious Sam 2 make an appearance in this game. As a result, the game gets VERY repetitive in a short amount of time, which is further compounded by the sheer size of levels in Serious Sam games. Much of the humour relies on one-liners and banters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. However, SS2 went way out of the box and went balls to the wall with silliness, so it's a shame to see 99% of it getting passed over in this rendition. NETRICSA, Sam's "in-game guide" so to speak has also been neutered as well, offering less information from before and just not worth reading, whereas in previous games, you could read the data sheets of enemies and get a glut of both funny and useful information.\n\nHad there been more level and environment variety with a bit more risk taken, this would have been a much better game. But I can't fault it for what it is, it's still Serious Sam. Buy it when it's more than 50% on sale and you'll get, what I feel, is the right pricepoint for it.\n\n6.5/10.","May 28","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Performance is unreasonably good, the options menu makes Mad Max look consolized, and it's divided nicely into CPU Performance / GPU Speed / GPU Performance with five presets each.\n\nSo yeah, good purchase, good use of the money I previously wasted on id's Rage and its awful engine.","March 21","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a prequel... Why does it always have to be a prequel?\n\nSerious Sam 3 is a classic FPS with a very classic structure. This prequel marks a return to the classic first 2 encounters with renewed graphics, weapons, enemies and a new story. Yes, story. Serious sam isn't exactly famous for its deep story, but this chapter has put some effort in it. Some cutscenes, few other characters and dialogues and some events explaining what sam did before the first encounter. Of course, this isn't a Kojima production, but you can see the difference with the previous chapters.\nAs a classic FPS there's not much to say, mechanics are the usual, and as every other SS you will face huge waves of enemies with the classic arsenal.\nActually there's not much to say, the engine is not the Cryengine but Croteam shows a great taste with environments and landscapes building great levels with great visual impact as usual. Enemies and Weapons are the classic as seen in the first encounter, but revisited and kind of updated, with just a couple of news. Music is Badass again, with epic tunes, Heavy boss tracks and some tracks with a touch of tension tracks in some dark and closed map sections (which is kind of new and strange to see in a Serious Sam game... O.o... But kind of welcome, anyways).\nShortly, Serious Sam 3 gives us a very good prequel with the classic sarcasm and fun situations, Hordes of enemies to take down with the classic arsenal, everything shown with the new version of the good and trusty Serious Engine.\n\n+++Pros+++ ENGINE. The serious engine has never made any miracle but it always showed beautiful landscapes and settings, and this time makes no exception.\nGAMEPLAY. The classic Waves gameplay is always fun to play as the first 2 encounter, and Sam is always a funny A$$h0l3 whenever e has the chance to talk... Which is quite often... XD\nCOOP. The game is playable in Coop as every other chapter and it's obviously more fun to play.\nSOUNDTRACK. A beautiful soundtrack again in this chapter with Epic tunes, Badass Heavy boss tracks and even tense tracks for dark sections.---Cons--- LEVELS. Even though there's a good alternation between indoor sections (Temples, dark dungeons) and outdoor locations (the city, Desert), they may kind of look repetitive. For example This never happens in the Second encounter as it has many different themed locations.","January 1","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game takes the player back to the time when Quake ruled the FPS world: no health regeneration, loadouts*, radar, or quest arrow. Everything one needs to begin the massive extermination of monsters are to be found somewhere in the levels. Moreover, there are tons of secret areas so keep a lookout for them.\n\nThe story is very straightforward: the protagonist, Sam Stone, is on a quest to stop the Mental's invasion on Earth. The game is set in Egypt so expect a lot of sandy areas and labyrinths. The player will find a variety of weapons throughout the game: sledgehammer, pistol, shotguns, minigun, explosives, etc. Despite being oldschool overall, the game has the option to aim down sights (ADS), sprint, and manual reload**. Speaking of variety, there are many types of aliens to obliterate, ranging from kamikazes and rocketeers to gnaars and kleer skeletons. The game can be very intense and I do not recommend long sessions, for it may become a bit mind-numbing.\n\nApart from the single player campaign, the game features a co-op (up to 16 players) campaign, survival, and PvP multiplayer. It is important to keep in mind that the more the players there are in co-op, the stronger the enemies. Survival is a mode where the players have to defend themselves from waves of aliens and the PvP multiplayer features classic modes like deathmatch, capture the flag, and so on. It relies on peer-to-peer connection so it may get very laggy.\n\nAll in all, I recommend playing this game. The solid mechanics, hordes of enemies, and a wide selection of weaponry provide hours of fun, especially in the co-op mode. It also happens to be on sale fairly often. A 7/10.\n\n*Quake Live is an exception to the franchise.\n**There is an achievement for finishing the game "ol' style", meaning no sprinting, reloading, or aiming down sights.\n\nP.S.

And it's a prequel to the first game plot-wise, whoop! BFE is abbrovation for Before First Encoutner, they say. It came out in 2011, being made by Croteam. And it's serious!\nIt also came out for Xbox 360 and PS3. Probably nothing to check out here, maybe it supports less players in multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer community is still there. They mostly play coop all the time. Coop survival is less played. And you are likely to get Versus game only on some hours, who knows, it's not as liked by general people. No one plays modded version of game.\nThat, or you can call your friend to play in split-screen anyway.\n\nAnd yes, you are once again Sam Stone, who is now wearing cool sunglasses. And this time you are going to kill many Mental's minions and maybe rip some eyes. To save the earth! Maybe. As long as you stay serious. Seriously serious!\n\nAnd yep, it now goes back to more realistical setting than Serious Sam 2. And you know what? It's awesome. It's like exactly what I always wanted the next installment of Serious Sam back when I was a fan of the first game, before Serious Sam 2 destroyed the dreams. I mean, cmon, you get to play Serious Sam prequel where you shoot kamikazes in ruined town. It's awesome!\n\nAnd music is still awesome and atmospheric, though this time more forgettable. And scenes are epic. And graphics are great.\n\nThen again, some complain that it might be a bit too serious. But I think it's on same level as The First Encounter. It's belivable plot combined with jokish secrets. And small details. That, and yes, it also has dark tomb levels where player even has slower movement speed, being interesting to explore for a change. No worries, it's not Doom 3. And I can agrue that it brought back memories of the third level of First Encounter which is part of what I liked as well. So I am very happy as a fan here.\n\nIt also added some more of modern gameplay elements into it. At least this is what our usual gamers would call them. But they aren't used as much as one might think and mostly is true only for low-tier weapons.  You can aim with assault rifle and pistol down the sight, which slows you down but makes accuaricy perfect. No worries, minigun still doesn't require any aiming and is accurate like sniper rifle.\n\nFew guns also require reloading. It actually fits to pistol and Devastator, a fast-shooting 20-ammo-in-mag explosive railgun thing.  For single-barreled shotgun and assault rifle? Not much. It does make early levels more interesting, having to worry about reloading as rare enemy charges at you. But on bad side, they become mroe painful to use in later levels, so you don't want to change from stronger Double-Shotgun and Minigun. Ok, at least Assault Rifle and Minigun use different ammo, so here is at least "saving ammo".\n\nBut sprinting is actually a very good addition to Serious Sam franchises. Did you ever think "ok, so it has good speed during battles and I enjoy these huge levels but once I killed everybody walking from one corner of huge valley to another to get all secrets is soooo boring"? Yep, we now have infinite sprint. You can't shoot and can run only forward. So during battle when you dont' sprint the speed and balance is similar to older Serious Sam. And sometimes you can sprint to take a new position, as each arena is much bigger here. It's actually the first Serious game where you can outrun kamikazes this way. And outside of battle it makes it less boring to explore enviroment, taking less time to move on. Perfect addition.\n\nAnd yea, melee kills. They have no gameplay bonus like health regeneration, so you mostly do it for fancyness. After battle. They are tasteful, not as awful as Brutal Doom, no worries.\n\nYep, it's still a good new Serious Sam game. You get new toys to play with. C4 is awesome addition, being hugely explosive. Having a lot of destructable decorations and columns helps to make it super awesome. New enemies. New balance to learn and master. Maybe "space monkeys" that hide behind columns is a bit unfitting to Serious Sam, but they help with variety and motivate you to destroy columns. And hey, new feature weapon, mutilator, is kinda fancy, where you lasso few enemies and they expode after some time of charging up energy. Whoop!\n\nLevels are much bigger this time around. Or more exactly, each room is bigger. You aren't as much closed down into arena and you got a lot of room to move. Or even unrestricted at all, which is very different from what we had before. It's still linear, but it's awesome.\n\nThe only big flaw is how slow and weak the first third of a game is. They go way too slow with giving player new weapons to try out. I mean, I love when I don't get flooded with weapons and options, letting me to savour low-tier weapons for a while. But Serious Sam has two levels in straight where you only have only one non-basic weapon - single-barreled shotgun. And in both levels you fight bulletspongy bosses. Other Serious games would have given you new weapon by that time, letting you think "what should I use in this situation". Really, this is one case where removing a level would have made overall game better.\n\nAnd yep, this game also includes survival game mode that you can play in single-player or cooperatively. Around five maps. Two of them even have you starting with little weapons, slowly giving you stronger enemies and weapons. It's a good fun.\n\nThen there are cooperative modes, with infinite respawn or with limited lives. It's a good fun and people will be happy to find out that this time coop mode has cutscenes from single-player as well, which are also skippable. Finally! Not to mentioning that you can play with friend in split-screen.\n\nIt has versus mode as well. I am not exactly fan of it, the first impession was horrible. Server with infinite ammo and map that has C4 mix awfully. Neither does map where you can exploit to get into rooftop and spam C4. Then there is a level which is nothing but tomb corridors, because all yay super-shotgun reflex and no maneuvering. And Trouble map from old games is now looking both ugly and there are less ways to move due to different physics and scale.\nBut in other maps? Yep, it's still a good fun. No worries, no melee fatalities in this one. It's not terribly unique either, sadly, but it's fun.\n\nOverall, it's an awesome game that I always wanted to get as fan of Serious Sam 1. While it has a flaw or few, it's epic and I love that it explores the setting of modern Serious Sam universe before he time travelled. It has that slight apocalypstic feel to it and is just plain Serious. Doesn't dissapoint gameplay-wise either. Thanks, Croteam.","May 21","true","35.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

If it shoots bullets, kill it first! in fact, kill anything that has a range advantage over your first, unless it's friggin' kleers, those buggers are annoying.\n3. The best targets for C4 are as follows: Khnums, scrapjacks, witch-brides, major biomechanoids.\n4. firing off a few rockets and switching to the minigun or assault rifle is a surprisingly  good strategy.\n5. above all costs, shoot kamikazes first, you'll live to shoot that scrapjack trying to  reduce you to giblets.\n6.

Её как я и ожидал улучшили, но одно меня огорчило. Движок Serious Engine 3.5 абсолютно кривой и его кривизна заметна. На моменте когда Сэм вырывает глаз гнаару хочется плакать, вид от 3го лица вообще лучше не включать. Если уж делать игру с кооперативом, то надо ж его до ума довести. Смотреть как твой партнёр держит оружие ладошками просто смешно и на то как Сэм передвигается сидя без слёз не взглянешь. Ну если откинуть движок и все его недочёты, то игра получилась очень крутой хоть непродолжительной, всего около 3-6 часов. Разработчикам удалось сохранить ту атмосферу которая была в предыдущих двух частях, когда на тебя бежит толпа разгневанных пришельцев и тебе ничего не остаётся, кроме того чтобы взять миниган и всех их похоронить.Саунтрэк просто сногшибательный, куча новых врагов, куча нового оружия, кооператив на 16 человек, все теже коронные фразочки Сэма, всё это подарило незабываемое удовольствие от игры.Конечно же игра не стоит своих 600 рублей, но на распрадаже по скидкам взять и поиграть с друзьями просто необходимо! Вобщем оценка моя такова 9.7 было бы 10 если бы движок доработали,а так игра крутая всем советую.","July 7, 2013","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No. Not by a long shot. It's actually one of the most riotously funny good times you can have on Steam. Beyond the humor and sort of ironic affability of the main character, the core gameplay is tough as nails but rewarding. All of the mechanics work almost perfectly, making the only thing contributing to your constant deaths your own incompetence.\n\nIt's a fast, fun, furious kind of experience, and definitely something that you'll get a lot of mileage out of.\n\n(For my full reviews and gaming news, check out digitaldevils.net)","December 29, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the future. Mankind has gone off into space. Evil aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Earth has been invaded. Humans are screwed. Sam is humanity's last hope. He doesn't give a damn, he's good with a gun, and high explosives are the perfect solution to most of his problems. Most of the dialogue is corny with a side helping of heavy cheese, but there are a few laughs sprinkled throughout. The game isn't afraid to poke fun at genre conventions, and Sam is more or less a self-aggrandizing caricature of the "buff dumb hero" stereotype.\n\nMost of the enemies are familiar, with headless kamikaze troopers, laser-spewing Biomechanoids and vicious Kleer skeletons returning with their familiar attacks in place. Every enemy has been redesigned to make them look more detestable and even disturbing than ever.\n\nSerious Sam 3: BFE is not a game for the faint of heart. It will challenge your resolve while it constantly pushes you back under a tidal wave of skeletons, fireballs, rockets and chaingun-wielding scorpions. Its levels can last up to an hour, its gameplay never deviates from one note, and it will cause players to thump their desks and roar with rage, but it's so much fun.","December 9, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JudgeRedeemer/recommended/41070/","JudgeRedeemer","JudgeRedeemer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JudgeRedeemer/","164 products in account","Serving as a prequel to the original indie sensation, Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Serious Sam 3: BFE takes place during the Earth's final struggle against Mental's invading legions of beasts and mercenaries.\n\nThe story, as it were, is pretty thin. It's the future. Mankind has gone off into space. Evil aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Earth has been invaded. Humans are screwed. Sam is humanity's last hope. He doesn't give a damn, he's good with a gun, and high explosives are the perfect solution to most of his problems. Most of the dialogue is corny with a side helping of heavy cheese, but there are a few laughs sprinkled throughout. The game isn't afraid to poke fun at genre conventions, and Sam is more or less a self-aggrandizing caricature of the "buff dumb hero" stereotype.\n\nMost of the enemies are familiar, with headless kamikaze troopers, laser-spewing Biomechanoids and vicious Kleer skeletons returning with their familiar attacks in place. Every enemy has been redesigned to make them look more detestable and even disturbing than ever.\n\nSerious Sam 3: BFE is not a game for the faint of heart. It will challenge your resolve while it constantly pushes you back under a tidal wave of skeletons, fireballs, rockets and chaingun-wielding scorpions. Its levels can last up to an hour, its gameplay never deviates from one note, and it will cause players to thump their desks and roar with rage, but it's so much fun.","December 9, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then get this one (or at least think about buying when it's on sale). Great old-school-shooter. Countless enemies to kill, wave after wave, it won't stop, your trigger-finger will hurt, your eyes will bleed, you will get stomped, shot down, get blown away by your own C4, get lasered, get kicked away by alien cows, you will surf alien cows, will kill nude witches and harpys and finally, you'll find the cannon gun and make the earth crumble. Starts off kind of slow with some rather ugly levels but then transforms into the old fun we once knew from the first part of the series: beautiful, vast desert areas full of primitive, mindless shooting (and egyptian monuments to destroy). But don't let the word 'primitive' fool you. The game can be quite challenging in some parts and on harder difficulty, at least some tactical approach is needed, especially when playing alone. Of course, one of the greatest aspects of Serious Sam was and still is the Co-Op. The more the merrier! Deathmatch and other PvP is also fun, but hard to find nowadays and nothing you can/should play competitive. All in all, serious fun!\n\nPRO\nbeautiful desert areas\ngreat number of enemies at once\nold-school shooter gameplay\ngreat co-op game\ngood replay value due to extra modes (survival etc.) and challenging difficulties\nCON\nit has a story and cutscenes (no one needed that)\nSams one-liner could be better\nsome levels (especially the first ones) are not so good","December 16, 2014","true","54.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is plain hard to advance in this game. Even in the first levels there are parts with so many enemies that you get out of ammo really fast.\n\nI hate the running Kleer skeletons, since they are not easy to kill, are fast and take a lot of life when hitting you. and the fact that they jump and have a long range attack is even worst.\n\nThe game has a lot of jokes, and Sam sometimes says nice catchphrases and comments about the situation. The story is basically kill everything until you finish the level. In a few parts it is necessary to collect some keys to advance.\n\nThe best of the game is actually the cannon. There is no better friend than a cannon when in tight corridors with many enemies coming your way.\n\nthe game also features the melee attacks, which are somewhat gruesome, but interesting to use in the few moments that you are not fighting 20 enemies or more at once.\n\nIt is a good game to spend a few hours finishing.","January 14, 2014","true","59.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Croteam knew what Serious Sam community wanted: Same core gameplay with differences in enemy and weaponry selection, level design and much more.\nWhen I mentioned the differences in enemy selection, I meant that they look much more threatening compare to the previous titles. Oh and one more thing, the game DOESN'T force you to sprint or aim down the sight.\n\nNow, the first few levels might trick some of you into thinking that it almost imitates Call of Duty (since 4th) like level design but afterwards, levels get really big and gorgeous-looking.\n\nThere is one flaw. Last boss battle.\nWhile the boss itself looks really cool, the way you need to defeate him, isn't interesting and fun in the very least and it feels like it was thrown there the last minute before the game was finished in its development process.\n\nIt also has a survival mode which it is self-explanatory and it is amazing and fun way to test your survival and reflex skills.\n\nVersus multiplayer is nothing you are missing out.\nCo-op is fun, especially survival.\n\nAs for DLC, Jewel of the Nile, it adds more action and entertainment to the game.\nThe achievements are great as well.\n\n----------------------\n\nIn summation, I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially to the fans of old-school FPS'.

The double barreled shotgun is, like in every game, a life-saving fella though.\nOh and the Syrian Mutilator? Seriously? More like "Syrian Slowly-Waste-Away-ilator". If it takes up to 5 seconds or more to kill a simple beheaded guy that thing is just a better wristwatch.\n\nPros:\nLater in the game the battles get more challenging and get almost close to those of the older SS games. Even the leveldesign gets more interesting when the modern egyptian suburbs are being displaced by ancient egyptian buildings. I wish they would have done that from the very beginning.\n\nIf there was a button like "neutral", I would choose that for my review.\n\nOh and PS: This game lacks a lot of color.","January 21, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Croteam knew what Serious Sam community wanted: Same core gameplay with differences in enemy and weaponry selection, level design and much more.\nWhen I mentioned the differences in enemy selection, I meant that they look much more threatening compare to the previous titles. Oh and one more thing, the game DOESN'T force you to sprint or aim down the sight.\n\nNow, the first few levels might trick some of you into thinking that it almost imitates Call of Duty (since 4th) like level design but afterwards, levels get really big and gorgeous-looking.\n\nThere is one flaw. Last boss battle.\nWhile the boss itself looks really cool, the way you need to defeate him, isn't interesting and fun in the very least and it feels like it was thrown there the last minute before the game was finished in its development process.\n\nIt also has a survival mode which it is self-explanatory and it is amazing and fun way to test your survival and reflex skills.\n\nVersus multiplayer is nothing you are missing out.\nCo-op is fun, especially survival.\n\nAs for DLC, Jewel of the Nile, it adds more action and entertainment to the game.\nThe achievements are great as well.\n\n----------------------\n\nIn summation, I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially to the fans of old-school FPS'. It is a great investment.\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","134.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice graphics and awesome retro-shooter styled gameplay.\nFramerate is all over the place. Going from 30 to 60 isn't really uncommon throughout the game. Uncommon would be maintaining a consistent framerate, but if you set the graphics options correctly, you won't notice anything, other than the already pretty obvious blood and gore.\nNothing really sets the game back other than it's 40€ normal price tag, and the lack of versus servers with a decent ping, though the latter isn't much of an issue because the game is made more for co-op anyway.\nOverall, much like the predecessors, there isn't much that can top Serious Sam 3 for balls to the wall shooting fun out there, so if you want to play a game with a bunch of friends and don't wanna think to much, this is a great option right here.\n\nAlso,\n\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....","April 24, 2012","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Serious Sam 3: BFE shows me a different perspective of how this was all started. The mechanics are fairly the same as for the others in the official series campaign (excluding the indie games) just run, gun, blow up, and basically 'shoot everything that moves!' Along with the (not entirely rspected) modernized mechanics for sprinting, which is extremely helpful in some cases of survivalbility. Aiming sights, which is kind of dumb having to do that because the original games had their guns automatically pinpoint accurate. And the melee which is a nice touch for me, giving more killing varieties. The levels for this game are MASSIVE and have secrets scattered about everywhere, but I am not going to complain how people think the level designs are 'linear.' Just to note that the classic games had linearity of their own perspective, but not big. The music ambience is really soothing, battle music fits my tastes, and boss music gives a big sense of adrenaline for me. The artstyle for me is decent, I do enjoy its 'semi-realism' approach; but I go for the classic's artstyle which had more cartoonish aspects to it. The weapons are still as devastating as ever. The enemy count is HUGE and there are some new variety of enemies now, though not much more, but some. The DLC (Jewel of the Nile) topped the icing, bringing what fans more wanted.\nMy overall verdict: Buy it!","December 28, 2013","true","236.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then get this one (or at least think about buying when it's on sale). Great old-school-shooter. Countless enemies to kill, wave after wave, it won't stop, your trigger-finger will hurt, your eyes will bleed, you will get stomped, shot down, get blown away by your own C4, get lasered, get kicked away by alien cows, you will surf alien cows, will kill nude witches and harpys and finally, you'll find the cannon gun and make the earth crumble. Starts off kind of slow with some rather ugly levels but then transforms into the old fun we once knew from the first part of the series: beautiful, vast desert areas full of primitive, mindless shooting (and egyptian monuments to destroy). But don't let the word 'primitive' fool you. The game can be quite challenging in some parts and on harder difficulty, at least some tactical approach is needed, especially when playing alone. Of course, one of the greatest aspects of Serious Sam was and still is the Co-Op. The more the merrier! Deathmatch and other PvP is also fun, but hard to find nowadays and nothing you can/should play competitive. All in all, serious fun!\n\nPRO\nbeautiful desert areas\ngreat number of enemies at once\nold-school shooter gameplay\ngreat co-op game\ngood replay value due to extra modes (survival etc.) and challenging difficulties\nCON\nit has a story and cutscenes (no one needed that)\nSams one-liner could be better\nsome levels (especially the first ones) are not so good","December 16, 2014","true","54.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This commando is known as Sam and he is deadly serious.\n\nSerious Sam adventures through harsh dunes filled with ungodly creatures neither truly defined as machine nor beast (but both) , smashing their toes with sledgehammers, ripping of their eye(s) and ripping off heads.\n\nAll the while a leviathan of the sand rears it's massive head in the background of sam's bloody wake.\n\nThis creature is known as "The Sandwhale".\n\nSam vows to kill this massive creature so that he may place it's amber colored jewel upon his crown. A treasure...a trophy.\n\nSam defeats literally hundreds of waves of foes with rockets, shotguns, and sexy blue whips...all the while that damned Sandwhale is hauntingly dancing and laughing in his whalish tongue at him on the horizon.\n\nThe Sandwhale screaks it's taunting calls to Sam. Sam can feel it now, the time of reckoning is close.\n\nSam finally arrives at his final destination, "all lines end here" he thinks to himself as the glorious seas of unfinished glass rumble and the maw of the Earth opens to reveal the dormant creature. A lightning storm approached from the West.\n\n" THE TIME IS NOW! IT BEGINS! " Sam yells as he runs towards the fissure.\n\nBut, this creature is nothing of what Sam expected. It featured long spider-like legs that stood like tent poles all around him.\nThere were no naughty bits. It had the body of Putin, The Russian Overlord's chest and arms. Upon this massive body was the head that was equally big and equally dumb...with four million eyes, some of which had crusty goodies (you know, that crap you get in the morning)\n\nFor the first time in his life, Sam didn't know what to do....He was so focused on the Sandy Mammal that he never prepared for anything bigger. All hope was lost....Earth's only champion would not be enough.\n\n*THE EARTH BEGAN TO QUAKE*\n\nThe Sandwhale breached the ground and dove into the unknown beast.\n\nSam's eyes exploded. Could this be true? The very creature which he was trying to slay...was saving him.\n\nSam's heart was filled with love and sadness at the same time. "My God" he whispered.\n\nSam then strapped on a jetpack that randomly spawned and threw steel rods (which also randomly spawned) into the creature.\n\nThe angry storm grabbed onto the rods with it's electric tendrils and began to shock the creature to it's bones.\n\nThe creature fell to it's spidey knees in defeat.\n\nSam had won. The Sandwhale had won.\n\n(I forgot to mention that all this time for some reason The Moon has been traveling towards the Earth)\n\n\nSam's eyes fell to The Sandwhale.\n\nThe Moon slammed into the Earth...and the pure, raw, and unadulterated heat melded their hearts and bodies together. It was like the heat of a thousand suns.\n\nThe Earth was no more.\n\nBut their love was so strong they had survived. Only they were no longer they...but one.\n\n"Sam Whale"\n\nTHE END\n\n- The greatest love story ever told -\n\n\nTL:DR; We named the Helicopter with tentacles Kevin Pollak.","February 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't bad though. In fact, it is far from that in my opinion. It stays true to the Serious Sam series and doesn't alter the main gameplay mechanics. Only things new are the option to reload and the addition of melee attacks, both of which I am cool with. Very difficult though, even on its Tourist difficulty. I recommend it if you're a diehard Serious Sam fan, otherwise you may find it kinda meh.

After all, the tutorial of Serious sam 1 had more than 500 enemies in it.\n\nWell, for the first 4 levels, this game doesn't deliver that. Instead, we're in cluttered city, with small weapons, and very few enemies (about 150-200 per level). It seems like the developpers wanted to introduce the world of Serious Sam slowly for people who are more used to modern games such as Call of Duty. It does deliver some hard fights because you don't have many weapons, but it's not that fun after a while\n\nHowever, if you manage to get over that first phase, you will finally get your rocket launcher at the end of level 4, and your first big arena at the end of level 5. And then, you will finally get the Serious Sam game you were looking for. The big arenas are back, with tons of ammo (sometimes even boxes of infinite ammo) for you to be able to use the biggest and most badass weapons without a second thought. Waves of enemies will come, and you will mercilessly mow them down.\n\nMore over, that second part of the game is cleverly designed. Instead of just being endless slaughter after endless slaughter, the game manages to provide some variety. For example, it will often alternate between the big open arenas where you can be as badass as you want, and some underground, claustrophobic corridors, where the limited vision offered by your flashlight will make you a prey. There are also others set pieces that I will not spoil for you. Suffice to say that once the game finally start rolling, it's hard to put down, it does a lot of stuff very well, up to the final level, which is utterly insane, and a great conclusion to the game.\n\nOn the technical side, the Serious Sam 3 engine is extremely impressive, it manages to have dozens of enemies on the screen at the time, while looking gorgeous, and also have destructible terrain. If you or one of the enemy uses rockets, or C4, you will be able to blow up almost any obstacle, for example to remove the cover of an enemy, or to help give you a better line of sight on far away enemies.\n\nFinally, I want to give a mentions to the soundtrack which is fantastic, and accompagnies the game extremely well. Big thumbs up for that.\n\nSo my final word is easy : buy this game, get over the first four levels even if you're not that happy with them, and you will be rewarded by a great game of utter mayhem and joyous use of rocket launcher.","May 30, 2014","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is decent, the graphics are pretty awesome but more importantly the gameplay is fun. Hordes upon hordes of crazier than crazy enemies running right at you in an attempt to do the impossible: kill Serious Sam. The game is fairly difficult on the default setting, making it a nice challenge. Just get through the first few levels and you'll start seeing the old school shooter that this game really is. The only issue I could mention is the length and perhaps the pacing. The single player campaign takes about 10-12 hours - and the first few hours are very slow, compared to the rest. Playing through the game on different difficulties could make it last longer and there is a survival mode, not to mention multiplayer.

Reminded me of the old DukeNukem style of game. I was stuck in the first mission thinking if I killed everything they would stop coming and that I would just walk to the objective. Wrong! I am in two minds whether this is a good or bad thing as you get rated at the end of the mission how many kills, how many secrets and how long you take. Well you can keep killing guys and take forever and get a crap score or you can run to the objective not worrying to much about the aliens and get a decent score. Not quite balance in that regard.\nAn ejoyable game.

The double barreled shotgun is, like in every game, a life-saving fella though.\nOh and the Syrian Mutilator? Seriously? More like "Syrian Slowly-Waste-Away-ilator". If it takes up to 5 seconds or more to kill a simple beheaded guy that thing is just a better wristwatch.\n\nPros:\nLater in the game the battles get more challenging and get almost close to those of the older SS games. Even the leveldesign gets more interesting when the modern egyptian suburbs are being displaced by ancient egyptian buildings. I wish they would have done that from the very beginning.\n\nIf there was a button like "neutral", I would choose that for my review.\n\nOh and PS: This game lacks a lot of color.","January 21, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Melee kills are kind of neat once, but you just don't have time for them by the point the game has ramped up to a proper Serious level.\n\nIt doesn't matter. It's still Sam. Soon the trappings of more modern shooters fall away and leave you with the familiar old tools, weaving your way through a herd of Kleer while trying to deal with the approaching gigantic horror before it steps on you. It doesn't really progress the series in any way but graphically (the plot has gone backwards again), but it can get away with being another iteration of the solid fast-and-fluid FPS and leave you grinning from the adrenaline.","January 2","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

На моменте когда Сэм вырывает глаз гнаару хочется плакать, вид от 3го лица вообще лучше не включать. Если уж делать игру с кооперативом, то надо ж его до ума довести.

Ну если откинуть движок и все его недочёты, то игра получилась очень крутой хоть непродолжительной, всего около 3-6 часов. Разработчикам удалось сохранить ту атмосферу которая была в предыдущих двух частях, когда на тебя бежит толпа разгневанных пришельцев и тебе ничего не остаётся, кроме того чтобы взять миниган и всех их похоронить.Саунтрэк просто сногшибательный, куча новых врагов, куча нового оружия, кооператив на 16 человек, все теже коронные фразочки Сэма, всё это подарило незабываемое удовольствие от игры.Конечно же игра не стоит своих 600 рублей, но на распрадаже по скидкам взять и поиграть с друзьями просто необходимо! Вобщем оценка моя такова 9.7 было бы 10 если бы движок доработали,а так игра крутая всем советую.","July 7, 2013","true","56.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geoson/recommended/41070/","Geoson","Geoson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geoson/","522 products in account","Serious Sam 3 takes the classic fast paced action and frantic gun selection of the early 90s and adds some nice spice from newer mechanics introduced in the modern day FPS genre.\n\nOften I found myself wrecklessly attacking my foes as death lingered just around the corner. Vast and expansive areas filled with hundreds of enemies swarming at me. Serious Sam is not only a tight shooter, but one that has some of the most impressive battles.\n\nWhat makes Serious Sam really work is the ability to truly fine tune your experience. You can make co-op a rather enjoyable and hiliarious shooter, or you can make it competitive and difficult, the choice is yours.\n\nDying WILL happen. This game can be out right sinister with the tricks and situations it puts you in, and only your skills and smart thinking will get you through.\n\nHowever as great fun as that all is, what brings the game down is really itself. I found that often times killing enemies can get REALLY tedious and breaks are something of a must when looking to complete the game.\n\nSingle player is also dull without anyone to experience the ridiculous traps and cheesy jokes and B movie dialogue.\n\nMultiplayer (Not Co-op) just feels a bit tacked on and really doesn't encompass what makes Sam, well, Sam. It can be fun for an hour or so, but I would really only play it to duke it out with some friends on a rare occasion.\n\nAlso, the last level is absolutely BRUTAL, and I can't imagine doing it without infinite lives and a partner. Definitely my most fond memory of the game.\n\n\n\nLiked:\n- Fast\n- Action packed\n- Co-op galore\n\n\nDisliked:\n- Repetitive\n\n\n\nOverall, what Sam 3 does is fun. It might not be perfect and often times dull, but when you get the chance for this game to shine it can really blow you away. One of my favorite Co-op games, and something I would recommend to anyone that has just a close friend, or even up to 16 cool dudes. 7/10","February 16, 2015","true","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sprint option in the game is great for dodging those kamikazes and kleers left and right. The melee option now makes the game even more gory than it used to be. Aim down sights is kind of cool, but somewhat useless since it just slows you down and only increases accuracy by a small percentage. It would be nice if the lasergun wasn't an easter egg and was an actual gun that was meant to be used ingame. Same thing with the sniper. Two of my favorite weapons from the old games aside from the minigun and cannon. Another note, this is possibly one of the only Serious Sam games without the serious bomb to nuke enemies, but the game makes up for it with the new features to help you with escaping and retreating to ammo and armor. All in all, my favorite game in the series and can't wait for the next installment where we get to possibly see Mental's ugly face.","February 15","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plagued by regenerating health, energy shields, power armor, unimaginative weapons, and hiding behind cover. At the very bottom of this pile of crap is a single jem, a jem that shines brightly and will restore your faith in the FPS genre. The Serious Sam series brings back health and armor pickups, big badass weapons and a ton of bullets and rockets to shoot at bazillions of enemies charging, shooting and screaming right at you and ripping your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wide open if you stand still for more than 5 seconds. That's right, bazillions of enemies. There could be more enemies in one Serious Sam game than there are in the entire Call of Duty franchise put together. If you don't want to get shot, then you better up your strafing game, because you'll be strafing and backpedaling more than you'll be walking forwards. Hope you can hit a moving target son, or you might as well put on your tutu and go back to ballet class if you can't handle the amount of screaming madness this game is throwing at you from all directions.\n\n10/10 Papa DOOM would be proud.","July 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't bad though. In fact, it is far from that in my opinion. It stays true to the Serious Sam series and doesn't alter the main gameplay mechanics. Only things new are the option to reload and the addition of melee attacks, both of which I am cool with. Very difficult though, even on its Tourist difficulty. I recommend it if you're a diehard Serious Sam fan, otherwise you may find it kinda meh.

The fastest way to describe it would be to call it the first Serious Sam game wearing the mask of a modern FPS. The level design varies from the ruins of Cairo to ancient Egyptian cities but all feature three main things. Large open ares, massive hordes and big damm guns. Theres quite a bit of variation in enemies and weapons to keep it from getting repetitive but having said this, some enemy attacks can become very annoying, especially when you've just grabbed a minigun are in the zone.

It is one of the worst games I've ever played, period.\n\nThe gameplay is worse than Quake; plot worse than Duke Nuke'em; graphics on par with Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6; the overall experience as mindless and boring as Solitaire--games I disliked for a multitude of reasons, true, but games that have EXCUSES for their bad, dated elements. But in its blatant ripping off of the worst features of tired genres, SS3:BFE can't even claim originality as a saving grace. The only excuse its developers could possibly offer is apathy and laziness.\n\nAs a fan of terrible, B-movies, I enjoyed the terribly voiced (by a literal strip-club bouncer), latently homoerotic dialogue immensely; and as a staunch ally of the LGBTQ community, I am glad that this game is targeting the closeted-homosexual demographic. However, the hours one has to spend getting from one ridiculous cut scene to another just aren't worth it--rent 300, Top Gun, or Superbad instead.","March 25, 2012","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/41070/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Serious Sam 3 BFE is actually a prequel of the previous Serious Sam games, with BFE meaning Before First Encounter. You’ll see a lot of similarities between the main character Sam Stone, and Duke Nukem, the other super macho hero from around the same gaming era. The games are quite different though. Where Duke Nukem Forever (the latest Duke game) tried to model itself as a modern shooter, Serious Sam 3 sticks to its roots of being a You vs 10000 enemies type horde shooter. Each enemy has just enough life that you need to focus your fire on them as a hundred others come running at you. You’ll spend a lot of the game running backwards as you lay down the fire.\n\nUnlike the previous Serious Sam games (First Encounter, Second Encounter, Serious Sam 2) BFE takes place in the future. Unfortunately, in this future the Earth has been overrun by aliens and the whole game occurs in devastated cities and ancient Egyptian ruins. Serious Sam 3’s story is mostly about how Sam needs to activate and use an ancient Sirian (alien) device called the Time Lock, which will allow him to go back in time and prevent the alien invasion.  There isn’t really a primary antagonist for the game, although Sam’s old enemy Mental (the boss in previous games) is mentioned as being the leader of the aliens.\n\nBFE is an old school first person shooter with loads of health/ammo pickups, loads of enemies, and a bunch of big ♥♥♥ bosses to fight. The sheer number of enemies practically guarantees that you take damage in every engagement, but there’s so much health and armor laying around that the game is a huge survival match.  This is one of those games where I would actually recommend people to play on one of the easier difficulties the first time through. There’s a lot of stress relief to be found in blowing up hundreds of enemies with a wide assortment of weapons. Get used to holding down the trigger button as you back up and sidestep enemies charging after you.\n\nThe game also has a ton of secrets to find, generally health/ammo/weapons. These are the old school secrets where you actually have to look for them by climbing over walls or busting through barricades. In a lot of modern games the secrets are just out of the way like in a dead end corridor or under a staircase. This is not the case in Serious Sam 3. You can play through this whole game and only find about 5 out of 100+ secrets unless you know what you’re looking for.\n\nPros:\n+While the story is forgettable, the game has pretty nice graphics with a bunch of weapons to choose from. The thousands of enemies you face means that you’re going to really in the action most of the time.\n+There actually seem to still be multiplayer servers running. The game’s co-op mode is pretty fun.\n+Giant bosses!\n\nCons:\n-Yes, the game can be brainless at times, but that’s part of its charm . Do note however, that there is some annoying puzzle solving to be done in the game. It’s usually about finding keys to locked doors or opening wall panels to get out of underground chambers.\n-Even on easy mode the game can be difficult (for impatient people). The difficulty setting doesn’t seem to affect the number of enemies you face, just how much life and damage dealing power they have. Near the end there are sections with infinite rocket launcher ammo and seemingly thousands of enemies rushing you.\n\nOverall, Serious Sam 3 is a fun game, and if you enjoyed the previous ones you’ll like the modern update. If you’ve only played Serious Sam 2, note that part 2 is quite different from the others in the series (more focused on humor). Serious Sam 3 is more focused on big guns mowing down aliens.\n","March 12, 2015","true","23.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the color is sucked out of the game, and the too-familiar Egyptian locale gets old almost immediately.  SS1 did Egypt well, with all sorts of vibrant colors going on, but since this is the not-too-distant-future, all that's gone.\n\nEnemies appear in as large of groups as ever, but very poorly staggered so that if you clear out a few dozen, you're left waiting nearly a minute in some cases for the next wave to pop in.  Add in a very small variety for most big waves (soldiers, kamikaze, kleer, kleer, kleer, kleer), music that's nowhere near as exciting as in previous games, and the big waves just get tedious after a very short while.\n\nThe new enemies they brought in don't help much, as most are an exercise in how long you're willing to play hide and seek.  The jumping monkey things aren't particularly threatening but just painfully obnoxious, the telekinetic witches break the flow of a firefight over their weird psychic knees, the technopolips (hey I remembered that one's name) should get a medal for how well they avoid rockets, and the tiny spider dudes are basically just the frogs from SS1, since everyone loved those so much.\n\nFor all the advancements 10 or so years have given us, environments don't feel at all improved from the first two games, and the muted color palette only serves to obfuscate the level design.  It's clear enough to figure out where to go, but also pretty easy to get turned around after a particularly long fight.  Dark areas that force a flashlight and slower movement speed on you are dumb and I don't have anything good to say about them.  Egypt Egypt Egypt; it's all been said.  There's nothing exceptionally exciting or pretty or interesting going on; no more lava caves or comically creepy graveyards or secret miniature recreations of the first game's final bossfight.  There are some Sirian places, but you usually turn right around after getting a macguffin, so I wouldn't really say those count.\n\nSecrets in general are very lackluster.  Crollywood sign, big-headed recreations of the design team, giant boxing glove spring trap?  No, but how about a medium health pack?  Sometimes you get lucky and find a laser rifle with almost no ammo, though.\n\nThe new weapons are okay, but the Bulletstorm/Metroid-style laser whip thing is really limited in its applications except to get an achievement against one certain new enemy.  The short range and its ability to overheat don't really feel right in a game like this.  The sniper rifle rocket launcher thing is fun, and makes the aforementioned kleer infestations a breeze.  But seriously, a generic M4 over a Tommy gun?  Not even touching the reloading thing, but that's just lame.  Sledgehammer was cool but the melee execution moves served the same purpose and let you teleport thirty feet at a time.  Chainsaw again plz.\n\nThere are still lots of guns, there are still lots of things to shoot with those guns, there's still fun to be had.  Maybe it's a bit different that before, but it's not all bad.  It's just a bit different.  ...Usually in kind of annoying ways.  Whatever!  It's definitely fun enough, and if the HD remakes of SS1 aren't doing it for you anymore, this is a reasonable enough choice.  But maybe consider bringing a friend along to have someone to talk to while you traipse through Egypt once again.","March 20, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game doesn't send enemies at you in waves in arenas. No, you have to keep pushing and pushing further on the map through the enemies.\n\nLuckily, there are often places where you can take a break too. And you will want to. The fights in this game are incredibly intense. I simply had to just stop and take some deep breaths and relax abit. You find a minigun and never stop firing it for like 5 minutes, because the game just keeps throwing them at you, while you dodge chained cannonballs.\n\nThe jokes could be better. I discovered this game when I played Shadow Warrior. I heard he's kinda like Duke, so I expected him to be funnier.\n\nDo be careful when playing this game for longer sessions. Dodging the rain of projectiles requires a lot of concentration and may cause headache withtin 1-2 hours.\n\n8/10 would spread democracy at 3000 freedoms per minute again.","December 30, 2014","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This was made before shooters were expected to be realistic, this is aimed at straight up crazy fun madness. It combines FPS with over the top gore and hordes of enemies (like 200 at a time). The story is ok but sadly ends on a cliff hanger. There are also heaps of secrets to find around the huge levels from laserguns to secret chambers. Multiplayer contains two options, versus and Co-op. Versus is about DM, TDM, CTF and many more. Co-Op is really where this game shines for me. The game is best played with one or more friends. The over the the top alien killing madness is alot more enjoyable in a group. Oh, and the soundtrack is great, really sets the atmosphere.\n\nThere is also a moddable version of the game for workshop compadibility and downloaded mods. (Be warned, workshop items may not always work untill steam or computer is rebooted)\n\nNeeds Serious Sam 4!

So far I have completed about half of the game, and I really like it. The first few levels were quite slow paced and felt a bit different from previous Serious Sam installments, but eventually the pace picks up and it plays just like the classics. The tone of the game is more serious, with more realistic weapon and enemy models, but it's not a bad thing.

The story is a simple but effective one - Aliens invade, lots of nasty critters, turn on and go to the time travel doodad and connect up to First Encounter to save earth. As a bonus, you get an auto-translator if you stare at text that shows you some more backstory and other bits of text.\n\nAt first, it seems like Sam has been reduced to a generic military shooter. Instead of the bright and fast shooting from the Sam games before this one there are basic guns, a grey cityscape, and somewhat basic soldiers you need to shoot like just another chest high wall simulating shooter game. But as you progress you find more interesting things to fight, you get more options, you find the old enemies again, and the environment shifts from generic cityscape to more interesting environments. You get more weapons, and the generic soldier enemies are slowly phased out as you get further in. It once again makes shooting fun\n\nWith large levels that have plenty of secrets hidden throughout them, exploring is rewarded. There seem to be a few new enemies but I do not think they all worked out that well. Of the ones I do not really like, one is mainly just annoying as it hides from you in what would otherwise be a fast paced game where you can go around avoiding everything through skill and proper manouvring, and the other uses magic to hold you in place in the air while shaking your aim. Luckily, these are not too common and the former can usually be ignored as you do not have to kill them to progress.\n\nAs is expected of Sam, there is a good co-op mode that allows you to bring one or several friends with you, and the settings are as detailed as they always were to let you customise your experience. Difficulty is not a problem - Sometimes it may feel like you're up against nearly impossible odds, but with a little bit of skill and a little bit of luck you can get through it.\n\nWhile I would not say it is as good as First Encounter, it provides a very solid experience with plenty of amusing moments, Serious Sam 3: BFE will give anyone with an interest plenty of enjoyable hours of play - And then even more if they bring a friend","February 5, 2015","true","30.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

They were (well, still ARE) colorful, fast paced and fun. There's a multitude of enemies to hit, lots of ammo. It's a great way to unwind after a long day (albeit if you're there for a challenge, those games could also deliver).\n\nThis time around? I was snoozing for the first number of levels. Then an annoying "space monkey" kind of enemy made the experience so annoying I had to take a break. And where are all the cool toys? Why does the game seem to expect the player to find secrets to get the big guns (in previous games secrets were bonuses, you could skip them and still have a blast will all the game had to offer).\n\nI can't help but feel that massive fights seem to have been replaced with smaller skirmishes. Occasional larger battles seem far less "packed" than before.\n\nIf you like Serious Sam, you're better off replaying the old games with your friends. Do not waste your time on this.","August 11, 2014","false","3.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Holy crap! It is harder than the cake your mom made me yesterday, and manlier than eating bacon while fighting a bear. And Sam 'Serious' Stone is the best video-game character since sliced bread (that's how you use that, isn't it?). Anyway, this is no cover, no sissy regenerating health and no new-age leveling system. Those are for losers. It does have near-impossible levels and bosses that will make your toes curl with rage. Beating each level feals like you are the best gamer this world has ever known. And unlike Duke Nukem Forever, this game manages to get back to its roots perfectly and still improve on graphics, cheesy one-liners, story telling, guns, enemies, bosses, style and whatnot. Frankly, until now I tought capturing the spirit of 'old' games like this one was impossible with modern graphics. Turns out I just never saw anybody capable of it. But croteam is. Croteam took the best ♥♥♥♥ing video-game character ever and revived him without permanently damaging his vital functions *cough* Duke Nukem *cough*.  This game has the good ol' HOLY-♥♥♥♥-I-CAN'T-BELIEVE-I-JUST-ACTUALLY-BEAT-THIS-LEVEL-♥♥♥♥-YES feeling, but it never feels unfair. Modern games are either way too easy or way too hard in an unfair way. This is way too hard in a fair way, and because this game is not entirely serious, you'll laugh rather than cry when you hear the spawning sounds of 2000 enemies all around you. The crying comes later. Now the official reviewy score-thingy: 11/10, 6 stars, amazing, would ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAmazing quote: 'Croteam owns!' - Sam Stone.","June 27, 2013","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

None of it stopped our friends at Croteam from modernizing their title a little, and trust me, I know that "modernizing" is a scary word in this day and age, not many franchises live to tell the story after receiving such treatment.\n\n...but fear not, for the most part, the new addictions are nothing but "cosmetic" in a certain way, and I'm glad the game was not designed with the two abilities I'm about to mention in mind.\n\nFor one, we were givin' the ability to Sprint and Aim down the sights;\n\nThe first which is absolutely ridiculous in a decent way, if we take in consideration that Sam's default speed was NOT nerfed, and I'll leave the rest to your imagination; Now, such ability might come in handy when backtracking and looking for items, but can be exploited as well, since it gives you the ability to literally outrun any kind of enemy in the game.\n\nThe former however, will slow you down to a crawl and only hurt you in the long run, in other words, do NOT aim down the sights, it's useless, and boy does that make me happy.\n\n\nThe Bad\nFor one, Serious Sam 3 lacks a Map, which could come in handy at times, specially for some of those dark underground and/or indoor areas that might require the use of your flash light; Dark areas that while few and far in between, are not particularly fun nor the most appropriate place to face of a horde of enemies...\n\n...and by speaking of enemies, this brings me to two very annoying design choices...\n\nFirst one, has to do with the sheer amount of "Hit Scan" enemies the game throws at you, like the Clone Soldiers carrying Shotguns and Assault Rifles to the Hatchling Arachnoids (little Scorpions), they can be a pain, plain and simple, specially since we're talking about a game designed around projectile avoidance, though the worst offender has to be the Technopolip (Heli with tentacles) with its near perfect aim.\n\nThe second faulty design choice, has to do with the insane amounts of dust/smoke effects that have the bad habit of blocking your view all the time, it's not exactly game breaking and as far as graphics and details go, they do look nice, but it's annoying none the less...\n\n\nThe Ugly\nTo put it simple, Sam 3 is visually repetitive, consisting of Middle-Eastern desert towns, Pyramids and Ruins.\n\nThat's about it...\n\nThe game could have definitely benefited from different themes, variety is a nice thing.\n\n...also, just like previews Sam titles, this is the kind of game that's fun to play for short amounts of time, lets say, an hour or two a day, otherwise it might become repetitive in the long run.\n\n*Sadly, Multiplayer modes like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, etc, are almost dead (Co-Op modes in the other hand are not).\n\n\nGraphics and Optimization\nTo put it simple, this game has one of the most indepth graphics options menus there is, and as far as optimization goes, it's hard not to be impressed by how smooth the game runs at any given time having in consideration the scale of each map and the amount of enemies on screen....\n\n...and graphically speaking, the game looks pretty beautiful overall; Nice shadowing, decent textures and character models (nothing that hadn't been done before and done better though), destructible environments, respectable geometry, reflective surfaces and I could go on!\n\nI'd advise pushing Color Saturation all the way up though (or at the very least make sure to set up the Color Scheme to "Vivid"), otherwise everything will look quite dull.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\nSerious Sam 3 is a frenetic First-Person Shooter (you may enable a Third-Person view as well by pressing H) that could in a certain be compared to "Oldschool" games of old, but NOT exactly in the same vain as Doom or Duke Nukem 3D; Sam games are far, far more simplified in terms of level design and complexity but on steroids as far as the shooting goes.\n\nIt is a fine game with a few problems here and there, but the speed, insanity, enemy variety, constant switching between weapons (required to adapt or take down certain threats at any given time), the humor, secrets and a proper health system more than make up for it.\n\nTherefore, earning a respectable rEvo's rating of an 8.0 out of 10!","July 14, 2014","true","28.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game looks stunning even when using low settings.  The only bad point about the game is that the shotgun sounds way to weak.\n\nGet this game! Seriously ..... GET IT!\n\nIt can even run on a mobile processor so it should work well on a large variety of system specifications, however if you don't like the default you customise EVERY graphical setting and I mean everything, so there's a lot of mixing and matching settings which is brilliant.\n\nKeep in mind that if your looking for a typical COD clone then this game ins't for you.  It's combining new with old here.  Its more of an old school shooter.\n\nKilling enemies is also very satisfying, and you can even tear off heads, hearts and even eyes off enemies and throw them at other enemies.\n\nThe game even has a seprate Moddable version that you get when buying the game, allowing you to use a whole wealth of workshop content to add new maps, enemies, game modes, weapons and more for free, but if you want to keep the game mod free you can also play the standard version which doesn't support mods.\n\nIt also features full controller support right from the get go, which means this game works amazingly well with big picture mode or SteamOS.  And ..... it also has .... splitscreen .... seriously (no pun intended) which is rare for a PC game, which makes it even better that this game has controller support.\n\nI honestly cannot recommend this game enough, its well worth the price.","February 5, 2014","true","49.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
