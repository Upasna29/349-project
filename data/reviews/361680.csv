But the game stop there. 16 min to kill the campagain mode & one try at the arcade that took 5 min.. . that's really short.\nNo explanation what so ever about what button does what on the controller and in the keypmapping you can only check for the keyboard, anyways they don't seems to do the same thing each time so checking is quite useless.... The only thing that's good are the graphics. Did I mention the game crash badly in the 5 first min?! and some 'minor' bugs like caractere don't show up,!\n\nI cannot recommand this game unless you grab it at -80% or in a bundle. I doesn't worth much more. Very dissapointing. It feel really unfinished.","May 21","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this very inspired game of "tug-of-war," you and a friend compete to clear as many rooms as possible in order to save the other person. While playing, your actions directly affect what is happening on the other player's screen. Knock a plant from your view? It drops down and overgrows on your opponent's screen. Boot a cannon out of your way? It will fly to the top of the screen and shoot a cannonball to knock your savior from their path.\n\nThe idea behind having both players trying to rescue each other is both endearing, and works really well with this game. The game screens are split up nicely, giving each player and adequate view of what is happening both on their own screen, and their opponent's screen. Coupled with the absolutely breathtaking visuals, and this game is worth getting the support of the developers to build more!\n\nMy absolute only gripe about this game is how short it is! My girlfriend and I completed the cooperative part of this game in just under 15 minutes, and due to the limited environments and props, the replay value is small. I'd love to see the developer revisit this game and expand on what could be a game that is picked up any time you have a get together. $10 might be a bit too steep for how short the game is, but if you catch it on sale, I would definitely recommend it.","May 19","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Knight & Damsel is essentially a competitive puzzle game. Both of the players (two players required) are trying to be the player that ends up rescuing the other player. To do this players push, climb or destroy the obstacles in their way. Some of the hazards can also be moved onto the path of the other player in order to slow them down.\n\nI had fun with Knight & Damsel. The gameplay is interesting if you have another person to play the game with. The game is easy to pick up so it could work for people that don't play a lot of games. The hazards do tend to create a runaway winner problem though since one hazard leads into another hazard and so on. While fun Knight & Damsel is the type of game that is best in short doses instead of long playthroughs. I think it would work best in 15-30 minute sessions.\n\nKnight & Damsel is also really charming.\n\nIf you don't like these type of puzzle games or don't have anyone to play the game with, I don't think you will enjoy Kinght & Damsel. If you like the theme, have someone else to play with, and the gameplay looks interesting I think you will enjoy Knight & Damsel.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","0"

However, it still has a few bugs that need fixing (game froze and crashed a couple times, water jets and ice slicks stun you infinite sometimes).  When it's finished we will love it!","August 21, 2015","true","5.4"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","8","20","2","1"
