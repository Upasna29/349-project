Although that's not the main theme of the game, the short story in the personal view of a charater gives you the background and the personality of the historical figures, and the interactions between them. On the top of all these, you can shape the future of the country and the people all by your own hand.\nIts control is intuitive as a strategy game since almost all the command and options are made via a textual menu with explanations, as long as you can read the language.\nThe battle is not so exciting in the later game because you should always have overwhelming troops with super powerful generals, but in the beginning of the game, the battle is thrilling, especially when you win your first siege.\n\nOne negative feature is mentioned that the battle in the middle or late stage of the game is easy because your superiority against your enemies. Second, the build, develop, expansion loop of all strategy games is somewhat boring, you do all the same thing for all cities.","May 15","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
