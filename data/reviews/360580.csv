You are an alien ufo. In each level you have to complete several tasks like abduct cows or kill ppl with highdrops or smash boulders on them. There are even bosses which you fight like the 20ft football mascot, a helicopter or a tank. Best level I found was level 2. You have to abduct cheerleaders to annoy the football team. But they have manly squeaking female voices - hillarious.The hard rock & heavy metal soundtrack is also very nice. Just have to complain about the unnatural spawnrates and the nearly invisible bullets in the sky. But nevertheless a nice and entertaining game.","May 22","true","2.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","Its a very short casual game. You can have fun for 1-2 hours with it you like such games. The bosses need a special tactic and the last level isnt so easy to destroy the tank if you lose before many lifes and hp against the soldiers and canons but its not unfair hard. Last is a survival level where you need to go trough all 4 levels with only 1 life and the last is not so easy because getting items you can trough on the tank and soldier holding you from grapping and you need always to move because the tank makes so many dangerous. Its not so every easy, its a nice little challenge for mid skilled gamers. I enjoy the game even if its no big deal but for a low budget game of a developer with not so many game before (if there even 1 exist) i like it and give a 57 % only because its to short. If you dont like types of this games, dont try it. Thank you for reading.","January 17","true","2.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

End of each level you have to press X to progress to the next level as well, so I think that this is a VERY lazy port that hasn't even bothered to change the inputs from XBox!\nI tried an XBox controller as well, foolishly thinking that it might be a better way to play...\nNope, no response at all using a controller!\nIt goes to show how truly lazy a port this is when, in the options menu there is a setting for controller shake and next to it is a message "Not on PC"!! So why is it even in there???\n\nThe gameplay is mildly amusing briefly, but only consists of picking things up in your abduction beam and either abducting the defenseless, dropping enemies to their death or dropping rocks and crates to kill or damage enemies. That's pretty much it.\n\nFor a mere Â£1.35 I suppose it's ok value, I got just over 30 mins for mild entertainment out of it.\nBut it could have been so much more!\nEvery level is the same, a flat plane with a very basic background image and a bunch of crates, rocks, civies and enemies.\n\nA bland and disappointing game, rather than a bad one, and a lazy port indeed.","September 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","8","12","3","2"

Plus is a pretty basic and short game that sees you playing through five missions abducting innocents, killing armed humans and generally wreaking havoc as you complete tasks set by your commander.\n\nPROS:\n\n-good amount of humour both in dialogues and mission tasks\n\n-gameplay is pretty fun overall\n\nCONS:\n\n-basic graphics\n\n-amateurish sound\n\n-I havn't tried the keyboard, but the controller felt a bit unresponsive while moving around and trying to drop objects on the tiny enemies\n\n-very short, you'll be done in an hour at most: it's also quite easy\n\n-while it saves unlocked mission it won't save your highscores and gained lives, this means that if you quit and then select the last played mission you'll start with the basic 2 lives and a score of 0\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531749240\n\nI got this through a bundle and it wasn't too shabby considering it was made by a few people: it's very basic both in gameplay and production values but it was funny and silly enough to make my 50ish minutes with it a decent experience, hence the thumbs up.\n\nI understand many people will, and in fact should, skip it since it's pretty forgettable overall and quite light in content: but if you find the premise interesting and find it on sale or in a bundle you'd surely do worse.","October 8, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
