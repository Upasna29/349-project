It's short, easy to play and fun to play through the first time. It has little replay value aside from some of the harder achievements, and one or two of them are actually quite brutal to get. The controls are fairly simple and there's not many spells or abilities to worry about. Some of the sounds effects will make you want to kill something I admit... looking at you Floyd. The game has a few AI issues like abusing hiding in trees and some strange targeting issues but for the most part the AI is easy enough to figure out and outplay. Don't go looking into this thinking you're going to get some amazing in depth Starcarft or Europa Universalis. You're not. You're going to get a cute light-hearted fun little time waster.","January 2, 2014","true","50.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

If you've played Grotesque Tactics, this game is quite similar but even more simplified, with no leveling up or inventory management. Also, wow, the "humor" is even worse - if you can believe that.\n\nIt's not quite as buggy as GT is/was, but there are still some technical problems with it. On the larger maps, the framerate starts to crawl because of the number of units, I suspect because the game isn't quite optimized. There's no music during gameplay, and the sound design leaves a lot to be desired (though I did get a chuckle when I heard the wilhelm scream). Graphics are quite bland, barely passable.\n\nThat said, it does scratch the itch a bit just like Grotesque Tactics did. If you've played through Final Fantasy Tactics enough times to really look for something else, you could find worse. If you're a hardcore turn-based tactics fan who likes a lot of depth to their strategy, this game doesn't have it. If you like something light on the tone and challenge, or can get this game really cheap, then give it a look.","January 28, 2014","true","3.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The graphics are ok, the sound too. The gameplay is a bit like final fantasy tactic, but the tactics are waaay easier and too simple, the story is dull and i don't know, i just find it boring to play.\nI tried to put some hours into it thinking it gets better later, but i could not get farter than a few hours before i was through. I don't think i'll get back to it again, too many other really fun games to play!","December 10, 2013","false","0.7"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/209850/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Highborn is a turn-based strategy game with old-style rules and wacky-stupid kind of humor.  There's a lot of references to the pop culture and the characters break the fourth wall all the time. The rules (and AI) are simple: you attack and then enemy retaliates if not dead or petrified. There are infinite amount of retaliations. Towers shoot any enemy attacking your troops in their area and also help when you attack. Enemy does not remember where you were last round, so you can always hide in the forest (or go invisible as Trillian) without a large chance of discovery, though sometimes enemy somewhat randomly goes there or hits Trillian anyway while moving and "discovers" you.\n\nThere are troops and then there are disposable troops that respawn from keeps, mage towers and such. Like expected you are not allowed to lose hero units who are also better than the rest and have a couple of very useful special skills. There are also 6 different spells that both you and your opponent can use, acquired through capturing monoliths scattered within the levels.\n\nAI is not very smart as it is easy to fool someone who doesn't remember enemies going into the forest, but as a snack-type strategy game this one is fine. There's no multiplayer, so don't expect too much replay value. You may complete each level on a higher difficulty level though, meaning more and stronger enemy troops. The level-based special achievements are a nice touch as well.\n\nDo not expect your mind to be blown (except by the puns) but it's a fine game akin to a snack. Do expect to grow to hate some of the characters though because they can be irritating.","August 28, 2013","true","40.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's funny, in a sort of juvenile way, but it knows to stick it in it's own craw sometimes and got a laugh or two out of me anyway.\n\nYou won't spend hours and hours playing this -- and the game would be well served by a skirmish/random map mode, maybe a wider multiplayer mode, bringing it into line with games like Age of Wonders or Heroes of Might and Magic. Then again, don't take that to mean this game is like that -- it's much, much simpler, and significantly more deterministic.\n\nI spent 8 hours on the campaign, only a few foolish losses which frustratingly had me re-do the whole mission, I would say my experience is average and you can expect 8-10 depending on how strategically you think.\n\nAll in all, I await the forthcoming chapter 2, however, it better be ♥♥♥♥ing cheap, I don't care to be nickel-and-dimed every time I want new content. I'd pay a dollar or two, but preferably they'd be free, maybe with alternate stories costing a few dollars.\n\nOverall, weak accept on merits, but beware the DLC disease.","February 24, 2013","true","29.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If your save game is in the list, it worked. If not? Too bad.\nAnd you need to save, because sometimes all units disappear, and the only way to get them back is to save and reload.\nThis is also the way to fix the game when it won't let you select anything on the screen. Save, exit and reload.\n\nThe game itself is a casual strategy game. It sells itself on the humour, but I'm still waiting for the first funny joke.\nIt's actually an OK game if you know what you are getting into: Casual with a capital C.\nThe graphics are good, the sound effects fine and they had just implemented more than one difficulty level when I started playing it. Played on Normal which felt like Easy, but again - Casual.\n\nThe most annoying part though, was finding out on the Steam forums, that the came only contains Chapter 1. That's 8 missions. Everything else will be released as DLCs later on, which is not mentioned on the store page.\n\nLike a lot of other games published on Steam lately, this does not feel like a finished game or even a game almost ready for release.\nIt should have been moved to the Early Access section and with a clear note saying that only the first 8 levels are included and the rest can be bought as DLCs later.\n\nI can't really recommend it in the sorry state it currently is in.","March 21, 2013","false","1.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"
