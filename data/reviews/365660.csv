There are also new tricks to do to further your scoring potentail that wasn't there in first game: Manuals, Reverts and Switch-Grinding. This means you can score even harder than you imagined compared to the first game.\n\nIn the same fashion of the first game, there are levels with challenges for you to clear to unlock Pro mode, which is the harder variation of that stages. Clearing Pro mode will unlock RAD mode, which is skating flawlessly or eat dirt for not nailing everything perfectly. Safe to say it's not for the faint of heart or those who never experence having sore thumbs for gaming hard.\n\nFor those that look to boast their scoring abilites after handling what the game has to offer, look no further to Spot challenges and the Daily Grind that has online leaderboards. You can also play locally with up to 4 buds in a split-screen Combo rush mode, which is a nice plus to what the game already has.\n\nOlliOlli2 is a good step up from the original, worth looking into if you're interested.","April 28","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But removing that third dimension, they still managed to keep the element of difficulty in this game while keeping it very simple.\nThis is a simply addictive skateboard game that is a must-buy for anyone who liked Super Hexagon, Skate, or the Tony Hawk games, and I would still recomend it to anyone else who is looking for a simple game that's easy to learn and run, but addictive and difficult enough to keep you angrily fascinated enough to keep playing.","September 15, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And that's what OlliOlli2 is to me, sadly.\n\nThis game has excellent great presentation and polish out the wazoo, and the mechanics to back it up. But man, I am not a fan of the controls, which involve flicking the stick in various motions and then letting go. It just never felt right to me, and I could never get into the "flow" I was looking for. That, and a lot of the objectives in the game involve going for score, which invariably means you have to be really dextrous and masterful in nailing lots of tricks and grinds in quick succession. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but I don't feel like investing the time in getting good if I find that the core mechanic of using the thumbstick clumsy and un-fun.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I've played my fair share of board-based games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Skate 3, and tolerated the trick/style aspect of those games because they felt good enough for me not to care too much. I can't say the same for OlliOlli2, as good of a game as it is.","May 24","false","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ackermax/recommended/365660/","ackermax","ackermax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ackermax/","232 products in account","Even better than first one!\nOlliOlli2: Welcome to Olliwood is a hard as hell sidescroll arcade skate game, which is probably the best "skate" game you can get on Steam.\nI'm a huge fan of the first one aswell, but in my opinion the developers managed to make a great game even better.\nHere's why:\n\nThe positive :\n\n+  An outstanding soundtrack.\n\nThe first one had a great soundtrack, too and OlliOlli2 doesn't disappoint in the slightest with it's choice of music. It's a mixture of electronica, glitch & and hiphop (artists like CidRim or Kyle Cook) and does just fit so well to game. One of the reasons I like that game so much!\n\n+  Optimized Gameplay.\n\nWhat makes OlliOlli2 such a great successor is the fact that they added plenty of new mechanics which make the game for one part more difficult but also way more entertaining. Now it is possible to get even bigger combos due to the new manuals and reverts. Also they added a bunch of new tricks (Double Treflip, Darkslide and others) and you're now allowed to change your trick while grinding (f.e. from Nosegrind to Crailslide). This makes the gameplay just so much more fun, as you have way more options to finish a level. The tricks are done similar to the game Skate by using the leftstick to perform different moves.\n\n+  Fixed the old problems.\n\nAnother positive aspect is the overall more polished presentation and more responsive controls. While still retaining the retro look they also managed to make game look better overall. Also in the first part it sometimes felt like some controls weren't executed by the game (resulting in starting all over). Roll7 did a good job in fixing some minor issues.\nPlus, the new levels look pretty great and have (especially in the later pro levels) a really nice level design. I sometimes had problems distinguishing some objects and obstacles in the first one, now everything is quite good to see.\n\n+  Lots of content for a reasonable price.\n\nThe game isn't that expensive and for a really nice price you get a lot of content. You basically have 5 levels per world and 5 challenges per level. It takes a while to beat everything (took me around 8 hours for the amateur challenges), also you have lots of achievements and a nice feature called daily grind where you can play a level and compare you points on a worldwide leaderboard.\nOh, and there is an extra "spot" per level you have to skate in one combo, which also will be visible on a leaderboard.\n\nThe neutral :\n\n~  Could've added more new gameplay features\n\nI generelly like everything they added but I feel like they easily could add even more, f.e. Grabs, real Lateflips (can only be done with a trick combo f.e. Hardflip-LateShuvIt) and Flatlandtricks while manualing. I guess they keep that for another sequel.\n\n~  Hard as hell!\n\nI generelly don't see it as really flaw (I actually like it, you have quite a high skill ceiling) but it should be mentioned that it is a really difficult game and for some people maybe a lil bit too difficult.\n\n\nThe negative :\n\n-  Some minor flaws\n\nI'm having a hard time finding anything bad, but there are some minor flaws I should mention. For example the game occasionally freezes for 2-3 seconds, which is absolutely deadly for such a fast paced game. This doesn't happen often, but it is still annoying. Also it would be awesome to see the different runs for highscores, which they sadly didn't add. (Maybe also a future thing).\nAnd why aren't there any steam trading cards?\n\n\nOverall impression :\n\nI absolutely recommend this game if you're into arcade and/or sidescrolling games! It's basically a mixture of games like SuperMeatBoy and Skate.\nThe second part does everything the first did and even more and better, also it isn't that expensive even when it isn't on sale!\n\nSo, go get it!\n\nGet's a smooth 88/100!\n","November 6, 2015","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Although this teaches you how to play.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nPlease, get a controller, just for your own sake.","May 11","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/recommended/365660/","bumblebug","Bumblebugbee3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/","250 products in account","Skateboarding and videogames go together like peanut butter and jelly.  Just like the Tony Hawk and Skate games left their mark on the industry so too did OlliOlli.  Although the sequel may not be revolutionary it does are great job of capitalizing on what made the first game great while simultaneously improving itself in almost every aspect.  New stages, tricks, and challenges will make this second installment a worthwhile play for those who have already finished the first game.  If you're new to the series don't worry, excellent tutorials will catch you up to speed real fast.\n\nOlliOlli is a fast-paced, side-scrolling, skateboarding extravaganza.  Those who played Skate will feel right as home as this games main tool for tricks is the analog stick.  By flicking the analog stick you can jump up in the air and perform various flip tricks.  You'll also need to hold down the analog stick right before hitting a rail to grind.  To land any other tricks you'll need to tap the A (or X) button right before landing.  As you proceed father into the game you'll need to be able to quickly transition back and forth between rails and the surface in mere seconds.  Its a thrilling experience that requires you to find the right rhythm to flow smoothly through each stage.\n\nThe atmosphere in OlliOlli 2 is incredible and the art is gorgeous.  The game has a very slick, colorful, presentation..  Although it clearly resembles the original, this time around the art is much cleaner and a lot less pixalated.  Each location offers a unique theme from the jungle, to the old west, the carnival, and beyond.  The highlight however is the soundtrack.  A wonderful selection of pulsing electronic music is bound to put you in a trance as you play.  The best part about the music in this game is that it keeps playing continuously, even as you reset a stage or open up various menus.\n\nThe most notable change to this sequel is the new tricks, specifically manuals.  Just like manuals revolutionized the second Tony Hawk game so too do they this game.  The ability to manual coincidentally lets you combo your tricks trough the entirety of each level.  This is especially import for the Spot mode which only let you perform one combo per stage.  Manuals are pretty easy to do so if you really want to achieve a high-school you'll need to combine them with two of the other new tricks, grind-switches and reverts.  Grind-switches let you mix things up on long grinds while reverts let you switch your stance as you land a trick.\n\nThis is clearly an enjoyable title in many ways.  The gameplay is very smooth and rewarding while the soundtrack is exciting and motivating.  That all being said this really isn't that drastically different from the first game.  If you played the original OlliOlli you can pretty much expect more of what that game offered.  The new stages and tricks, along with a magnificent new soundtrack, add quite a bit of value and incentive for picking up this game.  Whether you played the first one or not it, definitely check this one out.  OlliOlli offers a thrilling experience for gamers and skaters alike.","May 20","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In addition, the game will often lag for me during the music transitions which can ruin otherwise excellent runs. I really can't understand the transition lag as I'm running this on an i7-4790k and GTX 970.\n\nThe controls feel rather un-intuitive which normally wouldn't be an issue except that you apparently can't remap the controls. What's most bizarre to me is the fact that something as simple as a rumble setting, which the game does have, is not within the game's menu's but requires you to add a -norumble line to the execution path.\n\nI'm guessing this game was made with very specific intentions when it comes to how it's played, thus the option to control any way you'd like is not available.\n\nPersonally, I can't recommend this game at it's full price ($15 currently)","February 9","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Tight controls, no lag, and fantastic flow. OlliOlli 2 is lacking these elements.\n\nI got pretty good at the first one, but in this sequel I'm having major difficulty landing tricks, doing combos and executing grinds. It's just not responsive. Some times it's so bad that I try to do a 3-key combo, 2 of the keys execute, I don't succesfully land, and then the 3rd key I pushed starts executing the next trick.\n\nGrinds in the first game were super fun to do. You'd practically magnetize to rails as long as you were above them. Now you have to be accurate like landing a trick normally. I'd normally be okay with increasing the difficulty, but this just ruins the flow of gameplay.\n\nAlso, this game sadly falls into the ever-expanding category of "games with Retro-Like Graphics that take a ton of system resources to run".\n\nIn conclusion: I'm so disappointed.","April 4","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are however glitches here an there and the controls feel somewhat off with my non-xbox controller (could be my controller, could be the game). It's still unclear to me when exactly to “plant” a trick, the momentum feels random most of the time. Also, try to ride down some small stairs without jumping/tricks and try to land, it's impossible to do this right/not-sloppy. Grinding is a big part of the game and especially when you just started playing the game it's unclear whether an object is grindable or not. So you don't know if your just missing the hotspot or you cannot grind it. This is very frustrating. I still like playing the game but in my opinion it's not worth the €14,- and I wish I would have waited a while longer for a discount or something.

I feel alot of love was put into the idea espcially after checking out the tricktionary and some of the features added into this.\n\nBut the biggest complaint I have about this game is the controls, it's so frustratingly bad i couldn't stand more then 10 mins of this game.  I have put thousands of hours into games like Skate, Tony Hawk franchise, and even older the old snowboarder games like Cool Boarders on playstation.  I just feel like this games controls are way to frustrating and they defy common sense.  I think it would have been alot cooler to have it be close to the Tony hawk pro skater franchise in its control scheme, have one button that lets you push and pop the board and have other buttons to do those tricks and then use the analog stick to adjust the land.  Instead of this wonky ♥♥♥ shit where you have to press a button before your board hits the ground with one hand if your using keyboard and the other hand is getting used to doing the tricks.  Its just awkward the way they set it up.\n\nYou can remap the controls sure, but that doesnt remap the way they have it set up, because they have push/land on one button so it doesn't actually change anything.\n\nI personally can't recommend this game until a mod comes out to change the control scheme, or the devs add in a way to change the control scheme and that's sad because I really love the idea of this game and I see it has massive potential as an indie game and as a skateboard game on the pc.","August 14, 2015","false","22.1"," 9 of 34 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","9","34","0","4"

While it was fun, it also felt bland and didn't entirely grab my attention.\n\nOlliOlli 2 is so much better.  It feels so much more smooth, the levels feel more lively, the new art style is great, the animations are fantastic, and of course, the additions of manuals, reverts, and other awesome tricks are great too.\n\nI definitely recommend this, especially if you're a fan of skating games.  Controls are similar to the flick style of the Skate games but the general gameplay feels like THPS where you're always trying to make awesome combos.  Even if you didn't really like the first OlliOlli I recommend this because it basically fixed all of the aspects that I disliked from the previous game.\n\nThe only complaint is that there isn't any sort of calibration mode.  Because of this, it's somewhat difficult for me to play on my TV since it has a bit of input delay, but on my monitor it's completely fine and I'm sure it'll be fine on your monitor too.","October 20, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved the skating mechanics with the "easy to learn hard to master" feel that these kinds of games often have. Many tracks (especially in the 2nd and 4th worlds) featured branching paths that offer rewards (or death).\n\nSOME GRIPES:\n1) DO NOT buy this game if you don't have a controller. This game was NOT made w/ keyboard and mouse in mind.\n2) The game is surprisingly short. In roughly 5 hours I managed to beat all 5 worlds. I suppose some replayability comes from five-staring levels (which unlocks PRO versions of the levels, and eventually RAD versions) but after a certain point, star objectives become quite obnoxious...\n\nCONCLUSION: Fantastic if you like score-attack games and have a controller. Wait for a sale, as its pretty short.","January 26","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played about 3.5 hrs and will contiune to roll through the challenges.  It has a really good pace.\n\nBeat all challenges on an amatuer-level and it unlocks the respective Pro-level. Beat all Pro-level challenges and it unlcoks RAD mode. Which im assuming is crazy difficult and combo specific.\n\nPROS\nThe contols feel tight.\nThe game has a one button level reset, so its fast to try and re-try.\n2D eliminates the frustrating 3D aspect of SKATE and T. HAWK to 'line up perfectly' for your trick\nThe challenges are ... challenging.\nA daily online challenge with Online Scoreboard (you get to practice and then get only one shot)\nAddicting and quick gameplay, where you'll say "1 more try" about 20x\n\nCONS:\nMinor menu annoyances\nMemory leak?  ive noticed after playing for 30 mins or so, the framerate gets choppy. Reset the game and it smooths out. Others report similar.\nI paid $2 extra bucks for the soundtrack, but its not that great.  I wouldnt reccommend that.\nSome tracks are annoying, with vocal loops , Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh.

Then why did you lock the FPS to 60 you dumb f***s? The only use of 120 / 144 Hz monitors is for playing games like this - where stuff moves so fast it makes you vomit. If you're one of those "human eye can't see above 60 FPS" guys, then just go to this link[www.testufo.com] and tell me you don't see any ghosting / uncomfortable visuals at 60 FPS, especially if you increase the speed.
