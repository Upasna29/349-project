With landscapes and characters created entirely out of clay and cardboard, Erik Zaring and Andes Gustafsson helm this unexpected foray into our subconscious.\nThe Dream Machine tells the story of Victor Neff, a man who has just moved into a brand new apartment with his pregnant girlfriend Alicia. However, after their first night here, they begin to realize there's something incredibly "off" about this place. They both have strange dreams, the landlord is kind of creepy, and the previous tenant has left a mysterious note of warning. Though the dreams could just be a result of the stress of moving day and the note could have easily been a prank, things just keep getting weirder, prompting Victor to investigate.\nThe very first thing players will notice about the Dream Machine is its unique art style. In fact, the game was nominated for an award in "Excellence in Visual Arts" at the 14th Annual Independent Games Festival. That's because Cockroach Inc. has taken a different approach to game design: they decided to make all the set pieces and characters out of cardboard and clay. No polygons invited. This coats the whole affair in a layer of imperfection; it's flawed and raw, but in a way that gives it a deeper level of humanity. In fact, the guys at Cockroach have even admitted to intentionally leaving fingerprints on some of the objects in the game to accomplish this very thing.\nThe story is an admittedly adult tale of new beginnings, represented by both the move to a new apartment and the new life Victor's girlfriend carries in her womb. The Dream Machine's plot draws on basic human fears, but not in a Silent Hill sort of way. Instead, the game plays on real-life day-to-day fears that most people will encounter at some point in their time on this planet. Moving to a new place can be scary. Having a child on the way can be scary. And finding out that your landlord has a video camera in your bedroom is extremely scary.\nThere is a little bit of music in the game, and it's appropriately dark. Some of it is plain ominous, and other bits of it seem to accentuate certain aspects of the story. Mr. Morton's discordant jazz music fits his personality quite well, for example. Sound effects are minimal, but that sort of goes with the point-and-click territory.\nThe gameplay here is simple; The Dream Machine adheres to the age-old point-and-click adventure game formula, leading players through a series of puzzles before showing them each piece of the story. Thankfully, puzzles in the Dream Machine are incredibly clever. Too many point-and-click games are full of incomprehensible puzzles with completely nonsensical answers. The Dream Machine, however, has some incredibly well-thought-out solutions that will ultimately make sense. That's not to say they're easy; quite the contrary. Some of these solutions won't present themselves until you've spent a good deal of time just pondering over the things you've seen so far. But when you finally do stumble upon a solution, it's immensely satisfying.\nIf you have any interest at all in point-and-click games, or need a powerful defense in the "games as art" debate, you should definitely check out The Dream Machine.","July 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","46","50","0","1"

It's a great story! And while it's not a "scary" game, it is a deliciously disturbing one (I mean, it's based on dreams, of course it's gonna be disturbing, especially in the later chapters. I guess I'd say it's a similar feeling as watching one of Tim Burton's films, but with more blood, and a slightly more mature rating.)

Secondly, and simply, I'll just say that this is absolutely, positively, hands-down one of the best point-and-click games that will ever be made, probably in the annals of human history, and unless the devs drop dead in the meantime you can rest at least 99% assured that they WILL finish the darned thing, even if they're taking a bit longer than they initially intended to.\n\nBut hey, which would you prefer...a really, really good point-and-click game a year ago, or a truly classic point-and-click game in, say, a couple of years from now?  Cockroach Inc ain't dumb...they're in this one for the history books and the betterment of mankind, nuthin' less.  And you'd better BELIEVE it, buddy-boy.\n\nPoint-and-click games and myself, we don't exactly have a history of getting along that well, but this may well emerge as my all-time personal favourite of the genre.  Sure, I've required a few walkthrough consultations to date, but such is be expected with a semi-vegetative brain such as mine.  Whatever you do, don't go holding my confirmed stoopidity against the game, a'ight?  I'm the idiot, it's the savant.

There are oo tiny changes in the cursor or 2-pixel-wide items - movement is quick - no convoluted dialogues to dig through - you mostly just play the game instead of walking, talking and so on.\n\nUpdate: since writing that I've tried Chapter 4 and - unfortunately - I keep running into a crash bug which leaves me unable to continue.  This isn't ideal but hopefully the developer will address it/I'll figure out a different way around the problem - and the puzzles do seem a LOT harder in this episode too! :(","September 20, 2015","true","9.2"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

However, I felt that this one really deserved one.\n\nThe Short:\nThis is an incredibly well-designed game. The developer's were able to capture that very rare "spark." While it may be a little short (I really took my time and it took me an hour per chapter), it is one of immense quality. Overall 9.5/10.\n\nThe Longer:\n- Gameplay:\nIt is your standard point-and-click adventure game. You are given a small story or situation and you have to solve puzzles to progress. My only real complaint, which isn't much of a complaint, is the sudden advancement in difficulty. In the first two chapters, I didn't really come across any problems/difficulties. The third chapter was really hard! You'll understand when you have to make a certain drink.\n\n- Music:\nI loved the soundtrack. It matches the situations and environment very, very well. It ranges from the caretaker's creepy jazz song to minimalistic ambience to Silent Hill-esque rhythms.\n\n- Story:\nThis is easily one of my favorite stories that has come from recent gaming. Without giving too much away, it begins as a simple tale about a couple moving into a new apartment. Soon, it evolves into an (without exaggeration) epic adventure involving the dream world, a science project gone wrong, and horror.\n\n- Graphics/Environment:\nThe clay animation was a really smart artistic choice. It helps to add a fresh perspective on the genre. The environments are all interesting and enchanting. The characters are... scary looking.\n\nTo the developers, I sincerely enjoyed your game.","February 16, 2014","true","6.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

Something is amiss, however, and soon you learn that you'll have to take it upon yourself to stop a sinister plot where your dreams, and the dreams of all the apartment residents, are being infiltrated by your land lord and his out of control contraption. The graphics are marvelously creepy, being claymation, and the soft ambeint music and horror-like storyline set the scene for a truly challenging adventure that will have you immersed for hours.\n\nGame play wise, I will say that some of the puzzles may be easy to solve in a few minutes, and other may take hours, or even days, depending on your thought process and how you deal with puzzles. There are puzzles for all types of people, so while I certainly don't suggest that you cheat, it's always fun to team up on this game. Some of the game play can get slightly monotonous while you're stuck, which can be frustrating. (But such is the bane of adventure games.) There were also a few times where I thought I was supposed to be trying to solve a puzzle to unlock something, but it wasn't time for that in the story yet. Still, when things become clear, it's easy to sit down and focus on the puzzle intently.\n\nThe story line is creepy and unsettling. It is not a full out horror tale, but at times it can be graphic and disturbing. It also moves slowly towards the disturbing, and as you get further into the plot it becomes stranger.\n\nThis IS the sort of adventure game where you may need to keep some scrap paper beside you in order to jot down notes and figure things out. If you are not into complicated adventure games, then this is not for you. But if you are, then welcome to The Dream Machine.\n\n\n\n","December 13, 2013","true","13.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Not only that, but the story AND the writing are both terrific!

I had to use a walkthrough a few times to complete it, but that's the case with pretty much any adventure game I've ever played...\n\nI absolutely recommend playing this!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/absurdlogic/recommended/94300/","absurdlogic","Absurd Logic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/absurdlogic/","543 products in account","Note: This review is only for Chapters 1-5 so far (6 isn't out yet).\n\nThis game was collecting dust in my library for quite a while. I figured it was just another standard P&C to slog through when I had nothing better to do. On a whim I started playing though, and boy, was I wrong.\n\nI don't think I've been this impressed by a P&C in a very long time. It has its flaws of course, but I can unwaveringly and wholeheartedly recommend it to any lover of P&C puzzle games, especially experienced players looking for more thoughtful challenges (some of which put even Daedalic's better puzzles to shame).\n\nIf you're already intrigued, do buy and play this game. If you're still on the fence or want to know more of what you're getting yourself into, keep reading. Skip to the end for a sum-up.\n\nThe Good StuffGeneral Format\nFrom the very start, The Dream Machine sharply breaks from the by-now-expected P&C conventions: long cut-scene intros, expositional voice-overs, difficulty modes, Captain Obvious tutorials, sparkly "active zones/items", and recharging hint systems will not be found here. (There's a vague "hint mode", but it's off by default.) There is no hand-holding. You are thrown directly into the water (somewhat literally) and expected to figure it out for yourself. Yes, the first short section does function a little like a tutorial, but it's still one you must navigate on your own. While this kind of no-HUD, no-hints style may seem potentially difficult or off-putting to some people, it's actually nice to see a game that doesn't patronize the player. In other words, it "speaks to you like an adult", and duly expects you to think like one. That's incredibly refreshing.\n\nIt also does not follow the cliché format of "random female protagonist solving a mystery she's only vaguely connected with". I'm all for female protagonists, but it's still nice to see variety once in a while, as well as a protagonist more invested in their own storyline.\n\nPresentation/Style\nI've always loved games that take advantage of more unique graphic styles, particularly stop-motion. In this case, some aspects of the clay and cardboard style take a bit of getting used to (the characters don't really have facial expressions, for example, or even eyeballs), but it still creates a very pleasant and memorable feel. Anyone out there who remembers the 1996 game "The Neverhood" will definitely notice a similar charm. A more contemporary example would be something like Plastiland. There are no animated sequences or cut-scenes breaking up the flow or art style, like you'll find in a lot of modern games. Clay and cardboard is the omnipresent playing field, and apart from a couple of longer dialogues to click through, the player has control of the protagonist from start to finish - even while transitioning from one chapter to the next.\n\nStoryline\nThis has to be one of the most in-depth and convoluted (in a good way) storylines I've encountered in a P&C in years. Physically delving into the "collective unconscious" or "dreamscape" is not a new idea, but the reasons you venture through them are unique. In addition, the decisions Victor is presented with throughout, whether straightforward, questionable, or bizarre, are ultimately what shape his character and slowly allow the player to sympathize with his personal situation. Victor/the player has very clear emotional and realistic reasons for being proactive in the story, as opposed to the passive "outsider" feeling one gets from games with a nonchalant and uninvolved protagonist.\n\nVictor and the other characters may not be very deep as far as personality, but interactions are scripted quite well, essentially turning each character into an archetype anyone can relate to - which is significant, considering the lack of facial expressions.\n\nI was also impressed with the number of times situations or aspects of the story genuinely shocked or touched me. Without giving anything away, the slow realization that occurs at the end of Chapter 5 literally made me gasp. That level of emotional immersion is very rare in my experience.\n\nPuzzles\nThe puzzles are where Dream Machine sets itself apart. They involve in-depth thinking and down-to-earth, "realistic" logic, instead of "try every item in your inventory and hope something works". One of the better initial examples that illustrate that stark difference is the second puzzle involving the hammer and anvil. Yes, it requires a bit of real-world knowledge, but the sense of accomplishment once you pick up on that is extremely satisfying. Some puzzles (like the hammer one) have an obscure hint within the dialogue to point you in the right direction, but most of the time solutions simply require exploration of the environment and good 'ol brain grease. Young Edie's advice in Chapter 4 is a particularly tricky dialogue hint, but pretty darn clever in the end. Another example of "realistic" thinking involves the second cube in Willard's dream in Chapter 5. It's such a simple solution, but players these days are so accustomed to overthinking puzzles that it's easy to miss the obvious round-peg-goes-in-round-hole stuff.\n\nLength\nEach chapter takes a good amount of time to complete. Even taking idling into account, it took me over 9-10 hours to complete all 5 chapters, which is really good compared to the 2.5 to 3 hours you can squeeze out of many cookie-cutter P&Cs. It's more on par with the length of the better Daedalic games, like The Whispered World or The Dark Eye series.\n\nThe Not So Good StuffMy main gripe is with a handful of puzzles. Their common aspect is that you must return to a specific location you previously visited at least once, because something there will have changed that significantly furthers the gameplay (a visual cue or new interactive object), but you are given no indication that you need to revisit that location. You're left to randomly search areas and play "spot the difference" from memory. That isn't fun. One of the worst offenders is the near-unreadable cipher that appears in the front office after you complete Morton's chapter. Solving that puzzle also requires knowledge about another room you probably forgot about, because you used it once already. It's a lot of needless running around unless you keep notes. And don't even get me started on the recipe book and door code in Chapter 3. Clever mechanics, yes, but waay too obscure. I don't like resorting to LPs when the rest of the game is so satisfying to solve on my own. (Note that following a walkthrough can spoil a lot of the "surprise/realization" aspects of the story, so a decent amount of patience for the majority of puzzles is recommended.)\n\nThe fusebox puzzle in the apartment was also one I had to look up. I may be in a minority here, but that wire layout made no sense to me (and I've played many similar puzzles before).\n\nFor such a polished game, it was a tad strange to see some obvious spelling errors. But they don't disrupt gameplay/immersion.\n\nOverallThe Dream Machine is leagues above its competitors in the genre as far as depth of story and intelligent puzzle design. Solutions are smart, realistic/logical, and very satisfying to figure out. A few puzzles are too obscure or provide few/no clues for progression, but as annoying as those can be in the moment, they don't detract from the quality of the game as a whole.\n\nAs a seasoned P&C player, I wholly recommend this title to anyone looking for more intellectual challenge from a clever game that not only does not hand-hold, but treats the player like the smart person they are instead of assuming they need a tutorial on how to pick up a shovel.","January 29","true","11.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","2"

Nothing ever released has ever looked like this. It is clay and cardboard and little sets that were hand built and shot. So freaking cool.\n\nThe game was built by a small team, and based on reviews, it seems like it has had it's fair share of bugs. I saw none of them. The team has been on top of them, as evidenced by the regular updates and the fact none of the very minor glitches I saw affected the gameplay in any way. They were too minor to even mention. I have seen worse in AAA games. Development team cares about this game, and when I played, it was solid for all five chapters.\n\nThe story is unique, fun, and engaging. The main story is simple, but the complexity of the dreams is where the magic happens. There are characters even within the dreams to interact it, and their responses to the very... well, odd dream circumstances they, as figments of a dream, are in, is spot on. I find all the dialogue to be very well written and thought out. The developers avoided much of the repetition you normally see when trying to put the square key in the round keyhole. This shows a lot of care and thought when even such minor details as "Item doesn't fit" type messages were considered and customized for most every circumstance.\n\nThe difficulty level is just right for the average adult or the clever teen (might be a bit scary for kids!). The puzzles are varied, and challenge you to think about things you have seen in your adventures and to combine them with new knowledge and items you aquire. It isn't just going room to room to solve a puzzle in each one, you are challenged to think about how the items in your inventory can interact with each other, the environment, other people, and help you achieve the task at hand.\n\nI would have missed this game if a friend didn't gift me an extra copy. It has not gotten the attention it deserves. Don't miss this game if you have stumbled across it. I can't wait for the final chapter! I actually wish I had known there was one chapter left before I began playing, and waited to play the other ones until it was released. It sucked me in before I found out, and I couldn't put it down after I started playing!\n\nHighest recommendation!","September 19, 2015","true","16.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

I've just recently gotten into point-and-clicks and I think this just set a high standard and it's going to be hard to find a game that beats it. The wait for Chapter 6 is going to be painful, especially because the devs post teasers on their Twitter.  As an artist, this is a game to appreciate, and as someone who enjoys 'darker' art, it's a smorgasbord.\n\nReasons why you need it:\n+ Devs are very responsive to cries for help with glitches\n+ Art style is incredible and obviously takes a lot of work\n+ Puzzles are really tough\n+ Puzzles are innovative and different\n+ Chapter format makes it easier to appreciate in moderation instead of doing a binge\n+ It's easy to binge\n\nThere are some little glitches here and there, but your love for the game will overpower them. Community for this game is great as well. There are no cons, really.

Your main goal is to explore and find solutions. The game gives you just enough of information to figure out the puzzles on your own without being too ridiculously difficult. Sometimes you'll get stuck, but don't abandon the game. Take a break for about half an hour and try again. A solution will be found.\nI love the claymation because it is clearly a labor-intensive gamestyle, but very very worth it. The dialogue can become a bit repetitive, but the story is woven in very well with real life dream theories. If you don't like puzzles, this is not the game for you.

Some of the puzzles can be obtuse and pixel-hunty, but they're mostly fine. Definitely deserves more love and hopefully the last episode comes out next year.

It's one thing to have hand drawn art in a point and click, but it's another to have these beautifully crafted real-life hand built scenes.  There is detail in there all the way to 1920x1080 (maybe more?) and truly a pleasure to look at.  Also, the puzzles all make sense and at no point do you "rub every item in your inventory on every interactable object" like you end up doing in some adventure games.  The story is genuinely interesting and isn't just silly, overblown, and played for gags like many other adventure games (not that that's a bad thing, just that since many other games do that it's nice to see something different).  The tutorial segment is extremely cleverly put together and really sets the tone for the whole game.  The puzzles are unique, interesting, and most importantly seamlessly integrate into the world instead of feeling a bit forced and unrelated to the world like other adventure games do (yet another towers of hanoi mini-game anyone?).","December 3, 2015","true","26.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The first couple of chapters were a little slow to start with but it was worth waiting for the later chapters, and it's definitely worth playing through until the end.  The choice of using a style like claymation results a very unique environment and required a huge amount of effort on the part of the developers besides, and it shows.  Localization is good.  If I had to nitpick, it would have been nice to have  recap of each chapter since I was playing new chapters after a few months' wait, but nothing's stopping me from just replaying the previous chapters.

Before I knew it I had flown through Chapters 1 and 2 and was purchasing the rest of the chapters to play as soon as possible. The storyline has a low burn in the beginning but by Chapter 2 things dive into the deep end of possibilities for the storyline and do not disappoint.

Sets are beautifully photographed and worth all the wait. I feel genuinely lucky to have found this, and guilty to have found it when I did, greatly discounted. Very manageable but true to the adventure game way in its inventory. Puzzles are fair. There are either amusing or disturbing comments on most things when attempting to force item interaction. As for the themes and my response, as a skeptic of that certain and too often reinforced mystic attitude towards dreams, I didn't expect the game to make me any sort of believer. Not quite, still, but by this game's insight and the context of its own beauty, I feel changed, though always I had to acknowledge the influence our dreams have on us in recollection, or the reliability and vividness of our recall.

The script, although (perhaps because) it's not voice acted, stands out especially in comparison  to other modern adventure games of its quality.\n\nMost of all though, the game has an appropriately dreamlike, unsettling vibe, which nonetheless never quite gets in the way of how nice, and comfortingly solid, it looks and sounds.","December 29, 2014","true","16.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

That's unfortunate.  This is a game that gets better as you play, so far Chapter 3 was incredibly dense and interesting, and Chapter 4 is set up to be much the same.\n\nTL;DR Version:  10/10, would ruin my wife's dreams again.\n\nI love point and click adventure games.  They are what I grew up with, and at the end of the day, it's the format I'm most comfortable with.  I've spent my time in WoW, and I loved it, and I recently spent two full working weeks worth of time beating the Witcher 3's storyline, and all of these are great experiences.  None of them can take me back to my childhood, the kernel of my gaming self, like a solid point and clicker.  And this is one of them.  This is an excellent point and click adventure game.  That's all it is, mind you, it's nothing more than that.  It's just what it's advertising -- and in its genre, it is absolutely superior.  The story is compelling, even for an old guy like me, the mechanics are fine, and the puzzle strength really isn't that hard if you're willing to stick with it.\n\nYes, we only have walkthroughs for the first two chapters.  Thats ok.  Play around a bit and you WILL figure it out, and it will be way more rewarding than just reading through a walkthrough and beating the game in a few hours.  I promise, you can do it.  Remember when we had to order a hint book from Sierra back in the 80s, and by the time we got it, eight weeks later give or take, we figured out the puzzle?  There's no need for a hint book here.  Just keep at it.  And you'll feel a lot smarter when you figure it out all by yourself.\n\nThis game explores a thing that a lot of people have said a lot about, especially while in an altered state, the Dreamscape.  Ah, the Dreamscape, the Holy Grail of all game creators.  Quite possibly, the next bastion of virtual reality, if we really pick the thing apart.  Go read this review again on an energy drink or two.  If we had some sort of device that would let us fall asleep and log in while dreaming, lets be honest, that's another 6-10 hours a night we'd get to game.  That's all I'll tell you about the plot.  You don't need more.  Play the game.  It's fantastic.\n","September 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It lacks a chapter, and the chapters may be fast to finish, but it can still be hard to figure some things out. Really, it really triggers your brain to think and go beyond a reasonal thinking.\n\nThe art style is actually interesting and the game is very compelling with it. It looks like clay figures who are a little bit deformed and all, even looking like having masks and things like that. The characters can be pretty strange, also the story, but it actually is part of the fun of the game. It has some dense atmosphere, most of the part, so you'll get into the game.\n\nWhen the game finishes with the sixth you can buy it, and, well, the bundle is more recommended since it can be expensive to buy the chapters alone. If you buy the bundle, the sixth chapter will also be available for you. But, it still does not have any date to launch.

The world - or worlds as it quickly becomes - presented here is undeniably stunning, though the misshapen forms of its people and the engrossing plot at hand distract from that beauty. This is a game that demands that the urgency of the plot be forgotten from time to time in favor of stopping to take in the sights. However the novelty of its art style isn\'t the only thing The Dream Machine has to offer. Some of its puzzles are absolutely brilliant and though a few did seem to come out of left field, none felt absurd or out of place. A single mouse button takes care of all player actions making the controls very accessible, but also equally restrictive. Frustration is often born of not having enough tools to come up with a variety of possible solutions or to tell the game what you would like to do, and this is a hole The Dream Machine tends to fall into.\nThe game is very much a work in progress. It\'s still somewhat buggy and is missing its concluding chapter, but it is very playable even without those finishing touches. The individual chapters are a bit short, but they are priced to their playtime, so it\'s hard to complain about that. Having played five out of the the six intended chapters, the story so far is satisfying, as is each chapter taken on its own, even if it\'s all currently ended with a cliffhanger.","June 1","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That is very important in an adventure game.\n\nThe visiual presentation is neary perfect. Soundtrack is a good fit.\n\nOne bad point is that the characters move in a weird animation (maybe it was on purpose, or maybe it is because of the carboard and clay thing), and I personally find it unpleasing.\n\nAnother thing is that I like playing these game in a fullscreen, and I would love to have the option of rendering in a 16:9 format. The game seems to be tailored for windowed mode and for a more conventional square-ish screen ratio.\n\nOther than that, I would consider this game a definite buy; it has the potential of becoming a classic.\n\nGreat job devs!","March 26","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not being a huge fan of 'point and click' games I decided to give 'Dream Machine' and chance one rainy afternoon when I was bored with the usual third or first person shooters, and was pleasantly surprised with my discovery. For starters, the artistic direction that was chosen for this game suits the tone of the story perfectly and does nothing but add to the overall creepiness factor of the characters and the setting. The game is also pretty challenging at times and really makes you think. I almost felt like a detective while playing. I also found it refreshing that the game was broken up into several different chapters, each entirely different than the one that preceded it. Overall, the stories here are pretty interesting for a few hours, and for five dollars I can recommend 'Dream Machine' to those who are at this page right now, interested in this game, considering a new addition to their Steam catalog.","March 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backgrounds are immersive and really atmospheric. At first the characters creeped me out as they have no eyes, but the creepiness works well with the game overall which is often quite dark.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging enough but not frustrating. They make logical sense despite the fantastical places you may end up in, which makes the puzzle solving satisfying.\n\nIt has a good plot also - I found that I couldn't stop in between chapters as I just wanted to know what happens next (luckily the first 5 chapters were out when I bought it). The writers have done a good job of creating tension and uneasiness as well as characters that you actually care about. Delving into dreams opens up some crazy worlds and also deep back stories.\n\nMy only gripe would be some bugs in the latest chapter such as the game skipping you forward to a later point if you have loaded up an older save. Thankfully the game is constantly updated as the bugs are fixed.\n\nOverall a well made, imaginative and immersive adventure game.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #50 - The Dream Machine\n\nBefore I started my series of reviews, I hadn't really played much in the way of adventure games.  But, it's been nice seeing a resurgence in this genre, and now I've had the opportunity to play through several adventure games.\n\nGoing in, I didn't know anything about The Dream Machine.  So playing it felt a little like going to a movie that you didn't see the trailer for, and you don't even know what genre of movie it is.   And I'm glad I did that because I feel like I've just watched the opening act of a mystery, so not knowing anything ahead of time definitely added to that sense of mystery.\n\nI won't spoil anything about the story, other than to say I enjoyed the first chapter, which I just had time to finish in my first hour of play.  The story kept me engaged enough that by the time I noticed the time my playthough was nearly over.  I think this is one of the better compliments you can give a game when it has that ability to suck you in.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself seems fairly typical for a point and click adventure game.  It involves a lot of walking around, doing some pixel hunting to find points of interest, and picking up things that you'll need to use later.  Pretty much everything I could pick up I ended up using on something, and often in ways I would not have expected.  Besides the "use this item on this thing" type of puzzle, I also played a different kind of puzzle that involved turning knobs on a machine.\n\nI did occasionally have some trouble lining up my mouse cursor on the right pixel to pick something up, but it didn't happen often enough to be really annoying.  Also, when you move the mouse to the top of the screen, a bar will pop down with your inventory, but sometimes this interferes with you trying to point to something at the top of the screen.  Other than these couple of minor annoyances, I didn't really run into any problems with the game.\n\nBesides the story, I also enjoyed the art style.  Most of the adventure games I've played have an animated, cartoon like art style.  But this game has a claymation inspired art style which really sets it apart.  I can really tell a lot of work went into the art for this game.  The characters look great, and so do the backgrounds.  Everything has this hand crafted look to it.\n\nI'm not sure if the following chapters are any longer to play, but I could see some potential concern about the game being relatively short (for what you pay for it).  There are 6 chapters total (but the 6th is not out yet).   I wouldn't be surprised if the follow on chapters take a little longer than an hour to get through.  For me personally it's not an issue, as I think the game is worth the price, and would happily recommend it.","February 20","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are only a couple of hours of gameplay (took me about 2 h to finish both chapter 1 and 2); this, however, will probably stop being a problem once all six chapters have been released.\n\nSure, I'd recommend this game to point-and-click puzzle lovers but be forewarned that it's a really short gameplay and you get no closure after finishing a chapter as it is "to be continued...".","June 24, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The puzzles, like most point and click games, range from stupidly easy to esoteric beyond belief but this game manages to have a pretty consistent degree of difficulty. Unlike a lot of point and click games the puzzles reveal themselves through interacting with the environment and being patient, not many puzzles require outside help to finish or understand. The art style in this game is really interesting, I believe they used claymation to model everything in the game which makes for a really unique style. The only complaint I have about that is that the characters are horrifying, especially the wife character but then again maybe that’s the artist’s intent. The story is alright but nothing to write home about. I don’t know how to fix it but they had the ability to make something super interesting and out there, like Twin Peaks, but it just kinda falls short and feels like a semi-surreal romantic drama. Another complaint I have about the game is the length, ~45 minutes a chapter is too much to ask $5 fo. So while I enjoyed this game I don’t think I’ll pick up the last two chapters unless I see them on sale. Overall it was enjoyable, if you own it I suggest giving it a play through if you don’t I suggest wait for a sale to pick it up.","February 23, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was taken by the look of it and I am a fan of point-and-click adventure games. I'm still very happy that I stumbled upon this game.\n\nThe artwork is amazing and adds a depth to the game that complements the story very well. The few animations that are present feel natural for the artstyle even if they aren't perfectly smooth. I can appreciate the time that goes into creating each scene in this game.\n\nThe story has been very captivating thus far. It builds up very well and I feel very anxious to continue the story after each chapter. Although it would be nice to have audio instead of full text, it is very easy reading with short clips of text instead of walls.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty generic for a point-and-click adventure game with puzzles and a fair amount of walking from room to room using simple clicks for mechanics and a few drags to piece things together. For a real story-driven adventure game, though, I can deal with simple mechanics that allow for greater concentration on the puzzles, story, etc.\n\nThe developers are working hard at keeping the game updated and fixing any known bugs or issues. Fortunately, I haven't come across any issues with the game, myself. They've been constantly refining and adding to the game so it's likely better to pick up a copy later in development. It has been released on more and more platforms as the game ages.\n\nThe only real qualm that I have with the game is the extremely slow release of the chapters. When I purchased the game, I believe chapter 3 was just being released or had just been released. The release date for chapter 3 was October 31, 2011. To put the delays into context, chapter 4 was just released August 6th, 2013. I'm never one to mind waiting for a delay on a release for a well-refined product but that was a bit extreme. Fortunately, the developers have mentioned a release for chapter 5 in just months instead of years. Here's hoping. A miserable part of waiting so long is you have to revisit places and puzzles you've done in previous chapters; however, the game is quaint enough and easy enough to follow that forgetting shouldn't be a problem for most.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game. The price isn't bad and it does go on sale on Steam. There is a demo available on the official website that allows you to play the entirety of chapter 1 through your browser. I'd say that the demo, at least, is a must-play. http://www.thedreammachine.se/","June 1, 2014","true","23.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And the story is far more mature and interesting than one expects. Though if Tim Burton has taught us anything, it's that claymotion has a tendency to turn the cute into something surreal, unsettling, even horrifying at times. As the chapters progress, things go from banal to weird to scary, like in some old Stephen King novels. The puzzles also advance in difficulty, and while they are occasionally hard, they are mostly logical, and generally feel well worth the effort. Take the time to think and try out things, this isn't a game that wants to be rushed through.\n\nA really memorable, really gorgeous, really fun to play puzzle adventure.

While, some rooms and objects are undeniably created with such materials, I had to wonder if many weren't 3D rendered.  Either that's a testament to how well they were done or I'm under a false impression that ALL objects were made with either cardboard or clay.\n\nSome of the dialog seemed cheesy and presumptuous, but not to the point that it detracted from my enjoyment of the game.  Also, none of the dialog is voiced.  Sometimes repeating the same dialog is required in order to choose different dialog options and I was at times irritated when I had to repeatedly use the mouse button after every line instead of being able to press the escape key to skip everything.\n\nThe gameplay areas of each chapter are relatively small, but the puzzles within them were done well enough to keep me busy.  I thought the puzzles made logical sense and, apart from overlooking several objects which kept me stumped for a while, I was able to figure them out without help.\n\nThe game is only 2/3 complete nearly 4 years after its initial release as of this review.  Chapters 1 and 2 were released in December 2010, Chapter 3 in October 2011, and Chapter 4 in Auguest 2013.  It is now September 2014 and I'm left wondering when the next two chapters are going to be released.  Judging by the development timeline, it could be another 1-2 years before I may be able to experience the story's conclusion.\n\nUpdate: It's now April of 2016 and the final chapter still hasn't been released.  When I purchased this game, I expected it to be complete within the year like all other episodic games I have come across on Steam.  Instead, this game is more like an Early Access title where you just don't know when or if it will ever be completed.  Based on this experience, I will never purchase another game from this developer again.","September 15, 2014","false","16.6"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","12","26","0","0"

My problem in the game specifically is that I need an item, but I can't possibly get it, so I need to restart the chapter.

Really amazing storytelling, visuals, music, and gameplay. The puzzles are complex without being absolutlely impossible, and there's no totally bizarre solutions. Just about everything makes sense within the context of the world, and it's a really engaging world for the chapters that have been released so far. If you'd prefer to play it all at once, I'd wait untill all the chapters are released: but if you don't mind the wait, buy it now for sure.\n\nMy only current dislike is that there's not a huge reason to replay it due to a lack of randomly generated puzzles, but given the length of what's already out I'd say it's pretty worth what it gives. However, I still personally find it fun to replay, if only to choose dialogue options I didn't choose before, or just to see the amazing art.","July 31, 2014","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The humor is pretty funny and the horror is... actually kind of disturbing. While I can't say the dream portions opperate on actual dream logic, they can certainly make you forget that it doesn't, and figuring out the internal logic of each individual dream is pretty fun in itself. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a kick out of the subtle The Prisoner shoutout in Chapter 1.\n\nI am, however, struck by how lucid the various dreamers are once you find them, not to mention weirdly capable of taking the whole bizzare scenario in stride. Then again, considering the sorts of things I'm able to take in stride in my own dreams that would weird the hell out of me in real life, I suppose they aren't quite so lucid after all. But this is neither the time nor place for those stories.\n\nMy only complaints are that A) a few of the puzzles are terribly inconveniant to complete, even after you've figured out the solution, you're given a hell of a runaround to actually put that solution into action. And B) the chapters are over too quickly. I hope the next two chapters are longer.","February 24, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like there have been so many times where I've just wandered around and done everything I could think of to figure stuff out what needs to be done and then I've had to look it up and I realise that it is the most random and uncomplex answer that has nothing to do with anything. Like, how do people stumble upon these answers??\nThe cutscene kind of bits are so lovely and the story is beyond interesting and extremely grasping, but the 'puzzles' have really let me down.\nI'd still recommend it, as I haven't finished yet and have set the bar for the ending high, but the randomisation of answers makes it difficult when I can't work something out, because I can't ask for help :')","June 2","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
