"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/438820/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","It seems every month several of these minimalist precision platform games are released onto Steam. Some of them are actually very good games such as Hyper Box but there comes a point where even being very good stops mattering because the market is flooded full of them.  With a saturated marketplace the most important thing that a game in this genre needs to be able to demonstrate is innovation. What makes it different than other games in the genre? If there’s no point of differentiation then a game will get lost in the crowd. You’ll have your early adopters and then you’ll hit the point where you’re nothing but a blip on the longtail. Unfortunately, I believe that Hyper Box will end up as another one of those blips on the long tail.\n\nFor starters, the game instantly reminds me of Russpuppy’s The Deletion. While there is definitely some differentiation between the two games they play somewhat similarly – more than just being in the same genre – but Pixelated Cupcake’s game is darker in its scheme. Both games are very good at what they are trying to achieve but a consumer who has the choice between the two probably only has the later release date of this game as a reason to purchase this over the other. However, even that may work against it if the consumer is aware of both titles because the older game has had greater opportunity for review and is a dollar cheaper.\n\nBut as I said this game does hit the mark. It is difficult as good games in the minimalist precision platform genre need to be but more importantly the game play is addictive. It very quickly becomes a one more turn type of game. Unless you are some sort of gaming god the chances of you dying multiple times perhaps even hundreds of times trying to complete the levels is seriously high. But you’ll want to battle on and unlock the unlockables within the game. They truly feel rewarding when you do because of the amount of hard work you’ve put into the game to get to them.  The only downside is that the game becomes repetitive but that is another thing to expect with the genre.\n\nIn all, I can recommend this game if you’re not burnt out on the genre. There’s not enough new to warrant a purchase if you are but expect a solid game that is what it wants to be.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 27","true","9.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The difficulty ramp is insane. They give you three easy levels to make you feel good, and then they just throw a punch at you that you were not prepared for which you take to the face. I loved it! I was stuck playing it for awhile just trying to pass one level. One level for 30 minutes!\n\nPros:\n-Increasing difficulty\n-Addictively fun (you just want to get to the next level!)\n-Different costumes so that you can pimp out your cube\n-More expansions to come, and hopefully new challenges\n-The creator made WASD available as an alternate to the arrows, which is astounding.\n\nCons:\n-Gets kind of repetitive after some time of playing\n-The difficulty ramp seems a little intense (I got stuck on the 7th level)\n-Music is rather loud, and there is no options in game to make it softer (Only a mute button)\n\nI know this game is early access, so the control scheme will probably become more customizable and the options added as time goes on. I believe this game to have a lot of potential, and I personally would love to see it thrive. If you would like to see how it plays before you buy it, I have a video up on my youtube channel that I welcome you to check out if you are interested! I hope this helps guys, and good luck getting past level 7 :p\n\nYoutube video:  Here\nPart 2:  Here\nPart 3:  Here","February 2","true","7.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Despite some ragey moments, the game was very much a positive experience for me. I enjoyed the level design, Pixelated Cupcake did a lot with a little, as he constructed engaging stages that always helped the player grow.\n\nWhat you'll find in this game depends primarily on what you are looking for. Do you want a rage game? If so, this game will definately scratch that itch, not by being unfair though, simply by being brutal in what it demands from you in terms of execution. Do you want a precision platformer? Again, this game will give you that experience, if you are willing to forgive the occasional glitch. Do you want a game that guides you? This game does indeed guide you, it just does so by punishing your failures and nominally rewarding your successes.\n\nBasically, if you are seeking a platformer that will test your mental abilities as well as your reactions, then you should certainly give Hyper Box a try. Don't expect much in the way of unfair deaths, but don't expect to be able to skate by on luck either.\n\n","April 2","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're just a simple box that twirls and you must time your jumps against walls and obstacles to beat the level. Oh, you only have 30 seconds. You have big enough cajones to beat this game? For 3 dollars and it's still in early access it's a simple yet challenging game. Only downside there's a lack of options and levels. But for 3 dollars that's enough to tie you over to try to beat your record. Probably the only downside I can think of? Lack of any controller support but other than that it's a solid game.","February 23","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","6"

Please for the love of god add a mute button in game. Also try to add music tracks longer than  a few bars with loops.\n\nRemove the timer. Have a timer that counts up. The timer only adds artificial difficulty. Its more frustrating than fun. Allow someone to complete the puzzle regardless of how long it takes. This allows someone to win at their own discretion. If the player wants to complete the puzzles slower then let them. if they want to go for a speed record then let them. More ways to play is always better. Limiting the player to X ammount of time to complete is a relic of arcade op games. It has no real place in modern gaming.","February 24","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I still can't recommend this game though until the controls get slightly better.
