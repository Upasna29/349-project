"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazynone/recommended/16060/","crazynone","CrazyOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crazynone/","2752 products in account","I felt like it's kinda easier than the "Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena". Especially because of the scanner option change. Now when you click on the name of the item, the scanner shows you not only the shape of it, but it also changes the color to red once you are close to find the item (like a hide and seek, hot and cold child play). I still like the game. Story is very nice and the graphics put a big smile on my face. I must say that in this game you need to be more precise where to click (I got frustrated few times cause I was clicking right at the object and still the game told me that I'm wrong...and my scanner was breaking way more often than in the previous game), so it takes more time to play this game (I don't mind to play it long).\nYou have way more dialogues in this game, you are solving more puzzles and some of them are harder than the ones in "Hidden Roses of Athena" (especially the Zodiac puzzle, where you have to be very precise). But overall, like I said at the beginning, I felt like it's bit easier game.\nI totally recommend this game. You don't have to play "Hidden Roses of Athena" first to understand this one. :) Combo of those two is really nice though. :)","October 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/recommended/16060/","krayzkrok","krayzkrok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/","523 products in account","This is the sequel to Samanth Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena, and it follows exactly the same formula: you visit different countries searching for separate components to a myserious object that will save the day. Each place you visit involves a number of hidden object scenes, finding things that are lying around, and using tools in mostly obvious (and sometimes extremely unlikely) places. Occasionally there's a mild puzzle to solve, such as solitaire, match 3, jigsaw puzzles etc. It's all very easy, the cartoony style makes the objects stand out quite clearly, although in each scene there's usually one or two objects that are hidden a little better than the others. However, the game really falls over itself to give you hints, clues and not-so-gentle nudges, so you're unlikely to get stuck for more than half a minute. Hover a tool anywhere in the general vicinity of where you have to click, and a shower of sparkles erupts from your cursor. No doubt there, then! There are an abudance of hints that basically show you exactly what to do, by the end of the game we'd amassed nearly 40 of them and didn't use one. I mean, it's all good, clean fun and best enjoyed as a group, but it was easier than the first game. It really needs a "hard mode" where you can turn all that stuff off. Still, a good time was had by all, and I'd recommend it if you like this kind of thing. Just don't expect much of a challenge.","February 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

(My total hours are inflated because I kept forgetting to exit the game and left it running while not playing it.) Good choice if you like hidden object games, but only recommended if on sale and bought in a bundle with the other Samantha Swift game.\nRating: 3/5","June 29, 2014","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WHat was frustrating is that it would say it was running and I could see it in task manager but nothing ever showed up.  So far since I finally have it running on windows 8 it is a decent little game with plenty of hidden objects and some storyline, nothing elaborate..kind of a jump from here to there and find things and quick put this together...if you are looking for an elaborate and involved storyline and flow with the hidden objects game then this is not it..it's more like hidden object everywhere and oh by the way yeah we need that to propel the story forward...also the hidden objects are slightly lame because they will be like bust 1 and bust 2 all in all can't complain for a decent discounted bundle except for the whole we don't support 8.1 would have been nice to know before buying.  Glad I still had a machine on an ealrier windows version.","August 1, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now the game have a lot of clicking and the game really requires you to observe the environments.
