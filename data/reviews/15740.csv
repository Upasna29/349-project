"http://steamcommunity.com/id/khrisstradlater/recommended/15740/","khrisstradlater","Revvster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/khrisstradlater/","402 products in account","This here is the report I sent to Valve when asking for a refund, coupled with a reply to the developers in a discussion about the fact that the game does not work. Keep in mind, this is a lengthy sun♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nTL;DR: This game does not work and is arguably one of the worst PC ports of all time. Purchasing this, you will not be able to play it.\n\nThis reaches over the 2 week mark, in fact it has been 2 years. That is obvious, but disregarding this request solely on that purpose is a sick thing to do. Do not cancel this because it has been two years, Valve has not been allowing refunds, only recently your company has opened their eyes to developers trying to steal from players. Read on if you are a morally stable human being. I am serious.\n\nThe community overall has been begging for this game to work. The games here do not work (Excluding "Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD", though that one is an awful port, it still works.\n\n\nI want you to read this thread. http://steamcommunity.com/app/15740/discussions/0/618463738386140569/#p5\n\nThat thread, right there, is about developers not giving a damn.\n\n"Cr4zyJay is 100% right. You people are disgusting. I respect developers who put actual work into their games. I study game theory and I understand how hard making a game is. I study art, and I understand how hard making characters are. I do not however, understand how you can morally stand back as a company, and watch people complain about you stealing money, and simply not give a ♥♥♥♥. It's sickening. Absolutely. ♥♥♥♥ ing. Sickening.\n\nThis game is so ♥♥♥♥ing broken, I was furious. I know how to get games to work, believe me. I'm not stupid. Fixing my compatability modes and launch commands on Windows 7 AND Windows 8, it just doesn't work. And on the off-chance it does, and on the off-chance that you can get past the main menu without it crashing on you, this crashes constantly. I know plenty of people who can't leave the tutorial without the game crashing. I can't either.\n\nSteam won't allow refunds on this because of how long ago it was purchased, but you devs should. The morality of not allowing refunds and basically stealing money is ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\nMaking people pay money for broken ports that don't work on plenty of systems should be a crime, and you should feel ashamed for releasing it in this state. Dark Souls 1 had a better port, and that thing barely even functioned. I wasted days getting this garbage port to run, and now i'm done with that.\n\nThe fact that your team is not taking action stands that your people just do not care. I will not be buying your newest game, since I can imagine it will recieve the same kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up trolling as this one recieved. Devs are supposed to care, but nobody in this threat is seeing any sort of care going on whatsoever.\n\nDon't even get me started on the awful emulated PS1 ports of the first two Oddworlds, you know, the ones that also do not run for plenty of people. Sure the game was cheap, but still. That's borderline stealing money. I hope you shifty theives are happy. I know for a fact I will never be purchasing anything from this developer ever again, and I will feel good about that.\n\nI am going to file a second request for a refund. If I do not recieve one from Valve, I will be waiting every minute for a check for 7 bucks.\n\nA reply would be great, thank you."\n\nThat right there is the post I placed under that thread just a few minutes ago. This post, by a user named Cr4zyjay voices my complaints entierly.\n\n"you are disgusting in your professional manner.\n\nif i go into a game store and buy a game that does not work properly and go in to complain, the store manager humbly apologises for the inconvenience and trouble caused and either grants an exchange or a full refund, abiding by the law's statutory consumer rights that protect me the customer. If such purchase proves the game entirely across all copies does not work properly, the product is proved to be defective and gets removed from sale.\n\nYou people have done NOTHING like that.\n\nYou have insulted all of us with your 2 year late response which only tells us that you could not care less about the poor version of Munchs Oddysee available on PC as of TODAY, you are just going to leave it there, and remaster the game and then ONLY upload the update once you are confident you have x2 versions of the same game to make money from on the day of release for Munch HD on mobile.\n\nWhat's also sad is a lot of people in here are bending over and letting you have your way with them. They PRAISE your 2 year late response, they adore you for finally deciding to fix something that should have never been sold on steam in the first place.\n\nAnd all you have got, is "Rumbled". Charming customer service skills you have there. You're a failure."\n\nCheck the community hub. Read the forums, no seriously. Do that. Do you see people complaining about the game not working? You should, people have been begging the developers for YEARS to make these games work. They do not, they haven't and at this rate they never will.\n\nIn good morality, any developer or retailer would give a full refund. Hell if I purchased this at my local Gamestop, they would have given me in-store credit. Why? Because selling faulty products should be illegal. Outright illegal. In good morality, you should be offering full refunds for every person who owns this pack, whether they accept the refund or not, it should be offered. Developers try and grift us good people constantly, and as a respectable company, Valve must consider refunding this. If not, well, you need to do your job better.\n\n\nInstead of sending me an email stating "We will not be refunding" this time, I want a reason. I want a real, actual human being to type me a response.\n\n\n\n\n*If Valve denies this request, I will send this request every day until the day I die. If I get banned from sending requests, I'll make a new account, and send requests there. If that gets banned, I will email every employee of the developers of this game until I recieve a refund.\n\n**Edit**\nValve denied this request, they didn't even read my message, the cheap buggers. All they did was deny it because I bought it three years ago. I'm going to keep sending this in, every two hours, since that's how long it takes for them to not give a ♥♥♥♥.\nThe devs are saying they're making another version of this, another company is. Is it a port or re-make? He hasn't stated as of yet as far as I am aware. The only answer we've gotten is the usual "We're sorry, we know you're upset, this new game coming out *TBA* is going to be free for those who own it currently."","September 1, 2015","false","1.4"," 71 of 106 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","71","106","8","28"

With wonderfully designed characters, an awesome soundtrack, hillarious and strong story, strategy, action, and good old platforming, it is a game beyond compare. It also provides plenty of backstory, so you don't even have to had played the other games. And for only $5.00? Get out your moolah and buy this game now!\n\nAbe is a hero among his people after destroying Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brewery. He has saved a great many of his Mudoken freinds from being turned into lunch and tricked into slavery, but he always knew there were more of his brothers out there. Munch is a Gabbit who has lost his people. After the Glukons, those who were behind Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brewery, used nets to capture all of the Gabbits from the ocean, Munch has been left alone without any hope of seeing another of his kind again. But together, with their psychic abilities, they will bring down the Glukons and Vyykers Labs once and for all, and get the last can of Gabbit Eggs to save Munch's race. But not without saving the Mudokens and the Fuzzles of course!\n\nSome people critisize this game because of it being a port, but I think there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the controls, graphics, or anything whatsoever. This game is a purchase you will not regret, and I also recommend the others in the series as well.\n\n9/10","July 23, 2014","true","1.1"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","35","46","0","0"

On the propeties box, click on the betas tab. You should see "select the beta you would like to opt into". Click the dropdown box and select "beta".

Over 13 years later the game is still just as fun and has lost none of the replayability value. The gameplay has a good dynamic to it, retaining some of the aspects of the Abe's Oddysee games (such as being able to tell the mudokons what to do and have them follow you around) but also introducing several new gameplay mechanics with Munch. Each level is a puzzle; it can take tens of tries to complete a level, but it is extremely rewarding when you do - and more so when you save as many of your allies as possible. The game ending rewards you for saving the mudokons and fuzzles so I'd encourage you to try your best to do so!\n\nThe game is a bit awkward to control with a keyboard due to the turning mechanic and I didn't find it easy to adjust the controls to fix this so I'd recommend buying a controller to play this game with (the game was designed to play on an Xbox controller, and works find with a USB Xbox 360 controller, and others may work too). The gameplay is smooth and surprisingly polished for a console port. I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you have the money.","July 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

I had played and loved the first two Oddworld games on PS1 and I was excited to pick up the Oddbox while it was on sale.  Given the amount I paid for the bundle, it was well worth the cost.  The camera controls for this game make it a huge pain to play.  If you're using keyboard and mouse, the mouse is supposed to move the camera.  In my experience, it only moves the screen such minute amounts that it is barely noticeable and instead, the Function keys (F1. F2. etc) have to be used instead.  If you have an XBOX360 controller plugged in, the camera controls are hard-mapped to the D-Pad.  SERIOUSLY?!  Sure, back when this clunky 3D game came out, camera controls were notorious for being bad, but we should be able to switch the setting so that the camera is controlled by trigger buttons or the right stick.\n\nI tried to give the game a serious try, but after an hour I've given up.  Once platforming gets more difficult in the game, it's going to be impossible to play effectively.","June 30, 2014","false","1.2"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

If you can play through the constant crashes and falling through the solid ground and hearing Munch and Abe scream in pain as they fall for no reason great! get the game then, if you can't like most people save your money.","September 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would love to enjoy this game with all the performance benefits from PC hardware, but I cannot as it has serious crashing issues.\n\nExit the first cave, crash. Slide down the first cliff collecting spooce, keep running and colliding with something, jump into Well which shoots me back to the top of the cliff, slide down again, manage to move this time, crash.\n\nAlthough this game does not deliver the same (and in my opinion, better) experience of it's predecessors (Abe's Oddysee/Exoddus), it still has a lot of heart and imagination to be enjoyable. The characters of Oddworld are enough to make this game fantastic.\n\nBut I am reviewing this game based on my past experience of playing it on the Xbox as the crashing on the PC renders the game unplayable.\n\n7/10 when the game works (if memory serves me well)\n\n0/10 for the Steam version, until they sort out the crashing.

They claim the puzzles are tedious and repititive but I remember Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus having repititive puzzles as well.\n\nJust like the other Oddworld games, this game will have you rescuing Mudokons. But it's not just Mudokons you rescue this time. You also have to rescue Fuzzles and Mudokon eggs. And there are also lots of power ups. It also features the same awesome cutscenes and political commentary found in the other Oddworld games. My only complaint is the camera.

As a result, these games tend to work best on the platform they're made for. This is most certainly evident for Munch's Oddysee. Couple that with the fact that it's arguably the worst game of the Oddworld series, and it'd be fairly understandable that people would pass it up.\n\nI personally love each addition to Oddworld, and this game is no exception. It may be the worst game, but that doesn't automatically make it bad, it's just not as good as the others. While most game series made their jump to 3D in the N64/PS1 generation, Oddworld did that with the Xbox... and I can't really say it was effected negatively from it. The game looked gorgeous (back then, though still kinda does here and there now), the controls were simple enough to understand, it certainly felt like an Oddworld game. Honestly it pretty much took the series into it's next logical direction.\n\nAbe is still there rescuing Mudokon's, but all in all, he's a free man... mudokon... thing. So are majority of his friends. The spotlight is all on Munch and his problem with being the last of his kind, who just happens to have a very valuable set of lungs. And did we wonder why Abe was (kinda) the only Blue Mudokon seen throughout the series? Well, it just so happens that The Almighty Raisin (roll with it) has discovered that if he helps Munch, he'll discover that.\nIt's a game of partnership and cooperation (in a single player way). Neither can do this without the other, there's always need for them to work together in each level. It does it splendidly. Couple that with Oddworld's... 'oddness', the humour, the weird looking creatures, it's as appealing as the other games.\n\nThe problem is the port to Steam. If you'd played Abe's Oddysee or Exoddus on Steam as well, there's a few problems, graphically and control wise, particularly with the controller. The graphics tend to be easy enough to sort out, but the controller for the previous games was a no-go. This game however, it is very recommended a controller be used. But unfortunately there's a few problems with the thumbstick movements and such. In the menu's, navigation doesn't work at all, only the buttons do. I use the arrow keys on the keyboard for navigation in them. As for the gameplay, I wouldn't say it's incredibly game breaking, but it definitely gets very annoying. Particularly in some of the levels where you're practically running gauntlets.\nIt's like the movement locks itself, suddenly stiffens when moving in a random direction whenever it wants. If not moving at all, at least very slowly. It's especially bad when it comes to Munch when he's swimming, or using his wheelchair. When running from enemies or trying to make important jumps, it gets a little frustrating if the movement is suddenly stopped or slowed down.\n\nSo far the only good ports controller wise for Oddworld games to Steam have been Strangers Wrath and New 'n' Tasty. I hear there's a Munch's Oddysee HD on the way, so if that's true, then hopefully these issues won't be there.\nAs it stands right now... I do recommend the game, but I also say brace yourself for some control frustrations. If you can push past them, the game is pretty damn great.","August 29, 2015","true","33.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Let's just say it's not one of the better transitions of a series from 2D to 3D. It just doesn't hold a candle to the first two games and even Stranger's Wrath.\n\nIMO it feels rushed and not very well thought out, the game is supposedly mostly about Munch, however I found myself playing as Abe about 80% of the time. Surprisingly, there isn't too much story around either, although all of the present cutscenes are expectional. There are fundamental issues with the game's tone and nature of the gameplay though. It is one thing to give Abe a life bar and a completely different thing to see him slap a Slig to death. Arming fellow Mudokons and sending them to battle is kind of hilarious at first, but gets old quickly and doesn't fit in at all with already established concepts. Lastly, the game's just too repetitive, most of the levels see you doing the same thing and it just gets uninteresting and old real fast. It's not a bad game, but it certainly isn't a good one.\n\nThe PC port is pretty bad as well. The original 2010 release was full of bugs and crashed literally every 2 minutes. They've got rid of most of it, but it is still pretty bare bones. Controller support is rather bad, the analog control on my XBOX One controller was insanely off, the game crashes on modern hardware when trying to use Anti-Aliasing (thank god for Super Sampling), in-game options are incredibly lacking (Sound Effects & Music have 3 states, Mute - Soft - Loud, good job lads...). And yet it still crashes from time to time, so I'd recommend you quicksave often.\n\nOverall, I'd pass this one. If you played the first two games and want to see how the story unfolds, just watch the cutscenes on YouTube and move on to Stranger's Wrath which is a masterpiece.","October 30, 2015","false","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Let's just say it's not one of the better transitions of a series from 2D to 3D. It just doesn't hold a candle to the first two games and even Stranger's Wrath.\n\nIMO it feels rushed and not very well thought out, the game is supposedly mostly about Munch, however I found myself playing as Abe about 80% of the time. Surprisingly, there isn't too much story around either, although all of the present cutscenes are expectional. There are fundamental issues with the game's tone and nature of the gameplay though. It is one thing to give Abe a life bar and a completely different thing to see him slap a Slig to death. Arming fellow Mudokons and sending them to battle is kind of hilarious at first, but gets old quickly and doesn't fit in at all with already established concepts. Lastly, the game's just too repetitive, most of the levels see you doing the same thing and it just gets uninteresting and old real fast. It's not a bad game, but it certainly isn't a good one.\n\nThe PC port is pretty bad as well. The original 2010 release was full of bugs and crashed literally every 2 minutes. They've got rid of most of it, but it is still pretty bare bones. Controller support is rather bad, the analog control on my XBOX One controller was insanely off, the game crashes on modern hardware when trying to use Anti-Aliasing (thank god for Super Sampling), in-game options are incredibly lacking (Sound Effects & Music have 3 states, Mute - Soft - Loud, good job lads...). And yet it still crashes from time to time, so I'd recommend you quicksave often.\n\nOverall, I'd pass this one. If you played the first two games and want to see how the story unfolds, just watch the cutscenes on YouTube and move on to Stranger's Wrath which is a masterpiece.","October 30, 2015","false","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In Munch's Oddysee, the levels are small and short, and completing each one takes you to the next with no continuity or explanation except for a few instances. For some reason the detail of each locale in the first two games are also gone. There are only two to three environments recycled throughout the levels, and each one of them looks bland and uninteresting.\n\nAlthough the title of the game is Munch's Oddysee, I found myself using Abe most of the time. Abe is sufficient for most puzzles, save for a few. The puzzles are also usually exploitable. Instead of forcing you to think of the intended solution, there are many times when you can just bypass it by simply possessing all enemies and blowing everything up. There are some annoyingly repetitive sections which serve no purpose but to give an illusion of length to a rather short game. The puzzles start off quite interesting, but become monotonous later on until the last few levels. Some elements (Fuzzles, Interns) make severely limited appearances throughout the game.\n\nThe saving grace is that the story still feels like an Oddworld tale, with its classic humor and social commentary. The cutscenes are excellent as well. I still enjoyed the game, only because I am a fan of the franchise. But I don't think this game is for someone who's still trying to get into Oddworld (try the first two games for that). This certainly is the weakest link in the main Oddworld series.","July 7, 2015","false","15.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","1"

But that still shows that the fans care a lot about Abe and I certainly do myself as he's a beautifully designed character with a great personality.\n\nConsidering that my favourite Oddworld games are definitely towards the 2D ones, Munch's Oddysee is still a great game. The controls can be awkward at times but you tend to get used to them after a while. The level designs are nice with graphics being good for the time. Would recommend if you're a long time Oddworld fan.\n\n8/10.","January 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Many bloody years later I heard this game hit PSN for PS3 I wanted it & I still didn't get it because I owned a Xbox 360 but couldn't afford a PS3 & still don't have one of today.  So here is my PC review of Oddworld: Munch's oddysee.\n\nStory:  Munch's oddysee is about a Gabbit called Munch whos kind have been fished and one day Munch goes out to find them & ends up getting captured by Vykkers & taken to their labs who attach a electronic device to Munch's head so the Vykkers can get Munch to capture other wild life for experiments.  Meanwhile Abe & his Mudokon friends are being told by the Almighty Raisn about Munch's captivity & sends Abe out to save the Gabbit.\n\nWhen Abe & Munch return to the Almighty Raisn they are giving another task to save Mudokons & Fuzzles shutdown factorys & get the owners factory's the Glukkons to donate their cash to Lulu a homeless Gulkkon to buy the last can of Gabbiar eggs from an auction.\n\nGameplay:  Munch's oddysee is an open 3D world puzzle platformer set in Oddworld.  The game starts off as Abe where you have to get to a big well with Abe's friends to get to Vykkers Labs to save Munch.  Abe & Munch are the two playable characters were you can use Abe & Munch can collect spooceshrubs that you need to open loacked doors.\n\nAbe's prossession ablity is changed into a small ball of energy that you an control for limited time if you have enough spoocshrubs & you can chant to grow more spooceshrubs so you can bring back dead native Mudokons & level up to make them fight enemy's.  Munch's ablity's include swimming, taken control of machines that allow you to pick items, ememys & booms. Munch can chat to Fuzzles talking & to get them to attack enemys.\n\nThe game also includes vending machines that have power ups for charactors for Abe to jump higher, go invisble & run faster.  Munch's power ups include swimming faster, jumping higher & zapping ablity to attack ememys that knocks them back.\n\nI did have some glitch's with the game like dropping a Slig or a Slog in front of a van that have them running into it & blowing them away instead of stucking them in whitch is just odd & funny, but the one glitch that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was trying to get a number of Mudokons to activate a few levelers & they end saying "theres nothing to do Abe" that forced me to restart the level just to get my task done.\n\nI highly recommend you play this game with a xbox controller because I couldn't handle the controls a mouse & keyboard to play this game.\n\nWhat I Hated: There are some things I hate about this is 1. There isn't no chat option with prossessed NPCs. 2. There is no stealth. 3. Picking up Mudokons as Abe to toss them over from area from another whitch takes up so much f**king time. 4 Not to meantion that glitch I brought up. 5. Why do the Paramites sound like pigs? 6. There is no sense of fear. 7. Why the hell does this game make you pick up sheep like animals at one point & putting them into a area while the 4 other mudokons were too busy chanting that seems more inportant to than doing there work?  The lazy b*****ds.\n\nFinal Verdict: Is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee worth getting?  umm kind of.  The graphics are a bit old & the cut scenes are just great & for the controls its best to play it with a controller, but you can handle the keyboard good on ya.\n\nSo yeah its okay ish.\n\nThis game & the rest of the Oddworld games (The Oddbox) are available on the Playstation net for PS3 & as of now Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is also Avaiable now for moblie on Android IOS.","November 17, 2015","true","17.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The layout is different and consist of 3D camera viewing. Now you can view the enviroments like never before!\n\nMunch's Oddysee is more of a co-operative based platforming strategy. My co-op I mean two different characters doing different things... not multiplayer.\n\nThis version did have some bugs. Every now and then the game would crash out of no where which can get pretty irritating if it happens too often.\n\nAnd there are some very tedius tasks. One level  you have to use a crane to carry egg crates, and it takes... forever...\nOver all if you can handle the frequent crashing you will have so much fun with this game! Doing really cool and funny things through out the game, it's a new sort of way the world of Oddworld can be viewed.

It's also never hard, you get plenty of Mudokans and just tell them to attack.\nSometimes you have to carry the mudokans from Point A to Point B which could take 30 seconds... but you have to do it 9 times cause you have to bring lots of mudokans. This game never gets hard or complex, it just becomes tedious.\nThe controls and physics can be annoying, it feels like it's selective if it's a 8-direction movement game or 360 degrees game.\nNo memorable narrative or plot.\nIt just did everything Abe's Oddysee/Exoddus did but worse.

Unfortunately this game is barely playable, since it crashes very often, and the controls could be a little more fluid, even when using a controller.

I know for a fact that this is a great game, Ive played through and beaten it before and enjoyed it in all its glory back in the elementary school days, but the PC version couldn't remind me of that.\n\nMostly because the game doesn't work.\n\nThe PC version is littered with crashed and bugs that take away from the experience entirely. Miraculously, I did make it through the game; after tweaking, restarting, and autosaving my game every minute. From what I hear, the only difference between this version and the Xbox version is antialiasing. No upgraded textures, horrible button remapping, and the menu's resolution reminds me of a pixellated arcade game.\n\nI dont know why Oddworld would stop their support for this, but doing so has left a bad taste in my mouth for what I feel so nostalgic for. Verry disappointed to have purchased this.","October 19, 2014","false","11.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The audio quality was atrocious and in no way remastered. The graphics were far from impressive to say the least.\nDon't know about you but when I buy a game I actually like to play it! This port is in dire need of patching and right now I'm not holding out any hope. Do not buy this unstable mess on its own, but it's OK if you get the Oddbox like I did. Don't shy away from the Oddbox because of this monstrosity, just think of it as a disposable turd that you're given alongside a big pot of gold.\nAllow me to direct you now towards the original version of Munch's Oddysee on the Xbox - you know, the version that ACTUALLY WORKED.","May 6, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The camera works very poorly with a mouse and there's no setting to turn off inverted y movement. Design other than gameplay was all-around good.

I remember playing this on the Original Xbox back in the day, you know how you have fond memories for a game but you play it again & it never lives upto what you remember, we not so with this game this game in fact is better than how you remember it. This is a lesson on how to build seriously original games, with endearing Characters.\n\nFrom the opening cutscreen this game will grab you & demand to be played, & is probably the most emotional moment in gaming history. The game has a lot to live upto after that cutscreen & it delivers & delivers consistatly for 23 levels. You control 2 characters the first is Abe & you also Control the star of the show Munch.\n\nNever before has a game entertained both myself & my children so much. Mario 64 is widley considered to be one of the best platform games ever made we this is better.\n\nEssential purchase no matter what game genre you usually play. it's just a pity Munch's Oddysee Crashes so much on pc","June 19, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The camera is totally wonky and I had to invert the horizontal camera movement for it to feel less unnatural.  Graphics are better than the previous games, but voice acting isn't much better.  Trying to remember the numbers for commands is tedious, and don't seem to work all that well in the first place.  Certain levels are more difficult than others, but the minefield level is by far the worst and most frustrating.  I also hate the fact that the action button and jump are the same, as you'll need to use both functions quite often.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/recommended/15740/","thefirstdigit","プレリュード","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/","24 products in account","This time you not only play as our old friend Abe, but also the new and polite Munch! You play as the two and together you have to save Munch's species, the Gabbits. As Abe is now a free mudokon, you get to roam the villages and wilderness of his native land. As Munch, you get to slowly make your way through the industrial environment of the Vykkers, until the two finally meet and you now have to control two characters. This works very good and opens up for alot of new puzzles and ways to approach the game.\n\nThe game is executed very well and with a controller, the controls and gameplay works really good. The levels is a mix of puzzles and action, as you always have to figure out some puzzle, while taking care of enemies and saving your friends. With two characters you also get two different sets of playstyles. Abe who can move fast and agile, will posses and do most of the physical work. Munch, who is native to water, moves slowly on land, but often have to move around sneaky and open up the paths for Abe, while fighting alongside his new friends: the Fuzzles. Munch even has a newly attached neural implant, that can shoot electric shocks if boosted enough! This makes him able to take control over mechanical structures and weaponry, for an explosive exit.\n\nThe graphics are nice (compared to the time) and the cutscenes are just awesome. Sometimes the puzzles can get a little tedious, but that stops as you progress further into the game. While playing you are constantly entertained by funny minor things such as jokes, posters or items found around the world, that has that special oddworld-humor about them. I had a lots of laugh as I played while listening to Abe and Munch debate, or reading the newspaper, that shows after each level. Some items are just so lame, that you have to laugh, like the Vykker's invention; The Buttflo! <- Yeah for a hard stomach I guess. The story is very good and deep, which leaves you really cheering for Munch's cause.\n\nWe are introduced to new things and species, such as the Vykker. If you paid attention in Exoddus, then you'll have noticed a blocked doorway to their lab. We even get to see more of how the lives and such are inside the industrial world of Glukkons and Sligs, which is really interesting and fun. Yet we still get to see familiar things such as Mudokons, Slogs and our dear friends, the Paramites and Scrabs.\n\nOne sad thing is that 2 achievements does not work, and some a bugged. This is really sad. Another problem is that you can't change the axises for the camera in settings, which is annoying. After you get used to that, it won't really affect your gameplay, but can be tricky at times. I also read that alot of people have had problems and crashes. Some were never even able to launch the game. I must say though, that I had zero problem and the only crash I had was when I Alt-Tab'ed alot in a short period of time, so that is most likely my own fault.\n\nI will suggest that you take notice and think of how well you PC has been doing previously, when handling games that could be a bit tricky and fragile. If you have had alot of crashes and such in previous games and don't really have the info to fix it yourself, I suggest you may not buy this game yet. If your PC usually play edgy games or ports good and you rarely have had crashes, then just buy the game.\n\n7/10\nThis is only due to the lack of fixes. While I personally had no problems, I did experience achievements not to work, which is not acceptable, when you compare to the time they've had to fix it. If it ever get fixed, I will gladly return to give 10/10.","January 9","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I get lucky enough to launch the game (it's random chance), the main menu is completely unresponsive. And that's where I am stuck. People who got it to work only got it work for few minutes. I gave up because controls brely t work, no matter what I do. It's not that I cannot get them to work-they do not work. Half of the the time, the game doesn't recognize what I do.\nSteam didn't allow refunds when I bought this game. Today, they would refuse me to give me a refund because I bought it few years ago. Ridicilious. DO NOT BUY THIS, DO NOT BUY AIR, DO NOT SUPPORT DEVELOPERS WHO SELL YOU AIR INSTEAD OF A GAME.\n\n"5 minutes in game"....I had to wait in the unresponsive main menu, play with the buttons a while (most of the time they do not work while they should) because Steam didn't allow me to write a review if I didn't play this gmae for a least five minutes. So, there you have it. Oddworld: Control Torture (nothing against BDSM, but this is too much)","February 5","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Playing on the old school version Xbox years ago. So when I saw it was available on Steam, I bought it straight away! I loved this game back then and I still love it now. You play as Abe, who was part of the previous Oddworld games and also a new character called Munch. You work together to beat the bad guys and its pretty bad ♥♥♥. Munch can swim and Abe can possess and chant people making it awesome! The game includes saving Mudokons which you had to do in the original games. The one thing that annoys me from playing this on the PC is moving the camera angle using my mouse and it can sometimes spaz out, but other than that, its a beautiful game which doesn't require a brilliant computer. Highly recommend this game to all!

Is it as good as the previous 2D installments? no. Is it a bad game? no.\n\nIf I were to review this game before they started the beta updates, I would of told you to completely avoid this game at all costs. The steam port of the game was utter garbage, it was unplayable due to crashes as soon as you completed the first level. Some players got through the game fine, others, like myself, just couldn't even complete the tutorial level.\n\nAfter the community was pretty outraged by these issues, they complained about it in the discussion forums and the developers noticed this. They have done what a lot of other companies would of neglected, they provided fixes and are currently pretty much rebuilding the game and ironing out the problems along the way for free.\n\nI would suggest buying this game on sale, even more so if the bundle is on sale. It's a great game that is currently being fixed by a developer who actually CARES about a game from 2001. That to me, is fantastic.\n\nI recommend this game.","April 7","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/recommended/15740/","thefirstdigit","プレリュード","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefirstdigit/","24 products in account","This time you not only play as our old friend Abe, but also the new and polite Munch! You play as the two and together you have to save Munch's species, the Gabbits. As Abe is now a free mudokon, you get to roam the villages and wilderness of his native land. As Munch, you get to slowly make your way through the industrial environment of the Vykkers, until the two finally meet and you now have to control two characters. This works very good and opens up for alot of new puzzles and ways to approach the game.\n\nThe game is executed very well and with a controller, the controls and gameplay works really good. The levels is a mix of puzzles and action, as you always have to figure out some puzzle, while taking care of enemies and saving your friends. With two characters you also get two different sets of playstyles. Abe who can move fast and agile, will posses and do most of the physical work. Munch, who is native to water, moves slowly on land, but often have to move around sneaky and open up the paths for Abe, while fighting alongside his new friends: the Fuzzles. Munch even has a newly attached neural implant, that can shoot electric shocks if boosted enough! This makes him able to take control over mechanical structures and weaponry, for an explosive exit.\n\nThe graphics are nice (compared to the time) and the cutscenes are just awesome. Sometimes the puzzles can get a little tedious, but that stops as you progress further into the game. While playing you are constantly entertained by funny minor things such as jokes, posters or items found around the world, that has that special oddworld-humor about them. I had a lots of laugh as I played while listening to Abe and Munch debate, or reading the newspaper, that shows after each level. Some items are just so lame, that you have to laugh, like the Vykker's invention; The Buttflo! <- Yeah for a hard stomach I guess. The story is very good and deep, which leaves you really cheering for Munch's cause.\n\nWe are introduced to new things and species, such as the Vykker. If you paid attention in Exoddus, then you'll have noticed a blocked doorway to their lab. We even get to see more of how the lives and such are inside the industrial world of Glukkons and Sligs, which is really interesting and fun. Yet we still get to see familiar things such as Mudokons, Slogs and our dear friends, the Paramites and Scrabs.\n\nOne sad thing is that 2 achievements does not work, and some a bugged. This is really sad. Another problem is that you can't change the axises for the camera in settings, which is annoying. After you get used to that, it won't really affect your gameplay, but can be tricky at times. I also read that alot of people have had problems and crashes. Some were never even able to launch the game. I must say though, that I had zero problem and the only crash I had was when I Alt-Tab'ed alot in a short period of time, so that is most likely my own fault.\n\nI will suggest that you take notice and think of how well you PC has been doing previously, when handling games that could be a bit tricky and fragile. If you have had alot of crashes and such in previous games and don't really have the info to fix it yourself, I suggest you may not buy this game yet. If your PC usually play edgy games or ports good and you rarely have had crashes, then just buy the game.\n\n7/10\nThis is only due to the lack of fixes. While I personally had no problems, I did experience achievements not to work, which is not acceptable, when you compare to the time they've had to fix it. If it ever get fixed, I will gladly return to give 10/10.","January 9","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved it, the atmosphere was perfect and the characters we so endearing. I completed it first with the bad ending (didn't know there were multiple ending, I cried), then with the neutral ending and finally with the best ending. I love this gave - or that is to say, I used to love this game. For some reason it doesn't look as good as I remember and not because it is old. Textures are badly mapped, the controls are badly mapped and a lot of the sounds are bad... ly mapped. How could this happen? All the Oddworld games pushed their respective consoles to the limit, they got so much right. To see this game ported in such a terrible state has hurt my nostalgia glands. Thankfully the devs have released a new beta for the port which has made the game at least playable (though some of the sound changes and the HD textures are a little hard on the ears and eyes respectably). I'm giving this game a like, not because the devs did a good job on the original port but because even with all the bull you have to put up with it, the base game and it's atmostphere are jst too good to dis.

Sure, there might be better game they've made, but dammit, this is the one I've actually had memories playing.\n\nThe past horror stories about the then-current PC port made me hesitant to get this version of the game, but the updated port beta was interesting enough - and I'd say it's won me over even in its rough state. Actual game is pretty much a typical 3d collectathon platformer, which would feel instantly familiar to anyone who played Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Super Mario 64, or (in my case) Rareware's 3d platformers. However, as should be familiar to players of past Oddworld games, this game heavily relies on puzzles from the two playable characters, both of whom play differently and offer their own host of challenges.\n\nSo far I've only played enough to get my bearings, but this new port is really well done. On my 2k monitor and GTX 970, it runs like a dream, without many visual flaws for something that's originally from 2003. I would probably add post-processing sharpening and shaders, but the visuals could keep me playing. This game also controls well on a 360 gamepad, though I had to turn down the walk speed on one of the characters, who felt a little slippery to control in my opinion. Camera controls well, though I had to remove the inverted X axis for it to feel natural. Options are a little lackluster right now, hoping that resolution and quality options can be added in the future, and that the X360 controller controls could be more clearly indicated than using "Button 10" and such.\n\nI have a few issues with this while I've been playing. For one thing, the tutorials in Abe's section - can that shaman tutorial guy shut up and not halt me in my tracks with obvious crap when I'm trying to enjoy myself? I've also found it fiddly to grab Mudokons in order to toss them, feels like that could use a more generous collision box. Also, in order to active an environmental trigger, I found that you can't be right next to it, contrary to my own instincts. Finally, when multiple Mudokons chant, the audio of them becomes obnoxiously loud. I'm hoping that these issues could be addressed or tweaked in future beta releases.\n\nFor $5, this would be a purchase that's well worth your time. Just remember to use the beta version of this game for now.","May 19","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
