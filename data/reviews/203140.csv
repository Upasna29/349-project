I really enjoyed the high-production-value inherent in all of the facets of the game.  The graphics were crisp, the controls were smooth, the writing was interesting, the acting was excellent, etc.  This is a high-quality game, period.\n\nMoving on from there, I also personally felt that the game was extremely fun and that it does a great job of appealing to a wide audience (which, whether you personally like it or not, is the goal of any developers/publishers).  Now I understand that some people felt let down by this game after they had greatly enjoyed previous installments in the franchise.  They didn’t like some of the directions the developers chose to go with Hitman: Absolution™ and thus formed a very vocal group of disappointed customers.  If you are among these people, then I’m sure nothing I can say will sway your opinion, and that is fine.  It is impossible to please everyone, and the developers did their best to appeal to as many people as possible when they made this game.\n\nIn my opinion, disregarding how it stacks up against its predecessors and strictly looking at the game as its own entity, I can whole-heartedly say: I think this game is extremely fun.  Most gamers should be able to find a way to enjoy playing this game.  If you only want to play through on easy and enjoy the AAA quality story and cinematics, you can do that.  If you want to be frustrated with extreme difficulty and be challenged to your maximum breaking point, you can do that.  If you want to replay levels to explore different paths and collect hundreds of in-game achievements, you can do that.  And of course, if you want to fall somewhere in between those extremes, you can most certainly do that.\n\nOne thing I will admit I was not a fan of was the checkpoint system, or lack thereof.  Trying to experiment with various ways to complete levels can quickly go from fun to frustrating when you realize you have to start the level from the beginning every time you mess up.  I personally feel having a quick-save option would have been nice and would have allowed an even more widely varied audience to be able to enjoy the game.  Those who don’t want to play with quick-saves could just simply not use it, or they could have made it unavailable in the top difficulties, but still allowed it in the “normal” difficulty.  But, having said all that, most levels can be beaten in less than 5 minutes, so having to start from the top isn’t that awful… and it does prevent the game from becoming, maybe, too easy.  I still will always prefer having the choice to decide for myself if I want to use quick-saves in a game, or challenge myself not to.\n\nTo put it shortly: Hitman: Absolution™ is an extremely fun game with a noticeably high-production-value quality about it.  It is certainly different from previous games in the franchise, and in some people’s opinions it is not as good as previous games in the franchise; but regardless of whether or not you agree with those people, the game itself is still a good game.  Most gamers will able to find this game enjoyable by customizing the experience to their preferences.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 28, 2015","true","21.5"," 256 of 313 people (82%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","82","256","313","17","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/recommended/203140/","strangemodule","strangemodule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangemodule/","339 products in account","It’s been a long time since a game has absolutely infuriated me. Hitman: Absolution manages to do it.\n\nThis is going to be a pretty long rant/review, so be prepared.\n\nDisclaimer: Played 20 hours campaign, on Hard.\n\nI’ll start straight off with the main problem: The Disguise System changes. In Blood Money, enemies\nwould treat you differently based on what disguise you had on; each disguise had different “permissions”, in terms of what areas of the map you can go in. Enemies would never see through your disguise unless you acted strangely (carried guns as a waiter, throwing objects, bumping into people while sprinting).In Absolution, enemies with the same disguise as you will start pursuing you if you stand in their  vision too long (which is a very short time limit). After this, it’s only a matter of time until they  realize you’re not really who your disguise says you are and start opening fire. This prompts everyone to start shooting you. Add in the fact that maps typically are CRAWLING with guards of the same uniform and disguises have little worth the majority of the time.\n\nMy primary tactic in response to these changes was to change disguise to something beyond a typical cop/guard so I would not be noticed. Sometimes this worked, sometimes I got noticed by other janitors/ushers/etc of the same kind. The only difference of being caught by these guys is that they run away and tell the nearest guards to start shooting you instead. Later levels had high saturation of many types of NPCs, which made me hop from disguise to disguise.\n\nWhy is this problem in need of such detail? I found that it forced me to 1) pacify/kill more NPCs than I wanted to and 2) always be looking at patrolling NPCs instead of my enviornment, which is even worse as my first concern on my first playthrough was to look around the map and find what options I had to killing my target. I spent less time planning my kills and more times trying to avoid a massive shootout.\n\nWhile Hard difficulty increases both the number of enemies and how fast they respond, I feel that\neasier difficulties only reduce the above problems in terms of scale. Fundamentally, I found\nthe disguise and detection mechanics to be absolutely infuriating. I can’t count how many times\nI restarted a checkpoint when an npc turned a corner and unveiled me (proximity decreases how much time you have until detection), and unless you deal with who detected you within 1 second, other enemies will be alerted and sometimes even call for backup! It causes a messy, compounding situation that made me just restart the mission every time I was spotted.\n\nThis problem reaches its apex in the later half of the game, where almost every enviornment is small and populated with a variety of npcs. Preventing detection required me to burn Instinct and keep behind small cover the whole time. Like mentioned above, this prevented me from exploring (and this getting a good feel for) the missions, making me feel restricted in what should be a sandbox scenario.\n\nI’ll be honest and say I have not finished the game. I’m in the middle of the epilogue mission, but after\ngoing through the first half of it just gunning down everyone (including my target), I realized that I\ndidn’t care anymore. I’m going to uninstall this game after posting this review.\n\nI know I haven’t mentioned the story, Contracts mode, or even any of the other mechanics yet. To\nkeep things sparse:\n\n+the story is interesting enough to want to see what happens next, although 47’s character motivations are a little arbitrary. I found the main villian to be entertainingly nutty and even a bit threatening.\n\n+shooting and cover mechanics are solid. Aiming feels fine and you can choose whether you want 47 to “stick” to cover or not.\n\n+Contracts is an interesting idea, but the majority of levels in this game are linear, and I found the sandbox levels to not be fun for the reasons already stated.\n\nI really hate to say that I got so frustrated with a game. I hate being yet another person on the internet saying I didn’t have fun with a game, although I hope I have clearly expressed why I felt that way. Perhaps other people will find this game more fun than I did. However, I strongly advise watching some videos on it, even parts of a playthrough before you make your purchase.","December 26, 2012","false","17.9"," 315 of 422 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","315","422","0","19"

Absolution is far more cerebral than it's predecessors. The storyline is multifaceted and weaves together a plot that focuses on exposing 47's ambitions, strengths, and flaws without making him appear weak or whiny; he is still the ultimate badass, but much more human and believable. Absolution shows a more realistic and approachable 47; one I, and I assume others, can easily identify with. This game really develops Hitman's character on a much deeper level than previously attempted.\n\nThe movements of 47 are very swift and responsive. In fact, many of 47's movements can be compared to how Sam Fisher's movements are in the Splinter Cell games, which means players can now access cover and look around at a 360 angle. I would also compare the sneaking around to the Metal Gear games, as well. In this game, there are just SO many ways to go about taking out a primary target. On one level, I was given the option to take out a target in 12 different ways. That way could be by taking him out, wearing various disguises, taken him out quietly, poisoning his food, blowing his car up or taking him out with guns blazing. Not to mention, players can get reward for doing so, which enhances the replay value of this game.\n\nThe AI has been greatly improved. Characters interact with their environment, situations, and the actions of 47 in many fascinating ways now. Characters generally still have predetermined paths but they can now be interrupted, altered, redirected, and distracted to allow 47 to accomplish his objectives. This really makes a difference in the game play. You no longer have to memorize guards paths or actions, rather you can now change the course of events by affecting the characters in any given situation to gain access to your targets.\n\nAll in all this game is by far the best adaptation of Hitman yet. I highly recommend it. You can play this game and still feel comfortable without having ever played any previous versions.","December 28, 2013","true","20.1"," 401 of 581 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","401","581","0","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/203140/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Hitman: Absolution is a stealth game, developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. This instalment is the 5th game in the Hitman series. The game was released on November 20th 2012; ironically this is the 47th week of the year, referencing the main character Agent 47.\n\nAs with the rest of the Hitman series, you play from a third person perspective. You play as Agent 47 who is the best hitman around. Gameplay is very similar to the previous games, with a strong focus on stealthy progression on every level. At points there will be times where a gun fight will break out, but that usually means you are either very close to the end of the mission or have chosen the path of a deadly mercenary and just going all guns blazing anyway.  Each mission has multiple ways of completing it; you can actually finish the whole game by not shooting anyone, you can set up scenarios so that your “targets” die in an “unfortunate” accident or poisoning.  One of the major changes to Absolution is that Agent 47 now has an “Instinct” ability – this allows you to  track enemies more, and shows up interactable objects more easily. This of course has a limited supply but will slowly regenerate over the course of the mission. The stealth side of the game is done very well, and has the right amount of challenge for you to not get stumped with not being able to progress, but not so easy that you can do it blind folded.  The ability to pick up objects around the world and throw them into enemies path’s to distract them is always a good addition to a stealth game; but also sabotaging items such as electrics to also cause a distraction. The main aim of most of the missions is to take out a target, whilst causing as little disruption as possible, you are scored at the end of each mission taking into consideration how many “non-targets” were killed and other variables.\n\nGraphically, Absolution is stunning.  So much so that the actual gameplay looks better than the cut-scenes. The animations are perfect both in game and in the cut scenes too; it looks like you are playing a film at times. On top of the gorgeous graphics, the sound effects and voice acting are all perfectly spot on.\n\nSadly this game is not as challenging as previous games; this was done to bring in a broader audience to the franchise. You can play the game on a fair few levels of difficulty; hard-core fans of the series will need to be playing this on the harder difficulties. You can always make the game even harder by playing through the game in a complete stealth style.\n\nAll of the Absolution’s missions are huge and extremely well designed. Each of them has more than two ways of completing the objective, on each level there will also be evidence that you can destroy, this will grant you more points at the end of the stage by doing so.  The levels have plenty of buildings, and rooms to explore and you’ll spend most of the time hiding in them to be fair!\n\nThe game is very an extremely good length; it took me just under 28 hours to complete, this was mainly because I tried to complete each level as stealthy as possible, but even then, twenty eight hours for any game is long! There is also a huge amount of replay ability in the game too; not only can you replay the story mode on different difficulties and trying out different methods of taking out your targets, but there is also the “Challenge Mode”, which is player made missions giving an almost infinite amount of gameplay for you to play through.\n\nI had no technical problems with Absolution, I wasn’t able to push the game out on 4k resolutions, simply because it dropped my frame rate below 60, but that is because the graphics would have been mind-boggling. The game can be played with a controller, but I would suggest playing it on keyboard and mouse as you may need quite a bit of precision when it comes to planning your attacks. The game also has plenty of graphical options which are always nice to see; a field of view option would have been nice though.\n\nTo sum up, Hitman Absolution is in my opinion one of the best Hitman games; nothing will ever come close to being better than Contracts, but this one is easily second to that. The game’s gorgeous graphics, stellar gameplay and Hollywood like plot easily makes this one of the best games of from recent years.  The regular price of £14, 99 is very fair for this game too; however it is pretty much always on sale, so wait for the reduction if you can!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/203140/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The Hitman series has continually challenged players with tracking and assassinating various targets across the world, while providing multiple routes in which to accomplish the particular tasks at hand. Absolution marks the first true entry in the current generation of games built upon its powerful, in-house built Glacier 2 graphics engine. In addition, the gameplay has been altered with the introduction of new features associated with the Instinct and Contracts modes.\n\nSet directly after the events of the previous game, Hitman: Blood Money, Absolution tasks Agent 47 with tracking down his series handler Diana Burnwood after she goes rogue and reveals the agency's identity to the public. The new Agency director Benjamin Travis orders Agent 47 to kill Diana and capture a teenage girl by the name of Victoria that has been under her care. Upon reading a letter left from Diana, the narrative spirals into a chaotic set of events interwoven with Agent 47 being hunted by both the police and a cast of villains that aim to capture the mysterious Victoria from him. The majority of levels are set in various exterior and interior locales in Chicago and a small town in South Dakota.\n\nA major contrast from past games in the series is the addition of entire level sequences that focus on evading the police while reaching a designated exit. In these particular sequences, players aren't even provided with particular targets to assassinate that results in the gameplay resembling a generic shooter versus a Hitman game. Some sections feel eerily similar to the gameplay of IO Interactive's past Kane and Lynch series of games. The levels that do offer particular targets to assassinate and multiple routes in which to accomplish that task are the most memorable of the narrative and beg for multiple playthroughs.\n\nEach playthrough of a level is continually scored based on each action taken by the player from killing civilians to being detected by patrolling enemies. The game has a way in which it wants the player to complete each level and any deviations result in the loss of points. Compared with recent games in the Hitman series, Absolution includes far too many linear paths and evade the police scenarios that result in an overall more restrictive experience.\n\nThe major change in the Hitman gameplay formula in Absolution revolves around the addition of the Instinct mode. Instinct in the game is displayed through a meter that regenerates overtime through various actions taken. There are a variety of uses that involve Instinct mode from scanning the environment for enemies and their movement, which is similar to the detective mode in Batman Arkham Asylum, to a quick shot kill system, which is similar to the mark and execute feature in Splinter Cell: Conviction. While both are not original concepts, they work exceptionally well in surveying the environment and when in difficult situations that require a quick takedown of multiple enemies.\n\nThe major aspect of Instinct mode that will cause some frustration with players is how it handles disguises. NPCs in the game can detect that the player is lying about their identity if wearing the same disguise, with the example that other police officers would be able to spot someone new in their ranks. To counter this, Agent 47 can either wear disguises that aren't of the same group of NPCs or use Instinct mode to hide their true identity. Unfortunately, Instinct mode when used for disguises drains at an alarmingly quick rate that makes it useful for only brief scenarios. In later levels, disguises feel completely useless when nearly all of the NPCs are of the same group and can quickly discover Agent 47.\n\nAside from the new Instinct mode and cover system, nearly all of the Hitman series basics return with the infamous fiber wire and dual Silverballer pistols. Along with a host of other weaponry from pistols and shotguns to rifles and explosives, Agent 47 has the ability to utilize various weapons and staged accidents located throughout levels. Makeshift weapons appear in the form of small objects like knives, hammers, and even bongs. While some of them aren't the most practical to use in combat situations, they serve as great alternatives to when a more specialized approach is required for a certain situation.\n\nFollowing with the tradition of past games in the series, Agent 47 has the ability to utilize conveniently-placed staged accidents around the level that range from a hoisted car on a lift to food items that are ripe for poisoning. While some staged accidents are simple to put in motion, others require carefully-planned timing and execution to perform the perfect assassination. Absolution stays true to the Hitman series by continually providing players with a near endless amount of options in assassinating targets from going completely Rambo style to a more subtle approach with a knife stab in the back.\n\nLevels completed in the campaign mode can later be played through in the Contracts mode that has players setting their own targets and selecting loadouts of unlocked disguises/weapons. The points earned in the both modes can be used to unlock additional disguises, weapons, and gun modifications ranging from silencers to extended clips. Contracts mode introduces the Hitman series first online feature in that the scenarios that players devise can be uploaded online for others to download and play. When creating a custom contract, players walk through a level and assassinate whom they wish and with what disguise and weapon they feel is right for the particular task. When the target eliminated, players then rush to an exit point to complete the level. With the level complete and statistics tracked for the time taken for both assassinating the target and reaching the exit, players can then proceed with uploading the contract for other players to compete in beating their score. Players that use the particular disguise and weapon that the creator did in their original playthrough will earn additional points when completing the contract.\n\nContracts mode seems to be the developer's answer to the restrictive campaign levels and escape from the police sections. The Contracts mode is clearly not the perfect solution for fans that were looking for similar gameplay from the previous Hitman game, but it's a step in the right direction considering that players can select their own disguise and weapon loadout. Contracts mode will be interesting to watch as more players upload their specialized combination of levels, targets, disguises, and weapon loadouts.\n\nIO Interactive's Glacier 2 engine can be summarized with 1 word: stunning. From the massively-rendered crowds to the detailed interior/exterior environments, Absolution never ceases to amaze with visuals that beg to be set to max. Absolution debuts as the first real entry of the Hitman series in the high-definition era of gaming and succeeds at trumping nearly all of the current game releases. The sound effects and most notably the music succeed at impressing with loud and bold gunfire and mesmerizing classical scores. The soundtrack composed by Thomas Bärtschi fits the atmosphere of Absolution perfectly whether it may be a hectic gun battle or silent takedown.\n\nAbsolution marks a bold new direction for the Hitman series that focuses less on player freedom and more on telling a defined narrative. While the levels and poorly-implemented Instinct mode are sure to anger and frustrate fans of the series, Absolution still succeeds at providing an entertaining and most importantly, engaging gameplay experience that is difficult to put down until the credits roll. Both the expansive Contracts mode and stunning graphical overhaul help in overcoming the issues associated with the restrictive campaign levels.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 20, 2014","true","49.7"," 114 of 155 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","114","155","8","0"

Hitman: Absolution.I've played every single Hitman game and loved every single one of them.\n\nHated by hardcore Hitman fans\nLoved by newcomers to the francise\nPlayed by gamers all around the world\n\nIs Hitman: Absolution a bad game? Most definitely not!\nIs it a true, classic Hitman game? No!\n\nHow come it isn't a bad game? Well for a game to be bad it either has to be broken, boring or both. Absolution is neither.\nThere is no such a thing as a bug free video game or software so i'm 100% sure that there are some bugs and/or glitches. However i did not experience any.\nIt's not broken. It's not boring...The story is kind of bogus but more on that later.\nEven if the story would be boring then the amazingly fun stealth gameplay makes it up for it. The game is not boring nor broken - It must be a good game.\n\nSo why so much hate?  It's just not a true Hitman game.\nIt added couple of new features that really improve the franchise. Couple of features that I myself personally have been waiting for...But they also "downgraded" some of the old features. Features that were already there and didn't require changing - If it's not broke, don't fix it.\nAight, time to talk about some pros and cons aka "Not Hitmans"\n\nGameplay\n"Not Hitmans":\nDisguises - In previous Hitman titles when you picked up a disguise the enemies didn't recognize you...Unless of course they found the dead persons body whose outfit you're wearing or when you just started shooting everyone or walked into a restricted area without wearing a proper disguise. Not all disguises required you to kill someone tho.\n\nIn Absolution every single person who wears the same outfit as you will know that you're not one of them and your disguise is blown in seconds. This makes disguises somewhat useless. Lets say i need to get backstage of a strip club. Naturally you seek out a security guard outfit. Now what happens is that every single security guard will know that you're not one of them and will alert everyone (EVERYONE WILL INSTANTLY KNOW) that you're nothing but a bloodthirsty phony. No warning, nothing. Shoot first and ask questions later appears to be the theme of this game.\n\nNext point might seem like pointless whining but it's actually quite important in the entire stealth genre: You cannot switch off lights. Removing such a simple feature...Is just a very stupid thing to do.\n\nCheckpoints - Previous Hitman games never had checkpoints nor did they let you save your game during a mission.\nIn Absolution, however, you get rolled back to your last checkpoint every time you die. You can even reload your last checkpoint if things weren't going exactly how you planned. This, this little thing right here makes the game TOO easy.\nTo make matters worse, the enemies now RESPAWN. Yup! Respawning enemies in a singleplayer game! If you move from check point one to checkpoint two and then for some reason want to go back to checkpoint one area then you better not do so.\n\nOh and the levels are smaller and more linear than in the previous titles.\n\nPros:\nCover system - You can finally take cover in a Hitman game! All previous Hitman games needed this! Every now and then you either screwed up or things just didn't go your way aaaand...A shootout happened. A good cover mechanic would have really helped.\nThe only problem in here is that you can always reload your last checkpoint when you screw up so you can actually avoid shootouts and sneak your way through the game.\n\nI'm not 100% sure but to me it seems that there are actually more creative ways of disposing each of your targets. Previous titles gave you like maybe 1-2 sneaky options or you could go in guns blazing as the 3rd option. It seems to me that this game gives you like 3-5 choices with almost every target.\nWhat i also loved is that Absolution has this Splinter Cell kind of targeting system where you can pause time, set your targets and then 47 just kills 'em all in matter of seconds.\n\n+Fun and brutal ways of "assassinating"\n+Great gunplay\n+Good cover mechanics\n+One of the coolest easter eggs i've seen in games\nThese all make this gameplay a masterpiece.\nThe game is well optimised, everything can be used as a weapon...It's just a joy to play.\n\n"Game runs as smooth as a slimey snail on a moist di*k on a rainy day" - Just don't quote me on this one in front of the little ones.\n\nStory\nAgent 47 is supposed to be the deadliest and most skilled assassin ever. He was genetically enhanced...He is a perfect human being.\nHe is as physically fit as humanly possible, has inhuman reflexes and is as intelligent as you can get. Oh and he doesn't do anything based on emotions.\nHe's been in the game for many years and he got out alive...\n\n...But now the Absolutions story...47 actually gets captured TWICE. The perfect assassin. A veteran assassin. The most intelligent and strongest man in the entire storyline...Gets captured by some rednecks. Sure.\nHow does this happen? Well the first time around, for an example, he makes a complete rookie mistake. A bad judgement call. This should have never happened.\nThe story is full of plot holes actually. The story makes no sense at all. I don't want to fill my reviews with spoilers so if you want to ask me about the spoilers then visit my profile and we'll have a chat.\nLet it just be clear that the story in this game is pretty much garbage to anyone who has been a long time Hitman fan or who just enjoys logical storylines.\nThe story, however, gives you the reason to visit plenty of different places and oh god the settings and places in this game are just amazing!\n\nThe game got that much hate because it's a Hitman game.\nIf it would have been named "Assassin Man: Absolute Kill" then most people would have loved it.\n\n7/10 - Never judge a game from a fanboy point of view.","October 1, 2015","true","49.5"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","52","66","4","2"

I loved all the Hitman games, movies, everything about it, and when I heard this was coming out I was REALLY stoked...but after playing the game it feels a little misleading and not like how the older ones were.  I'm just gonna do the Bad first since there is a lot I really didn't like about this game...\n\nBAD:\n\nStealth System is eck...: Compared to Blood Money and before, instead of being it to where if you did something suspicious with the disguise or you went into a too high leveled area then you'd have a problem with the disguise, but other than that you were free to walk around the whole area (as long as you had clearance) but now apparently EVERY SINGLE PERSON FINDS YOU.  If you are wearing a guard outfit, apparently that guy knew EVERY OTHER GUARD FROM THERE TO AZERBAIJAN, meaning you could basically get caught even if you were blending in with other people, how does that make sense? Compared to the old games where no one else would even care about you, it's just ridiculous.  Not only that but it seems like guards can spot you even if they aren't looking in that general area, I had gotten caught several times while I was to the side of the guard, not even in her peripheral vision, and I still got caught from it.\n\nPoint System: This got on my nerves the minute I found out about it, it's basically saying how good you were at the mission area, but in all honesty it's kind of akward.  It feels like the game is judging me, cause EVERYTHING you do that isn't towards the target you instantly get a Negative rate.  Guard caught you and you kill him? -500 points deducted for killing a civi/not the f%$king target.  Got caught? -1,500 points.  Killed a enemy trying to kill you? -350 points.  That's just wrong, at least in Blood Money even if you screwed up it didn't say "Hey, you royally screwed up, nice going.", and it told you at the end how you were and didn't show a ingame counter.  I'm a bit of a perfectionist okay? So after getting caught over and over or killing too many people when I was basically forced to, I just ended up restarting the whole level and just got annoyed from doing everything over and over and F%$KING OVER AGAIN, I Just gave up and didn't even want to keep playing for the rest of the night.\n\nUpgrade system: It's tied to the Point system....and it's not even very good, it's only small little tuneups here and there that you never really pay attention to or even bother with, which means if you sucked on the level, you don't even get the upgrade till you replay it over and over till you get a high enough score to get it, and even then you won't really tell the difference between when you had the upgrade or didn't.\n\nAwful Checkpoint system: I wish they would've just stuck with savestates like before, cause the checkpoints are atrocious, even if you killed/Pacified enemies before the checkpoint (Which you still lose points for I might add) if you reload that checkpoint, every enemy before that checkpoint, will respawn in again, even if they were dead.  And if you get near the end and get caught and don't want to lose points?  Start from the checkpoint and do it ALL over again.\n\nVery linear: The game is extremely linear, compared to other games before or even old games like Thief and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory where they had these quite huge open maps with different pathways to take and use to get around the areas.  Yes they have multiple things to do to neutralize a target but once you get caught and just restart from checkpoint all the time you don't really end up caring and you'll most likely just pick the method you've always used because it seems to be the most effective way.\n\nInstinct is a Hit or Miss: Instinct helps you out in most cases giving you ways to neutralize a target or to see where they are going, which is very nice, but it's also used to blend into a crowd of people if you have the same disguise as they do, but if you run out then you can't blend in meaning you're basically screwed if you have to walk by a whole group of the b%$#ards and you have no instinct left.\n\nThe Awful Detection system: There is no way I would skip this, it's really...bad I guess, kind of a hit or miss, like when you wear a disguise that others also have on you can get caught still but it's a lot slower than normal.  But as I said above, even when I wasn't near some guys view I was still getting caught, even if their body was pointed one way and their head a different, one guy I was next to has his body pointing the same way I was and his head was to the side so I figured he wouldn't catch me, then the meter filled almost instantly and he instantly turned around and caught me, then it was back to mashing the f%*king Restart Checkpoint button, if that was a actual button I could hit IRL I would have broken it years ago.\n\nTrying to be More Assault: The game acts like it's trying to be more about Assault since there is taking cover and guns everywhere, taking cover is nice to hide behind crates and such, but once you get caught everyone is on your ♥♥♥ instantly and you basically have to just play the game popping your head in and out of cover like a bunch of Oompa Loompas, and since killing or even pacifing the wrong target makes you lose points it's basically trying to force you to hide instead of you know, blend in like how you could in the old games.  How the hell does that make sense? I get into a firefight when I didn't want to and then when I kill the guy I'M suddenly the a%$*ole for shooting him in return?\n\nChallenges: Challenges are there for you to try and do if you feel like it, like collecting guns or outfits or evidence or going through the whole level with just your suit.  It sounds like a nice idea but I always ended up missing half or more of the guns since I tried to go the more sneaky sneaky route and just picked a random gun for backup incase s*%t hit the fan, and even when it did I just restarted to checkpoint cause I didn't want to lose points for getting caught and then killing him.\n\nDistraction items: Instead of having a Coin like before it's now whatever you find in the environment, which isn't a bad thing at times but there are those moments when you kind of WISH you had that bloody coin instead.  One time I had a golf club as a distraction item and I was unsure of whether to keep it or replace it with a bottle, then later when I chose to throw it from behind a wall it got stuck on the wall, made the sound, and every single guard found me, then back to the Restart Checkpoint button it is.\n\nGOOD:\n\nStory: It's pretty interesting I suppose, you meet new characters and people as well as have a different story from just having the whole thing based around shooting a ton of people because you had to, at least now it's about saving a little girl while shooting a ton of people because you had to so at least it's a bit of a step in the right direction.\n\nHiding: At least now you can hide behind cover and such so you can't get caught AS easily as you could in the game itself which is nice, so that's something at least.\n\nMultiple ways in: There are different ways to get past certain guards or areas but this also goes back to the assassination system thing where you find the one that works and stick with it, I've never felt the need to go and pick a different way into a place because the way I picked last time works just fine so I may as well just stick with it.\n\nCONCLUSION: This game is a hit and miss for people, for the Hardcore fans that love the games and that loved that old stealthy sneaky feel without a atrocious detection system they might be dissapointed, I certainly was, that and the fact it's trying to act like a modern game, which it shouldn't.  It gets a 5/10 It's a half and half for me, with all the new things they've put it and taken out it doesn't feel much like a Hitman game like the ones before, sad.","May 6, 2015","false","30.7"," 207 of 319 people (65%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","65","207","319","18","13"

At the same time we can not ignore some design choices rather abnormal and tend to tarnish the feeling of enjoyment experienced by the player, such as artificial intelligence sometimes too deficient for stealth gameplay or atypical management bailouts. Nevertheless Hitman: Absolution is the worthy heir to a series that has always represented the best that the genre of stealth could offer and its beauty lies in the nonlinearity that distinguishes its gameplay: the ability to freely choose how and when to act, who kill, kill, where and how to do it is always anchored in the hands of the player.

Absolution is fun if you think of it as a stand alone rather than a continuation of the series. It starts off a little rocky as it somewhat picks up from where Blood Money left off, and the story gets more and more confusing. The agency that trained 47 is considerably less bad ♥♥♥ than it was in the previous games and now feels like how most alphabet agencies are portrayed in movies.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics aren't really "improved" but updated. The game is more pleasing to look at than the previous Hitman games were, however they sacrificed a lot of what the series was about, for example, disguises were introduced in the game so you would be able to EASILY infiltrate your target, that's no longer the case, if you put on any sort of uniform or disguise, another person who was originally wearing somethign similar will immediately start giving you the stink eye, knowing automatically (even if your back is to them), that you are an enemy, the only way around this is by using up your focus bar points and activating a very special ability...where you hold your hand up to your face and they make stupid comments about never seeing you before but they keep their distance and leave you be. Aside from that major flaw, the rest of the gameplay mechanics are similar to the previous games.\n\nThis game is by no means better than blood money or any of the other Hitman games, however for nostalgic purposes I purchased this game and played it, and was not as disappointed as the other reviewers, I still had fun playing this game, I don't have buyers remorse for pre-ordering this game for full price, as it was still worth it, it wasn't what I expected, but it was still worth the time and money I put into it.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 7/10, and recommend that people give the game a try and see for themselves, as most of the other reviewers aren't really rating the game based on the game, but rating it based on what they expected from it because of the Hitman series.","December 28, 2013","true","15.2"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","59","81","0","3"

If you don't like to do the perfect level, learning every patrols, areas and secrets, this game is not for you. In this one you will be happy to see new challenges and achievements...\nBut frankly challenges are not interesting except "suit only" or "being unseen" there is nothing particular, the most disgusting is that these challenges modifies the score you make at the end of the level. So if you don't do one of them even if you've made the perfect contract... you gets owned!\nAdd to that challenges like putting 5 bodies in a pool of balls or killing some guys with a particular weapon... it is contrary to your play style if you are, like me, a real pro hitman: no casualties, unseen and quick.\n\nChallenges are an awkward way to force you to play again the levels like achievements in general...\n\n*Stealth:\n\nYou like to throw tons of items... this game is for you.\nWith the quality of reviews i thought Hitman retribution would be a game with an incredible AI.\nAnd indeed the AI is marvelous ! As i said, throw something and just ALL THE TIME guards will split up. A group of 6 monkeys. Throw a knife. Get rid of 1 monkey. Throw a book. Get rid of another monkey...ect...ect...\nAnd no one will check for missing men... really annoying. For the previous Hitman, to distract guards with coins was possible one time. After they were looking in the direction of the sound but they were unable to go and check, only if the sound was louder or really suspicious.\n\nTo continue about stealth in the previous Hitman... Blood Money introduced blood traces. When you killed any characters without cable wire or syringe, bodies were starting to bleed and moving them created blood trails. Any guards crossing theses trails, was able to follow them and discover the body. This feature forced the player to focus on stealth with pacifications, accidents and avoiding.\nHere blood trails have disappeared. If a guard find a pool of blood he will be suspicious during few seconds and that's all. The most funny is during the orphanage hall mission. You will see dead bodies everywhere, blood and meat on walls and  the guards will be JUST suspicious for only one pool of blood in the middle of a real carnage ( 20 nuns i think).\nRidiculous.\nThe only good aspect in stealth is the cover mode, press space and like every games these days, you stick to a cover (Gears of War's style!). There are contextual actions everywhere, press w and you change cover, ect...\nThe instinct mode is only usefull with a disguise (when spotted to escape without raising the alarm) or during gun fights, you can kill few enemies in a row but... is it interesting in a stealth game where any violent action is punished by a loss of points?\nA waste of time.\n\n\n*Contextual actions:\n\nA nice way to show how bad can be a game in its own subject.\nHow painful it is in a stealth game like Hitman to be forced to fight with your bare hands in a bar against dozens of bikers.\n47 a brawler? Ah !\nAdd to that the fact that these fights are just horribly difficult and a guy like 47, can endure great pain (play previous episodes to understand), is K.O with 2 punches?!\nNonsense.\nWe still have disguises, but losing your suit rduce your total score. So disguises are useless especially if you notice, like me, that you can finish missions without them.\nThis is a nonsense because this is the trademark of Hitman franchise.\n\n*The story:\n\nFull of cliché: the young girl to save, the redneck villain with his big henchman, the dark hero.\nI was waiting something more astonishing like the end of Blood Money.\nI hated the moment were 47 cuts his tattoo (he doesn't grumble but he’s K.O with 3 punches... ). And the tattoo is still visible under the adhesive tape...\n\n*The OST:\n\nThe music was marvelous in previous Hitmans. It was Jesper Kyd, the man behind Freedom Fighters/ Assasin's Creed/ Borderland/ Darksiders II musics ! (search for Hitman: Blood Money ost to understand how great is Jesper Kyd).  Here, you just don't notice the music, there is no main theme and during missions only guards talks are nice.\nMusic changes during mission depending on how you perform takedowns or alerts but that's all.\nThe most annoying thing for me as a French player is the French dubbing of 47.\nI don't know why but they've dared to change it ! 47 dubber was just marvelous.\nMany people forget that dubbers are real actors and deserves respect. I was so disappointed that i played hitman in English just to forget the new dubbing.\n\n*Multiplayer:\n\nThe real good aspect of Absolution. How delightful it is to compare your score to other players. Play your custom contracts or player made ones. I hope they will try to add co-op or versus like in Assassin's Creed, this franchise really needs it.\n\n*Miscanellous:\n\nWeapon customization is cool but I’m crazy about Hitman Absolution: Sniper Challenge. This little game is really cool!\nI hope they will add such content in the next game.\n\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n\nThis Hitman is a real disappointment.\n\nIf your new: my review doesn't matter. But if you are like me a veteran in the series: don't buy it at full price and be prepared to have some great moments of boredom.\nIO  interactive you could have done better and please stop with your Kane and Linch franchise...\n\nAnd revievers, you are guilty to be unable to point the low quality of this game.\nEven you, professional revievers. We are now entering a time where journalists have less experience thant players... such a shame. And for Hitman: Absolution it is just outrageous.","December 22, 2014","false","26.7"," 189 of 300 people (63%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","63","189","300","19","14"

I read all the reviews, saying how this game was a critical masterpiece, under-appreciated, etc. I didn't find this to be the case at all.\nThe game is gorgeous, and the controls are good. But the actual gameplay is extremely frustrating. The game gives you a ton of ways to deal with your targets; however, the save system and score system get in the way of this every time. If you actually want to enjoy the game, then you have to ignore the score system. While previous Hitman games encouraged experimentation, this game actively discourages it by giving you - maybe - one checkpoint in each level, at the most. If you want to experiment with different routes or outcomes, be prepared to replay half the level every time you make a mistake (or suffer a humongous negative score).\nWhile there were a couple great moments (the Chinatown level really stood out as good), I felt like the majority of the game was just time spent redoing the same sections in order to get the game's score of approval.

TWICE. Therefore, Hitman: Absolution is broken and was ♥♥♥♥ in 2012, and is still ♥♥♥♥ in 2016.\nSummary\nWow what happened to this??? Each Hitman game got better & better, but Absolution brings the series crashing down. They tried to breathe new life & add new gameplay features to refresh the franchise: instead it just doesn't work, feels broken, frustrating & hilariously bad.\n\nKiddie Steam reviewer verdict:\n- wore disguise, disguise blown in 5 seconds, so killed every1.\n- walked past guard, nearly got detected so tilted head low. ran out of power, cudnt tilt head anymore. disguise blown, so killed every1.\n- ran 2 exit, disguise blown. cudnt open exit door cos game wudnt let me, so killed every1.\n- Stopped playing game, played agen next day, saves got wiped by square enix server. 3/10 wud NOT play this ♥♥♥♥ game agen.\n\nHitman: Abomination - Problems in the first 5 minutes\nThe trademark disguise mechanic has been drastically altered for the worse. Nick an engineer's uniform, & every single engineer in the country will be able to see through your disguise in mere seconds: it's like they all have an entire database in their heads of what each other looks like. Even if you're half way across a map, partially concealed by a dumpster & have your back to everyone whilst in the shadows, they can still see through your disguise! What the hell??? When you have a series that successfully utilise a unique mechanic that works throughout each game, then you change it so much that it becomes broken & frustrating that you end up just forgetting about it & shooting your way through levels, something has seriously gone wrong.\nThe absolute (see what I did there) worse offender of the disguise mechanic is that when you take the clothes of someone wearing a full face mask HE DOESN'T PUT THE FACE MASK ON!!! In all past games, Mr. 47 could hide his face, yet now all of a sudden he refuses to wear anything to conceal his face, like he suffers from an allergic reaction to face cloth. It's no wonder why everyone can spot you through your disguise, seeing as you're the only one wearing a hazmat suit without a gas mask on looking like a prick.\n\nBest way to play past the flawed disguise mechanic is to sprint full speed everywhere, hugging walls, hiding behind objects & ninja rolling between cover. It's embarrassingly sad & hilarious that sprinting through the entire level hiding behind things & rolling all over the place like a hyperactive toddler grants less suspicion then walking around the place like a fully grown man would normally do. The NPCs even make remarks like “act like a grown man!” when you start trying to hide. Who would have thought that the game is self-aware.\n\nBut this is Hitman: Absolution I’m playing, not Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid Absolution, so why the ♥♥♥♥ am I rolling all over the place instead of blending in??? Speaking of which, you STILL can get detected when you’re wearing a disguise in a crowd of around 50 people.\n\nArcade mechanics lead to hilariously bad results\nNew to the series is Instincts mode. Switch it on & time slows down, the background will turn monochrome whilst enemies, their walk path & important objects will glow. Instincts mode also allows you to blend in, such as scratching your head or tipping your hat low to obscure your face as you walk past people. But the problem is using this drains your instincts meter (mana?) so if it runs out, suddenly Mr. 47 loses the ability to simply lower his head again. Seriously???\nThere are a few select objects in the world that you can use to blend in: this not only recharges your instincts meter, people no longer suspects you of being an assassin. I think I'd be pretty suspicious of a guy constantly mopping a tiny area in front of his feet for a straight 5 minutes or a Policeman inspecting a doughnut like he's counting the individual atoms on it. Did I mention once this meter runs out, you suddenly lose the ability to tip your hat low or scratch your head? Maybe 47 has a stiff neck and the mana metre is actually his muscle fatigue.\n\nRegardless, these features in the game are so strangely unhuman-like & illogical it's ♥♥♥♥in’ hilarious.\n\nOther flaws\nOther minor flaws of the game is not being able to choose gear during the campaign, linear missions, ability to hide multiple huge guns and objects in your coat, enemies not noticing you strangling someone to death right next to them, silencers attach instantly to guns,\n\nScoring System\nBecause it’s cool and it’s Square Enix, you have a scoring system that rates you on how well (or how ♥♥♥♥) you are during each mission. Whilst it’s a nice idea to try to rack up the highest score as possible, it’s frustrating when bad game mechanics hamper this. As you can imagine, I’ve had to shoot my way through most levels, so most of my level score is in the minus thousands region. Anyone want to try to beat my lowest scores, huh??\n\nLight at the end of the rainbow\nWell, Hitman: Absolution isn’t that bad. It’s just far from good. As a Hitman game, it fails miserably. As a cover based shooter with minor stealth mechanics, it’s decent enough.\n\nConclusion\nI brought this for my friend’s birthday sadly, and to this day I still don’t know if he forgives me. Heck, I don’t know if I’ve even forgiven myself.\n\nHow can I best summarise this game? It's like that kid at school who boasts about driving an expensive sports car, has the latest £2000 super computer & has 5 different girlfriends. Then one day to his horror, his over-affectionate mum comes to pick him up from school, tells everyone that he stays at home all day playing on his cheap Macintosh & he is scared of girls. Then he goes all embarrassed & tries to stop his mum, only to trip over & his pants fall down in the process, everyone laughs & ridicules him, then they all go away & never look at him the same way again & he is left disgraced & shamed. Hitman: Absolution is that kid.","March 13, 2013","false","27.4"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","0"

On the flipside, stealth is mostly avoiding people using cover while using disguises to make people notice you just that little bit less. This would be fine, except the points system only actually rewards one playstyle, even though the levels simply, at times, don't feel designed with harder difficulties in mind. More on that later.\nThe graphics, while beautiful, do sometimes end up a bit distracting. Namely because bald heads don't shine like that. Seriously, that ♥♥♥♥ stands out as much as the out of character actions in the story.\nMost obviously there is a MASSIVE contrast in the game between levels. You'll end up with some wonderfully crafted arenas dedicated to creatively murdering a target or targets... Before or after having to get to the arena through linear levels with boring stealth that have almost no resemblance to what you'd picture the Hitman series having. In the end, you have a very schizophrenic sense of pace and gameplay as a result of mixing Hitman level designers with Kane and Lynch level designers. This is even further compounded by the fact that, while Jesper Kyd didn't compose the score for the game, they mixed previous game's tracks in with the new score, only serving to emphasize how at odds with itself the game is.\nThe challenges, while doing a wonderful job of forcing you to know the levels (good and bad) by heart, singlehandedly break the scoring system, and while I do encourage the scoring system since it's a rarity in games these days, it needs a very serious overhaul in this game due to a number of serious loopholes and glitches.\n\nAll in all, you're left with a very flawed gem, not unlike the Hitman franchise, but not of the same sort by and far, a very, very mixed bag no matter who you are to be sure.","November 4, 2013","false","44.7"," 54 of 75 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","54","75","0","0"

Let's start with the plot.\n\nHitman Absolution kicks off right after the Hitman book: Hitman Damnation by author Raymond Benson, which took place after Blood money. Agent 47 (The main character of the Hitman Franchise) is told by the new head of the ICA: Benjamen Travis, to assasinate 47's former handler Diana Burnwood. When 47 shoots Diana, she tells 47 to save a girl by the name of Victoria as her last dying wish. I thought the plot was pretty well done\n\nLet's get this out of the way first, the game is absolutely gorgeous with highly detailed locations, great lighting, sharp textures, great character models and animations. However, there is a bit too much bloom, especially 47's bald head.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of you having to get from one end of a level to the other while trying not to get spotted by enemies. Some missions have you killing a certain target within an area and these sections are by far the best parts of the game. You have a variety of ways to kill your target which goes from using electricity, blow up, grind, burn alive, blow up, stab, and yeah you get the idea. If you're not the sneaky type and want to shoot your way through the game's serveral chapers, that is also an option, the gunplay is perhaps one of the most tight I've played in a third person shooter. In each level there is a item you can find called evidence, which can be used to boost your score, and this takes me to the new feature for the Hitman franchise: the points system.\n\nIn almost every level, you will be scored on how you completed a level, such as losing points if you had to kill an NPC and didn't hide the body, killed the target in a creative way, lose points when spotted, etc. When you got enough points, you can learn assassin techniques which can be used to make 47 more efficient, such as reducing the time it takes to reload your gun, run faster, more health, and you get the picture. A returning feature is the much loved disguise system since the first Hitman game, although it works a bit different here.\n\nIf you find a disguise in a level, you can then wear it and move among the enemy, however it does not shield you fully from the enemy. If an enemy or civilian sees you while wearing their clothing, they will take longer to realize that you don't belong here and will investigate, however the other people in different clothing will not find you suspicious. This new system definitely works in my opinion, and if it was like blood money, the game would be almost impossible to fail.\n\nA new mode to the series is contracts mode, you pick one of the many levels in the game, look around and then mark 3 targets, kill them how you want, and put it online to see who can do the same hit more efficiently. This mode is probably the closest you'll get to Blood Money gameplay and is definitely a mode that shouldn't be avoided. When you complete a contract in contracts mode you earn money which can be used to buy upgrades for your guns, buy disguises, and more guns.\n\nThe sound design of the game is top notch, the music is well done even without Jesper Kyd, and the voice acting is superb, especially David Bateson who voices 47 who does an exceptional job.\n\nThe A.I. in this game is also pretty good, they will actively search for you if you are hiding and know when to take cover during fire fights. Although there were still parts where they did act strange, such as ignoring dead bodies and shooting in the wrong direction.\n\n\nIn the end, Hitman Absolution is an excellent edition to the Hitman franchise and shouldn't be overlooked just because it's not that much like Blood money. I even think Absolution is just as good as Blood money.\n\nHitman Absolution is beautifully executed.","November 25, 2013","true","245.0"," 62 of 92 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","62","92","0","1"

That and the new disguise system makes blending in incredibly frustrating, so you have to make sure nobody sees you instead of hiding in plain sight like in previous iterations.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is clearly a waste of potential.

It sacrifices the series's strengths (Well designed open ended levels) in order to tell a story no one asked for (poorly) and shuffle the player through lots of (mediocre) linear set-pieces with maybe two or three ways to go about them at the most. The Inclusion of instinct and point shooting are not entirely bad ideas, In a better Hitman Instinct would be a pretty cool tool for more casual players to intuit their way through a level... here it kinda is a combination quest arrow and radar.\n\nThis game gets rather... creepy with its objectification of women. This goes beyond the latex bondage assassin nuns that there was a minor controversy over ( and who were, in all honesty, an underwhelming fight). There are only two female characters that are not explicitly designed to be fan-service.One is a mcguffin who has no real purpose or character other than to drive the plot forward, the other is a fat nun with like four lines of dialogue, the rest all are pretty obviously there not to lend the world with the series's usual grit and grime but to titillate the player... right before they strangle them with fibre wire.\n\nThere are a couple of good levels, The King of Chinatown and Blackwater Park come to mind. But nothing really that was of the quality of Blood Money. I had some fun with it but out of the three hitman games I have played to completion... this one is by far the weakest.

Gorgeous environments that are incredibly lit, fantastic sound mixing, and moody ambience really make Hitman Absolution a title to remember. It's a generous game with a lengthy campaign and a separate Contracts mode if you want to dig deeper into what the community is doing within the game. Rounding things out is a surprisingly cool story with some very memorable characters, including a blood-curdling, redneck villan that you'll never forget. Hitman has always been a hard game to classify, as it has practically become a genre unto itself.

Do you like repeating the same parts of a game over and over hoping for a new result? Well the developer must've thought everyone who plays their games are masochists because without allowing you to save, it becomes repetition for the sake of repetition. It's not skill based at all in these situations just luck. So what it boils down to is less realism and taking you out of the experience due to frustation. I love a challenge, but my time is precious.\n\nThe Challenges that are setup are serioulsy contrived as well. Not only has the developer created these tasks for you to complete, but once you do there's no reason to replay a level. The desgin isn't well thought out either, requiring you to pause the game and access a menu to scroll through a vague list. It's a guessing game. The "challenges" aren't really that either, unless you think again redoing something over again to complete and earn points is challenging. Many of them are nonsensical too, i.e. making Agent 47 kill a certain number of goons in a particular costume, why would a hitman do that? I started consulting video guides just so I wouldn't miss anything. It's amazing that a developer would purposefully create content for a game that may never be seen.\n\nFinally the disguise rules are a joke. Use a costume that other characters are wearing and they'll spot you; put your hand over your face and you can "trick them". Just writing that made me laugh.\n\nAll of these features seem like a badly coordinated rush job. Which is a shame because the world is beautiful to explore in this game. The character models and animation are well done. Shooting and stealth(when it works) are fun also. Honestly if the older Hitman games, with their open-world gameplay, were made in this new Glacier engine it would be a fantastic experience.\n\nIt's such a mixed bag that I had to write this review to vent about it.

The story revolves around Agent 47 going rogue to save a girl that's chemically altered to be a killer or something along those lines. It's filled with one-dimensional characters whom I didn't give a crap about. The big bad guy is generically 'crazy' guy (ugh, can we stop with the crazy/'random' villains?) with a very thin motive to kidnap this girl. The locations, though interesting and varied, also seemed extremely random and detached from each other. I mean... I'm pretty sure I went from a factory to a wrestling match in one mission...\n\nI was initally very impressed with the controls and the gameplay. It went smooth, I liked the disguises mechanic and every major assassination target has several cool ways to kill them off. What I could've lived without was the scoreboard never disappearing from view. At first I thought "Oh cool, this'll motivate me to be the best assassin I can be. To plan my kills, to play as perfectly as possible" but as time went by, I began to see it as a malevolent schoolteacher grading me and marking me for every mistake I made. "Got spotted?" it would ask, "oooh, that's another 1300 points off your scoreboard. :) You're below your friends' scores now." And there is no way to turn it off.\n\nThis wouldn't be so annoying if it wasn't for the next thing I want to touch on. I was under the impression the Hitman games were like Dishonored, in that you have a big sandbox in which you can carefully plan out your kill. Hitman: Absolution didn't do this. Instead, Absolution drops you in small maps with increasing amounts of patrolling guards. The game became less about "plan carefully", and more about trial-and-error of trying to navigate through a maze of guards (and civilians who immediately warn guards...). I began desperately trying to avoid a massive shootout (with the high density of guards, when one sees you; you're boned) and constantly hitting Restart from Checkpoint because I got caught which would drop my score, instead of finding enjoyment in the planning and executing of the perfect kill. This, coupled with an increasingly frustrating scoreboard marking me and comparing me to my friends, began so IMMENSELY frustrated.\n\nFor a game which motivates you to be the perfect assassin, it sure does a lousy job. Half the time you'll have to restart the mission over from a checkpoint that has scripted guard conversations which you'll have to wait for to move on. Another thing that really bothered me is that it's very unclear when a kill is silent. Strangling someone with a power cord with them going "No! Grkkhk!" is silent, but a silenced pistol shot is not? There's a distance-based delay in guards seeing you while you're disguised , meaning that you can manage to scroll past a few guards in disguise (without using Instinct), but if you bump into one around the corner, you're IMMEDIATELY spotted. Spotted means every guard is warned, and that means a massive shootout.\n\nEven the ending left me completely blank because I didn't care about any of the villains. I didn't care about the girl I was supposed to save because I didn't have a reason to other than the game telling me "CARE ABOUT THIS GIRL D:<" And the very final kill happens in a cutscene... A fittingly frustrating ending to a frustrating game.\n\nThe Good: Stealth is unique if nothing else, graphics are tops, disguise mechanic is fun, many different ways to kill someone that do give a sense of victory, lot of potential.\nThe Bad: Trial-and-error in the worst way possible, story vague and thoroughly uninteresting with no relatable characters at all. And as final bad point; the one mission with the SM-clad battle-nuns. Why the hell does this game have SM-clad battle-nuns?!","September 25, 2014","false","17.7"," 63 of 103 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","63","103","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhorthex/recommended/203140/","vhorthex","Medieval Nerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhorthex/","354 products in account","From the vacuum sealed mission area, to the awkward new instincs system. This game does not live up to as a Blood Money sucessor.\n\nThe new 'instincs' meter is an interesting concept, but implemented in the worst of ways. Specifically the costumes/disguises side of it. Back in BM (Blood Money), disguises would give you certain access to specific areas, within reason. Taking the opera house as an example, dressed as a cop you could access some backstage areas. As one of the target's priviate secuirty guard, you gained even more access, etc. The disguises had a certain limited usefulness based on where you were going to use it.\n\nNow, I have no idea if the designers were having issues about 'how' to implement diguises in Absolution, but this whole 'skill meter' that goes down whenever someone even looks your way in disguise is a bit silly. In the very first mission, following the tutorial. You have to kill some guy in a tiny market, packed with people.\n\nOne of the ways to deal with the situation is to steal a poisonous fish to use it's poison against the target. Thing is, the fish is on a counter within a cooking stall. Even if you have a chef outfit, you need to hold down your 'instinc' ability so that you don't get spotted by the other cooks. Even though I was holding it down, seems when you pick up the fish that still triggers 'suspicion'. And then I had the cook chase me down until she called security...\n\nThe feeling of stealth and being 'mixed' in with the crowd is just completely ruined. The tutorial section gives out this sad mechanic when you have to use disguises a few times, but each time you still need to hold down the 'instincs' ability to not get your cover blown. And the AI's range for getting suspicious is ludicrous. If at least they would have kept it for 'face to face' encounters. IE, if you get to close to a guard he could call you up, and you'd have to use your instincs to come up with some BS answer/cover story or your cover would be blown. I mean the fact that 47's "defense" is to lower his head and put his hand on his forehead... really? Doesn't that make you look even more suspicious... ugh.\n\nAs many others pointed out, the lack of mission "preperation" is kind of annoying. You get dropped into a level, and most of the 'weapons' you need to find scattered around the location... I know that in BM you could spend money to get special weapons dropped for you within a mission area, but this one just feels totally wrong. Finding remote explosives in a crate of fruit for no specific reason, feels wrong.\n\nAnd although there are numerous ways to 'kill your target', many of them end up causing level wide alarm. And you 'need to' clear all security forces, or so it seems, before leaving a mission area... Very entertaining... Not really. If you look on youtube, many peoplel who showcase killing alternatives, do so and end the video shortly after the level wide alarm is triggered. You still get the achievement though...\n\nBlood money offered way more flexibility, and diversity of the way you disposed of your targets. And not all of them were on a razor's edge. In Absolution, maybe the later missions get better, but the first 'real' 'mission feals claustrophobic, extremely limited in actual stealh options (massively hindered by this new instinc system).\n\nThe overhaul experience feels too different to create any meaningful parralel with BM, a game that I love and have reinstalled and replayed numerous times. The level of freedom gives almost each playthrough a different feeling, and opportunity to explore different parts of the level of ways to accomplish your  goal.\n\nAbsolution falls so flat on the countless aspects that made Blood money the success it is. I don't want to sound dismissive of the team, but it's almost like someone drew up a list of good and bads from BM, and instead of sending the good list to the dev team, they sent the list of bad things to them.\n\nThey promised a much more different experience in the upcoming new hitman game, but I'm going to be as weary as I was with this one, and wait for it to come on sale. And I'm not talking 15% off here, more like 75%+.\n","December 23, 2014","false","1.7"," 35 of 53 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","35","53","0","0"

A living myth who is usually given the Agency's most dangerous missions.\nAbsolution neither lives up to the hardcore roots of its past nor makes up to be a fun ride for the present. As such, I cannot recommend this game. It simply isn't about a hitman. Agent 47 is not given the respect he deserves; he no longer functions as a perfect contract killer. Read on and decide for yourself whether Absolution is worth your time and money.\n\nPart 1: Gameplay and the Experience\nAbsolution is the first ever Hitman game that is a console to PC port. It's an above average one. Graphics and textures are good and the new game engine runs very smooth on a solid PC. By smooth I mean the game has minimal glitches and the 3rd-person OTS camera handles smooth. Too smooth. Keyboard rebindings and a number of visual (but not many game) settings are also included. And a new Instinct Mode is also there for those who need a "helping" hand.\n\nWell then. Now to the bad. Keep in mind that these are all my opinions, and as I have 70+ hours devoted here I've tapped into pretty much all Absolution has to offer. I also have no ill will towards the game itself; this is just an honest review on my part. But the truth hurts.\n\nFirst off, I guess I need to describe the 'feel' of Absolution as a hitman/stealth hybrid. Previous Hitman titles always had solid control layouts (eg. in Blood Money hold the right-mouse button for the inventory/action keys for situation events etc.) and for every level a simple list of targets to kill. In Absolution however, it's a mess.\n\nWhat you get at the start of every single level are a bunch of tedious, unskippable cutscenes that further reduce tension. There is no inventory for items. There is no map. Whoever decided to replace the map with one of the worst minimap/radar systems in the world should be shot.\n\nThe new cover system also feels slow and unresponsive. This may not seem all too important at first, but further down the line the game demands you to rely upon walls and benches on your every move (that is if you play as a silent assassin). Similar modern PC titles such as Arkham Asylum, Deus Ex: HR, or heck even Gears of War handle their cover systems much better. A cover system also encourages you to play more stealthily... but remember, this is a hitman game. Hugging walls and benches reduces the many ways you would want to approach your target; the creativity and degree of freedom you should have in how you want to move and navigate is now all but gone.\n\nThe way 47 moves is aggravating; he has this strange lethargic delay in every action. For a game that demands both precision in every action and intuitive decision-making as fundamentals to master, Absolution does not deliver. A split-second delay or one single wrong footstep is the difference between you getting caught and you achieving silent assassin. Most times it's because 47 does not turn/move three inches/hide body/find cover properly that you do get caught rather than it being your decision - you judging the time as right to move or to act. In a good stealth game it should be this decision-making that should define whether you succeed or fail. But here it's the other way around; here it's the movement system and controls that will always bring you down.\n\nSo then you think, "...okay, I made a mistake. Why don't I try it again? I'll just reload my last save..." Only there are no saves. Just some really messy checkpoints that respawn all guards, or restart the entire level. Terrible, just terrible game design.\n\nSpeaking of guards and NPCs, you know how to get them silently out of the way? Well as the disguise system is just... bad (I won't go into specifics, as it's despised by just about everyone) the only way to distract guards is by throwing an item in a corner, getting them to move and stare blankly where it hit, and then you move past them. Rinse and repeat. That is essentially 40% of the thrills in this game, the thrill of getting from A to B without getting caught. The rest are some pretty uninspired ways of killing targets. I don't want to play a stealth or thief game. Neither do you. I want to play a hitman. There's a difference. The game should encourage me to play as a hitman. But for some reason it doesn't. Absolution is a real let-down because of this - it plays as a poor man's stealth-action game.\n\nPart 2: Story and Characters - What Drives Absolution\nAbsolution is a perfect example of tasteless gratuity in modern gaming. Violence, sex, profanity - it's all there. None of it works. As such, none of the characters are relatable or even the world itself believable. And the villains are... worse.\n\nOften as you run past NPCs you will hear some of the most inane dialogue spouted towards you. As you are 47 you barely speak at all; less talking more killing. 47 is a silent assassin yes, but to make everyone else around him louder doesn't make him more silent. Or do you just want me to kill everyone? Soon enough I found all dialogue in Absolution just annoying; forced into a world that feels less realistic and less mature than any previous Hitman game.\n\nAt it's core, the story is pretty derivative and silly. After a life that has revolved around killing people, 47 is now having to run from it and save a... little girl. Everyone is after her. For this reason 47 brings down death ("assasinates") just about anyone he sees as having a bad influence on the poor child. I mean, in one level you are killing a crew of young punks for no reason whatsoever. Just.. cause you can?\n\nThis is story-driven game, and as such goes against much of the hitman experience that past games of the franchise established. In previous games characters never drove the story. You were just a simple hitman. Each level was a contract, and you were given a simple list of targets to kill. You were not meant to judge or feel any real sense of regret or discomfort in killing one-dimensional characters - their motivations and characterisation did not matter all too much. The fun came from how you handled each contract, how you killed your target and got away. In Absolution it's the opposite. The game wants 47 as an (anti)hero - kill enemies, not targets. And I didn't find killing them meaningful or even necessary to progress the plot. Killing some of them just felt wrong.\n\nPart 3: Contracts Mode and Other Considerations\nSo does the new Contracts Mode redeem this mess? Please. It really has nothing to do with the perfect hit. I cannot understand why people praise it. There is no glory or justification in killing a random innocent or a policeman walking down the street. No context given at all. Just some bizarre brutality complex, all just to get a higher score. Contracts Mode simply has no meaning, it's just there. I don't really know why.\n\nAnd... did you know? In Absolution you don't get to visit any other part of the world except for the mid-west US (excluding epilogue). No exotic locales or globe-trotting; no foreign infiltration, nothing. In previous games you had assassination missions spanning across multiple countries: Russia, China, Italy, Japan, Columbia, India... the list goes on. Much of the fun and excitement came from visiting these countries as an outsider and having to learn how to blend into different cultures and environments. This feature of the game always felt natural and well integrated; an essential part of the hitman experience. But such is not the case for Absolution. Here it's just streets, offices and buildings all in America. Urban, static and dull. Many locations are just recycled. A sad day indeed to be the "world's most deadliest assassin".\n\nAlas, a Hitman game that's not hardcore, not fun, and just not cool. Absolution tries too hard to please everyone. For that it pleases no one, and becomes just another forgettable game.","July 28, 2015","false","73.1"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","37","57","4","6"

The game is powered by the Glacier Engine 2, which is a graphical powerful house that covers the flaws in the game. Is Absolution worth your price?\n\nAbsolution is a double-edged sword where, at time, the game has good element while in the other hand, the game fell short. It is hard to describe the game. You do have multiple ways to assassinate your targets, but most missions have "one" unique way to kill your target to maximize the score to "Silent Assassin". The score system is an interesting mechanic, but the score system seems to treat players as a form of encouragement and punishment. For an example, if you accidentally messed up, points will be deducted from the score. If you have to improvise when you are caught, prepare your score to drop by a few thousands. In a way, the scoring system encourage players to play in a careful or stealthy manner. Unfortunately, the scoring system seems to "force" players to get the highest score as possible and psychologically restrict the player to play as freely he or she wants to play. In addiction, disguises mechanic is a failure. Putting on a disguise will make every enemy NPCs in the game to immediately recognize you when you get too close even for two seconds. While it is "understandable" that (some) people would recognize most of their buddies, it is also realistic that other people can't recognized 20+ people, by heart.\n\nThe story is pretty decent with solid voice acting and cheesy dialogue. Arguably, the best dialogue system comes from random NPCs with unique stories about them or giving hints about your objective. Absolution did very well with dialogue varieties for the NPCs and it is actually worth listening to. The mission levels feel very linear, but have environmental elements (like gasoline tanks, kitchen stoves, etc) to use for your advantage. There are 20 missions (or levels) in the game, but the game feels more of a drag as you progress.\n\nAbsolution tried to distinct itself from the other Hitman franchise and it failed. The developers acknowledge their errors and will compensate with the Hitman sequel. It is not a terrible game per se, but the number of flaws caused me to dislike the game as I finish through the ending. It is best to get it on sale for -75% or 80% off. In short, Absolution is a decent stealth game that should have been a lot better.","September 8, 2015","false","20.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Hitman develops feelings? AND a ♥♥♥♥♥♥? COME ON. He's a sociopath. He doesn't have feelings, he's the perfect killer. Let's just ruin 47's entire scheme now won't we?\n\n-Characters: 60 year old hired goons? "limp ♥♥♥♥" kids? Girl with super powers? Yeah that's what you get for your purchase.\n\n-Level Design: Unlike their atmosphere, the actually layout of the levels are horrid. There is usually only one way to get there and execute the target, which leads me to...\n\nAssassinations: More like "revenge killings". Takes away the wonderful feeling of killing someone for money and replaces it with Max Payne or something, which is a good game but he's got feelings which is why we like him. Hitman doesn't have feelings. (sorry going in circles.) These "assassinations" can usually only be done ne or two ways. You don't even get to choose how lenny dies.\n\nDisguises: Contract had it perfect edios, you didn't need to mess it up. Disguises are pointless now, as they can be seen through easily from more than 10 feat away.\n\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE\n\nCharacters' Deaths: No one important actually dies in this story line. Well one atleast shoud have. But she didn't. Because she has bullet proof ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or something?\n\nWeapons: Did you like custimizing your cool ♥♥♥ guns? Well ♥♥♥♥ you! You don't get that feature unless you play the stupid online version!\n\nOnline: Speaking of which this is a travesty. YOU GET TO CHOOSE YOUR TARGET! OH MY GAWD IMA KILL DA ICE CREM MANN! It's idiotic. No challenge. Seriosly.\n\nDifficulty: It's easy and hard where it shouldn't be. What I mean is: levels will give you a deus ex machina to kill your target but something as simple as hiding disguises was made incredibly difficult to use.\n\nSlow-Mo: No. Just no. Hitman isn't Neo. Don't add this. In this game you have the ability to slow down time with Hitman's inate magical powers.\n\nMagic: Not kidding you. You have a mana bar for rubbing your head to blend in.\n\nHitman: I know I've already stated how they butchered Hitman's character in this game but I can not stress it enough. HE HAS FEELINGS. Hitman goes all across America trying to save some little girl. Even when he had a pet priest in Silent Assassin, he didn't really care about him, he just used him to occupy time. When the priest seemed like he couldn't be found, 47 said "Well okay, I'll just use my money for better things", and moved on. Hell, he kills all of his genetic clones or "brothers" as he calls them with no emotion, not to mention the man who raised him and trained him to become a successful assassin. Why would he care about some catatonic teenager with super powers? "I made a promise to Diana to keep her safe." Really? You keep promises to dead people now? Jesus. I can't believe he got made into a shrimp.\n\n--------------------------------------------\nTLDR\n\nThis game butchers everything Hitman. If you want the real Hitman Experiance than buy Silent Assassin or Blood Money.\n\nI hope the next game won't be a trash heap like this one.\n\nOh and thanks for recommending me one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest games in history, Mike O'♥♥♥♥♥♥.","September 15, 2015","false","26.0"," 88 of 151 people (58%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","58","88","151","31","6"

Contracts was a very dark game and rediscovered some aspects of the story...\n\nEvery Hitman game is unique in his own way, so where does this strange idea come from that every part has to be like Blood Money?? Yes, it was with no doubt a great game with a reliable disguise system and fantastic missions - but Absolution also has it's very own strengths: great sound and graphics, smooth and polished gameplay, cool cinematics and a lot of details in most levels. Some areas (like Hope and Chinatown) are bigger than others and this is completely fine. In my second playthrough, I discovered eastereggs, new rooms and new ways of eliminating the target. Yes, story and points system are strange and not every level offers a lot of stealth varieties but the game just didn't deserve all the extreme and frivolous reviews of some "fans".\n\nAbsolution is fine the way it is - because it's an individual part of the series that still upholds most of the traditions of Hitman. I rather like to play some new aspects than the same style and content again and again.\n\nIf all the haters wouldn't be so ignorant, we surely wouldn't have this reboot without name that is coming out today - and while it might be a great game again, it clearly shows the anxiety of the developers of a new ♥♥♥♥♥torm and the lower production value. It's maybe too much based on the general wish that every level has to be a large sandbox environment (that wasn't even the case in Blood Money!). And while I'm comletely fine with this new decision, I hope that\nthe current uncultivated zeitgeist doesn't rise again and destroys the creative work and motivation of the developers with flames, arrogance and disrespect.","March 10","true","58.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","3"

I have not played any of the other titles in the Hitman series but really considering that now if they are anywhere near as good as this game.\n\nGame has a really good story and lengthy single player campaign.  There were a lot of good cutscenes between missions and the voice acting was well done.  I have a sneaking admiration for Agent 47 after playing the game.\n\nWhat I really like is the dynamic gameplay.  The player can approach any of the mission target(s) any way they wish.  You can be as direct or discreet in taking out the target(s) but also have to be mindful to plan a way out once the target(s) are eliminated.  The dynamic nature of the gameplay forces the player to adapt to the situations as they happen.  In fact there are many challenges that are tied to these different approaches that will affect the final mission score.  Clean and discreet methods are generally more rewarded with a higher mission score but there are many ways to simply succeed at mission completion and that choice is entirely up to the player.\n\nThe contracts mode extends the life of this game once the single player content has been exhausted.  The player can design contracts for other players to play and compete for highest ranking on the online leader boards.  Players can also enter into contract challenges to determine who can complete the contract in the fastest and most efficient way.  The player also gains in-game currency when completing these player-made contracts and can spend this on weapon upgrades to make future jobs easier.  This form of online content was a very smart addition and fits the theme of the game nicely.\n\nI really do like the scoring system that the game uses for both the single player campaign on the contracts mode.  This system keeps enticing me to try the missions and contracts again in a different and more efficient way to achieve the highest score.  This along with the dynamic nature of the gameplay will keep this game fresh for me for quite some time.","October 22, 2013","true","30.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","4"

IO Interactive had pushed Bateson aside for a no-name and didn't even give him a reason why he was replaced. When I found out they had changed their minds at the last second I rushed to Steam and pre-purchased Hitman: Absolution.\n\nProbably the biggest mistake I've ever made.\n\nWhat we have here is the weakest Hitman game in the franchise that was watered-down for casuals. Everything that made Hitman great was thrown out the door with this abomination. Okay, there are a few missions I like (or tolerate) but the rest of this game I pretty much can't stand. Contracts mode was kinda cool for awhile, but quickly got repetitive. The story was pathetic and made absolutely no sense. The cutscene kills were jaw-droppingly restrictive. This is Hitman. This is the sequel that followed Blood Money--the game where you had nearly no limitations. But yet, in Absolution, we are restricted in what we can do. What was the reasoning behind this decision?\n\nBlood Money was not perfect and I know had some flaws, but to follow up such an amazing game with this... is annoyingly difficult to comprehend. I mean it took them six years to make this? Where did the work go? Why would it take so long to make something this bad? And now IO Interactive is planning to release Hitman 6 really soon. They published a letter to fans explaining that the new Hitman game would have more of what everyone wanted and less of what was in Absolution. That's pretty much IO Interactive admitting that Absolution was crap.\n\nWell, let's hope that Hitman 6 really will be much better. Absolution was a major disappointment and really not worth the time or money. Maybe I'll play it again when I'm bored, but every time I think about it I get Nam flashbacks.","November 20, 2012","false","229.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

It hasn't been an easy game to do a Review about. I'm not the biggest Hitman fan, but this game gets A LOT of stuff wrong, and as usual, that's where I will focus first:\n\nFirst and foremost, remember how in previous games you could save during your assassination contracts? Well, that's gone. And that's the perfect case of "don't fix what's not broken".  I can't believe that the devs changed the "limited amount of saves" feature from previous Hitman games for a f#cking Checkpoint system. IT'S STUPID. WHY. And if that was the only thing they changed for the worst it would be fine, buuuut...\n\n...Sadly, this Hitman game goes quite far from previous games, as it offers a linear story instead of the previous games, where you only cared about your target. Why does it go wrong by adding a story? Because it tries really hard to be Deus Ex. Yes, I just said that. They're from the same publisher, Square-Enix, and yet for some reason Hitman tries really hard to add stuff from Deus Ex Human Revolution into here. Some are great aditions, others feel forced, like having maps be split into little sections. WHY!? That SERIOUSLY removes the freedom of taking your time, and getting to your objective the way you want, now instead there's a few dummied down ways to do it.\n\nThe story itself also has a big issue: Remember how in previous games you could choose your loadout before the contract began, and thus choose from the beggining how to handle it? Well, first off, loadouts are out. Gone. And if that wasn't enough, this Hitman game DOES let you go loud, but constantly let's you know that it's bad. Let me explain: Hitman games always had some sort of reward system for when you act silent, however here you can see your score at all times. And what happens when you decide to NOT handle the situation with pure stealth? The game takes points away from you. This is a perfect case of negative reinforcement, something that also happens in Dishonored: the gameplay and shooting/fighting feels PERFECT, but the game penalizes you way to much for it. Now indeed, Dishonored also had boring and easy stealth and it's more complex here, something that I welcome, however I got so sick and tired of how the game CONSTANTLY told me how "killing anyone but the target" was wrong that midway the story I just snapped and started killing EVERYONE. F#CK IT, IF NOONE SURVIVES, THEN NOONE WILL FIND ME. I must also comment on the fact that the game used sexualized women here and there. Seriously. You CAN'T take that sh#t seriously. They want to kill 47 and send a bunch of sexualized nuns with tons of weapons. WHO THE F#CK THOUGH THAT WAS SMART!? WHAT'S WRONG WITH JUST SENDING THOSE SAME WOMEN WITH THE SAME WEAPONS BUT WITH NORMAL OUTFITS!? If you also take to account how the game tried to get attention on Facebook before release, with a sh#tty game that allowed you to "create a contract on your friend's head" for reasons such as "has a tiny ♥♥♥♥♥", you will understand that someone was seriously not right on the head.\n\nThe game also sells a bunch of DLC's, but it did NOT bother to say that those DLC's woundn't be ANYWHERE on the story mode. I was seriously expecting to be able to play through the game dressed as Adam Jensen from Deus Ex HR (ironically, the game tries so hard to be Deus Ex it even has DLC's about it), but they were NOWHERE to be found. Instead, they're locked for the secondary mode, Contracts mode...\n\n...And the last thing I'll talk about is the Contracts mode. It's actually a good idea to have two modes, the singleplayer story mode and a competitive singleplayer with online features... But I didn't like it. At all. Like, seriously, letting people make the contracts on the story maps instead of Square-Enix bothering to make more maps for this mode is just lazy as hell. And some of the contracts made by people are just harsh and stupidly difficult. The worst part is that the DLC's are locked for this mode, but if someone doesn't make a Contract that uses them, then why the hell do you even have them to begin with.\n\nNow holy crap I'm being harsh to this game. Does it have good stuff? Yeah. Here and there.\n\nAs I've said, the gameplay is perfect. Shooting people, taking cover, using your wire, throwing items and such stuff, most of it takes a ton of inspiration from Deus Ex Human Revolution, but most of it is also done really well.\n\nThe music was quite good during the entire duration of the game, and the voices are even better than they ever used to be.\n\nThere's a ton of weapons, NPC's and crap on the maps, even though they're split into dumb sections. If you decide to go loud and ultimately f#ck stealth sideways, you're gonna have some fun. Specially because SOMEHOW you're allowed to take tons of big weapons on you, something you couldn't do before.\n\nThe story is also good enough. It does have some parts where the writers kinda screwed up and the game didn't make much sense, but for the most part, it's a story that will take you arround 15 or so hours to beat, depending on how loud you go.\n\nDo I recommend this game? It's difficult to awnser, so I'll say it like this: Have you played other Hitman games? If not, do not buy this game. Instead buy Hitman; Bloodmoney, which is by far the best game on the series yet, and does it WAY BETTER than Absolution. Have you played the other games already? Then go ahead and buy Absolution. Do you like games about Stealth? Wait for a sale. You loved Deus Ex Human Revolution? Check this game out.\n\nAnd don't bother with the DLC's. I got them all for like, 2€ and I still felt dissapointed.\n\nTL:DR Edition: Average stealth game. Buy Hitman; Bloodmoney if you don't have it instead of this one, buy it only if you trully love the franchise, love Stealth based games or love Deus Ex HR. Ignore the DLC's.","March 23","true","16.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/203140/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","I didn't expect to like this too much.  It received a degree of negativity on release, and I never really got to grips with Blood Money.  However, I LOVE stealth games and decided to give it a go thanks to sales.  Glad I did!  At this late stage I'm probably preaching to the converted, so this review is aimed at anyone else who couldn't really get into Blood Money either.\n\nThe goodThe primary reason this title gets attacked is that it's not open-world.  It's not, but the worlds presented to Agent 47 are still pretty large and there feels like 101 different ways to deal with targets.  It didn't feel overly linear like some titles.  There were many different approaches you can take to reach your targets, hiding and sneaking strategies offered, many weapons, distractions and disguises.  There are a whole variety of ways in which to complete your asignments without firing a shot or being anywhere near the victim.  The AI isn't exactly epic but does the job well enough (it's on a par with most other stealth games where the AI patrols their areas in a timed and predictable fashion).  Their narrative was the usual repetitive statements (very much like Dishonored though perhaps not as bad) and you soon begin to realise that guards aren't saying things because they've actually seen you, but because it is the next line to be spoken in the databank of lines.  Plenty of other games do this too, so that's no biggie.  What the game did well was making many varied people models so there was no feeling of copy-pasted NPCs everywhere.  Crowds were very convincing.  Animations of just about everything was fluid.  The locations were impressive, offering many different routes and places to hide without being overly obvious in their use of props for Agent 47 to use as cover.  Agent 47's use of multiple disguises was a great mechanic and a staple of the series.\n\nAnother reason I've seen this title attacked is because it is an 'action' game.  No, it's not, but it CAN be played as an action title if players prefer that and oftentimes it can be easier and all too tempting to play that way, but if you do, you rob yourself of the silent assassin experience that the game achieves so well.  I found it much better to 'role-play' as a deadly, silent and fatally efficient assassin who must not be detected at any cost, and the game offered a much better challenge as a result.  There is a huge range of (often rather similar) weaponry, most of which is arguably redundant if playing the game 'properly' (ie by stealth).  More useful were the number and variety of objects to be used as distractions.  Weapons, when used, were satisfying and the sniper rifle was a joy to use.  Unlike Blood Money, the controls are extremely simple and effective this time.  No more missing with the wire or fumbling around for exactly the right weapon.  Gamepads are fully supported with a properly-working auto-aim for people who want that advantage.  The opening chapter is a very effective tutorial chapter to introduce all the game mechanics you'll use.\n\nThe overall stealth aspect of the game is fabulous with a perfect difficulty pitch.  If you enjoy stealth play, this has to be in your library of games!  Although the game felt somewhat short, I was surprised to find it took me around 32 hours to complete the game end to end.  I definitely want to replay it!\n\nFinally, the controls are pure joy!  Much improved over Blood Money's clunky, messy PC controls.  This is an easy game to play - perfect for people without Olympic Gold Medals for gamepad dexterity!\n\n\nThe badThe game commits the cardinal sin of several 'points of no return'.  Why don't developers understand how game-breaking it can be to have a door closing permanently behind you without warning, with no way to return?  It breaks the immersion, it prevents players from returning for collectibles (more on those soon) and yet they're really not necessary.  Sure, games often need to be semi-linear if we are to be given rich and varied worlds to play in, and a new map needs to be loaded and the old one flushed out of memory, but at least give us some gateway back to an earlier checkpoint within the same chapter even if that does mean a loading screen here and there (similar to the design of Dishonored where maps would funnel back to one doorway that triggered a reload of the previous area).  As much as people complain about loading screens, they are certainly preferable to denying the player any means of retracing steps if anything has been missed - especially in a game where the player cannot save their progress manually.\n\nThe other element I didn't like were many of the in-game achievements.  There were many that were excellent (often covering the many and varied ways of taking down a target) but then there were the collector hobbyist's busywork challenges!  Basically, these amounted to finding a massive inventory of objects in each chapter.  You can spend far too much time picking up and dropping bottles, bricks, ornaments, wrenches, hammers, the occasional mannequin arm or a dog bone(!) - you name it, you need to grab it for the 'find' to be registered - only to get to the end and find you missed a whole load more.  It reached the point where Agent 47 was leaving quite a trail of broken and dropped debris behind him (hardly stealthy) and it broke the whole role-playing vibe (I felt more like an antiques vs junk collector vs home-wrecker rather than deadly assassin)!  Why even bother doing it then?  The problem is that the game informs you that you only completed, say, 17 out of 40 achievements.  You might have achieved all the important ones (the assassination hits and such), but such a low number results from not being a kleptomaniac and leaves a less than satisfied feeling for the completionist type of gamer.\n\nFinally, the story didn't really go anywhere.  It started out okay, but never really warmed up.  It was 'acceptable' in that it at least had a story unlike (polite cough) Thief 2014, but the whole thing really built up to - well, nothing!  I can't really say much without going into spoilers, but let's say that the final epilogue is a huge disappointment when compared to the earlier strong gameplay and was over all too easily - with the final expected 'boss fight' completely removed from the player's hands.\n\nAnd the summary...Despite those horrid points of no return, Hitman Absolution is a strong contender in the stealth genre.  It's at its best when played as intended: as a secret and silent assassin.  You can go in all guns blazing but it won't be the same satisfying experience.  If you didn't enjoy Blood Money, don't write this one off - especially if you've enjoyed games like Dishonored or the Thief franchise.  Definitely recommended!","February 18, 2015","true","141.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","4"

As a professional killer the game offers you a wide range of possibilities to eliminate your targets. Shoot, strangle, electrocute or poison them, break their necks, slit their throats or let them disappear in different kind of accidents. A great story separates the game in 18 very diversified levels. And while you have the freedom to kill everything that moves the basic idea of the game is to remain stealthy and complete your missions unnoticed like a ghost. This however demands patience. Take your time to investigate your environment before you make your move. Hitman Absolution is no game for nervous trigger fingers.\n\nEvery mission is rated. The more people you kill the less points you will collect. This is a great way to reward your play style. Beside the main target every level has challenges. Completing the challenges will grant you additional points. Depending on the selected level of difficulty your multiplier will rise or fall. Besides the personal satisfaction of gaining a high result you can compare it with your friends and other players.\n\nThe game also lets you create individual maps based on existing single player levels. These maps can then be played by other players. This however is rather disappointing but it's only a bonus that nobody really needs.\n\nPros:\n- Strong atmosphere\n- Nice story, very well scripted\n- Very good voice acting\n- Good sound and music\n- Very good level design\n- Good controls\n- Realistic enemy behavior, very good AI\n- Very entertaining\n- Extremely detailed environments\n- Nice humor (meet Kane and Lynch or find Lara Crofts ammo bag)\n- Good (somewhat aged) in-game graphics\n- Interesting locations\n- High replayability\n- Many ways to disguise (costumes)\n\nCons:\n- Poor, blurry cut-scenes\n- Sometimes long loading times\n- Disappointing level editor, if you can even call it an editor\n\nTo get the most out of this game I recommend playing it on hard difficulty with the aim to remain unseen.","March 21","true","44.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I can however give you a review about the game I played.\n\nAbsolution features a storyline behind 47's indoctrine into the world of Hitmen. The story starts out with his previous handler gone "rogue" for reasons unknown. 47 ends up shooting her point blank but makes a promise to her that he will keep this girl that she's been trying so hard to protect, safe.\n\nThe game play is well rounded in Aboslution, from close combat to ranged. There is a feature where you can mark multiple targets (much like Conviction) and execute them by pressing X (on a 360 controller). 47 is able to take cover by pressing B, and can lean out pressing the L trigger and fire to enemies. Exposure though can cost quite a bit of damage. The main feature I'm assuming in the Hitman series is the ability to disguise the main character as other NPC's from the game.  From a police officer, to janitor, to electrician, to thugs. Just like any stealth game, hiding the bodies becomes key. The player doesn't lift them up, but drags them to the destination. When around dumpsters and closets that exist for the player to dump two bodies into, the player presses Y to enter a scenamatic where 47 hides the body. The fighting in the game is nice as quick time events pop up to counter or combo against foes. When the player presses RB, in game there is a focus meter that high lights surrounding areas of the environment. It will show foes, points of interests, key cards, or even hidden pathways. This button also allows you to sneak by certain groups. In one level you may need it to sneak past thugs while wearing a thug outfit, in another you may need a staff outfit.\n\nVisuals are nice and graphics are up to date. Everything is running smooth and have had no hiccups thus far. Sounds are appropriate and listening to conversations throughout the game, the player can hear some funny stories. I like the way the game sets up and let's the player roam free in an area. Chinatown is a famous example of this where chaos can be created instantly, or, where it can happen quitely or from afar. This part of the game they absolutely nailed.\n\nI would have loved to see a local co-op or even a multiplayer feature, as I may not see replayability here for myself in the future. Hardcore Hitman fans may come back to this and seek a harder difficulty. I did enjoy playing through it none the less as the game play experience was nominal. Reading previous reviews, some reviewers have complained about not having a map. Not playing previous versions of the game I didn't really notice the absense of having a lay out, but it could have been nice to have one. Maybe for future cases keep it, and when you explore certain areas, point of interests become marked out to come back to and use?\n\nSaving scheme may sit well with some, badly with others. The game saves between chapters or new stages, and "checkpoints" are available throughout the level. These checkpoints can not be reloaded once the game is closed, and can only be used currently if you die or want to restart.\n\nAlthough the game is good, I still feel like they could have done better with what they were given. A lot was done, but something a bit more could have been added to make the game play experience better. The options of how to execute were great, but the process of doing them can be worked on.

I mean, Deus Ex Human Revolution was good. And hey, they talk about an end to hive-mind system that bugged me from every stealth game ever made!\n\nWhat followed is the least enjoyable experience I have ever had playing a video game. This is not the worst game ever made, it's just the most disgustingly large turd on a franchise I so eagerly follow. Anybody who has played a Hitman game and enjoyed it, stay away, and for anybody else who was looking to pick up this game I'd still be wary. Now, let me go on a far-too-long rant on why that is.\n\nFor starters, the story is trash. The only reason the story exists is because Agent 47 equips and unequips his emotions as frequently as most people equip and unequip a watch when bathing in 94 different bubble-baths getting dressed between each. Blake Dexter is a complete ♥♥♥♥ who sets up a framing job before lighting an entire building on fire. His girlfried/wife/whatever stays with him even though she remains the "voice of reason" throughout the game up until the third-to-last level. Victoria is a character who only exists to be a macguffin whose biggest accomplishment is killing about ten guys with guns before refusing to kill the villain because OH GOD I'M A MONSTER LET ME STARE IN ANGUISH AT MY HANDS. I could write a thesis on how this game's plot is awful, but I digress because Hitman was never about the story anyway and is just filler and justification for the levels.\n\n...and the story is only used to vaguely justify killing some people that the game explicitly states as evil. Multiple times. Even by the mooks that litter the levels. The only exception to the rule that everybody is shown as a monster before you kill them because morals are the horrible fetish nuns. Why are there horrible fetish nuns? And why can't they tell if there's rat poison in their coffee even after looking at the inside and smelling it? Why don't people see the difference between the wrestler they were just training and a bald white guy who looks like he guts domestic animals in his free time? Nitpicky, but stupid how a judge that they refer to on a first name basis is a better disguise than some nameless police officer that nobody cares about unless they see him holding a gun?\n\nAnd yes, the hive-mind system works in theory. It's just that if somebody is firing a gun at where they think your cover is, regardless of if it's a ♥♥♥♥ing bookshelf against a wall, they get alerted, plug themselves into the ♥♥♥♥ing paramilitary archives, find out what your disguise is and start firing where they think you are. And everybody who sees the two people who saw the first guy go hostile. And everybody who sees the five people who saw the first three go hostile. And soon you have a generic cover-shooter fight with an absurd amount of people that's only exceptional in how bad its aiming is, unless of course you have a sharp object for the game to aim into their neck or if you use Red Dead magical i-just-murdered-everybody-in-three-seconds-o-vision.\n\nThe amazing talents behind this game decided to focus their efforts into filling the game with a ridiculous amount of dialogue that, in the long run, is a less charming version of "GET LOST CHUM-LY" whenever you run or get too close to somebody. Or, of course, the game wants to show you how funny it is with such award-winning lines such as "didn't you use to date my sister?" or "heard of breath mints before?" And you'd better believe that you'll get maymay'd on so many times over the course of this game akin to water torture, just with your eardrums and people who cannot believe their eyes every time they see somebody at a light jog.\n\nPraise for this game starts and ends with potentially good levels and easter eggs. Except for the strip club, the multiple levels in Chinatown, the subway of much spinning in place and the fact that they wanted to shoehorn in Kane and Lynch not once, but twice.\n\nIncreases in difficulty just put more guards around the place that block different ways to kill your target. Additionally, you lose points with every pacification/kill/walking two inches too far down a hallway/fun. It's like the game developers decided that they wanted to make a game with a lot of ways to kill your targets before poking the player in the ribs every time they don't do an accident kill. This is assuming that you actually have a target in your level. The lack of killing in this game for a game about a contract killer is mindblowing, and when you are killing people it's silhouttes that the game call "evil masterminds" and "story-relevant". The last people you actually kill as a player in the game are three ♥♥♥♥faces that haven't been mentioned in the slightest up until that point, before you take out the main villain in a cutscene in a sequel hook that only made me wonder where Hitman Absolution stopped taking itself seriously and finally downed the bottle of ♥♥♥♥ it didn't realise had been sloshing down its throat the whole time.\n\nPlaying through this game using only a suit actually introduced challenge and interesting things into this game up until one level that had an un-detectable disguise sitting in the middle of an empty room that was all-but essential for clearing this level with good points. And so, rather than taking out the last target in an interesting and challenging manner, I exploited the person I had to knock unconscious and then lobbed a screwdriver into the other target's skull with unparalleled accuracy from a second-storey window. I then proceeded to get Silent Assassin.\n\nOther greatest hits from the "Silent Assassin's Golden Memories" folder includes grabbing a knife in the middle of a crowd and putting it into my pocket before anybody noticed, weaving my way into one of the billion ♥♥♥♥ing bins in Chinatown and waiting until the target went to sample some sushi before throwing it into HIS skull. Skip forward a few missions to the next mission in Chinatown and I went with the very exhausted option of gunning down all three of my faceless targets, hiding in cover a few metres away from the exit and waiting for two minutes for the police force to drain approximately $6,000,000,000 worth of bullets into a box. When they decided that they'd done a good enough job, they walked forward a few steps, loudly proclaimed "HE'S VANISHED" and walked away from the only exit to Chinatown.\n\nAnd the cheat meter. Revolutionary to Hitman games is the ability to brainwash people into forgetting about you, detect people/weapons/ways to kill people/secret god damn doors from miles away and take away the only form of challenge with accident kills by telling you where to use a wrench as well as babying you to the point of telling you that a lever right beside electrical equipment emits electricity.\n\nI could go on even longer about how much hellfire and brimstone this game makes me want to explode out into HTML, but I'll just stick to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out salt for the next couple of weeks from the discomfort of my own home. If you have standards low enough to ignore 90% of this stuff, or have enough cynical tolerance to happily crap all over the game, then go for your life. To anybody who wants a good stealth experience, Blood Money is always a far, far, far more desireable experience past the tutorial. And to anybody who loves Hitman and is nitpicky, you'd probably also vomit in your mouth when you see the crow suit easter egg.","March 20, 2015","false","16.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","1"

You had your level layout, your target, and many ways to approach this.\nYou have none of that in Absolution. Instead of infiltrating - you're hiding behind dumpsters and convenient blocks of random crap.\nEveryone instantly thinks he doesn't know you. Even in a level of 1000 cops, everyone's suspicious of you, and you have to have your "instinct" to pull down your cop cap or hide your face a little (whichs is unsuspicious as hell) to prevent them from "finding out" that you're not a cop, for instance.\nIt would be a decent Splinter Cell game if you could hide in the shadows, since that's a very big part of action stealth. You also have none of that here.\n\nIf you've never played Hitman before - you might love this, so go ahead and buy it, but if you're a fan of the old chess-like Hitman games, then please, do not waste your money on this.","December 4, 2013","false","7.1"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

What removes the tension of having to draw your weapon faster then your oponent when you are discovered, or hide it before a enemy sees you.\n\nThe AI makes no sense at all as I even had a police officer call the SWAT on me FOR TRESPASSING IN A SUSHI MARKET STAND! Guards also no longer warn you when you are trespassing, and "trespassing" aparently now applies for sushi stands who exclusivelly have poison fish, while all other market stand owners are totally fine with 47 entering there stands.\nAbsolution literally ignored all realism and simply marked every location that would be convienent as a restricted area.\n\nThe world design makes no sense, and the enemy's even less,\nmost of the game plays in area's with small towns, with (I'm not very familiar with the American terms, but the game calls them "rednecks")\n\nthese are obviously towns where people are just hanging around and taking life less serious, yet everybody is hyper focused and somehow every shop, every home and every target location has police and body guards, the past game's had realistic guard posts and behavior, this game just randomly puts a guard at every target location and defies all logic,\nwere this reality, I would have been able to stroll in witouth anybody in those towns giving a damn.\n\nThe story also makes no sense, 47 cuts his bar code on the back of his head "becourse"\nliterally no reason is given.\nWhy? his barcode is his proof that he is a clone, what does that even have to do with the plot right now? what purpose did it have for him to cut it and then paste a bandage over it that's SMALLER then the barcode so enemy's can still see the barcode?!\nand his new "personality" makes no sense towards his actual personality from the past games.\nWhoever wrote the script made the fatal error of trying to give 47 emotions,\n\nWhoever demanded 47 to get more story and emotion really needs to learn how to be creative, as "giving your character a story the player can relate to" is one of the basic "how to create my generic game 101" textbook.\nPeople liked Agent 47 becourse he lacked the ability to process human emotions and we were not forced to "relate" to our character we controll.\n\n47 should be a killing machine that does not care for humans, the past game's made that spesifically clear that he would never pull punches of do favors, leave alone that he would get "emotional" and in a confusing moment cut his barcode.\nThe real 47 would have spend that time on planning to find out who his next targets would be, instead of sitting in a chair half a day struggeling with his feelings.\n\nAnybody reading this, don't buy this game, by all means buy all other hitman games, but not this one, Absolution is for all I care none canon, and the hitman series stopped with bloodmoney.\nAbsolution can turn to dust for all I care.\n\nIf anything, the ONLY thing I like about this game is the instinct ability replacing the map.\n\nThis "thing" is not a Hitman game,\nits a pathetic group of people buying over a series in a attempt to leech of its popularity, failing to realize you can't get anything out of a series you destroy,\n\nyou can also buy a expencive car from somebody, but it won't do you any good if you crash it into a tree and then dare to call it "better".\nwhoever created the car made the brand populair due to them being able to create those cars the way they are,\nwhen you buy it over and start creating other type's of cars under the same brand, nobody will want them anymore as they did not like the brand, they liked the product.\n\nthis "hitman" is not a hitman game.\n\n9/10 game? wonder how much those people were bribed to give that false score,\nthis game is a 4/10\n1 point for the instinct ability\n3 for the graphics\nand -2 for not improving uppon bloodmoney\nand -4 for taking away literally EVERYTHING that made Hitman a good game series.\n\nif anybody of the Hitman Absolution team is reading this, stop your nonesense talking about "hitman 6" you stil need to FIX this game, and by fix I mean actually listen to the fans of the game instead of bluntly ignoring there requests to bring back the ACTUAL Hitman game's core,\n\nwhat you presented to us is just a hollow shell of a shooter/sneak game with hitman's face pasted over it. You can't just cut out the core of a game series and expect everybody to just be oke with that.\n\nThis is one of those games that, if it would have been released as a new title witouth leeching off another series's its history,\nit would never have sold well.\nThe only reason it sold well is due to 2 reasons\n1: It leeches off the Hitman franchise, a rubish game sold with the title "Hitman" pasted on top of it.\n2: Misleading trailers and anouncements, half the anouncements and trailers promiced things that have never come to pass or don't even exist or work entirelly different in the game.\n\nI can literally not understand how anybody who worked on this game, if they ever actually "played" the previous games of the game they worked on, is not feeling ashamed of themselves for driving Hitman into the ground like this and not even TRYING to fix it. Not even listening to the actual long standing fans of the series.\nIf I would have been on the development team of this game I would have felt sickened of what I had created, and pleaded with whoever my boss was to let me patch up the flaws and bugs and not leave it like this as by any reason this is just unaceptable.\n\nAnd people can bring up arguments all they want on how hard it would be to patch it,\nits no problem to patch a game, we have steam, we have online updates for games,\nback in 19XX years, THEN patching games was impossible,\ntoday? please, making toast is more complex then adding a patch to people's games.\n\nSquare Enix, you want the Hitman series? then know that you can't just "buy" the hitman series,\nyou have to earn it by making a worthy sequal, not by simply buying the series and then copy/pasting the name on a new bland game,\nor like right now, starting to work on hitman 6 and act as if absolution never happened by pussing it under a rug,\nfix the damned game and THEN work on a worthy 6th game.\n\nYou wanted to make Hitman turn into a new road? make the system work differently?\nthen you should have started a new series with a new character in the Hitman universe,\nso that the fans of hitman could have kept there actual hitman game, and along with that you could have created your own new playstyle with a new character, Like another clone who happened to have survived after he/she was raised by whatever group invaded the labaratory and destroyed everything exept him/her and instead trained Him/her to become a secret asset for crime fighting.","February 22, 2015","false","85.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

The most obvious problems with this game, again, are that it is trying to be both a stealth game and a modern shooter; Your character in this game is an absolute bullet sponge, able to take dozens of shots without going down, taking away much suspense; why even bother going in stealth you could h shootup the entire place without any difficulty, which again defeats the purpose of this game. Compare that to Blood Money, were you could only take 2 or three shots before dying, forcing you to use your wits and intelligence all the more.\n\nThat leads into the second obvious problem: look at the massive weapons arsenal players are given to loadout for missions, with machine guns, smgs, shotguns, etc; A real hitman doesn't need or often even *want* an automatic rifle for a mission, all they need is a silenced pistol and maybe on occasion a sniper rifle; the point of the game is to act with surgical precision, not shoot up the joint like a common thug. Not that there is anything wrong with shootemup gamea, but trying to mix 'shootemup' into such a stealth game just leaves the gameplay feeling a tad confused.\n\nAnd furthmore something about the stealth gameplay feels 'off', it feels like it has been made too easy. The special kill methods tend to feel forced and contrived, as if the game has a "proper" way to kill the target in mind rather than giving you the range of options to feel free; In Blood Money, the killing methods felt natural and organic.\n\nAbsolution isn't what I would call a "bad" game, I guess I would say it feels pretty to look at but mediocre in gameplay. It it is something that interests you it will likely be worth it on sale, but otherwise I wouldn't go rushing out to get Absolution.

Surely, hardcore fans of the older titles may be disappointed with the somewhat more linear structure of this game, but I thought that the superb stealth, shooting, and movement mechanics were exactly what this series needed, and Hitman Absolution delivers big time in the fun factor department. Gorgeous environments that are incredibly lit, fantastic sound mixing, and moody ambience really make Hitman Absolution a title to remember. It's a generous game with a lengthy campaign and a separate Contracts mode if you want to dig deeper into what the community is doing within the game. Rounding things out is a surprisingly cool story with some very memorable characters, including a blood-curdling, redneck villan that you'll never forget. Hitman has always been a hard game to classify, as it has practically become a genre unto itself. But while this title may polarize fans of the older titles, there has never been a better Hitman game for the newcomer to jump into and discover the one-of-a-kind experience that the Hitman franchise offers.\n9.8/10\n","September 4, 2014","true","36.5"," 36 of 62 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","36","62","3","0"

Contracts was a very dark game and rediscovered some aspects of the story...\n\nEvery Hitman game is unique in his own way, so where does this strange idea come from that every part has to be like Blood Money?? Yes, it was with no doubt a great game with a reliable disguise system and fantastic missions - but Absolution also has it's very own strengths: great sound and graphics, smooth and polished gameplay, cool cinematics and a lot of details in most levels. Some areas (like Hope and Chinatown) are bigger than others and this is completely fine. In my second playthrough, I discovered eastereggs, new rooms and new ways of eliminating the target. Yes, story and points system are strange and not every level offers a lot of stealth varieties but the game just didn't deserve all the extreme and frivolous reviews of some "fans".\n\nAbsolution is fine the way it is - because it's an individual part of the series that still upholds most of the traditions of Hitman. I rather like to play some new aspects than the same style and content again and again.\n\nIf all the haters wouldn't be so ignorant, we surely wouldn't have this reboot without name that is coming out today - and while it might be a great game again, it clearly shows the anxiety of the developers of a new ♥♥♥♥♥torm and the lower production value. It's maybe too much based on the general wish that every level has to be a large sandbox environment (that wasn't even the case in Blood Money!).

NO! Don't get me wrong, Hitman Absolution is pretty good as a stealth game but it's a terrible Hitman game.\n\nFirst of all the levels are much more liniar compared to the other Hitman games, combining that with the fact that your cover can be blown if you come too close to a person that is wearing the same uniform as you, witch mostly results in killing everyone to pass a certain part of the level because for example only police man may acces a certain area and every person in that area will discover you if you try to pass them. Second of all you can not select your loadout at the beginning of a level witch was a cool feature in all the other hitman games because you could select a loadout that fits your strategy. last but definitly not least, there are a lot of levels that don't even have a target to kill, you just have to go from point A to point B trying to sneak past all the guards.\n\nSo now the bad aspects are out of the way here are some good aspects.\nThere are mostly multiple ways to kill your targets ranging from setting up an "accident" to gun everyone down, and the stealth has been improved making it easier to sneak past guards in previous Hitman titles without them seeing you at all, and there's contracts mode which makes you select a level, kill up to 3 targets selected by you and the game creates a challenge based on your actions to share with the rest of the world. And the game has a better story compared to the other Hitman games, not that the story was very importand to me in a Hitman game. I mean you're a hitman, someone wants someone dead and you're hired to do the dirty work, no need for a fancy story there.\n\nIt's pretty good as a stealth game but because it's called Hitman: Absolution i'm rating it as a Hitman game, i'll give it a 5/10","November 26, 2013","false","6.6"," 54 of 97 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","54","97","0","1"

Or second. Or third, for that matter. It's like one of those old arcade games, where the slightest mistake, your fault or not, will cause it to become a bloodbath.\n\nThe beauty of the older games was that it was a sandbox. You could complete the level in the way you wanted. You could put on a disguise and become a GOD. Disguises now serve next to no purpose since anybody with a similar outfit will be able to recognise you.\n\nThe graphics are nice and some of the levels have that same old Hitman magic (the ones where people don't just shoot you on sight). However, the game is far too frustrating to play properly. If you want to reach the end of the game, expect to give up and shoot everybody in some of the missions, or to be at this game for months replaying every level hundreds of times before you learn and perfect the exact route that works.\n\nIf anybody doesn't know what to expect from a Hitman game, you have to kill certain people and you get a better score if you do it secretly or make it look like an accident. The levels are large and semi-open-ended, with lots of NPCs and pointless but fun details. If you want to know what all the fuss is about, try Blood Money, which is a really good game and has aged wonderfully. This game, on the other hand, was dated in its style before it was even released. Oh and there's no such thing as the colour black in this game, since it's always smeared with a filter. Sometimes it makes it look very cinematic, other times it's downright annoying. But that could be ignored if the gameplay itself wasn't so perfectly flawed.","December 7, 2013","false","17.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It definitely takes the gameplay a bit into the Deus Ex: HR / Alpha Protocol realm, which I really don't mind since I love those games. The melee is all QTE stuff, but the overall game controls are a huge improvement over Hitman: Blood Money and the earlier games. In Blood Money, for example, pushing the interact button on someone had a completely unpredictable effect; you may punch them, or push them, or maybe knock them out, or maybe just annoy them and alert everyone to your presence. It was really annoying. This game does it infinitely better. The disguise system and blend-into-the-crows system are great, too. The save (checkpoint in Absolution) system is much less versatile, though, which is too bad, but not really too much of a hindrance since levels are generally very small and confined compared to earlier games. Overall, I really like it so far and think it improves upon the series in a lot of ways.\n\nI can see why many Hitman fans didn't like the campaign. Each mission is a series of smallish levels, and only one or two of the mini-levels might have assassination targets. The levels with no assassination targets are more like your standard stealth-action game fare than traditional Hitman style missions. Mostly, it's just sneaking past guys to get to the next area. The actual assassination levels are great, and I like the way challenges give you both goals to play for and hints on various ways to kill a target. Contracts mode is is pretty neat, and can fulfill the desire of series fans for a "murder playground" just fine, I would think.\n\nThe controls and the disguise system are really orders of magnitude better than any previous Hitman games, which is great. There are just a few annoying oddities with the disguise system, though. (dressing as a food vendor from one part of Chicago arouses suspicion of food vendors down the street?). I miss having a map, but I think the instinct system is actually more useful (for tracking enemy positions and interactive objects, at least), and is more intuitive (the maps in previous Hitman games for larger levels were needlessly difficult to use, usually not showing you where one floor map connected to others).\n\nI think this game is my favorite in the series. The improved controls far outweigh the decreased sandbox feeling compared to earlier games. The moral of the story (or even the entire franchise) I would say is that "you can solve a lot of problems by killing enough people."\n\nRecommended if you are into video game murder simulators and stealth/action games (e.g. Deus Ex: HR).","April 9, 2015","true","18.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The addition of a "focus" bar which 47 can use to hide his face whilst walking past guards is laughable. Disguises no longer grant access to places, and walking down a corridor 50ft away from a guard will cause them to run up to you and ask who you are, even if 47 is walking away from them. In another scenario, you might open a door and get spotted by a guard way down the corridor, and lose points for "trespassing" or something similar, even if you are walking in a normal non-forbidden area.\n\nIn general, I found that I had to shoot my way out of a lot of situations constantly, and it was almost as if the game let you get away with just killing anyone you see. There is no real disincentive to just pillaging an entire level and killing everyone. In the first level alone, I messed up one silent execution and suddenly had to kill at least 15 people. Fair enough right? Well there was no punishment. I transitioned into the next area and carried on.\n\nAnd speaking of transitions, the levels are built into "areas". 47 has to complete various tasks in each area before he can move on. Essenitially, this forces the Hitman genre into a adventure platformer... Go here perform X, go here, enter cutscene, go here do Y, cutscene. It also means that you can gun your way through a hard area, run for the exit, and suddenly by walking through a thin wooden door onto a side street, the guards on the other side haven't heard the gunshots, explosions and multiple mass murders you committed on the other side.\n\nFurthermore, the Contracts mode was poorly executed and could have been fantastic, but it essentially just allowed you to pick a random character in a level and then get others to kill them like you did, f.e With a knife in your Suit. Or via an accident whilst wearing a chicken costume. In reality, all that happened was that you ended up running around the level looking for a specific hidden weapon someone used, then trying to recreate the specific set of circumstances that person used to set the contract.\n\nAbsolution might aswell be a standalone game, as it really feels like it lost most of the classic features from the Hitman series.\n\nAll in all, this game is garbage, and has essentially been milked for a sequel that could have been so much more.\n\nI played this game through once and got completely tired of it. It had none of the features I wanted to see, and all of the things it did add were poorly executed or so unncessary and condesendingly dumbed down that it simply made me wish I hadn't bought the game.","November 25, 2013","false","11.7"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","30","52","0","0"

You visit lots of diffrent locations and take care of people.\n\nGood Points\nThe Storyline is great and keeps you intrest all the way though with a few plot twists and the characters are really intresting thoughout the story.\n\nControls are easy and you will pick them up quickly as there easy to learn. Sometimes you loose control when the camera moves on its own, but its not to bad.\n\nThe levels are all unique with every level being in a diffrent place and situation. This keeps you intrested and keeps you playing.\n\nGrathics in Absolution are nice and look great because there is alot of detail in the game. The lighting is the best feature in the grathics because its very realisic fits the tone of the game.\n\nThe slow motion feature great as it can help you kill or give you more time to think on what to do. It also gives you some clues which can be helpful.\n\nMusic in Absolution is good, not amazing but it fits the scene and helps you understand the situation. It just works which is what you need.\n\nThe length is good, its around 10 to 12 hours long if your rushing though but you can but over 20 hours if you playing the game slow. There is so many things you can do and each level is replayeble so you can get your moneys worth if you wanted to.\n\nBad Points\nTowards the end you start to realise that each level has the same layout in what your supposed to do. Its always find this room then find your target. Works well but you notice it towards the end.\n\nThe Multiplayer Contracts become boring very quickly which makes you not even want to try again. I'd just play single player since you get a better experience.\n\nIt diffrent from over hitman games and a few fans say they like Blood Money more since its alot better. So you you've played every over hitman game then dont be taken back when you play Absolution since its diffrent.\n\nOverall\nIn my opinion I think that Hitman: Absolution is a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes stealth games. If you a big fan of the Hitman series then you might not like it as much but for someone new then you should start with this game. I rate Absolution 7 out of 10.","June 23, 2015","true","30.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes, having absolute control over life and death with a well crafted character with a wide range of skills, who can easily take down every single enemy on the level, or pass through like a ghost. This game, or rather this Franchise, sets a good mark of an assassin - and that is planning and strategizing. There is always ANOTHER way of killing an enemy, always a different aproach, and while you get rewarded for more creative ways, don't let the score discourage your playstyle. That is the beauty, and that is what it makes me feel as a gamer. Now off to a more technical aproach.\nOptimisation is an absolute win, i benchmarked this game with ultra settings on my lenovo y50, which has an integrated and nvidia gtx850m and you can easily pull over 30 fps. Tearing is kind of annoying with disabled vsync, it does eat quite the amount of memory, but it's really not a big problem, as mentioned, optimisation is amazing and you can pull this game even on older PCs. Graphics, visual effects, lightning, and blood are spectacular, honestly, i haven't found any bad graphical glitches or bugs.\nAudio/Soundtrack is dynamic and again, gives you the feeling of control, almost acts as a vital guide on harder difficulties. Gives you the sense of a situation, and allows you to steadily go with the flow. Audio is really important for me in the game, and i found it really suitable for this type of gameplay. I absolutely loved it.\nLast, but not least, is gameplay. I believe you kinda get the sense of the gameplay from what was mentioned above, but let me mention a couple of new features that i found interesting:\nInstinct. Bloody hell, i love this feature. Not because it can make a game easy, but because it gives you a choice on how do you want to play this. I love how developers removed every most important aspect of "instinct" on higher difficulties, and kept it hardcore for long term fans. I'm not gonna lie to you, i haven't completed the game on highest difficulty, and i'm not going to. I've been playing it as challange since Hitman Contracts,\nScoreboard. Let's you compare your score with your buddies, and can make a game a bit more competetive. That is a brilliant feature aswell, but as i said before, don't let the score discourage you, if you have a lower one. Hitman was never truly a comptetetive game, altough in the good old days, we DID like to argue who was a better assassin and who can complete the level on higher diffuculty. That brings me to another new cool aspect.\nContracts. You can now design and play contracts designed by your friends, so you could finaly put it to rest on who's better at the game. Simple as that.\nTo sum it up, this is truly a masterpiece, and if you're a long term fan, there's absolutely no reason not to get this game, AI is excellent and challanging aswell, well polished and crafted piece of art, ripe for the taking. Enjoy.","February 27, 2015","true","13.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The game itself is wrapped around the main hitman character, number 47. The story guess wouldn't really suprise and keys are given all the way through till the end. The misions are fun, plenty of features, challenges and taste of proper assasination make it enjoyable. You get points for your actions and that's actually plus and minus of the game, it motivates you to compete with others (shows you world average, average in your country and most point walkthrough) or just get better in-game for your own but also kinda disturb the storytelling + doesn't really makes impact on in-game world. Contracts are nice addition to stick for some more time with game even after beating main story but they are often easy and get repetetive.\n\n+ Story and some memorable moments  (crazy killing sexy hitman nuns in cornfield)\n+ Nice graphic\n+ Variability of missions and enviroments\n+ Many different ways how to reach your objectives\n+ Enjoyable characters\n+ Guns and costumes number\n+ Contracts and point tracking\n- Contracts and point tracking\n\n"If you like stealth action games, this one is definitely worth a shot.

You'll notice it from the beginning, and still you'll probably be amazed by it deep into the campaign. After that, there is no too much to admire.\nIt plays like a puzzle game about creating elaborate deaths that look like accidents. Once the puzzle game breaks down, it becomes a 3rd-Person-Shooter. Trouble is, I found myself forgetting about the puzzle rather quickly, eventually just shooting my way in and out. I frustratingly got to this point because of the reminders of my score everytime I made a mistake trying to make the perfect kill. The constant score updates ought to be something left for a second playthrough.\nOn top of this, the assassination puzzles are claustrophobic rather than an open toybox of options. I guess if you want a narrow "cinematic" experience with the occasional break of puzzle/shooter gameplay, this game is just for you. It ain't for me. I'd rather have the sandbox loaded with option, with the only story being, "Kill this guy. Make it look like a accident."","February 21, 2015","false","6.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I've been a long time Hitman fan and have enjoyed all other installments before it.\n\nI'm not sure if it is because it changed developer hands or what, but I felt like the missions went from holding my hand so hard they'd break it to then release me into missions that were cryptic and rather unforgiving in odd ways.  I remember Hitman missions as being something I'd freeform through much more gracefully.\n\nThere's a score that sits up in the corner grading you on everything you do.  I didn't enjoy this as I subconsciously started trying to please the score more than myself.\n\nIn the first "real" mission the score at the top was far nicer to me if I just walked up and gunned people down and bolted to the exit -- rather than attempt a bunch of natural play sneaky stuff that wasn't pre-scripted.\n\nI was in a crowd blending with hundreds of people and a civilian who owned a small stand cooking fish screamed and ran to the cops who immediately gunned me down.  Not the security guard, but the cook.  Upon trying the mission again the same thing happened with another person selling streetwares from another small stand.\n\nI encountered some checkpoint bugs that were frustrating.  It keeps a score tally and my tally kept going down every time it brought me back to the checkpoint.  Eventually I was in score debt.","January 31, 2014","false","7.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It is not about butthurt, but rather being deceived by false promises and selfdeclared incapability to locate the bugs and repair them###\n###So do not BS me, because you like the Hitman Series (which I do too) and give a proper feedback and do not simply "No", if you have clearly NOT PLAYED IN PURIST MODE!###\n\n\n1. AI is broken beyond repair YOU WILL DESPAIR!\n2. DO NOT BUY, if by any means you are interested in this game, let it be gifted to you... by whoever is willing to waste 5 USD for it :-/ otherwise, every cent wasted!\n3. I AM A MASSIVE FAN OF THE HITMAN SERIES and I gave the game every credit I could scramble, but it is atrocious\n4. I paid hard cash for the game and pre-ordered the "Professional Edition" from Amazon\n5. I finished the game completly (with a lot of pain and sometimes I was about to puke on my keyboard or controller)\n\n\nThis game took me one year to finally finsih it. It was a thorough torture for me, simply because I was so frustrated about the AI. The AI is absolutely broken, there is no ABSOLUTION for the programmers and their really bad job!!\n\nUsually I end a SP focused game within 1-4 weeks. I really wanted to give this game a fair chance... but it let me down several times!\n\nMy plan was to play a level, perform all challenges (needs replay in some levels because of signature kills) and afterwards I wanted to replay the level in "purist" mode (highest difficulty without HUD etc.).\nIt was not possible to do so on PC, on console I read and saw different walkthroughs working 100%, BUT NOT ON PC!\n\nWhat you see in the purist mode videos on YouTube is not possible anymore (at least on PC).\nThe broken AI spots/recognizes you apart from wearing a disguise and they can hit you from 1km distance. Additionally they do not react as you would presume they would react to distractions (if they even react to them at all!).\n\nBest example: "Terminal"\nYou are fleeing from the Chicago Police through a library, an apartment and make your getaway from a train platform,\nIn the foyer of a building you have to get through to make it to the train plattform.\nCheck videos on YouTube for reference and search for "Hitman Absolution Terminal Train Station Purist Suit Only".\n\nI did the Librabry in Purist mode with patience and care and made it through. Same with the apartment(s) (you remember the video with teh hippie boys smoking weed... it is their arpartment ;-) ), they were "beatable". BUT I never made it out of the foyer of the building. You know why? It is impossible to grab the evidence!\nGrabbing the evidence is a vital part for a good rating and you can proof yourself you did it.\n\nI used the following strategy:\nI drop a C4 bomb near the elevator (which is your starting point at this part of the "terminal" level).\nNext step is taking a detour (to the left) and wait for the SWAT Team to arrive.\nThen detonate the bomb (without casualties, it is just a distraction) and see all Cops reacting to the detonation (storming to the elevator room).\nAll except two idiots standing near the tray where the evidence is located.\nFail! Dead end!! Reload!!!\n\nIt is useless to compete with other players at all, if you do not grab the evidence, you need these extra points (after some time some people found out how to cheat the best player highscorelists, so now you see people with a 1.something million highscore, instead of max of a 6-digit highscore).\n\nAnyway these Cops made a reaction jump to the detonation and thats it.\nTheir Cop colleagues now rush to the source of the noise, except those two idiots, who then lean back and go business as usual (blocking my way to the evidence).\nThis was proven more then 50 times!\n\nI reloaded and reloaded and reloaded, yeah! After like 50 reloads I restarted the whole game.\nThat was the most frustrating part, because I had to replay the whole level, two additional parts before. This is necessary, since the savefile DID NOT SAVE that I had a C4 in my inventory once and always resets the inventory to what I had some walkthroughs before.\nBefore you ask, I did a proper "normal" walkthrough with the C4 in my inventory and at this point finished the level completely in one sweep (with the C4 in my inventory and on normal difficulty!).\n\nSo the savefiles are broken too :/\n\nI gave the game another chance and lowered my video settings to absolute minimum, because I thought the troubles were related to performance issues (even though I  had proper and more then recommended hardware). But performance and CR4PPY AI programming are two pair of shoes!\n\nAfter this BS I stopped playing HMA, which was within the first 10 days after release! I gave the game another shot in early spring and in summer. Still no change! This is by far the worst triple A (AAA) title I ever bought and played.\n\nSimply put: Do not buy!!!\n\nAI is still bugged after they tried to "patch" things out.\nSavepoints are bugged, too. This means dead/unconscious enemies re-appear after loading the game, objects vanish or return to their original spots.\nYou will only get frustrated and try to bite something (your controller or your mouse/keyboard).\n\nSeriously and I bought the Professional Edition...\nSquare Enix has good titles and is in general a good publisher, but the studio goofed up!\nNo buy anymore from that studio :(","July 14, 2013","false","79.0"," 44 of 81 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","44","81","0","10"

I would have liked a 'mixed' button for the recommandation rating, because I don't know what to think of this game.\n\nO.K.\n\n+/ Nice level design.\n+/ Interesting and new locations with refreshing levels.\n+/ The assasinations levels are cool.\n+/ Smoother, easier to read gameplay than in previous iterations.\n+/ There is a story, and it is not that bad!\n+/ Good voice acting.\n+/ The Contracts mode is FUN.\n+/ Cool weapons feeling.\n\n\n-/ Dumbed down version of traditional Hitman games.\n-/ The gameplay is not varied enough to be truly fun.\n-/ Between two assasinations, there are a few linear  levels that feel like Splinter Cell with less moves, less options and a very flat design.\n-/ Instinct mode is frustrating and forced into gameplay.\n-/ The A.I sucks.\n-/ Scoring system is annoying. No, let me rephrase that. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.\n\n/Absolution is plain weird. I played all Hitman games before, and I don't understand it. It's not that bad. It's just not that good either. Everything contradicts itself into this game. You have a lot of options, but if you want to be efficient and sneaky, the game can feel really dull.\n\nAs I said before, this feels like the best way to play is to play a weird version of Splinter Cell with an assassination gimmick. You can still disguise in a variety of costumes, but it is broken by the instinct system. Enemies are suspicious of anyone having the same costume as theirs, and you need to replenish a jauge of 'instinct' that you will need to cross the way of any guard with the same costume without attracting uneeded attention.\n\nSo how does that translate?\n\nLet's say you enter a zone with a lot of guards patrolling (The 'Run for your life' level comes to mind.) and that you succeded in attracting a guard, stunning him and stealing his clothes. There are a lot of his pals patrolling the area, and, with your costume on, you decide to casally walk to the exit. But unfortunately for you, if you encounter one of your colleagues, he will become suspicious, forcing you to press Lctrl to avoid them by hiding your face, thus depleting instinct.\n\nAnd once it's empty, your costume is useless. Meaning that most costumes in Absolution are actually useless, because there a not enough variety in the NPCs you encounter to change costumes a lot, and that even if you could, taking down non target NPCs costs you points.\n\nWhat's the point then? The basic controls for 47 are fluid, with the addition of a cover system which I feel is not a bad idea at all. But they are not as developped as the controls of, say, Sam Fisher in the Splinter Cell story, which makes basic infiltration very flat. Yes, it's sandbox, yes you can just play as you wish, but with a scoring system as invasive as Absolution's (seriously, the score indicator takes like a tenth of the screen.) you always feel punished when you experiment stuff.\n\nThe assassinations are the high point of the game, but it's so weird that not every level consists of simply kill a target in an inventive way! I can understand it goes with the story of the game (47 is betrayed by its agency, this time it's personal, blah blah blah, girl to save, blah, blah, blah.), but this game is so empty of real  cool moments!\n\nIf you don't compare the contracts of previous Hitman games with the ones in Absolution, those are really nice. There are a lot of options, a lot of paths to said options, and the level design of those areas is really well done. It always feel fun to kill someone in a stupid accident, poisoning him, pushing him to his death, sniping him or just garroting him. But then again, a mission like the King of Chinatown, while being a nice throwback to the very first Hitman missions (Aaaah, the Hong Kong levels.), feels empty when compared to levels of Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nAnd maybe that's the problem with Absolution. Maybe I would be less unforgiving if it was not the black sheep of a glorious series of game which encouraged cautiousness, intelligence, and creativity. Absolution has a lot of arguably good points, but its gameplay sucks for old timers like me. There are a few additions I like, such as the Contracts mode which allows you to play missions with rules invented by other players, like killing a guard in a room full of his pals with a Samurai armor and your bare hands.\n\nIt is simply not enough. I can't recommand this game, and can only advise that you get Hitman Blood Money if you're searching for the ultimate sandbox assassin experience. Then again, maybe you're just searching for a light stealth/action game. I don't know. This game confuses me./","June 5, 2015","false","24.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The game begins with Agent 47 detailing his relationship with his handler Diana Burnwood whom he had trusted until she, without explanation, betrayed the International Contract Agency (ICA) by sabotaging their funding and database, using the subsequent confusion to vanish. After the ICA is reformed, 47 is tasked by his new handler, Benjamin Travis, a high level official within the ICA, to kill Diana for her betrayal and retrieve an important Agency asset named Victoria from her mansion in Chicago, Illinois. 47 sneaks into her mansion and shoots Diana. Rather than finishing her off, 47 comforts the dying Diana and asks her why she betrayed the ICA. Diana reveals everyone has their limits over the bad things they have done and she discovered hers after learning about Victoria, a teenage girl who is genetically-engineered to be an Assassin within the ICA. Not wishing to see Victoria suffer the same fate as 47, she betrayed the ICA and escape with her. As her final request, Diana ask 47 to protect Victoria, and he agrees to do so. Because 47 refuses to return Victoria to him, Travis brands 47 a traitor.\n\nNow this story revolves around Victoria, ICA and more other great story characters. It is certainly a very good story well done to. I enjoyed it.\n\nGame Play: The game play takes place in America e.g. The United States. Which is different that around the world like the old Hitman games. But I will try not to compare it to the old ones. Now we have the addition of the online feature called Contracts which you can compete against other players around the world doing contracts and even make your own to challenge your friends and others. Also the addition of this instinct feature. Which you can see through the walls and the enemies followed by using it to distract the enemies. Shame there is no in story weapon customization of the weapons and the load out choice to.\n\nControls: Controls are simple to learn as always even for the new player which is good.\n\nThe Graphics: Just amazing. Such an improvement. You can see it in the game and the cinematic's to. The detail on the weapons to and on Mr 47 even the npc's. I can not see a fault in it.\n\nMusic: It worked well with the game, it set the scenes up great even in the cinematic's to. I did not even want to turn it off which I did with the old games.\n\nBugs and Glitches: Well as with any new game these years there is always bugs and glitches. But there was only one or two. First would be crashing in loading sections and the other where the save file is unable to sync up. Other than that I could not come across any other. Many people have said of corrupt save files. I wounder if its connected to the failing to sync up.\n\nReply Value: There is certainly replay value in this game. Going through each difficulty level and there is the contracts side.\n\nOverall: Great story as always, Game play just gets better with additions of a new skill and environments in America. Bar the loss of the weapon load out set and story mode customization's of the weapons. Controls simple to learn and use. Graphics just amazing. Music in the game adds to the game suspense. As I said there is always bugs and glitches hopefully these will be sorted. So for this next great installment to the Hitman Series.

It cares not for the overly delicate, their minds rendered dull and flabby after years of being prodded through corridors blasting anything that breathes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirdavies/recommended/203140/","sirdavies","SirDavies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirdavies/","424 products in account","Hitman Absolution is a misguided attempt at getting the franchise to reach a wider audience. In AAA development, reaching a wider audience is a synonym for littering the game with systems that remove any semblance of challenge, a story where the character's personality is fundamentally changed to give way to a petty and meaningless revenge tale, and substituting what made past games great (big levels full of possibilities) into call of duty level design (small, linear corridors and rooms). Also shooting, lots of shooting.\n\nFrom about 3 missions in, your objective stops being "look at this area, find your target, figure out the best way to assassinate him" and becomes "here's a level full of guards that are looking for you, get to the other end of it".  When the highest difficulty involves little more than waiting behind cover for guards to finish their conversations and move out of your way, the most difficult thing is to keep playing the game. Add to that an arbitrary checkpoint system with no manual saves, and every time you make a mistake you'll be forced to hear the same conversations again. It's a diluted, dumbed down and intoxicated version of Hitman.\n\nIt's a shame, because there is some good stuff there. Some of the locations are varied and interesting, and the few levels that are open feel like they have a lot of potential. There are quite a lot of objects you can find scattered around and use to your advantage. The main story is profoundly stupid, but the little comments and conversations NPC's have are entertaining and they do give life to an otherwise soulless and janky Pac Man clone. I just wish they were all optional, not located between the player and the arbitrary red door that is their objective.","May 29, 2014","false","9.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/203140/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","This game is a very worthy addition to the Hitman series. I have to admit, I wasn’t particularly a Hitman fan. Blame my best friend. One day he lent me Codename 47, Silent Assassin and Contracts all in order to play in retail boxes. Back then I was merciless to any frustration and played every single game on the hardest difficulty. These days I play games on Normal. And this is one of those games where I’d recommend playing it on Normal for the first time.\n\nHitman is all about achieving “Linear Gameplay Perfection”. And that’s a lot harder than you may think. You have to know your environment. You need to know the timing of the characters paths. You need to know the various ways you can eliminate a single target discreetly.\n\nThis brings me to say what you can do, but don’t want to do. You can go on a massacre run. I tried this out in a courtroom map for the fun of it. But eerily it was horrifyingly realistic. You can hear people begging for their lives and stuff. And all I could think about was, “My gawd, this is like some American high school shootout simulator.” Unlike the previous Hitman games where it felt like you were a badass against bad guys and nobody could mess with you. Hitman: Absolution penalizes you with a scoring system. In effect this game literally forces you to play the right way unlike its predecessors.\n\nIgnoring the challenges, there is an XP system in place that unlocks skills as you progress. None of the older Hitman games did this. In fact I’m starting to feel like a lot of today’s game development companies are just chucking similar systems in for the heck of getting a player to play the game more. I’m not against this idea (because it hasn’t bothered me yet). But I also don’t endorse this idea. I’d rather have game developers focus on the real reasons why people return back to playing a game. Things like fun factor … etc. Not some progress bar that tells you how much you’ve done.\n\nHitman: Absolution is powered by the Glacier 2 game engine. This is a game engine that I would commend. It seems very sophisticated. A lot of the mechanics from the older Hitman games have been enhanced. Everything seems more precise and graphically illustrated, as opposed to just having a hunch.\n\nHitman games have a certain aesthetic that evokes a particular mood that is truly unique. Whilst Hitman: Contracts has my favorite introduction movie, Hitman: Absolution has by far one of the most classy, simplistic and quick switching main menu interfaces you will ever witness.\n\nI want to talk about the crowd which literally looks like hundreds of people on a single map. When I first spotted this in “Hitman: Blood Money” back in 2007, I was like, “This is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. How the ♥♥♥♥ did they do this?” Forward to 2013, the technology is still unbelievable. You can still bump into each individual or kill them one by one if that is your thing. Whilst this was the same for “Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days”, they made an improvement for Hitman: Absolution. Now you can hide in the crowd, with certain parts of the crowd being “thicker” to conceal your location. In other words all those people aren’t just a visual aesthetic anymore.\n\nI still like “Hitman: Blood Money” the best, but Hitman: Absolution is a definite for any fans or someone who hasn’t played any and is looking to get started. It takes about 20 hours to complete it properly on Normal and by that I mean always aiming to be a Silent Assassin. I think the game is an 11GB download but takes up 24GB of Hard Drive space. I’ll definitely be playing this again but on the hardest difficulty now that I know what the maps are like.","March 8, 2013","true","36.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Наконец-то его сделали внятным и видно что над ним много трудились. В игре много роликов, как перед заданием, так и внутри него. И чему вообще я обрадовался, это тому...ВНИМАНИЕ СПОЙЛЕР...что Диана осталась в живых. Значит, следующая часть с её участием станет интереснее. В частности она станет интереснее, если она будет координатором. Всё таки выполнять чьи-то приказы интересней.\n\nСам геймплей стал очень линейным, наверное процентов 60 игры точно линейны. И это не есть хорошо. Но если посмотреть с другой стороны, мы бы нее увидели такого сюжета в игре, если бы нам давали чистые уровни с убийствами, а не, например, задание со святыми, там просто невозможно сделать не линейно...\n\nМаскировка стала реалистичней. Персонажи на локации стали более внимательны к своим коллегам, и если тебя увидит, например, охранник внутреннего помещения особняка, в такой же одежде, он начнёт подозревать. В принчипе это нормально. Каждый из персонала знает друг друга в лицо, как ни как в одной усадьбе работают.Подозрение не идёт в тех случаях, если персонаж эксклюзивен для локации или между разными типами персонажей (сантехик - охранник и т.д.), тогда подозрения даже не будет.\n\nА вот теперь самое дикое. Если на всех уровнях сложности было маскировка нужна, то тут совершенно нет. потому что это "легенда". На этом уровне сложности использование маскировки сразу пропадает, т.к тебя противники палят за сотни метров и инстинкт тут не восстанавливается. Остаёться только что "укрывайся, перекатывайся", что не очень интересно. Можно только хорошо пройти, я повторюсь, используя эксклюзивную маскировку. Вот в суде переодеться в судью и всё, дело сделано. так что, я лично предпочитаю играть максимум на высоком.\n\nМного оружия убийств. Например, нету мины или с4? без проблем, можно взять канистру и поставить её в нужное место. один вы стрел и ваша будет страдать) Конечно, с4 мощнее, но лучше же чем ничего...\nЕщё можно разлить бензин, выкрутив пистолет колонки и разлив бензин по земле.

You move through non-linear levels taking out targets however you want, and there are bonuses for completing the level multiple times, killing your foes however you want.  Want to run in guns blazing and kill everyone? You can do that. Want to make your kill look like an accident? You can do that too. Each level has various ways to approach each and every kill, and they are all vastly different. Some require high skill, some do not. The game looks great with the Glacier 2 engine, the story is quite easy to understand even if you have never played a Hitman game before, but is still detailed enough to add a few twists and turns, and the amount of weapons you have throughout the game is vast. Completionists will be at home with this game; it has tons of replay value and the Contracts mode adds to that. The game has a couple of flaws though. Why is everyone suspicious of you when you wear the same disguise as them? They surely would not know every single person in the area who had that occupation. The game can be annoying at times, especially the final part of the final level where the enemies spot you in an instant.

Third person shooters and even “stealth” games now offer a stronger emphasis on speed and multiplayer combat. IO Interactive may have had a tough time this generation experimenting with new intellectual properties, but surely they know what they’re doing with their biggest franchise. Can the ultimate assassin bounce back into the game, or has he fallen from grace?\nMechanically speaking, this is very much a Hitman game with a number tweaks to the overall mission structure. You’ll still be strangling guys with fiber wire, locking in chokes and pulling out 47’s trademark Silverballers when things get hairy, but it’s all presented in a more fashionable manner. The camera plays a slight role in this as the closer over the shoulder perspective works well with the more personal tale, along with takedowns and slow motion kills adding to the overall cinematic nature.\nUnlike past games, though, this isn’t just the agency pumping out mission after mission. With Agent 47 going rogue, he has his own agenda to attend to, and at the moment it’s all about rescuing and protecting a mysterious young girl. Because of this, Agent 47 won’t be dropped into random locations around the world; he’ll stick to the United States of America and follow a linear storyline with minor branching options that can change dialogue in set areas. Don’t be fooled, though; while the story is told in a linear manner, each location is its own sandbox in which players can sift through. There are a wide variety of paths to take and an abundance of clothing to steal in the incredibly meaty world. It’s all about carefully stalking a target and finding the best time to strike without being seen, creating a sense of tension that’s both entertaining and nerve-racking.\nThere are twenty missions in all and they can range from literally less than a minute to hours long depending what kind of play style is used. Taking the stealth route, which is how it was meant to be played in the first place, offers a variety of ways to approach a situation, creating a good sense of replayability. Pulling out the Silverballers and go gung-ho is certainly an option, but that’ll obviously attract unnecessary attention and put guards on alert. There’s no one way to kill someone as IO Interactive have given players an array of creative ways to dispose of their targets and a number of alternate areas that most will likely miss on their first playthrough.\nA new feature that is more than welcome to the Hitman formula is instinct. People in this world seem incredibly suspicious as no longer will walking past someone of the same trait, such as a criminal or police officer, allow safe passage. It’s an exceptional new stealth mechanic that allows Agent 47 to blend into the world around him a little more reasonably, but there are some issues with it. It makes sense that disguising yourself within a small group of people wouldn’t be realistic, but when fifty police officers are on scene, blending in as a cop shouldn’t be an issue. Enemies will also start to become suspicious even if your back is turned to them and they’re thirty feet away.\nSimilar to past games, Hitman grades how well a mission is accomplished and hands out rewards accordingly. Instead of receiving cash to upgrade weapons, which is instead done through the online Contracts mode, Agent 47 is given a numeric score which, if high enough, will give him upgraded abilities such as moving faster and blending into crowds better.\nThe Hitman franchise is all about trial and error and becoming the best assassin possible. Past games have had the ability to save anywhere during a mission and revert back to it whenever needed, allowing multiple approaches to different scenarios without having to go too far back. Unfortunately, Hitman: Absolution strips away the feature adds a number of checkpoints that are both automatically and manually obtained.They are generally well placed, but the biggest issue is that instead of saving everything that’s happened, it just resets the entire world from that spot.\nWhile the game has changed how the franchise will move forward, the online mode titled Contracts will bring fans back to the classic style of play. Instead of going with the flow of the main storyline, players will be able to set hits on whoever they please during a mission, allowing others around the world to try and best them and rack up cash for upgrades in the process. It’s an ambitious online multiplayer mode that gives gamers the freedom to play a traditional Hitman experience, simply going from kill to kill.\nIt’s also notable that Hitman: Absolution looks absolutely gorgeous. Having a powerful, but not top of the line rig, I was able to max everything out and still stay between thirty and sixty frames-per-second at all time. The number of bodies that IO Interactive is able to put on screen is overwhelming, making the crowd blending mechanics believable.\nWhile still very much a traditional stealth game, Hitman: Absolution has changed the series for the best in offering cinematic quality combat. It has a stronger focus on telling a coherent story while keeping a slow methodical pace. With a terrific single player campaign and a compelling online multiplayer component, it’s safe to say that whether or not you were a fan of the series before, you will be now. Even with its imperfections, Hitman: Absolution is a magnificent achievement that goes well beyond expectations and will lead future stealth action titles into a better tomorrow.","April 2, 2014","true","93.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Depending on the weather, one could opt to be professional and keep things quiet or go on a Sterling Archer-esque rampage.\n\nAbsolution, however, decides to take that agency away and puts you in the uncomfortably tighter suit of a restrictive narrative, much like your mother did when you were flower boy at your Uncle Gerald's wedding. Unfortunately, the aforementioned narrative is done in disappointingly poor taste, and Absolution's linear nature does not lend itself well to multiple replays.\n\nFilled with ghoulish, hideous caricatures which are supposed to pass some semblance of human beings, Absolution catapults you into the grungy abyss of a metaphorical (and at one point literal) sex dungeon.\n\nIt remains a competent stealth-action game and there's certainly some fun to be had if you're truly, desperately bored...but try as you might, you can't wash the smell of grindhouse out long after you've left.","April 15, 2015","false","30.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/recommended/203140/","skorch82","Bl0rch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skorch82/","365 products in account","I've been a long-time fan of this series since the first installment by Eidos, Hitman: Codename 47. It's gotten a lot better with each subsequent installment, and this is no exception.\n\nThis game defines what it means to use stealth. Much like Splinter Cell, or Thief, this game rewards you for your patience, and puts it to the test with each stage. The game isn't particularly long either, with each mission area being fairly short, with minimal objectives to complete, but it's the time it takes to wait for that guard to finish his route, or the two civilians holding a conversation to move along that makes the game long and enjoyable.\n\nThe game's basic plot is you're given a mission to eliminate an Agency rat and through the act of actually getting to your target, you learn there's something bigger at play, and you defy your commanding officer, setting a string of events in motion that will put your will to the test.\nYou're thrown into the game with a minimalistic prologue/tutorial that tells you the basics of sneaking around and causing distractions, killing, subduing, hiding bodies, etc... and then before the mission is over, you're introduced to the rating system. A system that awards points for positive actions (objectives, hiding bodies, evidence, silent kills, etc...) and penalizes you for naughty actions (getting spotted, killing/pacifying non targets, killing civilians, etc...). The goal is to maximize your score on each mission by completing challenges and completing your objectives in a multitude of (creative) ways. The best rating you can get on a mission is Silent Assassin, whereby you complete all your objectives only killing your intended target(s), and not getting spotted. This is the most difficult to pull off, but it makes it all that much more fun. The multiple challenges that you can complete are also presented in such a way that it requires multiple passes through a mission before you can claim them all (many are mutually exclusive), so the incentive is to keep thinking of new ways to win. The one downside to this system though, is that when you complete a challenge, it stays for good, so reloading a checkpoint is enough to give you the credit to complete the other challenges without a full playthrough.\n\nThe missions are tough and well scripted. The dialog and the musical score is top notch, though there are some lines that are pretty corny. The character cast is great and it can be sometimes hard to follow who's who, but they are all likeable (or dispicable). The game offers a wide spectrum of difficulty, whereby the harder you go, the tougher (and more plentiful) the enemies get, the more aware they are, and you get to use less of your "instinct", a skill that allows you to see interactive objects and enemy trails, as well as the ability to blend in using a disguise. The hardest difficulty is the toughest enemies, highly reactive, and no interface. The only other game I've seen that done with is Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (another great game). Good luck 47!\n\nIt also sports a contract mode, which is sort of like on-line competition where you complete user-created contract missions for money to increase your stats. It's a pretty slick system.\n\nCheck this game out, you won't be disappointed.","February 24, 2015","true","19.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Had they created a new IP with an interesting world and story, this game might have been great. It's not a bad game in it of itself, but it is a bad Hitman game. The enviornments are small and limiting. You aren't even able to assissinate many of your targets--instead the game launches a cutscene where 47 either screws up the hit (WHAT!!?) or you get a cutscene where 47 barely is able to take out the target. Very dissapointing. Even worse are the levels. There's no trips to castles in Japan or various other interesting locales; no, we're stuck running around boring ♥♥♥ middle America. Ugh, just remebering the game gets me going. At least it looks really pretty, if you can ignore the ridiculous amounts of bloom that is. Anyway, do yourself a favor and get Blood Money instead.

The game where the only problem with the game is my skill.\nHitman Absolution in my opinion an amazing game, graphic wise and gameplay wise.\n\n– Storyline 8/10\nAs much a fan as I am of the game, the storymode could have been worked on just a little more! I found it confusing to what’s happening from time to time. Sometimes I didn’t even know if there was a story mode. The story mode starts with you assassinated Diana. Your assignment is to kill Diana and bring Victoria a teenage girl who you find out later is quite special. The game becomes more interesting when you decide to hide Victoria in a nearby church therefore disobeying the Agency’s order.\n\n– Controls 7/10\nControls of the game weren’t too bad, but were a bit wonky at times. I didn’t particularly like the idea of QTE’s for every close combat battle you get into though.\n\n– A.I. 8/10\nThe A.I. was just spot on, untill they started hiding behind walls and shooting through them. I also had problems with the fact that everyone knows EVERYONE, I was no more special then the next guy, but apparently I stand out in a crowd. Also sometimes the A.I. somehow know where you are when trying to throw an item to distract them.\n\n– Graphics 10/10\nI honestly can’t complain about the graphics, I didn’t find any bugs or glitches in the particles around me. I also didn’t notice texture poping or not rendering. There are plenty of options for the resolution of the game for those who own a less powerful computer.\n\n– Options 10/10\nThe options menu in a lot of games is quite poorly done, but in Hitman Absolution it was executed perfectly. You can change every control, the difficulty of the game, graphics and more.\n\n– Gameplay 10/10\nObviously the main part of the game, executed perfectly. Hitman Absolution has 2 gamemodes to choose from – Storymode & Contracts. The story mode explains itself. The contracts can add a few more hours after finishing story mode. In the Contracts mode you compete against friends and online players to who can be the best assassin. Little side note- If you fail any level in storymode or contracts it has a really quick and easy replayabilty. The Chaoters are split into multiple levels, which alows the levels to be designed better and makes it easier to replay if necessary. One of my most beloved aspects of the game is – you can finish a level or choose a path in more than 1 ways. Often you will be given the choice to garote a victim or smash his head in with a vase you just picked up a minute ago.\n\n– Final Verdict 8/10\nThe game in my opinion is amazing. I have nothing to add. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it.","September 26, 2014","true","34.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Firm coolness, as well as absolute indifference to someone's destinies, was considered twelve years inseparable from the legendary murderer. Armor for protection against wordly passions. And so: the armor burst. Eidos Interactive assumed a role of the fairy and intended to turn bald wooden Pinocchio into the real boy, from a flesh and blood. Object, as usual, didn't ask. Suspicious speeches from lips of Danes flew for a long time. About terrible, chilling things — a plot, the drama. Why the terrible? Yes because there is nothing more dangerously for a free gameplay, than the strong scenario. It as the power vertical and decentralization — together don't get on. When it is necessary to throw out the hero in a huge terrarium and to bellow "Look for! ", the plot strong squeezes his hand and conducts on attractions. Generally, fight of two elements. And this fight in Hitman: Absolution is traced from beginning to end. The principles of game remained are invariable. There is a big fellow in expensive suit, and there is a person who was late in this world. He doesn't want to die therefore protects itself with protection, police or simply hangs about in crowded places. Fans to do some shooting can forget about a genre a stealth and corpses to pave the road to the purpose. Adherents of silent passing, as usual, get in an inner sanctum by means of masking — that counter which does Hitman special.

Why do so many people dislike this Hitman instalment? I know it isn't Blood Money or Contracts but how could anyone say that this game isn't fun? It's really fun and to me, it's a must have in your Steam library. This is one of the most underrated games I've seen in a very long time. It seems to me that whatever Square Enix release is just pure gold, I've never ever played an awful Square Enix game and I'm hoping that I never will.\n\nFor everyone that keeps on going on about Blood Money, please, stop. I know it was a great game, and I know that this is nothing compared to it. But that does not make this game terrible.\n\nThe game is nice and short. Why is it nice? I don't particularly know, I just like short games sometimes rather than games that just drag on and on. Whilst I'd like a bit more replay value, other than that, the game is fantastic! Stealth mechanics are great, especially the point shooting. Activating distractions like radios and such is awesome. I especially love attacking people's necks from behind with a wire and subdueing them. If you love stealth and assassination, then definitely buy this game.","April 11, 2015","true","19.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The tone of the game is slightly different this time, with 47 being on the run from his agency, though the plot isn't particularly interesting or engaging. What it does do is serve as a device to push Agent 47 to some great locations to ply his craft and sneaking through a level to eliminate a target is both familiar and wonderfully realised.\n\nThe objectives through each level are hardly revolutionary; get to target, kill target, escape. The pleasure is in the execution, with several different methods of accomplishing each objective. From a mysterious accident, to a poisoned drink, the signature garrotte and more, 47 has a vast array of lethal options at his disposal. You could even go in all guns blazing of you want, though I wouldn't recommend it; the shooting mechanics leave much to be desired; stealth is the focus here.\n\nThere are various methods of infiltration, many of which depend on the level. The most obvious options are either via the traditional stealth method, or by using disguises. Unfortunately both of these mechanics leave much to be desired. The stealth option has far too few actions available and consists of being able to crouch behind cover, move on ledges and hide bodies. Similarly, the disguise system is virtually useless as people wearing the same uniform can see through it, rendering the whole thing pointless in most settings.\n\nThe layout makes up for things a little and I ended up ignoring the disguises for the most part, preferring to sneak through the excellently set out areas. The level designs are fantastic, from bustling stations to the arid south.  Is South Dakota really like that? I thought it was quite lush. Also, I know it’s not southern – it’s more the stereotype really.  I was genuinely impressed with just how atmospheric the various setting were, even if the strip-club that now seems mandatory in “mature” games felt gratuitous and contrived. I also loved the dry humour present throughout the game. It’s subtle, only really there if you look for it, but I found it hilarious.\n\nThe new engine really shines in-game and it looks truly impressive at every step. Areas look simply stunning with excellent lighting, textures and attention to detail. The Chinatown level is particularly impressive, with a staggering amount of NPCs present, each moving independently, that really gives a feeling of stalking your prey through a busy city.\n\n\nI’ve noticed that truly great stealth games are incredibly rare these days, and I can’t remember the last game that actually demanded patience, thought and exploration. Absolution most certainly has the latter under its belt and whilst it wouldn’t be unfair to say that my recommendation is partly based on the lack of competition, it’s still highly enjoyable and I’d definitely recommend it.\n\nFinal Score:\n\n7/10\n\nIt’s not going to be a classic, but it’s good enough for stealth fans.","October 2, 2014","true","23.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Some of the missions were alright, but a lot of them were Splinter Cell sneakin' and forced you to shoot your target in the face. All of the missions where you could take a "sandbox" approach were super tiny save for the Chinatown ones, even then there were still only one or two actually viable options for the whole mission.\nAll they really needed to do was take the Blood Money gameplay and put it in the new engine with new graphics, maybe add some more difficulty options, but apparently that's too hard so they decided to add instinct and a godawful disguise system.\n\nI am skeptical but hopeful that the new one is going back to the core gameplay (although the enforcer mechanics looks kind of obnoxious).\n\nI find it laughable that it was already half of the original price only a year after it was released. Although it's not as bad as it could have been, it's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They honestly had the basic formula perfected with Blood Money but they chose to do something completely different that didn't work quite as well as expected.

So that's a bit of a game breaker.\n\nIn overall i give the game 8/10 because of the good game if you don't look at the other great games in the franchise, but when you put the game togheter with the franchise then you will see some dark spots on it... in figure of speech\n\nIf you are interested in a good game where you have to patient some times but where you can put some decent hours in to enjoy (like i did myself) then this is for you.\nIf you are a long-run hitman fan then you might not like this game.. (altough there's no reason for it, the game is good)\n\nThanks you for reading.","January 9, 2015","true","62.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Definitely not. Part of what made the older Hitman games so fun was the feeling that YOU were the one coming up with all these methods of killing, thus having a feeling of accomplishment. In this game, all the methods are shown for you in a way that makes them all seem scripted.\n\nDisguising is pretty much useless since it only works provided you have sufficient 'influence', and it drains so quickly you'll just not even want to bother.\n\nLast thing I dislike very much in most games is this fad of giving the player x-ray vision. How can something be at the same time regarded a legitamite element of singleplayer, but hacking in multiplayer? You can try not using it but you always know it's there.\n\nAll that aside, if you aren't a long time Hitman fan, you will most probably have fun.

The core mechanics of the game focus around sneaking and movement, features like bullet time are fun but i found myself not using them very often. Enemy AI is great, the guards wandering around are not complete morons and actually communciate with each other.\nThe graphics are stunning, this game really shows how powerfull the Glacier 2 engine is. The cutscene's are cinematic and blend in with the overall look of the game.\nThere's not too much to the story and to me it felt like the story was driving you towards the setpecies that were intended to be in the game.

The last great game in the series was Blood Money, which combined an excellent story with great gameplay, that connected a series of globe trotting assassinations, ultimately culminating in what could have been a fond farewell to the character. However for some reason the developers decided to make Absolution an average third person shooter, and remove the very elements that made the series stand out. And the saddest thing of all, is that the paid/preorder demo they released: The "Sniper Challenge", was more of a Hitman game, than Absolution will ever be.","December 27, 2013","false","6.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And for the first few seconds I was overwhelmed. It look good, the story didn't seem particulary well but interesting enough.\n\nAnd then it all went down...\nLets go to the positives first:\n- Beatiful! You have to give them credit for that\n- Contracts seemed like a good idea\n- Shooting mechanics are quite good, covering works well\n- Some nice ways to eliminate your targets\n- Kinda good stealth game\n- Very good level design (visually)\n\nCONS:\n- An absolutely broken checkpoint system. It doesn't even save who you killed. Everything came back to live afterwards. Everything you tried to buid up to vanished.\n- Disguise system is broken. Others have mentioned it. Hide in plain sight is only possible if the enemies are far away and you really really hurry up. Everyone wearing the same disguise can spot you. Like hundreds of cops would know each other on a personal level if they are hunting for a suspect. This was the point that killed it for me... Instead of thinking of clever ways of how to acquire a disguise that will get you through the next section they are utterly useless, you still have to hunker down in cover... Wait for painfully long periods of time until some NPC has finished the dialog to continue. Because, well, you wear the same clothes as him and the checkpoint is placed when they start talking, not when they are finished.\nWonderful!\nInstinct lets you put your hand in front of your face for a short period of time because well... f***, thats why. Doesn't make any sense.\n- Very restricted areas. There are magic doors that you close behind you and no one will come through the door - ever. The level is divided in independent sections that share nothing between them.\n- The story gets really dumb and embarassing. They wanted to center it around our protagonist. And they could have made so much good with it, instead it turns quite obnoxious, weird and unbelievable...\n- Killing in cut scenes. You might have heard that. It doesn't happen often, but it is odd enough that they even think about that. Worse than the killing in cut scene is that the enemy is being killed IN FRONT OF DOZENDS OF BYSTANDERS which is exactly what Hitman is NOT about. Ridiculous\n\nBottom line is:\nIf you expect a hitman like game, don't get this, not on sale, not ever. You are most likely going to be severly dissapointed. It is bad as a hitman game, they stripped it of almost everything that made it unique and interesting and not only dumbed down the gameplay to make it more accessible, but dumbed down the gameplay for no apparent reason because it actually makes it LESS accessible (other than perhaps lazyness when it comes to programming (I've been there)).\n\nIf you are looking for a stealth game where you can calmy time your next moves and know nothing about hitman, or hated the previous games, this might be a pleasant surprise for you.\nThen you should get it. It's a catch for 5€..\n\n\nI get that things need to change to keep a series interesting. And the previous games had their flaws. But changing all the central gameplay elements is not the way to go.\nIf it didn't say "Hitman" on the box, I might recommend it for being an 'okay' stealth game... But this is no Hitman, don't be fooled by it's looks. It's by far the worst Hitman game ever made.\n\nSummary:\nHitman fans - Stay away\nStealth game fans - Give it a go. When it's on sale","December 27, 2013","false","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was up to you, and it had never been done before. The Hitman Franchise was once a blaring success, and many games were sold.\nHowever...As what happens with most developpers who see dollar signs(And you can't blame them, they're only human...Greed comes naturally to us once we taste immeasurable success...We want more). They got off the trails, gave up their outside-the-box thinking strategy, and started to give up on what made Hitman special, and slowly turned it into a shooter. Blood Money was on the verge, with some few points that made it worth buying, but Hitman:Absolution marks the fall of once beautiful franchise.\nThe game.Is.Complete.and utter.TRASH!\n\nTHe once all important Stealth design has been pretty much ignored...Putting on a disguise doesn't really help you with remaining undetected much, as you are fully dependant on your 'Instincts' which is pretty much nothing more than a bar which is represented in a similar fashion to Fantasy games' Mana Pool. It fills when you complete objectives or make tactically accurate moves, and gets drained when you use it...And it is 110% required to use it to slip past guards...Even with a disguise on! I actually found that in more cases than not, it was more beneficial to simply NOT take a disguise, and stay in your suit and tie as long as possible, cause for some reason, guards found a guy in a Mechanic's outfit, outside a mechanic's shop, suspicious enough to shoot at. More so, than a bald ominous guy in a black suit, crouching behind a car...Completely normal Saturday wierdness, right guys?\n\nThe 'Going in loud' is also heavily recommended, and it is obvious in just how many tools you're given to kill lots and lots of people...Such as Point Shooting...Use up a chunk of Instinct per target, a total of 4, which you mark, and then hit the Execute key. 47 stands up, and instantly, without any effort, shoots all 4 enemies.\nFurthermore...In each mission you have the oppertunity to 'discover' new weapons...Such as revolvers, uzi's m4's, sniper rifles, shotguns, baseballbats, crowbars, crossbows etc. etc. lots of full automatic weapons to really paint an entire map read in blood. Now all this would be cool...If it actually benefitted you...Because for some strange reason, the developpers decided to provide all of these ways to kill people, and all of these cool full automatic weapons to collect, and KEEP THE SILENT ASSASSIN FAVORING SCOREBOARD!...\nThis means that you will score 'more' points if you IGNORE all of these cool new killing methods/weapons, and go with old school Hitman style gameplay, killing as few people as possible except the target, and getting out undetected, most of the time doing so without having fired a single shot...But if you decide to use these amazing modern-hitman bonus kill methods, you actually LOSE points, and it is completely impossible to go into a Hitman Absolution game, and complete a mission by shooting everything, and getting out with a + sided score count...It will ALWAYS, ALWAYS result in a NEGATIVE scoring if you go in loud...So you are in fact punished for using these new features in Absolution.\n\nThe developpers had NO IDEA where they wanted to go with this game...They finally got impatient, took a huge overdose of Fokitol, and released the game with an absolutely BROKEN stealth system, a COMPLETELY unfair scoring system, and a COMPLETELY POINTLESS new set of killing styles that you get PUNISHED for using...\n\nNOT recommended. Jesus Christ guys, let the Hitman franchise die with its dignity intact, stop trying to squeeze the last little bit of green out of its husked corpse already.","March 2, 2014","false","10.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Every element of the game has been designed specifically to prevent you, the player, from ever having to fire a neuron in thought. No expense has been spared. Every plot element is explained. At great length. Slowly. By terrible voice actors. And just in case you're too thick to figure out that you're meant to be emotionally involved or something, every scene of the game is accompanied by an orchestral soundtrack so overwrought and pervasive it's like being dry-humped by John Williams on meth shouting "THIS SCENE IS SAD YOU CRY NOW OGOD RUB MY NIPPLES PLZ".\n\nYou bumble through admittedly very pretty environments waiting for the prompt that lets you know you're allowed to interact with item X, person Y, or container Z, as an omniscient voiceover tells you what you're meant to be doing.

Let me start off by giving the obvious acknowledgement - yes, it is predictably sexist - the strip clubs, the streetwalkers , the PVC-clad, sexy criminal nun gang (yes, I'm not making it up), the old, abhorrent baddies with their 20 something year old hussies dressed in ridiculously revealing outfits, and so on. I'm not going to harp on about it. It's expected.  So now the boring sh*t is out of the way, I can review the game for its quality as a single player game.\n\nThe storyline is an extremely gripping, albeit predictable, action-fuelled chase to save a girl (I know, I know) called Victoria, who some baddies have taken for reasons you'll find out during the game. It's a part stealth, part action game, and I really appreciated the fact that you can choose how to go about achieving your objective in the way you want; be it stealth, going in all guns blazing, or setting traps to distract, kill and remove evidence. The controls are a bit fiddly at first, for example, shooting involves using all your mouse buttons, but you can get used to them quite quickly.\n\nThe tasks are varied and fun, and some of them made me genuinely laugh out loud (setting a trap so a guy got electrocuted when he urinated on a live wire is one that springs to mind). Agent 47 is a stereotypical badass - chisel jawed, handy with weapons and has an icy stare - but I couldn't help but like him. He was a man of few words, usually delivered just before he shot someboy between the eyes.\n\nThe graphics are top notch and some of the scenery is spectacular. The cutscenes are exciting and immersive and using disguises to go into certain areas or bypass guards was particularly fun (did anybody else dress like a scarecrow, or was that just me?) I liked the fact that you had to scout out a building or room and look for ways to carry out your objective, and it wasn't just clear cut. I liked that this game was sometimes really difficult (and I actually ragequit a few times), rather than being linear and obvious. It was well worth the £3  I paid for it during the sales, and I'd absolutely recommend it, particularly if you enjoy stealth games. If you can overlook the usually unecessary titillation in place for the boys, and the occasional cringeworthy scene, this game is really worth a playthrough or two.","August 31, 2014","true","13.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/missioncontroldoyoureadme/recommended/203140/","missioncontroldoyoureadme","Medusa Head","http://steamcommunity.com/id/missioncontroldoyoureadme/","178 products in account","I was considering giving this game a good review because many aspects of this game are good. Music, graphics and voice acting are all there. It has some of the best scripted sequences that I've rarely seen in a game and features a variety of creative ways to kill your target. But where this game screws up big time is in it's level design and specific aspects of its game mechanics.\n\nFor the purposes of this review I'd like to like to look at two other stealth franchises which are Batman Arkham and Metal Gear Solid.\n\nThe biggest issue in the game is the level design. The first few missions have pretty decent level design. The AI purposefully has weak points that allow you to slip by undetected. You may find certain guards go into a secluded area allowing you to take them out to progress. Challenging but designed in a way which allows the player to slip by if they use caution. I'd say when you get to about the Dexter Industries section of the game all of that goes out of the window.\n\nWhen you get to the last 2/3rds of the game the level design becomes ridiculous. I've played through hard and purist modes having done a no kill alerts run and let me tell you, unless you use obscure gimmicks there's no way you're beating this game without any alerts. In certain areas there's that many guards all facing each other all the time with visibility on every area that the player needs to go that it makes it absolutly impossible for the player to go stealthy without cheesing the game.\n\nIf you look at mgs 1, 2 and 3, even on the highest difficulty in every level the player is given the possibility and abilities to be stealthy and clean. The guards always have certain patterns designed for the player to take advantage of. While still being extremely challenging if you're good you can always remain undetected. In Hitman Absolution it doesn't matter how good you are, unless you resort to specific gimmicks and borderline exploits in many areas, you aren't getting through without being spotted. In the start of many of the levels such as before the fighting match, there are guards that just stand there having a long conversation, forcing the player to sit there impatiently listening each time you try the level. It just interupts the gameplay and it's extremely boring and frustrating.\n\nWhat are these gimmicks that I refer to? Well in Hitman Absolution you have two ways to deal with guards cleanly, going behind guards and strangling them (which makes all nearby guards look in your direction) and throwing objects to make a guard check it. In many of the later levels the only way to progress is to keep throwing the same object against the wall, strangling the guard that comes to check it over and over until the way is finally clear. You can either do that or use a disguise to just walk past all the enemies without bothering, but that burns all your instinct meter so don't expect to be able to use it all the time. Certain events like the fight with sanchez become ridiculous because the guy with the disguise you need just stands in a spot with about 12 guards all staring at him and doesn't move. So again you have to resort to throwing wrenches at the wall to lure everyone out which takes absolutely ages. It's tedious and boring, but it's the only option for stealthy players.\n\nBatman Arkham, which while being a considerably easier and less challenging game had what Hitman needed badly. A wide variety of non lethal takedowns to deal with enemies. When you're playing hitman, you have to do the same choking animation every single time while tapping X repeatedly. It's depressing. Every now and then you get an animation of 47 hitting someone against a wall but in the end you're doing the exact same takedown over and over again. Playing non lethally in Hitman is the most depressing aspect of the game, but you're punished for killing guards which means the player is constantly trying to play in a boring way. Think of all the different takedowns in batman, like hanging off a ledge and strangling people with your feet, or dropping ontop of them from a great height, or even jumping people out of a vent. Only having the option of choking people out makes the game extremely tedious but you have to do it throughout the entire game.\n\nI cannot stress this enough that the vast majority of this game is throwing wrenches at the wall and waiting for guards to come and check the sound. This is why I found the majority of the game depressing to play and had to give it a bad review. If they had spent more time working on the AI patrols the player wouldn't be forced to constantly use gimmicks to get through the missions. I got through the later missions using an obscure trick where you use your silenced pistol to alert the enemy then run through them because it's the only time you can get through certain guards without killing them. I'm all for challenge, but when it reaches the point where the player is forced to use exploits to progress, it kills the whole point of the game being a challenge. The levels which aren't like this are actually a lot of fun and if the game didn't have such bad level design I'd be giving it a good review right now.\n\nAnother thing which is really annoying is the scoring system. You get scored on things such as how many times you were spotted, how many people you killed, did you hide the body.., etc. Yet on certain missions you're forced to kill people and on others there's actually no areas to hide bodies. The scoring system is always telling you you're playing the game wrong, but you don't have a choice because of how badly designed most of the levels are.\n\nIn summary the things which killed the game for me: Gameplay interuptions, poorly designed levels, lack of non lethal options, the scoring system constantly criticising you and gimmicky gameplay. I've beaten the game twice and it was mostly not an enjoyable experience. Sometimes it's fun, but most of the time it's frustrating, but not in a good way. I'd say it's worthwhile if you're a Hitman fan since it has some great moments, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone else.  The vast majority of the game is just throwing a wrench and then pressing X repeatedly to strangle a guy out. Extremely boring compared to other stealth games.\n\nThis could have been a great game.","March 14","false","52.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

I like it so much, that I even prepurchase this game. Initially I was really disappointed. Previous games were made from relatively standalone missions, with background plot. Now there is strong plot connecting all levels. This has many consequences. You cannot choose your gear. Some missions are just linear corridors. There are no contracts. Big disadvantage is missing save function. Yes, there are checkpoints, but they are scarce and repetition of some parts was so frustrating, that sometimes I rather finish the assignment by killing everyone.\n\nSo I was pretty upset, I spent more than 30 euro on game, which I didn't enjoy. Then I realized how to play it. It is no longer pure stealth game. For me, it is more like stealth game with action phases and it works. In linear parts works more aggressive style, while in big open spaces silent assassin style is my choice. Love it. Combat with guns (you can even use human shields) and overall cover system are great. Controls are excellent. "Stealth" missions are nicely designed and joy to play. Maps were removed and replaced with instinct. I still miss them, but instinct is decent and makes sense.\n\nNot a perfect game, but still recommended.","December 23, 2013","true","22.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Just to be sure I wasn't missing something. I did this on PS3.Then a friend of mine decided: "hey you should stream this game. Here's a key for the pc version". And I never streamed it. Why? It sucks on so many levels, but especially in two areas.\n\n-First:\nIn terms of mechanics, the game is not well designed at all. And I'm not talking about the linearity of the level-design, though that is a big step back compared to the perfect Blood Money (perfect on that point at least). No, the main idea is to resolve an incoherence of the series (the fact that when dressed as a cop, no cop will tell that you look suspicious) by creating this 47 "sense". It is a bad bad bad decision. In theory, well balanced and polished, this would be an ok solution to a "non"-problem. But in execution, this gauge means that you can't be dressed as the type of character that is the most seen in the level, because you'll be unmasked in seconds by these guys, except if you use that sense gauge that emptied itself way too quickly. In lower difficulty settings it can work okay, but when in pro mode, some missions are just stupidly difficult to perform a "silent assassin" rank. Except if you play the game like a Conviction ripoff. That means that, in a HITMAN game, you spend 80% of your time crouching behind counters, taking down people that are not relevant to your objectives...when you should be proudly crossing entire rooms just walking, dressed as a clown, a priest or a bodyguard. The essence of Hitman is to be hidden in plain sight, and that mechanic f-ed it up.\nThe worst thing is: it is not even a good Conviction ripoff. The game doesn't know how to balance this modern predator stealth kind of gameplay, that we all played from Arkham Asylum to Human Revolution with the Hitman type of infiltration. And that gives us a level-design and NPC placement that satisfes no ends.\n\n-Second:\n...and foremost should I say, Absolution is incredibly vulgar and idiotic. And I know, being a fan of this series since the second one, that there is some poor taste jokes in previous episodes. But overall, I think the tone of it all, the focus on the themes rather than the characters, and the fact that the story never really was a focus of the game, merely a way to introduce nice game-design ideas (that be cool to make a hit on a classy boat! let's find some story about drug dealers on the Mississippi river!) gave opportunities to take it as a juvenile way to contextualise the gameplay, and it kept intact the elegant nature of the main character. Absolution can't stop putting "story" in the game. The cutscenes are longer, the game is more focused on that, rather than giving the player a good challenge, and by god why is there so much bad language in this game, and why all the childish sex elements? The Saints are the farther the series as ever been from good taste or even a bit of maturity. That doesn't make the game cool, or mature. It just looks like either an idiot who wants to tell a story with edgy characters, or a kid who wants to look like a bad*ss. Plus, I swear, the story makes no sense, and from beginning to end, you can pinpoint a major incoherence in each cutscene.\n\n\nTL;DR: The game is poorly game-designed and doesn't know if it wants to be a predator-stealth game, like the Arkham series or Conviction (that were previously released) of if it wants to kinda stick to the Hitman formula. It satisfies non of these two game-designs and tries to resolve an incoherence by creating even more incohenrences. Plus the game talks to you like if you were a complete idiot and use bad language in place of good writting to tell a poorly put together story.\n\nAVOID. Play Contracts, Blood Money or the 2016's Hitman for the real deal. This one is just pretty looking and insults your intelligence.","May 8","false","0.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","2"

Linear levels, mark 'n' execute, press X to kill, cover system, the list goes on. Even in purist mode the game feels like it was supposed to be something else, something generic, a complete after thought. The idea for the story is incredibly flimsy and looks like it was shoe-horned into the Hitman canon after Blood Money (which is where the Hitman canon reaches its definitive end) just so Square Enix could use IO to make a quick buck by slapping the Hitman name on a not Hitman game.\n\n- QTEs absolutely everywhere, even in take-downs.\n\n- QTE hand to hand combat. DUMB.\n\n- Checkpoints instead of save files. Completely stupid idea. It's like they don't trust you to be able to save your own damn game properly.\n\n- Steve Blum voice acting.\n\n- Mark and execute. Sucks all the fun out of trying to clear a room of hostiles and allows people to half-a$$ their way through "tougher" areas. (Not that you would ever need to use mark and execute if you were playing Hitman properly).\n\n- The story Dianas motives for double crossing The Agency are completely illogical and frankly stupid. It serves no good story telling purpose and shifts 47 from a true neutral anti-hero into somewhat of a weird hero or guardian. While 47 kinda maintains alot of his mannerisms from the previous games, he's a lot more talkative and shows more emotion, which isn't 47. But he still seems different some how. The Diana situation isn't explained well enough for it to be able to understand from 47s perspective. I don't even understand why he removes the most iconic part of his character, his barcode on the back of his head. They already covered a lot of 47s personal stuff in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin and Hitman 3: Contracts.\n\n+ Game engine is nice, looks clean, textures and lighting are good. Shame about the OTT bloom. Maybe IO can polish the engine a little more and use it in a new proper Hitman game, like 2, 3 and Blood Money.\n\n- "Instinct", hold control to basically get away with murder. Again, another crutch for bad players to navigate "tougher" areas. It's a bad mechanic and doesn't need to be in the game. If you're playing Hitman properly, you don't need it. And for some reason you can hear peoples thoughts if you do use it.\n\n- Very few open ended contracts and the ones that are there aren't that great. Most of it is story driven linear corridoor crap.\n\n+ Create a contract is pretty cool. Allows you to challenge your friends and the world by creating your own contract. Very limited infunctionality though, a lot more could have been done with it.\n\n- Pre-order & store specific DLC suits and weapon packs out the whazoo.\n\nAs a Hitman fan, I really dislike Absolution. It had a few good parts, but it's hard to make out through all the feces the game is smothered in. But it wasted a few hours and only cost me a few pounds since I bought it on the cheap through a Steam sale. If I had bought Absolution at full price on launch, I would have been incredibly upset. Blood Money is THE quintessential Hitman game, and will more than likely never be topped. Especially if IO keep taking the path they are with the franchise at the moment.\n\nSeriously, if you have a craving for Hitman, go play/buy Blood Money, its so much better.","June 2, 2014","false","31.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The hiding in plain sight aspects have been completely stripped out, making it HARDER to sneak past an enemy in disguise. The enemy AI is much improved with different alert levels and the graphics are functional but by no means exceptional (I/O subscribe to the 'lots of bloom' school of thought). The story is deliberately over the top, embracing cliche at every turn, but it still didn't manage to hold my attention. It finishes with a completely unexplained plot twist that just ruined any sense of weight the story had. If you've never played a Hitman game, give it a go.

Agent 47 has a Detective Mode-like Instinct that enables him to see behind walls, highlight items, important locations, see the enemy's walking pattern, and enables him to execute a slow-mo auto kill move (mark targets and Agent 47 auto fires). I do understand the reasoning behind the Instinct ability, but it's just too convenient. Fortunately Instinct is limited in higher difficulties. If you're tired of sneaking around, you can always shoot your way through. But that ruins the point of the game and I only use it when my cover was blown and too lazy to restart.\n\nEnemy AI is, most of the time, stupid. When I switched to a different corner, the guard in front of me didn't react. I have to be visible for a few seconds before he notices me. Unlike, say, Metal Gear Solid or Deus Ex Human Revolution, the guards react and take caution when they notice something passed by. In Absolution, they just ignore any oddities they see.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the scoring system. They deduct points by taking out enemies, killing civilians, getting spotted, etc. You earn points by disposing bodies, getting specific items, etc. You'll get an overall score after you cleared the level. You get the highest score possible if you go purely stealth, I think. Sure it encourages you be more stealthy, but there are times that I want to get noticed. For example: There's a guard in front and I'm in a guard disguise. A way to eliminate this guard is to lure him to a dark corner. I approached the guard, notices me I'm not one of them, does not attack, 1,350 points deduction, I move away and he follows. I raise my hands, disarmed the guard, knocked him out, and hid his body and gained 135 points. I really like this bait tactic, but the score deduction is discouraging and I ended up tossing stuff around to attract the guards. It's not fun.\n\nOn the plus side, game controls are very good. Sticking and navigating Agent 47 to walls is wonky at best, but it's still functional. Stealth take downs and gun combat is good and satisfying. Agent 47 moves like a tank, so don't expect to roll around during firefights. The visuals are very impressive. Everything is so vibrant, detailed and areas with large crowds are a thing to behold. The game has a lot re-playability because of its checklist system. You get bonus points if you get all the weapons in the area, killing enemies with environmental hazards, collecting disguises. Avid item collectors will find this enticing. If collecting is not your thing, you can go to Contracts and beat community-made objectives.\n\nOverall it's an okay stealth game. I like it and most likely I will replay the game again and 100% every level. For die-hard Hitman fans, Absolution is the cancer of the franchise, but to some it's an entertaining game that lets you garrote nuns.","February 2, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although It would be more ok if the rest of the game wasn't so bad.\n\nSpeaking of faces, Diana's is just blurted out from the start, and seeing as it had been kept a mystery all this time, I feel it would've been more acceptable if there would've been some anticipation to seeing 47's dear handler for the first time through the players' eyes.\nWriting tries too hard to make 47 appear more human. 47 is also less intelligent as before, trying to fibre-wire a man thrice his size. Plot device > actions befitting of the character.\n\nYour part in all this will not be to play as 47, but guide him through extremely linear levels, possibly doing some small distractions because hiding in plain sight will never work. Sometimes you'll actually be given the chance to do the assassination yourself instead of a cutscene.\n\nI got this from a midweek madness for 6€'s. And i'll recommend it at that price! It is worth 6€'s to see how a good format of game can be ruined.\nMy advice for Absolution? If you're like me and've played the previous games, don't be like me, and set your game on easy, say "Eff the scoring system" And just blaze through the levels so you can experience the semi-bad story as quickly as possible.\nCan't wait to see what'll become of Thief....","January 27, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Only gripe about it is there is a bit of button mashing when you try to subdue without killing, which makes sense but I don't see why you can't just press the button once for either a neck snap or subdue, just make it a longer animation, similar to the Batman: Arkham games.\n\nFinally the overall look of the game is stunning, I won't say graphics make a game, but in this case, they look amazing and they are just made better with the overall look of the levels from the bright lights of chinatown to its dark and gritty cemetaries, the astetics of greenhouses and the pristene look of mansions and building interiors.\n\nOverall I highly reccomend this game, but if you have played previous hitman games before, do a little research on youtube or similar, check if this approach for hitman games "Suits" you!

The graphics are good, the stealth mechanics are fun, and the gameplay is fantastic. But, the story is ridiculous and the game is WAY too short. I beat the game in like six hours. It was great while it lasted, but the characters weren't relatable and the story made fun of itself. Some games should be serious, others should be funny. Hitman desperately needed to be serious even though it wasn't. It was also really easy so I didn't have to try to hard to win. Overall, Hitman Absolution is a fun game that is way too short and easy. I give Hitman a 7.9/10.","February 7, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The push, the pull, the contemplative pause... and the rush of action.

The graphics are amazing and every kill makes you go on the edge of you're seat.

It is nothing like Blood Money, or any of the previous Hitman games for that matter. But except for the misleading name, this game does its own thing and it does it well. It is a good action game, that can be played either stealthily or full-rambo (Not sure about higher difficulties though). The audio cues that occur when you set up traps, or do other hitman-like things, are a nice touch. Get this if you like sneaking around with cover mechanics, don't expect a lot of "blending in with the crowd". It also reduces your points for being seen while trespassing, even if you leave the area and don't alert anyone. This discourages experimentation, unlike in Blood Money where you would just walk around and if someone tells you to go away you would do so and nothing would happen. The disguise system is also not in favor of hiding in plain sight, which strengthens the idea of sneaking and hiding instead. These things don't necessarily make this a bad game, but they make it a different game from what you would expect out of a Hitman game (Just letting you know). There are some missions that resemble Blood Money a bit better. While the level design is not nearly as good, missions like The King of Chinatown give you a target to execute and leave you in an open area to do whatever you want with that objective, without worrying about sneaking and hiding for the most part.\n\nI'll give this a 8/10. Now before you go and rant to me about how Blood Money was way better and this game is horrible:\nBlood Money was better at being a HITMAN game. This game is better at being a planned-stealth game. Other than the misleading name that the game was given, there is no problem with that. It does a great job at being what it is, apart from a few disagreements I have with this game's score system.\n\nConclusion: 8/10 had a lot of fun with this game, don't get it if you don't like stealth* and sneaking.\n\n* I don't mean stealth as in just not being noticed, I mean it as in evading enemies in a hostile area where you must not be seen at all.","June 28, 2015","true","53.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It makes stealth next to impossible.  You can only save at checkpoints, but if you restart at the checkpoint all the enemies you killed before reaching the checkpoint respawn, on some levels you will load in plain sight of them.   In previous Hitman games there was always that moment when you figured the perfect solution, in Absolution it just never arrives because trying to get through the levels is such a chore.\n\nI've owned every Hitman game and up to Absolution they've been some of the best gaming experiences out there, this is a passable game, but it just isn't like Hitman.","June 12, 2015","false","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nearly every movement is fluid and natural. Even Blood Money, for the masterpiece that it is, can be a bit clunky at times. The added takedowns and cover system really help you get into that assassin mood. The disguise system is weird but it works, in that guards actually NOTICE that you're not their longtime friend Bill. You can bypass this however by using the Instinct feature, which helps in a multitude of ways. Not only does it show where enemies are at/headed, it also slows down time so you can check the surrounding area without taking up too much in-game time. These features add to the overall efficiency of your kills. After all, that IS what being a hitman is about. The biggest downfall in my opinion was the weak story. It didn't quite feel like it held up as much as previous entries. But while this game is no Blood Money, I can without a doubt say that it is definitely a Hitman game.","June 13, 2015","true","26.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sundistorsion/recommended/203140/","sundistorsion","sundistorsion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sundistorsion/","53 products in account","For the fans of the series, I fully recommend it. It has a nice storyline, in accordance with the Agent 47 myth. As we are already used, you are the bad guy, but doing the good deed. You can play as a shadow, no one ever noticing you, making most kills look like an accident, or you can take everything head on, making it a nice shooter; but this isn't the case for a Silent Assassin.\n\nThe playability is, however, not up to what I would prefer. You have several challenges for each mission, but you cannot achieve them all from the first run, different challenges making you replay the same mission several times (e.g. target assassination in different ways will force to restart, at least from last checkpoint, several times). You also have to perform each mission at least twice as most missions are split in several acts with specific challenges and, to get the highest score multiplier, you need to have already completed all the challenges. This interrupts a lot the story line. My second run through the game, when no longer carrying about challenges/score, but rather do it on my own terms, was, however, a lot of fun.\n\nThe introduction of disguises is a nice addition; however, it may be too much. There aren’t many areas where you can go with your normal black suit/red tie, without raising suspicion; therefore, you will spend most of the game in a different outfit. This made Agent 47 lose his classy look.\n\nThe contracts (i.e. multiplayer) are storyline maps, with user created targets and challenges. Most of them are fairly easy and, to some extent, senseless.\n\nBut, even so, the game will be fun and will keep you interested enough to come back. If you are fan of the series, you already have it. If you are thinking if it’s worth to get it, get it. If it’s on discount, get it anyway.","May 7, 2014","true","105.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For some good, and some bad reasons. I'll provide only the main reasons.\n\nTL;DR version: Enjoyable stealth game if played on 'normal'. Aggravating (challenging) game on expert/purist (good luck without prior gameplay experience or guides - still doable, but you will get to know levels quite intimately for the number of times you play).\n\nThe good:\n\nVery challenging without previous experience. Yea, it was a doozie. Satisfying to have finished the game and there was a reasonable storyline. Lots of quirky characters. Most of which you kill. Yay! Oh, and headshots.\n\n\nI have never played a Hitman game before and I like playing my games on difficult settings. I did not run purist because that appeared to need some familiarity with the game to play. However, so did Expert. I am glad I played Expert and not Purist. I found it difficult to catch on to what 'deaths' could be setup, what mechanics to use and how they could be used. This isn't necessarily bad... Except that you will probably miss a lot of cool setup deaths such as an individual peeing on a wire you have exposed that leads to their electrocuted demise. It was not intuitive that these types of kills could be done. Decent story. I cursed many times as I was caught in many awkward situations. Also, I did not realize you could upgrade weapons until I finished the game. To have more freedom to 'enjoy' these tidbits in the game I recommend that you play on Normal unless you want the Absolution achievement, then play on Hard,\n\nHeadshots.. Headshots are rewarding and make you feel good. 99.9% of occasions 1 headshot = 1 kill. So for those of you who have good accuracy and hate games like GOW for the reason that no person/monster should take a sniper round to the noodle and survive, this game is for you.\n\nThe bad:\n\nMelee, lack of checkpoints for higher difficulties, some complete BS detection.\n\nMelee has got to be the most frustrating aspect in the higher difficulties (replaying normal for achievements, melee is a joke because it is so easy in comparison). I did not know for the longest time, until rage level exceeded maximum and I looked up a guide that you are better off watching the animations to know what buttons to press than to actually wait for the QTE event (which gave you a window of what seemed to be less than a second and required inhuman reaction times). FYI: 'Space' if they are attacking you; 'Q' for first hit; 'W' if 47 knocks them in the face backwards; 'E' if 47 knocks them towards the ground.\n\nCheckpoints... Oh dear. Having no familiarity with this game and playing it on Expert lead to a long time of trial and error trying to figure out how the hell to beat some levels. Admittedly I looked up a guide in two circumstances: One of the first levels (can't remember which), and the courthouse. Other than that, no guides... But I can see why people would instantly go to guides after 3...4...10.. 20 failed attempts at a level haha.\n\nDetection.. Silenced weapons are not so silent. I always loved how shooting a target with a silenced weapon would result in being spotted first, then being awarded for the kill (the game awards score based on activity and so it shows, in order, the events that occur and the points associated). Albeit, the circumstances in which I was shooting a silenced weapon (from afar) and being detected were somewhat reasonable, but annoying all the same. So expect to be detected frequenly and die frequently if you play higher difficulties. Especially under circusmtances of choking a guy out only for one of the teammates to 'happen' to turn around and see you. I felt like the game was just trolling me for the number of times people turned around for no reason, not because I made noise, but just because this is Hitman and you need to be demoralized a few times.\n\nThere were also many instances where throwing something to distract an individual never worked. The NPC refused to move at all. So you were forced to find some way arouund these stonewall NPCs. On most occasions I emptied a clip into them out of frustration and had to restart the level because A) No checkpoints in expert, and B) I would be detected even if my weapon was silenced.\n\nAlas, time to finish the achievements and move on... Probably never to play this game again.","February 23, 2015","true","35.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greatestmemes/recommended/203140/","greatestmemes","€LЇT€1▂","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greatestmemes/","151 products in account","Hitman is a simple concept: someone gives you a target, or targets, and you take them out. The genius of it is the way the designers let you do that. It's not just about deciding whether to sneak past people or get into a gun-fight - it's about slowly tracking the movements of people through large environments and observing the ways you can manipulate them and their surroundings to bring about their downfall. Perhaps you place explosives where you know they'll wander, or maybe you arrive just in time to nudge them over a railing into a deserted alleyway, and often you do all this dressed in borrowed clothes that conceal your identity from all but the most detailed investigation.\n\nHitman: Absolution includes all of that stuff, and on the higher difficulty levels it leaves you to figure a lot of it out on your own. You sneak or roam in disguise through police stations, courthouses, dilapidated mob-run hotels, maize-covered farmland, factories and science labs, teasing out details about your target from overheard conversations and useful objects left on shelves or in poorly guarded rooms. Then you formulate a plan and try to pull it off.","October 17, 2015","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/budget_security/recommended/203140/","budget_security","Budget_Security","http://steamcommunity.com/id/budget_security/","72 products in account","A good story with some great characters and humour, but gameplay is a bit mixed - rigid stealth mechanics with an arcade/consolitis feel. Sometimes you get detected for something that you would get away with in real life and vice-versa. Confusingly, enemy eyesight is matched to their torso instead of the direction their face is looking towards. The challenge is annoyingly increased artificially by over-populating levels with guards. To get past them you take things slowly and memorise their pre-defined patrol routes - which can get a bit tedious. The mechanics have a “puzzle game” feel to them. There is little room for improvisation. At least you can always go the guns blazing route if stealth gets too annoying. The gameplay does offer good replayability though, if you want to improve your score for each level and beat the scores of your friends.\n\nLevels are on the small side and too linear, but many have nice detail and feel very alive with huge crowds of AI. Some also have funny things and some great easter-eggs. On a technical level though, the graphics are just average (aimed at xbox360 limitations). levels also take unreasonably long to load.\n\nThe control scheme feels a bit cumbersome. Shooting mechanics are acceptable, but melee combat is poor - clumsy and harsh quick time events that break the flow of the action. The screen FOV is low by desktop standards. The lack of frequent checkpoints or a manual save system can be annoying if you slip up and have to start from the beginning of a level. Also, your gear and outfit are not saved between levels. Even worse, if you reload a checkpoint, some enemies are alive that you killed before reaching that checkpoint.\n\nSo, gameplay is arguably not quite as good as in Blood Money, but I did find the story in Absolution much more entertaining. Other than some minor issues like very slow loading levels, a few bugs and glitches (once an AI spotting me through a floor), the game runs stable.\n\nOverall it is a decent game to get when on sale.","October 29, 2015","true","47.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He protects little girls - free of charge.\nHe gets put on his back 2 times only surviving because his idiot enemies  fail to put a bullet into his brains right away.\nHe is a 47 that is uncapable of keeping his equipment sorted, so he has to start his assignments with whatever he found in the trashbin down the road.\nHe is a 47 that can stick Sniperifles and Shotguns into his pants (and nobody will notice!), but can only start a contract with one type of weapon.\nHe is a 47 who's face everyone has seen on TV (or where was it?) already, hence he can dress up all the way he likes - someone is bound to indentify him anyways. Well, unless he wears his standard suit that is.\nAnd last but not least, this is the 47 who can bend time and travel back in time to not-do-what-he-did-before.\n\nI cannot rate this game as a Hitman title because it clearly isn't, so i will rate it as a standalone game:\n6/10\n\nBecause i see there has been put quite some effort into providing a good game. Interessting map-design, good AI, a decent movement system, it is really not all bad.\n\nBut it has a low replayability value, despite the user-created contracts, which play on the same maps with the same mechanics as the storyline missions.\nYou cannot spawn new characters, you can't even alter the pathing for already existing characters. All you can do is replay the mission, define new targets and ways to kill them, and others may try to do as you did and either beat your score or die trying.\n\nConcerning gameplay you can but say that controls are rather complicated and not well thought out, button confusion for most part. There is no 1st person mode, so you better run through those curtains before you find your view obstructed by them while you get pounded with .45cals from the other side.\n\nNo pre-mission gear selection, no blueprints, no layouts, no freedom.\nThe rating system is a real bummer, spoils all the fun in progress already, unless you don't give a f***.\n\nThe graphics are superb and deliver a premium experience with low impact.\n\nSo, this is great a firework of eyecandy with a semi-interessting story about some bald guy who accidently got mistaken for Mr Fourty-Seven from Hitman: Blood Money, and now everybody wants a piece of him and he wants the girl.\n\nIf you have never played a Hitman title before this could be nice to play before you play Blood Money. Afterwards it is just a huge disappointment.","November 4, 2015","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First play through I kinda focused on stealth and the more passive approach, but second playthrough was even more fun just going on easy mode guns blazing. The point shooting mechanics really support kicking ♥♥♥ and it's a lot of fun. Was able to sit and play through the whole thing in basically one sitting. There is a lot of replayability here and contracts is an interesting take. The only thing I don't like about the story is that there is basically no point where you can decide your loadout before you go in, instead you're expected to play contracts for that ability. But... This lack of a load out in the story mode actually fits the story well, making it feel that much more like a movie. Again, with the point shooting, it felt like a great action game, I enjoyed that more than the actually stealth playthroughs I did before.","March 12","true","25.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A mistake often made. The thinking part, that is.\n\nAs usual, if you've come to read this review, you've done some background investigation towards the game itself. So I keep those obvious details short. New aiming system, new gallery of weapons, new ways to interact, etc... You'll have read all this, and your assumption will be right.\n\nThe assumption being: This is a stellar improvement over the original. The engine looks beautiful and the weapons handle much, much better.\nA lot of my Blood Money gripes have been settled.\n\nBut this is no longer a Hitman game like you're used to, in terms of Gameplay. And not always for the better.\n\nIn the past installments, you were thrown at a level, a situation if you will. And you had to figure out how to achieve your goal(s), then escape through the way you came. Everything that happened between beginning and end was up to you.\n\nThis is no longer the case. Now, you are thrown into a smaller level, where you either need to interact/sabotage something or kill someone, then escape through a designated exit into another section of the mission. Commonly, these are three parts.\n\nAs a long-time Hitman fan, this sits uneasy with me and feels less true to the Hitman spirit.\nOn the flip-side though, this allows new gamers to the Hitman series to easier adopt the spirit and feel of the games. In a way, train them for Blood Money or a successor that returns to the old feel.\n\nAlso, while I felt more limited in my playground, I did feel like my curiosity was still stimulated through the methods of murder available to me.

In a sense, I think the developers are trying to open doors for the series.\n\nAbsolution will be slightly tougher to get into for long time fans. But if they can get over the big changes, you can still get a good time out of it.\nFor newcomers: This isn't what the Hitman series has always been about, but it's pretty close.\n\nA 25 or 50% off will easily justify a purchase.\nIf you even remotely think you may like a game like this, you probably will.","August 4, 2013","true","37.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off some long time fans, but the change really makes you appreciate the environment more than ever. The cover system is robust for the most part, the controls are tight and precise for sneaking around.\n\nI finished the game before on Purist mode and I must say, the Instinct system they used in the game is amazing. I could've done without the precision shooting mechanic, but the sound indicator when you're about to be spotted is a great addition to the game. Notice that on harder difficulties you will not have a HUD that indicates who will see you or how close they are in spotting you. If you really want to enjoy the game, I'd suggest you push it on harder difficulties especially if you're a veteran of the previous games. It provides a cinematic experience and your movements will feel really organic - whether it's choking out someone or sneaking from cover to cover.\n\nAbsolution's story is lacklustre in comparison to the previous games. While the amazing locations and the voice actors are top notch in providing a great experience, the story's build up does not come close to ANY of the previous games. Though it is nice to see 47 exhibit his human side since Silent Assassin, they seriously wasted it here. Normally I would stop when the story get so horrendous, but they do such a great job of making you feel like a stealthy assassin that I don't mind it all.\n\nI'd highly recommend it for the experience, not for it's story.","January 7, 2014","true","23.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Well personally I loved it and thought this games style and artistic design was great.  Yes in a way it is linear and not as open ended as other Hitmans but change can be good and it is with Absolution.\n\nThis game features the single player story which is a good lengh over several chapters and different locations.  Then there is contracts mode which you can play with friends and even make your own contract so others can play - this was kind of cool to play.  Contracts are basically assassinations of specific targets with certain goals awarded.\n\nThe graphics and art style of the game were great, I love Square Enix's games they seem to have that edge and know how to make games look different - like Kane & Lynch Dog Days and Deus Ex HR for instance.  The voice acting is great - Blake Dexter was my favorite and he is a complete ♥♥♥♥.  Hitman himself sounds awesome, the musical score did get a little old for me as it seems to be the same music rehashed and nothing really new.\n\nCombat was decent and enemy AI can be troublesome sometimes the game was never really overly difficult, however I do not play on Purist mode either.  There is a ton of weapons, gadgets and outfits for Htman to collect and the more you collect and the more time you spend involved in the game getting creative the more payback you get with rewards and challenge unlocks.\n\nThis was a great game, I highly recommend picking it up as I got it last week on sale with all DLC for about $8 money well spent.  Now I will await the next Hitman or I could play Blood Money again.","October 1, 2013","true","36.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

A truly remarkable game. The Contracts Mode puts it one step ahead.\n\nHitman: Absolution, the fifth game of the Hitman franchise, has so much to be told about. For the first time we are presented a movie-like story line that shows 47 has feelings and emotions (who would have guessed?) making the game feel very immersive. Characters are very well developed, the voice acting is just perfect and the entire plot will get you so angry at some characters that you will enjoy, with a big evil smile on your face, ending the life of those hateful characters however you wish.\n\nThe gameplay feels smooth and easy to understand just like in the other Hitman games despite a few changes here and there. Now you can hide behind walls and crouch behind boxes like you were never able to. The graphis, of course, were greatly improved and reached a level that amazes anyone. The lighting is great, the phisics engine is very realistic and the AI behaviour seems more immersive too.\n\nThe levels of the game, on the other hand, feel like a small corridor that only goes in one direction. The freedom you used to have in the other games is just gone, pretty much like saving (which was replaced by useless checkpoint saves that won't save a thing but that position), picking your weapons before the missions and purchasing and customizing your friendly guns. Why? Why this huge step back in the franchise?\n\nBut! Contracts mode was introduced allowing you to play the missions of the game as you want, chose up to 3 targets you want and kill them however, whatever with and whenever you see fit. Then the mission will be saved and posted for everyone to play it and the other players will have to complete it as you did so that they can earn the most out of it. You can create competitions with other people for those contracts and completing them earns you money you can spend on upgrades, disguises and weapons for Contracts mode only.\n\nIn my personal opinion and considering how awesome Hitman: Blood Money was, my rating for Hitman: Absolution is only a 7/10. Yes, the story is amazing, but it feels you have no freedom at all. Yes, the graphics, gameplay and Contracts mode are too, but there is so much that could be improved concerning the little things from other games.\n\nPerhaps, the next Hitman will be as hardcore as previous Hitman games and as badass looking and story-wise awesome as Absolution. If this is true I'm sure a 10/10 is in order.","May 31, 2013","true","91.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

More like, "Hitman: Absolutely Spend Your Money on a Different Game."\n\nHitman: Absolution isn't a bad game, per se. But for everything they added into the game, they took a lot out that made the previous games great. My biggest complaint is the removal of the "open world" style levels, for a much more linear level design. I felt like I was walking down a hallway the entire game. The level design isn't the best. Between the conveniently placed dumpsters every 5 feet, and the chest high walls that just so happen to be lined up for you to perfectly sneak past the enemy, it just didn't have the same level of design as the previous games. The levels themselves are good to run through once, but I found they lacked the replay value that I have come to love from this series.\n\nIf you haven't played the previous Hitman games, I think that you would probably enjoy this game very much.

THERE ARENT SPOILERS READ ALREDY! JUST SHUT UP AND READ.\n\nHitman is a fun sneaking game. But is even a funnier shooting game. The graphics were made by a rattlesnake obviously as  you can see.\n\n\nThis game is all about bottles. You hit that guy with a bottle and the fun thing is that it has really original weapons i never seen. It has a shotgun REALLY ORIGINAL a silenced pistol. Wow great idea!\nIt has a smg and sh!t  but the fun thing is. YOU CAN KILL WITH TOYS. YOU CAN GO GRAB A CHOO CHOO TRAIN AND STRANGLE SOMEONE. and you can be a bird and the fun thing is you can kill with a radio.\n\n\nBut and the game is actully very spooky cus u hav 2 kill your partner only because she released TOP SECRET INFO. Which was that the agency liked donuts. That is seriously bizzarre and spooky. WOW REALLY TERRYIFING I SHOCKED MY SELF.  And when you kill her. She is naked on a shower but the game developers dint show anything luckly but you know.. See what im sayin?\n\nThat was secret files,No one shall know that a corporation likes donuts and you have to kill her. then you have to kill 30 people to save a girl named victoria which is a total ugly waffle and you have to save her but some rare texan physco gets her and you have to save her.\n\n\nOh where have i seen where the boy saves the girl? 500 MILLION GAMES/MOVIES\nSo yeah you must like killing some bad guys they get the girl you must get a guy called lenny subdue sh!t sh!t and you kill kill kill and you kill the texan guy and you kill the guy from the agency.\n\n\nAnd really i dont know why you have to care about a girl you dont even know. She is not special. The guy that you kill with the beard says that she was made to sell donuts.  A TOUCHING STORY\nYou have to kill 9999999 People to save a girl that you dont even know his second name.\n\n\nEh... Great touching story em really original havent seen anywhere something similar like this 100% Original. I still have a lot of sarcasm\n\n\nBut you see the game is good cause you can disguise as a chimunk! Look!\nhttp://wakeupandsmelltheashes.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/charlie-the-professional.jpg i swear its not a virus i mean look its not like you are gonna lose all your  games and money. Dont worry but only i mean. Real pros click it. Because they like danger and hack everything!\n\nWait this isnt Watch_dogs.\n\n\nI mean look. HAHAHAHAH where have i seen that in a  game. In which you can be a chimunk and wield a giant A$$  m60? AHAHAHAHAH But obviously you have to find it your self cause i alredy beaten the game.\nIts a cool easter egg that requieres to kill victoria (the ugly girl) kill the texan (the bad physco) and be agent 48 seewhatididthere.avi (the good)\n\nBut the fun part is that you have to kill random people that i dont even know. Seriously. You kill the manager from a club and you have to kill a junkie named king, you have to kill a boxing fighter. YOu kill a hot chick with a gun.\n\nYou kill an oldman from a gun store and you kill more girls and 3 soldiers and a guy with a beard. Only to save that stupid girl you dint even know. GREAT STORY UHH.... Hitman.com duno eh\n\n\n10/10 IGN\n\nBest game ever -PCgamer\n\nTouching story. -Metacritic\n\nBest game in E3! Everyone was playing it!\n\nI like it cus it has a gay rattlesnake -Rock,paper,Shotgun.\n\n\nI had the chimunk and i suicided but im the best critic evar -GameStop\n\n\nI like the str!p club -Some pedophile\n\nSo yeah GREAT GRAPHICS GREAT GAMEPLAY EH SO YEAH 10/10\n\n\n\nWHAT A PIECE OF SHI-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh did i tell you there are spoilers? Oh no sorry .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe girl looks like she was photoshopped and apparantly you can throw knifes from 3 meters and hit\nperfectly the head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts actully very impressive that someone is so bored that reads to the end.

With the Glacier 2 engine, the game looks so realistic and makes the gameplay a real joy for everyone, who plays it. The characters are looking very nice, especially Mr. 47 himself, who looks better than ever before, especially more realistic, but also the other main characters in the game are looking very good.\n\nBut also the gameplay itself is very well done, they kept a lot of things from the previous Hitman: Blood Money and added some new stuff as well, to make this gaming experience just remarkable. Like in Blood Money, you have dozens of ways to eliminate your target and you don't have to fire a single bullet to reach your goals. You can sneak up on him/her or you can make it look like an accident or just go beserk. But the more silent you kill your target(s), the higher is your score and the better your rating, although I find it a bit sad, that you don't have the very bad ratings like\n"mass-murderer" or "slaughterer" anymore, the worst you can get is "agent". Of course, when you kill non-targets or civillians, you will receive a massive loss of points in our final score.\nAlso you can increase your score by hiding dead bodies/knocked out people or remove evidences from the scene and there are muliple challenges to complete, which will later increase your points-multiplier.\nThe level-design is also very well done, even though it is more linearly designed than in previous games of the Hitman-franchise. But you have pretty large levels in which you have several ways to sneak around to find and kill your targets and achieve your goals. But you have to watch out for the many many guards/cops/handymen you have to evade, without being uncovered. You probably have to try it several times, before you'll find the best way to reach the target, it's sometimes a real challenge, depending on the difficulty level you've chosen.\nThat's the next point, the 5 different difficulty levels, you can choose between easy, medium, hard, expert and purist. The higher the difficulty is chosen, the more and more observant are the enemies, plus the use of instinct is limited, as well as other help, on purist for example, you have no instinct and help at all and full enemy presence! Real challenging!\n\nAnother great addition to Hitman: Absolution is the "Contracts Mode", which allows you to create your own contracts. You can choose one of the levels, mark your target(s) and set contract details on how to kill your target(s), the weapons and/or if the bodies have to be hid and so on. You can almost do anything you like, and you have dozens of possible targets in every level, which is a huge fun! Also you can play contracts, that other people or your friends have created and try to hit the highscore. I personally have spent almost 400 hours with the game and about 350 of them in contracts mode alone!\n\nThe conclusion is, that Hitman: Absolution is a great game, until February, 11th 2016 it was the best game in the francise, until it was beaten by the newest installment named "HITMAN". But even after the release of the new game, Hitman: Absolution is still a fantastic game, with beautiful graphics, a very nice story and many assassin-tastic missions. It's still worth playing and as a true Hitman-Gamer you have to have this game!","March 29","true","396.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a stand-alone game it would be amazing, however as a "hitman series" game it is a complete let down. The most enjoyable experience for me on the previous game, blood money was the fact you could eliminate a target ANY WAY YOU LIKED, in fact i used to replay the missions several times just to complete them with different tactics. For me Absolution is a terrible attempt at a hitman game, you basically HAVE to complete the missions in a certain manner or you lose points. The disguise system is a total joke, kind of looks like they tried to "borrow" the Blend system from Assassins creed. All in all 4/10. If like me you're a hardcore hitman fan, then don't buy this game, stick to blood money. However if you're totally new to the hitman series then by all means purchase it, maybe you'll like it.","February 14, 2015","false","6.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I don't mean to imply that the stealth in this game is of a lower quality than the two I've listed, in fact it's probably on par with them, but the real issue I have with this game is the way it approaches gameplay in general. In each level, you have a score at the top of your screen. Points are gained for completing specific challenges and lost for doing things wrong. While it's possible to ignore the score, Hitman focuses very heavily on score being integral to your experience with the game. The challenges are sometimes easy and sometimes difficult, but it's often impossible to complete multiple in a single run through a level. As a result, you'll find yourself replaying the level over and over again in an attempt to complete the challenges. And then, one time, you accidentally do something majorly wrong, like killing an enemy in plain sight ("I SWEAR THAT GUY DIDN'T SEE ME!!!") and you lose the majority of the points you've spent an hour-and-a-half cultivating. Well, it looks like you're just going to have to reset the level (replaying lets you keep points and challenges, resetting resets all your challenges and points to 0). As stated previously, you can ignore the challenges and score, but they're such a core part of the game that if you ignore them, the game becomes a generic "kill this guy and don't be seen".","December 2, 2013","false","4.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The people at IO Interactive decided to raise the stakes by making Agent 47 fight the Agency itself. As usual, the levels are varied and they were all meticulously designed. 47 traverses through various locales and all this is presented to us beautifully. I remember Blood Money being a beautiful game but Absolution upped all this - this game certainly stands out in its genre.\n\nI expected this considering the companies behind the game. After all, high production value can easily yield the necessary results. However, it is not enough to make a game with an interesting story or gameplay and this is where Absolution excels.\n\nFor those of you who are new to the franchise: in Hitman you control an assassin whose job - on each level - is to eliminate someone. Stealth should be the preference as while running and gunning is also an option (but makes the game significantly more difficult) picking the silent run method gives a much higher satisfaction. Enemies' clothing can be picked up and disguise is important to get through various parts of each level.\n\nA change to previous installments is that some sequences are specifically action oriented or more linear. Yet, core and hardcore elements are still there. Also, predicting the routes enemies do can be done with the introduction of the so-called "Instinct Mode". I would say that this Hitman is easier on a normal difficulty than its predecessors but one can always go for the additional challenge by picking another difficulty.\n\nAll in all, an excellent follow-up to the franchise and, therefore, highly recommended to the fans as well as to the newcomers.","September 30, 2014","true","20.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is completely different in many ways from say - Hitman: Blood Money (which you should definitely play first if you haven't), but I believe most of these changes were either necessary or in good taste. The graphics are a huge improvement, the soundtrack is fantastic, the dialogues are well written and there are tons of goofy easter eggs in the grim setting of Absolution.\n\nJust one little thing. Checkpoints are bugged. There is no other way to play this game than on purist (the highest difficulty).\nPicking this difficulty will eliminate checkpoints (that are broken anyway), remove ESP and make the game more pleasant overall. Anyone who gives this game a bad review was probably playing on normal, and complaining about the broken checkpoints or built-in wallhack.\n\nNo really, playing on low difficulty is like playing as Charles Xavier from the X-men.

It not only betrays the design philosophy of previous games, it also fails as a stand-alone without any expectations or standards the title on the box gives us. You do yourself a great service in avoiding this game at all costs.\n\nHitman Absolution is a pseudo-stealth game. Objectives range from "go from point A to point B" or "kill this target". Naturally, the best ways to accomplish these is to do it without witnesses, without getting caught, without getting shot at and of course, as silent and discreet as possible. Previous Hitman games essentially gave you a sandbox to explore and a variety ways to off your targets. Even going as far as to make it possible to make your expertly executed murder look like an accident meaning nobody even had to know an assassin was even present. At the risk of sounding pretentious, it's without a doubt one of the most artistic depictions of stealth in the medium. Hitman Absolution instead controls a lot more like a third-person shooter. Ghosting (minus the required targets) is still possible, but incredibly annoying to execute because of contradictory design choices. Let's start with the small problems and build our way up.\n\nFirst off: the score system. In previous games, you were awarded with a certain amount of money based on how well you played. The higher your rank, the higher the prize. This could later be spent on upgrades, new weapons for missions etc. This time however, it's entirely cosmetic and borderline irritating. The scoreboard will constantly subtract or add points based on your actions in real-time during gameplay, but it's entirely pointless. Its sole purpose is for online leaderboards which really shouldn't be the focus of a Hitman game. I don't know about you, but I do not want to be reminded by a useless scoreboard that I'm playing a game every time I do a thing within said game.\n\nThis scoreboard highlights the shallowness of this game. For one thing, not only is creativity less important, you're often flat-out TOLD how to perform unique executions in order to get points so you can participate in the leaderboards. This ranges from routes, disguise options you can find across the map, weapons, weapon locations and even unique assassination techniques to make the murder look like an accident. The game constantly holds your hand and reminds you can do all of these things when all you want to do is be free and explore, hopefully without the extra grating tutorial voice that I'm hoping you've already shut off in the options menu unless you have already returned this game at gamestop where it belongs. Hitman is supposed to be a game about two things: 1. I should be able to plan my weapons and route with the help of a map and 2. be able to do some improvisation with the given location. You can only do the latter which is made worse by limited weapons, smaller maps, less options and ultimately less interesting/exotic locations.\n\nSo let's come right out of it. The gameplay is bad. For one thing, even though stealth should be the better option, fighting back with brutal force is strangely enough encouraged a lot of the time. It really shouldn't be like this, but with covers sprayed everywhere and the annoying disguise system which I'll get to later, making a few sacrifices is often your best bet at survival.\n\nBut the scoring system is what breaks this. The game is full of contradictory design choices like this. You're basically told to do complete a certain goal and you're given less of a score for doing something bad like killing or harming non-targets, getting spotted or letting bodies get discovered. Well, gosh I'm so sorry for not doing everything perfectly in my first run, IO interactive! Even stranger is that if you knock a person unconscious from behind and hide his body, you don't lose points but if you knocked someone out and hid the body after he/she spotted you you still lose points. This make some sense as he did see your face except not really when you realize he saw your face a couple of seconds before you decided to choke the living hell out of him from behind. This is made even worse by the horrible checkpoint system which does not save your progress but instead resets the entire level and only brings you to a different part of the map. This means that all of the bodies you put into lockers before hitting a checkpoint are now inexplicably walking around again. Not being able to save wherever you want is also very annoying and discourages experimentation.\n\nAnd lastly we come to ever awful disguise system. The way you get spotted by enemies is simply awful. When you're in the sight of an enemy you'll see a yellow cone on your screen. Even worse is that their vision cones which are displayed on the the radar don't match the movements of their head on screen which is really off-putting. This will disappear when you move out of the way. Stay in there for too long and the guy will try to stop you and eventually he will become hostile unless you do what he says. You can reduce this reaction time with a disguise. A disguise allows you to enter locations that would otherwise be prohibited to get in or even interact with other NPCs. It doesn't work for people with the same disguise however. So if a police officer spots you in a police uniform he for whatever reason won't be fooled by it. Even when your face is entirely covered it won't stop people from finding you suspicious if they're part of the same group. You're probably thinking that this makes no sense, but it gets worse. There's ways to avoid getting spotted with a disguise. First off, you can move out of the way which makes no sense. If some guy spots you and you duck for cover he or she won't find that suspicious that all. Even worse is the instinct mode. Instinct mode allows you to see throw walls, highlight objects of interest, because Hitman is now Batman. It also allows you to maintain your disguise when spotted by depleting your instinct. How do I use this incredibly skillful technique, you inquire? Gather round and be sure to take notes. The one and only step is the following: you hold a button. That's it. Again, I have make this clear: with mostly linear levels and a horrible disguise system, most of the gameplay will consist out of moving forward and pressing X to not GET CAUGHT. This is what Hitman has devolved into. Other stealth game would at least add interesting uses of darkness or sound, but these staples in the stealth genre that were praised in titles like Thief or Splinter cell are nowhere to be found in Hitman. Heck even Metal Gear Solid, a series I despise, has interesting moments with its fast-paced arcadic gameplay. You're basically reduced to press X TO WIN when it comes to pacifist runs minus targets you need to kill. All redeemable factors from Hitmans predecessors like the sandbox elements, the explorations of multiple methods in assassinating your targets or the creative executions are all gone.\n\nSo if press X to hide sounds appealing to you then by all means go buy this game. Other than that there's very little to say about this game. There's a damsel in distress storyline with very little surprises but performed by mostly good voice actors. The original 47 is also back for the ride which is good because IO was originally going to use a Christian Bale impersonator judging from early trailers.That first casting choice rather reflects the soundtrack quite well which was mimicking inception with a hundred percent more BWAAAAAAS. Very disappointing when compared to Jesper Kyds compositions in Hitman Blood Money. As for graphics, the glacier 2 engine made this game look beautiful, but I'd rather have a game that plays well.\n\nThat's about all I got. If you like the type of kind of a third-person shooter, sort of a stealth-type of game then go for it. This just does not do it for me. Looking forward to HITMAN: THE APOLOGY.","May 15, 2015","false","20.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","4"

This game rewards perfection, if you don't care about that sort of thing, then this game probably isn't for you.\n\nThere is a lot, a lot, A LOT of varibles that affect the game especially the dialogue. Think of any game where developers have touted that "Omg its so realistic, there is so much unique dialogue you'll never hear the same thing twice" and its ended up being a complete lie? Well, HItman Aboslution did not tout this...yet its 100% true for this game.\nJust an example, I snuck past two thug guards, one was clearly a newbie whilst another was a veteran, with the veteran trying to calm down the noob. Many paces past them I shot a bullet and they heard, the veteran pointed out that something got past them and the noob began to chicken out, to which the veteran began to psych him up.\n\nThis game is a long pathway of disguises and alteranative ways to do things, unlike previous Hitman games where you're just put into a single world: meaning this is an interconnected section of worlds leading to one story.

When the game is good, it's fantastic and borderline brilliant. But when the game is BAD, woah boy, is it BAD. Missions are generally broken down into two different types; being given targets to assassinate by any means necessary, and Metal Gear Solid-esque sneaking through larger levels to get to the exit. The former can be absolutely stellar; you have to plan takedowns of other targets to get disguises to get close enough to your target (preferably without getting caught, as the best laid plans will understandably get torn asunder if someone sees you moving a body), and are then given a variety of methods to take your mark out, ranging from doing it personally with a gun or garotte wire, or, my personal favourite, using various parts of the environment to set up "accidental kills", like framing your target so he gets shot by police, setting a live wire to where they urinate in an alley in order to electrocute them, or less subtle methods like causing a crane's hook to come undone and crushing them with its contents.\n\nUnfortunately, where the game falls apart is in the long stealth sections that make up the rest of the game. There's very few checkpoints, it's almost impossible to shake suspicion once you've lingered in an NPCs line of sight for too long, even while disguised, and with few exceptions (like one case where you can throw the police off your trail by dropping the body from someone else's murder into their line of sight), they feel very uninspired. Worse of all the AI is very buggy at times; I've been spotted through solid walls, had would-be victims magically turn around at random despite never going so in the previous dozen or so attempts, and on at least three occasions had to completely restart a level because an NPC spawned right in front of a checkpoint, facing me. Worst of all, checkpoints DON'T save progress between game sessions, meaning if you crash or have to exit for whatever reason, you have to start the entire section from the beginning.\n\nThere's a recipe for a truly unmatched stealth game here; if Hitman: Absolution had focused more on the actual "hits" and less on the horrendous stealth sections, it could have been darn near perfect. Unfortunately, those are diamonds in the rough, and there's a heck of a lot of rough to sift through. Thankfully the game's multiplayer "Contracts" mode, where players can set challenges for other players to beat by doing those actions in the in-game setting, provides a steady stream of decent diversions and while the stealth sections heavily bog down the early stages of the game, much of the later game brings the game back to form.\n\nAll told Absolution slips by with a recommendation, but with a lot of caveats. Sadly beyond Contracts mode you HAVE to endure the lousy stealth levels at least once to get to the good stuff, meaning those without a lot of patience for that sort of thing had best look elsewhere. The meat of the game is in replayability; thankfully replays break chapters up into sections that allow you to bypass the worst parts of them if you see fit.\n\nI really, really hope that the next Hitman game learns from Absolutions' flaws and continues to polish its gems. For now, Absolution is fun-- just very flawed fun.","October 21, 2014","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There was a pro of Hitman: Codename 47/. A tremendous step in before a plot - Road Movie.\n\n\nAt the best moments of Absolution forces the player to feel like the real murderer improvisator capable to tear off purpose life in one thousand various ways. To strangle the security guard and to change clothes in a new form. Having pulled a cap over the person, to slip by his vigilant colleagues. Having quickly studied a situation round the victim, to make the decision and instantly to carry out it, and then to be dissolved before people around manage to understand something.\n\nUnfortunately, Absolution — it also the imposed linear pieces where it is necessary to move forward obediently in the unique way. These are conventions in a stealth which force the project to look bad in comparison with the predecessors. On each plus here easily there is minus. However work of IO Interactive is contrary to mathematical laws, remaining on a positive side of balance.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nthe best missions offer a choice in a corporate style of Hitman;\nintense, dynamic stealth;\nhigh potential for repeated passings.\n\nShortcomings:\n\nset of boring linear episodes;\nsluggish multiplayer;\nnot ideal system of masking\n\n\nIt is dissatisfied music already unwritten Jesper Kyd to which I listened throughout all last parts.\n\nMy assessment = 7\5 Excellent stealth of 2012.","January 28, 2015","true","57.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In addition, the game features Instinct Mode which allows Agent 47 which is your main character in this game to predict enemy patrol routes.In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency. The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown, in order for him to play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie. 47 learns that Dexter is in the "Terminus" hotel and after evading Dexter's henchmen, eavesdrops on him. 47 learns from Dexter's conversation with his secretary Layla that he plans to kidnap and auction Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to strangle Sanchez, Dexter's enormous bodyguard, who proceeds to knock 47 unconscious. After Dexter discovers who he is, he almost kills him, but decides as he doesn't want that kind of attention. Just then, a hotel maid comes in and discovers 47, thinking he is dead. Dexter kills her, plants the weapon with 47, douses the room in alcohol, ignites it, and leaves with Layla and Sanchez. Framed by Dexter for the murder, 47 escapes the hotel and evades the police.\n\nNow I'm not going to say any more of the story because i realy want you guys to take a look at the game yourselves and as always try not to be detected and stay unnoticed.\n\nHave fun playing Hitman Absolution!\n","August 9, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spoiler alert. You step in to Agent 47 a.k.a. the Hitman a.k.a Tobias Reaper's shoes yet again to protect the life of Diana's adopted daughter. The villains in this iteration of Hitman are quite colourful, but most of the levels feel like a rinse and repeat.\n\nThe final stages are doubly disappointing. There's way too much of stealth and sneaking around and not nearly enough ways to cleverly kill off targets. The Contracts mode is just awesome though. That alone warrants Absolution to be purchased by any Hitman fan.","August 15, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanktkaiser/recommended/203140/","sanktkaiser","Fe* BattleVodka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanktkaiser/","374 products in account","I'll be upfront: I went into this game expecting, essentially, an upgraded, spotlessly polished, prettified Blood Money. For me, Blood Money was the epitome of Hitman. Why would they change what was the ultimate expression of the sandbox assassination? There are lots of reasons I could speculate on, but for anyone considering this game, know this: It is nothing like Blood Money. Further disclaimer: I suck at this game. Sorry about that. So, this review is from the point of view of Easy and Normal modes.\nThat said, on to the actual review, then. Wall of text incoming, I take this fairly seriously, because well hey, everyone needs a hobby.\n\nI'm going to look at this game two ways: as a generic stealth game, and as a Hitman game.\n\nAs a stealth game, it's above average, good even. The usual illogical fallicies aside (i.e. hiding behind/rolling between cover in a disguise is the most effective means of transversing an area, despite it's suspicious as hell), it's still satisfying. In comparison to Blood Money where disguises were the be-all-end-all, IO revised the disguise system to where enemies who are dressed like you are will see through the disguise (they supposedly know who they work with, after all), while other people will simply assume you're supposed to be there (provided you have the appropraite disguise). For me, this was at first annoying, and then I realized its brilliance and logic, and adjusted accordingly. It does, however, need tuning rather badly, but it is most certainly workable. The biggest issue I have with the stealth system as a whole is the "Instinct" resource. It's consumed to blend in with your chosen disguise (and use a "mark and execute"-style ability in combat), and replenished when you kill someone. This means you CAN recover from mistakes at a cost (since Silent Assassins don't touch the world around them), but in the end it's a rather shoehorned system; I didn't feel it should have been used in this fashion, as it doesn't really make sense, but that probably comes down to the diguise system tuning I mentioned, so your milage may vary. However, Instinct is also used in "Instinct Mode", a vision mode that gives you x-ray vision, highlights useful/interactive things, and shows you NPC pathing. This was an interesting way of doing things, which I mostly found acceptable, if overpowered (seeing NPC pathing was a little much). It felt like a good way to show that 47 is beyond merely human in his abilities, which despite being a cornerstone of his character, is often glossed over or ignored.\n\nAs a Hitman game, however, Absolution is woefully bad. Levels are linear, with targets conveniently in your path to the exit. Sometimes, you don't even get to assassinate the target yourself; it's all done in a cutscene, or a forced psuedo-Quick Time Event. Other times, the game literally makes you fail, in the name of plot. Furthermore, gone is the personalized, sandbox approach to dealing with targets: you start with whatever equipment the game decides to give you, and you have no access to anything other than what the level designers have decided is a viable option, and deigned to leave in the level for you. Granted, finding these various ways the level designers want you to finish the mission CAN be interesting, it would have been a more complete exprience were this "find the method" combined with "bring your own toys"... much like Blood Money. That aside, the plot is laughably bad as usual, only this time the story is the center focus... making much of the game a cringe-fest. A further tragedy of the plot-driven gameplay is that, as mentioned, you are at times forced to fail in a cutscene. This has the added effect of not only throwing your hard work of, say, Silent Assassin-ing it up to that point, but also makes 47 look like an idiot. Lastly, the game has a weird habit of trying to force you into out and out firefights, but punishing you for trying to meet those apparent expectations (the mission involving The Saints comes to mind).\n\nHowever, the game world is amazingly alive, nearly on par with Deus Ex: HR, which is the most "living/real" game world I've ever had the pleasure of participating in. Conversations between NPCs are involved and varied, and delivered in an excellent manner (voice actor quality is unusually high for the throwaway NPCs). That being said, it's odd that most of the storyline characters and cutscenes aren't very memorable or impressive. A great deal of effort and money (see here) was put into making the cutscenes realistic and impressive, but I found that effort wasted on me; the story wasn't good to begin with, no amount of presentation is going to change that.\nI will, however, praise the visuals and effort of the IO art team; the game looks damn good. All animations except for 47's aiming animation (it's weird, no one aims like that) are very well done.\n\nSince I'm out of space, closing thoughts (TL;DR): It's a decent, even good, stealth game; but also, a disappointing failure of a Hitman game. Go into it expecting Splinter Cell Conviction with a viable Ghost approach, and you'll probably like it.\nScore out of 10:\n7/10 Stealth Game\n3/10 Hitman Game","July 10, 2014","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays more like a stealth shooter than a Hitman game. Checkpoints, when used, bring back dead guards and whatever trickery I had devised previously. The Instinct mechanic is ♥♥♥♥ing dumb and the point-and-click executions from the bad Splinter Cell games make an appearance. But when it remembers that it is Hitman instead of "Bald Guy With Gun Vs. Perverts", it recaptures some of the magic present in the franchise.\n\nSpeaking of the story: It is an embarrassing and repulsive Hollywood star-studded mess, even for video games. Sitting through the story is like being the friend of someone who intentionally impaled his own eyeball with a pencil before dressing up as a pirate, going to a nightclub, and greeting everyone with a hearty YARRR and a lifting up of his eyepatch to show off his self-inflicted injury. I wouldn't rag on this if the game didn't insist on making me pay attention to it, so well done. (On a side note, there's one villain who looks like Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation. I wish it were actually Ron Swanson, he would have been a better villain.)\n\nIt's a good stealth game and it's a good shooter, but it drops the ball when it comes to being a Hitman game.

It's actually one of the best ones in the series, it follows the core of the first two Hitman games to it's fullest and adds more, but the blindspot is that the game that made people freak about Hitman, was ofcouse Blood Money.\n\nI thought blood money was amazing, great Hitman game, but i knew it's open world would bite the series in it's ♥♥♥.\n\nThat's in the past now - I'm here to talk about Absolution.\n\nAbsolution starts off stunningly, you are on one of your usual silent assassin missions, your target is one of the few you have close to you, but your duty to uphold your line of work is always the focus.\n47, however soon discovers that nothing (as usual) is what it seems and is soon sent off to take care of .. a person. A kid at that.\n\nThe story warps from here on out, changing, getting crazier by the minute with it's conspiracies and dark as wormhole humor, clearly the work of Danes.\nThe controls are slick, the graphics is (as no one unbiased or fury-filled) stunning. The only problem i bumped into is the AI at times, along with the newly added "Instinct" meter, which to be honest doesn't really fit in that well. The story can run off track, but i feel like the ways it gets handled makes up for it and get you back on rails, THAT is what this game is, it's on rails, like the first one and mostly the second one was, you do have the opotunity to switch tracks, but you will always have a goal you need to follow to get on.\n\nThat said, this is a premium game, well worth every cent - and more!\n\ni give it 8/10, it's far from perfect but it's amazing and has a lot of content to offer, that and the taste and setting for a future  game (like Blood Money perhaps?) brings a lot of hope for IO Interactive","June 12, 2014","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are not an old player who's been watching 47 since the first episode of this game series was issued, I will recommend this game. If you are, I suggest you stay away from it. Because many traditional factors that make Hitman a Hitman are all abandoned in Absolution. In the traditional Hitman game, players can not hide their long rifle like what you can do in the GTA. However, in the Absolution , you can hide you rifle no matter how long it is . It's just like 47 has a dimension pocket which is owned by Doreamon. That's really unacceptable to an old player like me. Besides, the map of Absolution is not as open as the one in the tradional Hitman game. All in all, new players are good to play, old players should stay away.","June 14, 2014","false","79.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Искусственный интеллект, создает уникальную модель поведения для каждого отдельного персонажа, что делает действие более насыщенным и разнообразным. В игре есть и драки с бомжами, и боевые монашки, и салочки с вертолетом, и прятки в конопле, и побег из горящего отеля. В игре введена система особого рентгеновского зрения. Главный герой может смотреть сквозь стены, подсвечивая важные предметы, отслеживая самих охранников и даже маршруты их передвижения.\n\nВ игре  есть сетевой режим «Контракты». Это любительские миссии. Игроки выбирают локации из одиночной кампании, назначают жертв – любого человека на карте, выставляют сложность, ставят дополнительные условия, затем сами проходят это задание и публикуют его. Выполнение контрактов дает деньги, которые тратятся на открытие новых костюмов, оружия и апгрейдов, чтобы создавать еще более трудные контракты.

Hitman games are always judged harshly, because the concept is just so simple and wonderful: You are a silent assassin in an impeccable suit, contracted to kill various people around the world using a piano wire, high power sniper rifles, explosives, poison... whatever seems best suited for the job. It's perfect, but the truth is the games themselves never live up to the potential.\n\nThis one looks great and has some interesting setups, but most of the levels are just too small. Hitman usually comes down to a Groundhog Day to make the perfect kill: you explore the level, your possible weapons, disguises, distractions, exits, you experiment and restart... Restart after restart you figure out the patrol routes and your optimal path. But in Absolution, the most of the levels are just to small to really take in and enjoy. It forces you to replay it and try out new things to get the highest score, but it's just a hollow retread of what you've seen before.\n\nAbsolution isn't impressive storywise either, with lots of things not making scence and Agent 47 doing tons of stupid things when you aren't in control.\n\nOverall, Hitman: Absolution has its moments, but they are few and far between, it could have been a lot better.","June 2, 2014","false","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Go stealth or go loud, it's your choice. Every single mission has at least two ways you can complete it. The only gameplay weakpoint is that stealth is near-impossible in some areas, and it feels like the "loud" approach is encouraged at times. In my opinion, the story tries a little too hard to over-sex itself in a couple minor areas, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game or story.\n\nThis is one of the few fairly linear games I see myself replaying another couple of times. It's somewhat long, and the quality is incredibly high; I feel challenged to complete it on higher difficulties, as well as attempt some of the more difficult contracts created by other players.\n\nConsidering it's been on sale for ~$5 for the complete version, if this game hits that price again and you're on the fence, just buy it.

In addition, the game features Instinct Mode which allows Agent 47 which is your main character in this game to predict enemy patrol routes.In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency. The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown, in order for him to play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie. 47 learns that Dexter is in the "Terminus" hotel and after evading Dexter's henchmen, eavesdrops on him. 47 learns from Dexter's conversation with his secretary Layla that he plans to kidnap and auction Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to strangle Sanchez, Dexter's enormous bodyguard, who proceeds to knock 47 unconscious. After Dexter discovers who he is, he almost kills him, but decides as he doesn't want that kind of attention. Just then, a hotel maid comes in and discovers 47, thinking he is dead. Dexter kills her, plants the weapon with 47, douses the room in alcohol, ignites it, and leaves with Layla and Sanchez. Framed by Dexter for the murder, 47 escapes the hotel and evades the police.\n\nNow I'm not going to say any more of the story because i realy want you guys to take a look at the game yourselves and as always try not to be detected and stay unnoticed.\n\nHave fun playing Hitman Absolution!\n","August 9, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I really enjoyed the story of this game, the game play is primarily a stealth...I want to say puzzle game.\nLet me explain, there are usually multiple routes in each level for you to reach your goal, and figuring out each route an how to execute it (no pun intended) can be a bit tricky. Every mission you encounter has typically one of two objectives; reach the exit undetected, kill the target in an inventive/uninventive way and escape undetected. This of course sounds linear in level design, and in some instances it is.\nRegardless I think this game is worth the money you spend on it. The developers gave a good deal of thought on how this character would  complete his objective realistically. NPC behavior though predictable never left me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at its stupidity or god like behavior you see in many NPC behavior packages(damn NPC has aimbot ). The in game  textures are nice, and the outdoor environments were pretty enough to make me want to explore areas before completing a mission . Protagonist and antagonist character models are well done with NPCs getting the unfortunate short stick in the looks department.\nThe voice acting for this game is generally pretty good and the voices do seem to fit the character models spot on. However, there are rare occasions were the mouths don't sync up to the words (still better than almost any final fantasy created after 7).\nAgain, all in all, I found this game to be a good addition to the Hitman franchise only lacking a PvP mode for general fun\n","June 25, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed the film that released a few years ago, but couldn't get around to playing any of the games until recently. I'm to understand that Hitman: Absolution recieved mixed reviews for it's step away from the staples of previous games in the series. I'm also under the impression that this is the most "casual" approach to the franchise to date. Many felt that the game is too easy when compared to literally every other installment. As for my experience, I found this game to be a very enjoyable mixture of stealth and action. I've played through the game on normal and felt challenged, but rewarded for my achievements. Virtually every kill felt gritty and impactful. The stealth elements are solid, and though not without flaw, usually reward patience and punish mistakes. Even though I never intended to complete any achievements, I found that I was challenging myself to stay hidden and avoid using disguises as much as possible. This ended up extending the time needed to complete the campaign on normal by a few hours. Also, while the campaign only clocks in at about 8 hours, there is a ton of replay value here. Each contract can be handled in a number of different ways, and there are a wealth of weapons to implement. I have yet to even explore the "contracts" function that allows players to create and challenge others with custom missions. All in all, if you enjoy stealth games, replayability, cosplay, or are just looking for a gateway into the Hitman franchise, this is an excellent place to start.","August 1, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is rock-solid and challenges the way you think about stealth games. I played the entire game on "hard" mode, which was very challenging at times but felt appropriate for the style and format of the game.\n\nThe game is absolutely stunning even on medium settings and is fairly well optimized overall. All of the environments are engrossing and interesting and there's an infinite amount of ways that you can take advantage of the environments to beat a level. I'd probably say I didn't even see 30% of the game's environments solely due to how hard it is to get into certain areas.\n\nThe story and voice acting were generally on-point and I definitely felt like I was invested in the characters enough to care about advancing the plot. At times, I felt like some things weren't explained fully (though again, I wasn't going for completionism so maybe I missed things) but overall the story felt pretty bulletproof as you'd expect from Enix and IO. I'm definitely interested in returning to the Hitman universe in future installments of the franchise.\n\nAfter not playing stealth-action titles for a few years, Hitman is refreshing and highly entertaining.\n\nAbsolutely reccomended.\n\nI'll show myself out.","April 12, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphically this game is incredible, although cutscenes and the game look noticably different. Story is okay but I didn't really care about it in this game I just wanted to stealthily murder people. I first had this on PS3 and i played it how I prefer to play stealth games, kill most people unnoticed (the panther style in SC: Blacklist basicly). However the game only rewards you for playing it how the game wants you to: only kill targets (preferably by accicedent) and never get seen, which is the way I try to play it on PC. It's just a bit annoying seeing that -100 or whatever in the top left whenever you kill a non-target.\n\nNow we move on to the disguise system. Basicly for those who don't know, in this game you can kill people, once a person is dead or knocked out you can take their clothes. But the way it works is that if you get too close to a person with the same disguise then they will start to notice you, unless you use instinct (which also let's you see people through walls and stuff but runs out quite fast). This is the problem. For example, not every single police officer is going to know the face of every other police officer in America. But the owner of a mansion dosen't notice if his chef has a different face because they don't wear the same clothes.\n\nThe game gives you enough options as to how to approach most of the missions, with Chinatown being one of the best missions in the game. In the Chinatown missions (there are more than one) there are so many different ways to approach them. The more linear missions are okay but not as good as they could've been.\n\nOVERALL:\n-Graphics : 10/10\n-Story : 5/10\n-Gameplay : 7/10\nFinal Score : 7.5  (also happens to be the average)","August 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's obvious that the devs took hints from the current top selling games and shoved them into the franchise. I don't think that this was a bad choice, but it clearly changed the game so much that it felt more like an Action/3rd Person Shooter with Stealthsections instead of the other way around (like old Hitman games were).\n\nWhile you get most points for doing things stealthy, it never feels necessary to do so. In fact, most of the time you'll shoot your way through your victims. There is barely any punishment for that besides a massive impact on the Missonrating... which doesn't matter. Unless you are actually going for a high rating... higher ratings give you better perks for "Contracts" (another part of the game), and I don't know. Maybe 47 is using them automatically in Storymissions as well, didn't look like it though.\n\nThe biggest problem I am facing right now is, that I don't feel like replaying ANY Storymissions to go for a better score. Why is that? Because Hitman Absolution doesn't have the freedom I am used to in a Hitman game. Levels are a bit too small, barely any optional Routes which are worth taking. It just feels like your typical 3rd Person Shooter, which is sad.\n\nYou could argue that this makes the game alot more accessible to anyone new to the series and I recommend it to anyone who's never played a Hitman game, but to Hitman vets this is prolly more than dissappointing (enter Kevin Sorbo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O1hM-k3aUY).\n\nThen again. This game is NOT bad, even with all its flaws. It's still a really well presented Actiongame and everyone should play it, especially when it's on a sale again. It's just not what Hitman fans were looking forward to.\n\nOn a sidenote: The game looks fantastic and it runs really well, even on older rigs. I am rocking an ancient i720 (didn't have to OC, running at stockclock at the moment) married to a GTX670 and the game performed really well.\nThough, the Benchmark should be ignored. It doesn't really represent what you face most of the time in the game. Same goes for the Tutorial level. I had a few Areas where my FPS dipped below 40 (never below 30 though), but most of the time it was running at solid 60fps with everything maxxed, except for MSAA (is a performance killer in this game). Turned that off and used the build-in FXAA instead.","April 9, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I tried so hard to like it. I'm a fan of the series, but this just doesn't hit the spot. Aside from the story being throwaway crap (not that story matters in a Hitman game), the gameplay is sorely lacking. Far too many missions have you trying to inflltrate or escape somewhere, and there are far too few assassination contracts. The few that are there show promise, but the disguise system is pretty broken, and there's often only one or two approaches that can succeed, due to the extremely rigid AI. You'll either be checking walkthroughs or restarting far more frequently than you'd like.\n\nMaybe worth a look in a cheap sale ($20 or less), but I couldn't bring myself to finish it. At about 40 hours in (almost halfway - not because it's long, but because that's how often you'll be restarting if you want to be stealthy), I had to admit to myself that I just wasn't having fun, as much as I wanted to like it.","December 20, 2012","false","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gunplay is awesome, the story is AMAZING, and 47 is just as much an unrelenting killing machine as ever. It's definitely more action-oriented that previous entries, you can wipe out an entire level of people without much difficulty as long as you plan your hits right, and it sometimes seems to squeeze you into certain linear paths unlike previous games. I would compare it to another game I love, Max Payne 3, more than previous entried in the Hitman series, but in no way should that shouldn't stop you from picking it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bournestorm/recommended/203140/","bournestorm","Bournestorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bournestorm/","169 products in account","Bourne's Review\n-------------------------\nOverall: 7/10\n-------------------------\nPlot: 5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 8/10\n-------------------------\nPlot: Very weak. This is (To my knowledge) the first Hitman game where they really attempted to give more depth to the protagonist, 47's, character. And it..... left much to be desired. The overall plot within the game wasn't absolutely terrible, but very predictable after awhile and the ending was extremely anti climatic and quite frankly, stupid. This is mainly where the game falls flat on it's face for me, had the plot actually had some interesting points to it I might have really really enjoyed this game more, but it didn't. The characters were very colorful, but I never felt connected with them. That being said, I did very much enjoy the game overall, mainly because of the gameplay itself, where Hitman games really shine.\n-------------------------\nGameplay: The gameplay in both Hitman games I've played (Blood Money and obviously Absolution) have been exceptional (At least in my opinion) delivering exceptionally open ended levels with set targets or objectives, and plenty of optional objectives and challanges. To condense it,  a typical mission has at least a solid dozen ways to kill your target, ranging from a wide variety of methods. From poisoning, sniping, dropping objects on, pushing off cliffs, blowing up, planting explosives, shooting with a giant whale harpoon, disguising as a decorative samurai and stabbing as they walk by, spiking cocaine, dropping a car on them, embedding an axe in their skull, to electrocuting them, or setting up a gas explosion; the options are virtually limiteless. There are multiple ways to approach a target as well, from taking a maintenance uniform as disguise, to running in guns blazing, sneaking along back alleys, blending with a crowd, or disguising as a scarecrow and creeping through a cornfield. And of course, general killing and mayhem is super fun as well, tossing guys out windows, strangling, throwing a knife into their head, and then silently disposing of their body in a leaf mulcher - this Hitman game makes it just plain fun to kill people. And since that was, of course, the objective of the game, to kill targets, it nailed it. Combat and gameplay in Absolution is superb.\nThere is a very nice point system built into Absolution as well - the game automatically tracks your poitns (Based on how silent you are, headshots, signature kills, if you were spotted, etc.) and uploads those scores at the end of each level to their leaderboards. Then, if any of your Steam friends play that level themselves, they'll see your highscore displayed at the top when they begin, giving them a little incentive to try and beat your score, and vice versa. Some people do not like the points system but I thought it was a good way to encourage stealth and I found myself specifically reloading levels to try and beat my friends score.\nIt is also worth noting that Absolution can be a VERY, VERY hard game, if you want it to be. There are 6 difficulty settings in the game - the highest difficulty offers you no assistance from outside intel, much more enemies per level, much harder objectives, and overall increases the difficulty to near impossible, presenting even the most hardcore Hitman fans with crazy challanges.\nSidenote: If you have played Absolution and liked it, or are at all interested in Hitman games, I would recommend also checking out Hitman: Blood Money\n-------------------------\nGraphics: The graphics in Absolution are very very nice, and in many ways unique. The developers use of glare, bloom, and FOV make the game a bit harder to run for some, but pay off in very deep graphics. I did notice that the FOV and everything else combined, didn't present the most crisp graphics, but it did provide a very atmospheric feel to it, and certainly felt as if it fit the game. The colors were especially rich and vibrant. The settings in the game varied greatly, some missions were in noisey crowds in Chinatown, others in nightclubs, some in hospitals or secret facilities, and others in the dusty streets of small towns. These varieties in settings provided a constant changing backdrop to your murders and always presents new ways to kill.\n-------------------------\nReplayable? - Yes, the game has so many options of how to kill, as well as extremely hard challanges such as finishing everything silently, or 'Suit Only' (Meaning you complete everything without taking a single disguise) and offers enticing options for replaying missions.\n-------------------------\nBottom Line Recommendation: Hitman Absolution delivers very fun gameplay and a great challange on most missions, and while the plot felt weak, I would recommend the game.","January 24, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/recommended/203140/","Simolius","Simolius@AgualvaCity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simolius/","234 products in account","When Hitman Absolution was announced, people were afraid it would be another victim of the recent modernization of old video games that negatively affected games like Syndicate and XCOM. Well, that did affect Absolution, but it definitely didn't ruin it.\n\nThis time around, there's been a lot more effort put into the plot. It's the best story in the series and I must say that the ending is also great and very satisfying, no loose ends, some sequel bait but nothing too big. The characters are great, great voice acting, all good! The fact that the plot is a bigger thing does make the game A LOT more linear but nothing too bad.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good and very well optimized. I managed to run it on a stable 60 fps all the way through on an outdated laptop and the game still looks great after you lower the graphics. The pre-rendered cutscenes are a bit weird though, it would have looked better if they did everything in-engine.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty good. Shooting and moving feels way better than in the previous games, everything feels much more polished and smooth. The stealth is very satisfying, specially when you manage to pull off those awesome no-kill runs, the full-stealth runs and the "poisoned your coffee" assassinations. There are still a bunch of ways for you to kill your targets and it definitely still feels like a Hitman game. Unfortunately, the modernization of the gameplay has dumbed down the game a bit...\n\nNormal difficulty is like playing the tutorial of previous Hitman games. While a lot of levels are still very open and require you to kill targets, some levels are just corridors that require you to go from point A to point B or grab some important object or trigger some other event. You now have instinct, a limited ability that highlights interactable stuff, weapons and objectives, you can see people through walls, you can get past guards easier and it gives you hints on what you can do to complete the objective. Shooting is also much easier to do now thanks to the cover system and the point-shooting mechanic which allows you to mark targets and then shoot them all very quickly, so the guns-blazing strategy is more reliable than ever (but not as fun as the stealth runs). You can now hide yourself and dead bodies in boxes and cabinets, you can carry an entire arsenal and have it all hidden, you can pull people behind counters and break their necks and melee fights are now easy quick-time events. All of this makes both stealth and all-out action easier, which makes you feel more like a badass than in the other games but it removes a lot of the challenge.\n\nAnother thing that's a bit weird is the new score system. There's a score counter on the screen at all times and every action you make (or don't) can increase or deduct points from your final score of the level. What's weird about this is that sometimes you feel like you are not being properly rewarded/penalized for what you're doing. The game keeps deducting points for stuff that you feel shouldn't deduct points and sometimes you are give points for doing dumb stuff. I think some people would've prefer not to have the score system, I think I would as well. In the other games it was all about challenging yourself by creating your own challenges. Now it's about pleasing the score system...But you can always not give a damn about that and play however you want.\n\nLuckily for the big Hitman fans, the harder difficulties are great. The hardest one of all leaves you only with your crosshair. No interface, no instinct, no hints. You can definitely make the game more like the older games of the series but some parts of it are still much simplified.\n\nThe game also has a bunch of replayability. You always feel the need to go back to the story levels and get the best score you can, find all the collectibles, all the weapons and all the costumes. There's also a "multiplayer" mode called Contracts where you can create missions for other players to play and rate. You can still spend a lot of time in Absolution after you finish the story mode.\n\nConclusion: if you never played the previous games or if you aren't a purist when it comes to the Hitman series, Hitman Absolution is great game. If you have played previous Hitman games, this one is going to feel a lot less challenging but it's still a great game on it's own. Recommended!\n\nScore: 5/5\n\nSimolius - December 2014","December 30, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They also don't let you take the final kill in some of the boss shoot-outs but I still love the game, the gun mechanics are brilliant, the Instinct mode (similar to the Detective Mode in the Batman games) is fantastic and extremely useful (especially point shooting, i just LOVE THAT) and overall, yea its a brilliant game! 10/10!!!

Graphically this game is incredible, although cutscenes and the game look noticably different. Story is okay but I didn't really care about it in this game I just wanted to stealthily murder people. I first had this on PS3 and i played it how I prefer to play stealth games, kill most people unnoticed (the panther style in SC: Blacklist basicly). However the game only rewards you for playing it how the game wants you to: only kill targets (preferably by accicedent) and never get seen, which is the way I try to play it on PC. It's just a bit annoying seeing that -100 or whatever in the top left whenever you kill a non-target.\n\nNow we move on to the disguise system. Basicly for those who don't know, in this game you can kill people, once a person is dead or knocked out you can take their clothes. But the way it works is that if you get too close to a person with the same disguise then they will start to notice you, unless you use instinct (which also let's you see people through walls and stuff but runs out quite fast). This is the problem. For example, not every single police officer is going to know the face of every other police officer in America. But the owner of a mansion dosen't notice if his chef has a different face because they don't wear the same clothes.\n\nThe game gives you enough options as to how to approach most of the missions, with Chinatown being one of the best missions in the game. In the Chinatown missions (there are more than one) there are so many different ways to approach them. The more linear missions are okay but not as good as they could've been.\n\nOVERALL:\n-Graphics : 10/10\n-Story : 5/10\n-Gameplay : 7/10\nFinal Score : 7.5  (also happens to be the average)","August 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This made the game, for me atleast, a lot more interesting to do. But on the other hand, just like with the assassin's creed series, I somehow prefer the idea of 'You-have-one-target-and-find-a-way-to-kill-him'. I missed this in the campaign itself, but with the second gamemode, Contracts, they made up for it.\n\nThe campaign:\nIt truly is a good campaign, it really keeps you attention as you try to figure out what is happening and try to solve your problems while you sneak past countless enemies and killing them one by one in silence. You also can pick up weapons to unlock them in Contracts.\n\nContracts:\nThis was probably the best about the entire game. You, a friend, or just any person can go into any level of the campaign and create targets, so creating a contract. But you just don't say like "kill that target", making the levels impossible, you really have to play through the level, kill the targets you want to kill and set your own highscore for others to beat. So not only will you show them that it is possible to do, you also show them that they can do better. This truly is amazing. But I have to warn, some people that are really good at this game can make near-impossible levels with near-impossible scores, which can be frustrating. But other than that, this gamemode is really, really fun.\n\nGameplay:\nJust like any other stealth game, you walk around crouched, sneak around enemies and then kill them. You can even dress in a certain uniform to hide in plain sight, but when you behave suspiciously or enter prohibed areas for that uniform, the enemy will question you and eventually kill you.\nThe control combinations are really good, but then again, I played with controller...... so I can't say much about the keyboard, but I guess it shall be fine.\n\nWeird things:\nNPCs never notice someone missing\nThey don't think that a large, musculair, bald man in a uniform that his friend just wore minutes ago is suspicious\nThey don't see you when your head is sticking out above the ledge of the fence you're hiding behind and they are straight looking at you\nThey don't see you when you are peeking from within a closet or something when they look at you\n\nAlso, the graphics look amazing and some scenes are really beautifull. And you rarely see any dublicated NPCs walking around\n\n\nOther than all this, this game really is a lot of fun and I definatly recommend it","February 6, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are not an old player who's been watching 47 since the first episode of this game series was issued, I will recommend this game. If you are, I suggest you stay away from it. Because many traditional factors that make Hitman a Hitman are all abandoned in Absolution. In the traditional Hitman game, players can not hide their long rifle like what you can do in the GTA. However, in the Absolution , you can hide you rifle no matter how long it is . It's just like 47 has a dimension pocket which is owned by Doreamon. That's really unacceptable to an old player like me. Besides, the map of Absolution is not as open as the one in the tradional Hitman game.

The gameplay is rock-solid and challenges the way you think about stealth games. I played the entire game on "hard" mode, which was very challenging at times but felt appropriate for the style and format of the game.\n\nThe game is absolutely stunning even on medium settings and is fairly well optimized overall. All of the environments are engrossing and interesting and there's an infinite amount of ways that you can take advantage of the environments to beat a level. I'd probably say I didn't even see 30% of the game's environments solely due to how hard it is to get into certain areas.\n\nThe story and voice acting were generally on-point and I definitely felt like I was invested in the characters enough to care about advancing the plot. At times, I felt like some things weren't explained fully (though again, I wasn't going for completionism so maybe I missed things) but overall the story felt pretty bulletproof as you'd expect from Enix and IO. I'm definitely interested in returning to the Hitman universe in future installments of the franchise.\n\nAfter not playing stealth-action titles for a few years, Hitman is refreshing and highly entertaining.\n\nAbsolutely reccomended.\n\nI'll show myself out.","April 12, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has interesting story, visuals, characters as well as gameplay.\n\nThere are two modes in this game, the single player mode named absolution and contract mode.\n\nThe single player mode features a great story in which we play as agent 47 to carry out assassinations on targets in beautiful and immersive environmental set pieces. There are around 20 levels which takes place mostly in Chigaco and Hope town. Levels are broken down into several sections in order to make gameplay much more digestible as they are served in bite-size portions.\n\nPlayers are also scored for almost every mission and with the inclusion of the leaderboard, it makes the game highly replayable for me as I would want to replay every mission in order to beat the scores of my friends and be at the top of the leaderboards.\n\nLists of collectables in each level are also featured at the end which enable the player to know which collectables they have collected and the ones that they have not. This give players who are completionist an additional task of replaying that particular level and finding the rest of the collectables.\n\nAlthough you are able to complete each mission on a variety of ways, this game highly emphasizes on stealth as you are given more points for being stealthy such as hiding bodies and remaining unseen, while going in guns blazing would give you a low score as you are given negative points for every NPC you killed that is not the targets.\n\n\nContract mode enable players to create their own contracts by marking any target in any of the single player levels and playing it in order to prove that it can be completed before other players are able to attempt their contracts. This help extends the game replayability as I am able to play through other player's contract and attempt to kill their mark target in the same fashion that they did and vice versa. Completing contracts award players with money which they could use to unlock disguises, weapons or weapon parts.\n\n\nThe only major gripe in this game would be that it could be extremely frustrating and challenging to play through in the higher difficulty levels such as expert and purist mode. There are also minor bugs in this game such as character's clipping issues with clothing which is very obvious in a level called blackwater park with the character Layla as you can see some patches of the clothes clipping into the skin.\n\n\nTo summarise:\nPROS:\n+Great Gameplay\n+Great Visuals\n+Memorable Characters\n+High replayability\n+Cool looking disguises!\n+Contract Mode\n+Great voice acting\n+Score System and leaderboard\n\nCONS:\n-Bugs like Clipping issues\n-Ridiculously challenging in higher difficulty level\n\nOverall I would give this game a 8/10 which is a fantastic game!","March 4, 2015","true","105.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Obviously some huge, sandbox-style, open levels would be nice, but this Hitman tried something new which was to make it a checkpoint based game with an action-movie storyline.

The stupid "Instinct" rubbish ability, which was one of the thing the devs talked about a lot, and maybe a bit too much.\nNow here's what this does: It allows you to see through walls and conceal yourself while wearing a disguise. The whole game revolves around this stupid (dis)ability), and when I say revolves... It's like the whole game was designed for this feature alone.\nWhy is this feature stupid? For one, it's basically some sort of wallhack, sure you can NOT use it, but, and this is the 2nd reason why it's stupid, as I mentioned above, the WHOLE game... Is tailored for this feature.\nSay you knock-out a cook, or a janitor, or any innocent law abiding citizen, and then steal his clothes,  well guess what: ALL his lil' buddies will see through your disguise. If you want to avoid being detected, you can use up your instinct to... try to hide your face. INSTINCT... HIDE YOUR FACE... The simple fact that they see through your disguise so easily is stupid enough.\n\n"Hardcooooooooooooreee" as I am, I like playing first playthroughs in the hardest difficulty a game might offer. The highest difficulty in this game is Purist: Extremely limited HUD, NPCs reacting much faster, reduced player HP, all that good stuff that makes a game fun, not to forget, perhaps the most important thing, less "instinct".\nWell guess what? Thanks to the whole "Instinct being a big deal" deal, the game is ruined. Yes, RUINED.\n\nAll in all, this could have really been a true Hitman game successor, but unfortunately end up being a completely forgettable experience that pales in comparison to what 47's previous adventures were like before.\nCome for the Legendary Agent 47, don't stay at all, leave as fast as possible in fact.","December 22, 2012","false","41.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Later levels seemingly have unavoidable bottle-necks to where you will end up shooting your way out of a bad situation 90% of the time.\n\nthe rating system (Specialist, Veteran, Professional, Silent Assassin) isn't very clear. 47 is naked without his signature items for a good portion of the game. The detection system seems to have a mind of its own sometimes....\n\nThat being said. Its a decent stealth game. It looks decent as far as graphics go, but they still took some shortcuts. I'm glad i bought it on a steam sale as it is definetely not worth the full price.\n\nIts the usual one playthrough game as acquiring money/upgrades is completely irrelevant.\n\nthe create-a-contract mode is a complete fluke as well.

It has interesting story, visuals, characters as well as gameplay.\n\nThere are two modes in this game, the single player mode named absolution and contract mode.\n\nThe single player mode features a great story in which we play as agent 47 to carry out assassinations on targets in beautiful and immersive environmental set pieces. There are around 20 levels which takes place mostly in Chigaco and Hope town. Levels are broken down into several sections in order to make gameplay much more digestible as they are served in bite-size portions.\n\nPlayers are also scored for almost every mission and with the inclusion of the leaderboard, it makes the game highly replayable for me as I would want to replay every mission in order to beat the scores of my friends and be at the top of the leaderboards.\n\nLists of collectables in each level are also featured at the end which enable the player to know which collectables they have collected and the ones that they have not. This give players who are completionist an additional task of replaying that particular level and finding the rest of the collectables.\n\nAlthough you are able to complete each mission on a variety of ways, this game highly emphasizes on stealth as you are given more points for being stealthy such as hiding bodies and remaining unseen, while going in guns blazing would give you a low score as you are given negative points for every NPC you killed that is not the targets.\n\n\nContract mode enable players to create their own contracts by marking any target in any of the single player levels and playing it in order to prove that it can be completed before other players are able to attempt their contracts. This help extends the game replayability as I am able to play through other player's contract and attempt to kill their mark target in the same fashion that they did and vice versa. Completing contracts award players with money which they could use to unlock disguises, weapons or weapon parts.\n\n\nThe only major gripe in this game would be that it could be extremely frustrating and challenging to play through in the higher difficulty levels such as expert and purist mode. There are also minor bugs in this game such as character's clipping issues with clothing which is very obvious in a level called blackwater park with the character Layla as you can see some patches of the clothes clipping into the skin.\n\n\nTo summarise:\nPROS:\n+Great Gameplay\n+Great Visuals\n+Memorable Characters\n+High replayability\n+Cool looking disguises!\n+Contract Mode\n+Great voice acting\n+Score System and leaderboard\n\nCONS:\n-Bugs like Clipping issues\n-Ridiculously challenging in higher difficulty level\n\nOverall I would give this game a 8/10 which is a fantastic game!","March 4, 2015","true","105.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the gunplay to the sneaking mechanics everything is smooth and well balanced. The options given to you throughout each level are just enough to keep things fresh and entertaining while keeping the flow of each level steady and not dragging it out too far.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bournestorm/recommended/203140/","bournestorm","Bournestorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bournestorm/","169 products in account","Bourne's Review\n-------------------------\nOverall: 7/10\n-------------------------\nPlot: 5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 8/10\n-------------------------\nPlot: Very weak. This is (To my knowledge) the first Hitman game where they really attempted to give more depth to the protagonist, 47's, character. And it..... left much to be desired. The overall plot within the game wasn't absolutely terrible, but very predictable after awhile and the ending was extremely anti climatic and quite frankly, stupid. This is mainly where the game falls flat on it's face for me, had the plot actually had some interesting points to it I might have really really enjoyed this game more, but it didn't. The characters were very colorful, but I never felt connected with them. That being said, I did very much enjoy the game overall, mainly because of the gameplay itself, where Hitman games really shine.\n-------------------------\nGameplay: The gameplay in both Hitman games I've played (Blood Money and obviously Absolution) have been exceptional (At least in my opinion) delivering exceptionally open ended levels with set targets or objectives, and plenty of optional objectives and challanges. To condense it,  a typical mission has at least a solid dozen ways to kill your target, ranging from a wide variety of methods. From poisoning, sniping, dropping objects on, pushing off cliffs, blowing up, planting explosives, shooting with a giant whale harpoon, disguising as a decorative samurai and stabbing as they walk by, spiking cocaine, dropping a car on them, embedding an axe in their skull, to electrocuting them, or setting up a gas explosion; the options are virtually limiteless. There are multiple ways to approach a target as well, from taking a maintenance uniform as disguise, to running in guns blazing, sneaking along back alleys, blending with a crowd, or disguising as a scarecrow and creeping through a cornfield. And of course, general killing and mayhem is super fun as well, tossing guys out windows, strangling, throwing a knife into their head, and then silently disposing of their body in a leaf mulcher - this Hitman game makes it just plain fun to kill people. And since that was, of course, the objective of the game, to kill targets, it nailed it. Combat and gameplay in Absolution is superb.\nThere is a very nice point system built into Absolution as well - the game automatically tracks your poitns (Based on how silent you are, headshots, signature kills, if you were spotted, etc.) and uploads those scores at the end of each level to their leaderboards. Then, if any of your Steam friends play that level themselves, they'll see your highscore displayed at the top when they begin, giving them a little incentive to try and beat your score, and vice versa. Some people do not like the points system but I thought it was a good way to encourage stealth and I found myself specifically reloading levels to try and beat my friends score.\nIt is also worth noting that Absolution can be a VERY, VERY hard game, if you want it to be. There are 6 difficulty settings in the game - the highest difficulty offers you no assistance from outside intel, much more enemies per level, much harder objectives, and overall increases the difficulty to near impossible, presenting even the most hardcore Hitman fans with crazy challanges.\nSidenote: If you have played Absolution and liked it, or are at all interested in Hitman games, I would recommend also checking out Hitman: Blood Money\n-------------------------\nGraphics: The graphics in Absolution are very very nice, and in many ways unique. The developers use of glare, bloom, and FOV make the game a bit harder to run for some, but pay off in very deep graphics. I did notice that the FOV and everything else combined, didn't present the most crisp graphics, but it did provide a very atmospheric feel to it, and certainly felt as if it fit the game. The colors were especially rich and vibrant. The settings in the game varied greatly, some missions were in noisey crowds in Chinatown, others in nightclubs, some in hospitals or secret facilities, and others in the dusty streets of small towns. These varieties in settings provided a constant changing backdrop to your murders and always presents new ways to kill.\n-------------------------\nReplayable? - Yes, the game has so many options of how to kill, as well as extremely hard challanges such as finishing everything silently, or 'Suit Only' (Meaning you complete everything without taking a single disguise) and offers enticing options for replaying missions.\n-------------------------\nBottom Line Recommendation: Hitman Absolution delivers very fun gameplay and a great challange on most missions, and while the plot felt weak, I would recommend the game.","January 24, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's obvious that the devs took hints from the current top selling games and shoved them into the franchise. I don't think that this was a bad choice, but it clearly changed the game so much that it felt more like an Action/3rd Person Shooter with Stealthsections instead of the other way around (like old Hitman games were).\n\nWhile you get most points for doing things stealthy, it never feels necessary to do so. In fact, most of the time you'll shoot your way through your victims. There is barely any punishment for that besides a massive impact on the Missonrating... which doesn't matter. Unless you are actually going for a high rating... higher ratings give you better perks for "Contracts" (another part of the game), and I don't know. Maybe 47 is using them automatically in Storymissions as well, didn't look like it though.\n\nThe biggest problem I am facing right now is, that I don't feel like replaying ANY Storymissions to go for a better score. Why is that? Because Hitman Absolution doesn't have the freedom I am used to in a Hitman game. Levels are a bit too small, barely any optional Routes which are worth taking. It just feels like your typical 3rd Person Shooter, which is sad.\n\nYou could argue that this makes the game alot more accessible to anyone new to the series and I recommend it to anyone who's never played a Hitman game, but to Hitman vets this is prolly more than dissappointing (enter Kevin Sorbo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O1hM-k3aUY).\n\nThen again. This game is NOT bad, even with all its flaws. It's still a really well presented Actiongame and everyone should play it, especially when it's on a sale again. It's just not what Hitman fans were looking forward to.\n\nOn a sidenote: The game looks fantastic and it runs really well, even on older rigs. I am rocking an ancient i720 (didn't have to OC, running at stockclock at the moment) married to a GTX670 and the game performed really well.\nThough, the Benchmark should be ignored. It doesn't really represent what you face most of the time in the game. Same goes for the Tutorial level. I had a few Areas where my FPS dipped below 40 (never below 30 though), but most of the time it was running at solid 60fps with everything maxxed, except for MSAA (is a performance killer in this game). Turned that off and used the build-in FXAA instead.","April 9, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the first couple missions I got that hang of how the game wanted me to play and I stopped expecting it to work like Blood Money. Absolution is a different beast altogether, and you have to acknowledge that in order to actually enjoy the game.\n\nI feel that Blood Money gave you more options when completing a mission. Blood Money is mechanically the better game, in my opinion.\n\nAbsolution has new mechanics like instinct, but I don't think it's a necessary addition. While it's possible for the player to just ignore instinct, it feels as though the map design was done with being able to see through walls in mind.\n\nStealth in absolution is forgiving, to say the least. You have a small window between when the enemy spots you and when they come after you. This small window isn't very small. You can basically sneak from point to point uncontested despite being in clear view half the time. There is less planning than there was in Blood Money. In Blood Money you had to wait and figure out the enemy's patrol route before executing your path. Getting spotted was more deadly.\n\nAbsolution emphasizes stealth less. I hate that games these days are being made easier and easier in the stealth department. Especially for the Hitman series: this is a stealth game, why take away game mechanics that encourage it?\n\nStill enjoyed the game immensely though, in the end.\n\n---\nIf you enjoyed Blood Money, I think you'll also enjoy Absolution IF and only IF you don't expect it to be like Blood Money.","January 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
