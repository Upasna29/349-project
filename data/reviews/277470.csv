It is a standard old-school, turn based battle JPRG along the lines of the Dragon Quest or and original Final Fantasy series with a lot of emphasis on exploration. The dungeons are big, open and detailed. They have a lot of interactive objects with loot hidden in more than just chests and dressers. You will find plenty of characters to join your party hidden throughout the game. These include cows, chickens, men hiding in baskets. Again, you are rewarded for exploration in big ways.\n\nThe game feels free and open after the first area where you can go virtually anywhere you can walk to if not fast travel for gold. Each town feels big, and there are small settlements littered throughout the world map that add a lot to the game. You'll find merchants, shops, shrines and quests in each town, settlement and castle. My only problem is the world map itself for the most part are literally lines of land instead of big expansive plots of land like the towns and dungeons are big and ripe for exploration. The one problem with such big towns is that there is no run button.\n\nOnce you've gone through a tunnel, you have an option when going back into it whether or not to simply travel through it or go into it. Its a nice time saving feature that feels like its not padding the game with wasted time, but you can still go through for those that want to.\n\nWhen you start the game, you'll find a choice of casual mode or normal mode. Normal mode feels easy enough, but casual mode has random enemy battles less frequently and you regain health after each battle. Its good to have a choice for people just looking to plow through the game. The random battles are not painfully frequent like in old school Dragon Quest games. Its more like every 40 paces or so. You will find enemies in walls or thieves attack on over world bridges. There are tutorial books littered sparingly throughout maps and having a tutorial book seems odd instead of just having NPCs explain things to you if not have an extensive help feature in the menu.\n\nThere is little enemy variety in the game and you'll see the same enemies from area to area, which is a disappointment. A few enemies are reskins, which I'm fine with, I just wish they did different things. The combat feels pretty shallow and you can use a 'rush' (autobattle) for 99% of battles. The battles are turn based, where you select everything that your party will do on their turn of the battle ala old school JPRGs, then when everyone knows what they'll do a turn happens based on their speed. Quicker characters will take their turn first. It is as old school as possible straight down to map movement moving you an entire body length with each press of the left, right, up or down.\n\nThe skills in battle seem underwhelming if not almost useless except for certain circumstances. At least every character has their own skills so everyone feels unique. You'll gain more skills as you level up. You can even change characters on the fly with the party system. So if you have 3 dead party members, swap them out with living members. There are skills and items to revive people of course.  With the excess amount of accessories, you'll be able to craft the character's stats and resistances to your preference. You'll have to chose different weapons based on stats, do you want this sword to make your character speedy at the cost of damage or have a heavy damager that is slower than enemies? It is a nice sense of freedom from typical armor and weapon upgrades.  It adds something to replayability since you can customize your party so much.\n\nOne downfall if not exploit I have found that I can have 3 party members block and my main hero can destroy every boss. Some bosses throw waves of enemies at you before you get to battle them, which I suppose is a unique take on boss fights, but it could also be seen as useless fluff.\n\nThere is an Asian style to the game that makes it feel fresh, even if I suspect the graphics are from the Samurai DLC pack instead of custom. Even with an Asian style, the characters speak with modern words like 'dude' and 'cool.' I think the game is in on the joke and embellishes on it.\n\nBook of Legends feels very dialog heavy, and offers some fun banter between characters when you search or find treasures, but the actual story is just far too dialog heavy for me and I found myself skipping through everything said. Even the NPCs have a good amount to say instead of just one line throwaway statements. It adds to the immersion even if I can't be bothered by the story when its just paragraphs of dialog.\n\nYou can save in most every settlement, but there is an autosave feature and your main hero can save and fully recharge his energy. Its nice to have just before a boss.\n\nWith all of that being said, are there better RPGs out there? Yes, but this stands out as being better than 99% of the RPG Maker games out there for its sense of exploration, freedom to do as you please and make your own party, customizations and all. I am a big fan of customization and freedom. Is it worth $15? Probably not. Maybe $5 hits the mark.","October 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 111 of 121 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","111","121","0","0"

I hate to dump on indie game developers, but I really can't recommend this game.\n\nGranted, I only played a few hours, so maybe it gets better, but in the time I played the fighting was pretty uninspired. I mostly found myself just fight-buttoning though the same troops of enemies again and again, and I didn't really have to deploy much strategy apart from "One of my moves can only be used with 4 or more enemies, so use that if there are 4 or more enemies."\n\nI really don't care for the writing either. The dialogue between characters seems like a nonstop train of snarkiness that is trying to be playful and funny but I can't say I laughed at any of it. I am 27 and sort of jaded. I may have found it funnier when I was a teenager I suppose. I spent most of the game with two party members, and then when another was potentially going to join me, I had to choose between her and the one I already had. These characters were very cliched "young cute love interest" and "mature sexy woman love interest" tropes straight out of any cheesy harem anime.\n\nWhen I first saw signs of the inevitable relationship building between the two charactres  I had in my party, it felt extremely forced and stereotypical. All of a sudden the hardened ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ warrior reveals a deeper side through referencing his tough childhood. Of course.\n\nThe art is good, and the plot was at least interesting enough to keep me paying attention to it for the short time I played. The dialogue, characters, and combat are what ultimately made me give up on this game after just a few hours. Best of luck to the developer on future games, and I hope my rather harsh review has at least a little bit of helpful criticism.","March 24, 2014","false","5.4"," 193 of 259 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","193","259","3","10"

The fact that every time one of the characters makes a 'joke' the author had to add 'ahaha' at the end of the line really gets to you after a while. The dialog is lengthy and not well written. It's also quite repetitive and after some time you really have to force yourself to still pay attention to it.\n\nIt's a typical RPGMaker game in presentation, but I have to admit that the graphics and music are well chosen, The locations are again lengthy and exploring them grants you a lot of usable items, but sadly not enough equipment. Which brings me to my main complain about this RPG.\n\nThe game is unbalanced. Heavily unbalanced on multiple levels. The first 'dungeon' is far too easy and your character way overpowered. You continue and gather other characters and the game is still way too easy and that's not because I gained too many level early on. A level up in this RPG basically has no effect on your combat performance except when you get a new skill. The increase in HP and attack power are so minimal that it's hardly worth to grind at all. In terms that means that you have to rely on equipment to give you the needed boost to get better in combat. For a good amount of the game that doesn't matter much as the 'mob' fights are ridiculously underpowered and you won't have a problem at all, but in boss fights it shows that something isn't exactly working out. You can still push through those with a bit of tactic and luck, but it's starting to get really frustrating.\n\nAt some point the game forces you to play as a group of characters that are completely underpowered. Only one of them has magical abilities and they aren't very powerful. This is when the game grinds to a halt. You can't make them stronger by leveling up nor can you get better equipment. So every tougher fight is a pure gamble if you'll get through.\n\nSo far that's not too bad, but add to that one enemy that always attacks first, has a quite strong AOE spell that costs you about 50% of your HP and is nearly not hittable because it dodges every attack. I'm not kidding. In random encounters those enemies flee after a couple of rounds, but then you run into a forced encounter with three of them and they don't flee. I tried it five times, each time grinding a level for each character more and there's no way to get past them except for getting extremely lucky and hitting them with every attack.\n\nI don't like not finishing a RPG, but this one is just so annoying to play that I won't try to push through. Don't waste 14 hours on this one like I did and get a better RPGMaker game instead.","August 11, 2015","false","14.3"," 78 of 91 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","78","91","0","0"

The game features some really nicely detailed artwork, character portraits and profiles are especially well-done.\n\nBattles play out in the expected manner typical of the genre, with combatants taking turns to attack each other, use skills, defend, etc. There are plenty of skills on offer for each of the characters, ensuring that combat doesn't become tiresome. Many skills take both your character's statistics and enemy numbers into account, allowing for a decent amount of strategising during combat. New skills are unlocked as your characters gain levels, providing new ways to overcome enemies. Encounters sometimes start with an ambush, or with you ambushing your foes, which mixes things up somewhat when you're fighting. You always have the option to run from battle as well if you don't fancy your chances against your adversaries. The enemy sprites are all quite detailed, with some quite elaborate designs in there too. Status elements, both positive and negative, element-based skills and weaknesses are all present and accounted for and as always, monsters drop both exp and gold when defeated. Equipment can be attached to five different slots per character, comprising of weapon, shield, helmet, armour and accessory respectively. I've yet to complete the game (and by all accounts it's a sizeable adventure) but what I played was well-balanced in terms of challenge and I never felt the need to level grind. The bosses represented a reasonable challenge but nothing insurmountable. The encounter rate is nicely balanced (with different rates for the game's two difficulty modes) and doesn't feel too frequent or intrusive as you explore various locations in the game.\n\nThere's good attention to detail in the environments, treasures are scattered throughout each area, encouraging players to venture off the beaten track. The tilesets that make up the game's locations are well-utilised to minimise repetition, with little touches such as animals being scattered throughout the many locales adding life to the world. Another thing that impressed me with the environments was the amount of scenery that be interacted with to elicit some type of comment or remark from your character, a little detail that is far too often overlooked, especially in modern titles. It really harks back to the glory days of the 16-bit rpgs and some of the habits players picked up during that generation are recognised and rewarded here. It's a very self-aware game and it uses that to subvert the player's expectations at several moments during the game - there's plenty of flavourful dialogue and choices, primarily from the main character, Jordan and it only gets better as additional characters join the party, there's some entertaining exchanges between party members, even early on in the game. Indeed, the entertaining ensemble is definitely one of the highlights here and In some ways it's quite reminiscent of the self-satire seen in the Disgaea series, though the script could use some editing here and there to give it a little extra polish before it approaches that level of finesse.\n\nIf you were a fan of 16-bit era rpgs and lament their absence in recent years, I'd expect that, like me, you'll find something to love here. It's good to see more titles like this finding a home on Steam.","March 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 124 of 162 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","124","162","0","4"

The price is currently at 80% of Baldur's Gate, and the price is higher than several far better JRPGs.\n\nEssentially, this game seems like a very high quality work of a high schooler, who put a lot of work into it. There is a story, many areas to discover, a variety of companions to join the party, and lots of optional sidequests.\n\nThe weakest point of the game is the intro. For the first hour, combat is trivial, boring, and unavoidable. Gamebalance also often relies on the player doing some things which the player can't know about - Didn't find some hidden party members? Combat will be easy until the next boss fight, then you're screwed. Didn't grind to buy that awesome sword before moving to the next continent? You'll now have to grind at least 30 minutes more to become strong enough to continue.\nThis will get better over time. Once there are ~6 party members all at level 20-30, combat becomes less trivial and the game doesn't try as hard to screw you for not findiong a hidden party member or item.\n\nThe second weakest point is the writing. The dialogues are okay, but not great. This is where the impression that the game was written by a high schooler comes from. Humor is attempted. The entire setting is not fleshed out and the story is simple. There is dialogue tough, which does at least make the party members somewhat likable.\n\nThe third weakest point is the combat system. Some stats make a huge difference, but the entire combat system is not documented, not even on the developer's forum. You have spells to create or cure status effects which are not explained. You have abilities that cannot be used in some fights. You have new weapons that increase the damage dealt by a factor of 10 or 20.\n\nSUMMARY: The story is weak, the game takes a while before combat becomes non-trivial, and in the early game the game balance often depends on doing things "right" without having any clue what "right" is.","May 16, 2014","false","43.5"," 95 of 122 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","95","122","0","0"

The skills and combat seem good, and the dialog isn't bad. Although as other have said, it seems every other line from the main character is sarcastic.\n\nThe main breaking point for me is the leveling. I was somehow able to beat the first boss, mainly due to the fact the main character has a skill which makes the first chapter a cake walk. But the next area, I got one shotted time and time again.\n\nMy main character is able to withstand any foe, but every supporting character I have just gets 1-2 shotted. I even tried grinding a bit, but after several hours? (it felt like that), I feel my characters still aren't there. The weapons and armor didn't seem to help much, and many items seem very expensive for the area.\n\nI would recommend this game to someone who has a kid that can burn many hours on it, but as far as JRPGs go, I think your time is better spent elsewhere.","May 28, 2015","false","10.1"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","58","68","0","5"

Casual mode slightly lowers the encounter rate, allows partial healing after battles, and auto-saves after every fight as opposed to after every ten fights.The Book of Legends plays out similarly to a Star Ocean game in that the overall plot, including major boss battles, is scripted while player decisions influence the trajectory from Point A to Point B.The game has 31 potential party members, including a slew of talking animals, so players have a lot of characters to keep track of.The game requires some grinding here and there, but unused characters gain partial EXP from battles. Babysitting is unavoidable, especially when new recruits join at low levels, but partial EXP gain is better than none at all.The best part of The Book of Legends is the music.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/277470/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","Book of Legends is one of the best RPG Maker JRPGs I've played so far.  The battle mechanics are very basic - you have your Fight, Skill/Spell, and Item options, as well as Rush (everybody attacks random enemy) and Escape, but it's the quality and quantity of content that make this game.\n\nThere are tons of playable characters, and most of them are well written and often have something interesting and/or funny to say when you speak to NPCs.  Jordan, the main character, is, well, an ♥♥♥, who doesn't shy away from telling people what he really thinks of them, or from poking fun of standard JRPG tropes such as NPCs who just stand around saying the same line all day.\n\nI was surprised when the game offered me the choice to kill the first potential companion who offered to join, a cute anime girl at that.  There was very reasonable (paraphrased from memory) explanation of "You just tried to kill me, and when that didn't work you know offer to work for me?  How can I trust you not to try to kill me again when my back is turned?"  I chose that option, and the story went along with it.\n\nBy the end of the game you'll have many characters accompanying you - some optional, some required.  You can only have 4 members in the active party, but you can juggle your party around any time outside of battle/cutscene.  Inactive party members still gain experience when the party wins battles, but at a greatly reduced rate.  Still this keeps them useful when it's time for boss battles which often require you to field two to three non-overlapping parties for concurrent fights.\n\nThere are tons of side quests, secrets, items, spells/skills, etc to keep a JRPGer occupied, and I found the story and dialog well written and engaging.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the main character is ridiculously overpowered for the starting area, and can still easily solo most enemies for some time afterwards - but he is supposed to be a badass after all.  Don't worry, battles come soon where you actually have to rely on your companions.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that while the game has "random" encounters, the time period between the encounters is not random.  In Casual difficulty you'll have an encounter every 50 steps, and in RPG difficulty every 40 steps.  I found this a very welcome change of pace from JRPGs who seem to throw you into combat every couple steps.\n\nMy only issue with this game was from the UI perspective.  It's generally pretty good, but a couple pieces of missing functionality stood out:\n\n1.  The game has plenty of status effects which your characters can deal out or be dealt in combat, but no explanation of just what those effects do.  "Poisoned" and "Paralyzed" are self-explanatory, but "Diseased", "Dazed" and "Distracted"?  And after beating the game, I still don't know what the difference between "Paralyzed", "Lost" and "Numb" is (though based on observation I think Lost enemies took more damage or were more susceptible to critical hits).\n\n2.  When shopping for equipment, you only see which of the 4 characters in your active party can use any given piece - to know if any of your dozen+ reserve members can use it before buying, you gotta swap them in.  And lack of item descriptions for equipment in the inventory means that not only do you know know which character can wear that "Full Moon" you just found, but until you find one that does you don't even know which equipment slot it's for!\n\nTL;DR I recommend this game to any fan of the JRPG genre.","July 20, 2014","true","44.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

I almost NEVER replay games more than once because I have only limited time.  However, the Book of Legends was enjoyable enough that it makes me want to replay to see a different ending and try out different characters.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy unique characters, meaningful player decisions, important party decisions and an oldschool style of difficulty that features some tough boss fights and requires a bit of leveling up.\n\nWhat sets this game apart from others is the fact that you make actual meaningful decisions that can affect the plot, your party's competition, and the ending.  There are 31 characters in the game (some are well hidden) and you get to pick who to allow to join you, who to use, who to level up etc.  It's pretty interesting and it isn't simply about leveling up the "4 best" characters.  Some boss battles require you to have 2 or even 3 parties of 4 characters so your choices about who to pair together adds an element of strategy.  In the first few hours of the game, decisions you make will actually affect you throughout the game, which is pretty rare to see these days.\n\nEach of the characters have interesting personalities and are pretty unique.    They have fun personalities and the dialogue between them is often funny and usually interesting and well written.   The main character is a bit of a jerk and very sarcastic with often hilariously rude replies.   The plot itself is quite good and there's lots of sidequests. I finished the game in about 39 hours, completing 8 of the 27 quests.  I also did some optional stuff in the arena.  The speedrun for beating the game is 20 hours or less, but I recommend taking your time and it would be pretty difficult without building up a few extra levels as well.  There's lots of NPCs to talk to in each town and lots of side paths to explore in both the dungeons and world map.\n\nThe Book of Legends reminds me of an oldschool RPG in that it can be quite difficult.  Combat can be pretty challenging, especially bosses.  Even when I thought I'd powerleveled quite a bit for a boss fight, I'd end up getting a challenging fight so that was enjoyable.  When you reach a new area on the map, the regular enemies are pretty tough but as you level, they get easier.  Combat itself is pretty good.  There's a nice "rush" feature that lets you stomp easy enemies quickly,\nthe characters have quite a few skills and it is cool to try different combinations of parties.  You also have the choice of trying to keep all of your characters high level, or just focusing on certain characters.\n\nThe world itself is quite huge, dungeons are big and sometimes require multiple visits to get all the way through.  There are many hidden areas in the game.  Finding hidden secrets in dungeons and even on the world map is fun and rewarding.  It is also worth noting that there is a strategy guide available for sale on Adorlea's website.  I finished the game without it, but I did read up on the forums a few times.  I played the game in "RPG" mode which is the more difficult version of the two.\n\nAs far as negatives, I would say that the first hour of the game is actually the worst.  For a long time, I was lost in the forest with a stupid dead rooster, wandering aimlessly.   Luckily, the game gets a LOT better.  Also, you can get a free sample of the strategy guide which has a map of the forest, which I found was the most confusing map in the game.   The economy in this game is VERY tight.  The best weapons and armor are EXPENSIVE and even getting enough healing and magic potions\ncan be pretty expensive.   Also, due to the difficulty of bosses, you'll need to grind levels for both money and xp.  This can be a bit dull, but it was pretty much the norm for old school RPGs so I didn't mind it too much.  I probably spent about 3 to 4 hours building levels and getting money (while raising up weaker characters as well) out of the 39 hours played.\n\nThere are a few optional bosses that are really really tough and the game doesn't necessarily warn you about it, which I didn't like.  (The cave early in the game is the worst offender) Just remember to save before a boss and that you cannot beat everything right when you fight it. Some stuff you have to come back for later.\n\nOverall, the Book of Legends is a real gem of an RPG.  The unique characters, humor, strategic party composition, important player decisions, solid plot, and massive replayability make this game stand out.   There's a bit too much grinding but the end result is well worth it.  The only game I could compare this to might be Suikoden V, due to the amount of playable characters in both games.  However, the characters in BoL have more personality and you get to choose which ones to use in a more impactful way.

With my ever growing library of hundreds of titles gained with bundles or purchases on the Steam market, I now have time to tell the world what I think.\n\nWhen you start BoL, you will get bored, the game DOES in fact pickup after about an hour or so. The start of the game is just anticlimactic and that's not so bad, many RPG or JRPG can start off this way. Once you really put in the time you will notice that BoL has loads to offer you. You will acquire and have many companions to chose from in your party's organization, with different equipables and abilities. This can be quite nice over some other RPG Maker titles that only give you an initial party and about 3 hours of game play. You also have a nice variety of side quests and the main story to keep you entertained for a number of hours and I have seen players reach over 50+ hours when going to fully complete the game.\n\nThe main thing that BoL has going against it is the large price of $15. This price isn't that intimidating when picking up the game from a bundle, trade or Steam sale. So I recommend buying the game when it's on some sort of sale.\n\nI'll be giving this game a 8.5/10 and strongly recommend you give it a try and remind you again to at least play through the boring intro to hit the games real stride of content.","May 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

I played the original version for the first time two years ago and I loved it. Since the game is now on Steam, I'd like to share my impressions here:\n\nIt starts quite "traditionally" - a simple task for a "saviour of the world" hero. Things become more complicated very quickly, though. I won't spoil the story, but let's just say it's both adventurous and thrilling, with plenty of twists. Plus, the main protagonist isn't the "classical" hero. He's more selfish and self-centered, which adds spice to the story.\nChoices have impact on the story, too. You can't have all characters in the same playthrough, because you have to choose between some of them. This alters dialogues, accessible areas and battle strategies.\nSpeaking of characters, there are plenty of them, both human and animal. Some of them like each other, some of them don't, so party banters are really entertaining sometimes. Some of the characters are even more powerful when fighting side to side.\n\nFights are classical turn-based, but with lots of added depth - countering spells and attacks, equipment for regenerating health or mana, multiple-hits weapons etc. Difficulty tuning is great, normal fights are easy (especially with top equipment), but boss battles are really tough, often with adds and multiple rounds, requiring different parties and strategies. For extra challenge there are also arena (Colliseum) and "challenge tower".\n\nThe gaming world is fairly big, with many town, dungeons and hidden places. Dungeons have many sideways and optional areas, usually with stuff that is worth the extra effort. "Exploration pays off" is certainly true when it comes to TBOL. Once you go through a dungeon for a first time, you can automatically "go through" next time. This makes exploring more enjoyable, too.\nProgression through the game is quite nonlinear, especially when playing on RPG difficulty. There are many optional places you can visit, but you aren't strong enough for them yet. This makes you to backtrack from time to time and test your newly acquired "toys" (= spells and equipment) against tough enemies.\nThe replayability is also pretty good, considering all the choices and secrets that are often easy to miss.\n\nOk, to sum it up. We have good story, dialogues and gameplay. It's a "solid foundation", but what really makes TBOL so special in my eyes is the the sense of achievement, the way how the game rewards you for knowledge of its mechanisms and thorough searching. You can rush it on lower difficulty and call it "fun". But try again in RPG mode, with all sidequests and bonus stuff, and it's a completely different experience. And then, when you unleash all of your hard earned powers against an enemy you previously considered to be challenging, you feel as true heroes. Few games can make this that well.\n\nFor me, TBOL is definitively "more than sum of its parts". I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I strongly recommend to test the demo and give it a chance. Even now, after two years, when playing it again, the game still amazes me.","March 15, 2014","true","11.3"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","51","80","0","0"

I've always been hesitant because RPG Maker games, a genre that I like very much (if well made), are often not being treated with much love here. Seeing the release of The Book of Legends made me change my mind.\n\nThis game is not just "well made", it's fantastic. It's undoubtedly one of the best games I've ever played.\nAt first I felt a bit repelled by the main protagonist. He's really not what you'd expect a hero to be like. He's grumpy and rude and not friendly at all, but the dialogs with him turned out to be a lot of fun to read, much like dialogs in general contain a lot of humor in this game. What makes them even more interesting is that they depend a lot on who you have with you. For instance, a conversation with an NPC guard in the town Zenna is hilarious - but only when playing with Princess Melusine.\n\nWhich leads me to the greatest feature of the game: You can choose who to play with. Several times you'll have to decide whether to keep or get rid of characters and who else you want to add to your party. There's a variety of different combinations, which makes replaying the game a whole new experience. All the characters have different skills and abilities and different strengths, so you'll have to come up with new tactics in every playthrough. In addition there are loads of hidden characters to discover, like animals that will support you with their special skills. One animal for instance can decrease the chance of being ambushed, which helps tremendously in a certain area. There are also some very valuable, yet optional human characters that will join you (if you find them).\nWhat I appreciate a lot is that not only the actively fighting members level up. Also the rest will gain experience points, so you don't have to spend hours on grinding.\n\nMaps are made with much love and many details. Exploring thoroughly pays off as there are loads of secrets to be found, including some unexpected things like a chest that will refill several times during the game. Also there are many sidequests to solve, and some are pretty tricky!\nYou can even unlock new places to visit, for instance as a reward for finishing a quest.\nAlso, the artwork is stunning. The characters look just amazing.\n\nThe battle difficulty depends on whether you choose "Casual Mode" or "RPG Mode" at the beginning of the game. Casual is easier, plus you gain back some HP after each battle, which is a great help and you won't need too many restorative items. You can get through the game without doing a lot of levelling up - although the boss battles can be quite tricky and tough, forcing you to choose your parties wisely and use the right tactic. Very thrilling and a lot of fun!\nFor me Casual Mode is exactly the difficulty that I like; it's very well balanced.\nThus I personally haven't tried RPG, but it's certainly a much bigger challenge.\nThe game features random encounters, which at first I wasn't too happy about. But the encounter rate is perfect, so fighting doesn't get boring. Also, there's such a big variety of enemies, so battles are quite diversified.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is the way the Colyseum is set up. Much too hard at the beginning, so you gotta keep it for later. The humans enter in pairs, but you can only put in every character once, which will be reset every time after killing a demon. You can't return there after every demon though, so if you keep it until late in the game, you can't have all the characters participate.\nIt's not really disturbing though since the Colyseum is 100% optional and not important at all for the game.\n\nAll in all the game is awesome. No matter how many times I play it, it never gets boring. I highly recommend everyone to give it a try - maybe even those people who don't hold RPG Maker games in high esteem. Give it a chance, you might be positively surprised!\nI would love to see more games like this on Steam in the near future!","March 23, 2014","true","49.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","1"

The game itself is pretty basic, you fight similar enemies with similar skills the whole way though. Once you get a few more party options the game gets a little more interesting. I am satisfied with the amount of grind to it (so far very little), but the combat is uninspired to say the least. I have to say that the story and characters are well worth pushing through the game. They interact enough that they're memorable, but not so much that the game is centered on interactions.

The main character is a little annoying, but in a likable way for the most part. The flavor text for checking random things in the environment and responses to NPCs are very enjoyable and I think what really makes this game worth the play through. It's also rather expansive. I can normally keep track of the map of a dungeon in my mind as I play through an RPG, but most areas in this game are so large that I can't do that in TBoL. I like to explore everything, so it lead to me being really overleveled at the end of the game.\n\nThere is nothing special about the combat. There are a couple of fights that you have to figure out the tricks to win them, but all and all, very run of the mill. You occassionally have to split your party to take care of multiple fights at once, I found that more annoying than innovative, but that's just my own 2 cents.\n\nI will say some of the character interaction is just downright silly. You beat a boss, and then you're given the option to kiss one of your team mates. No, that's a terrible way to do that. This does not happen in normal interaction with people. You don't just kiss people because YOU want to. They should have added some text that suggests the character would like to kiss you as well, and then give you the choice. It's a two person action, and I find it almost borderline offensive that it's handled the way it is. But that really is its only flaw. And I'm sure many people played it without taking issue with that portion.","March 8, 2015","true","46.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The game begins with Jordan, a man on a delivery of utmost importance, who is promptly robbed on the first night of his journey. He teams up with some unlikely allies (including a chicken…) and goes in search of his lost item. Presumably other hijinks ensue, but I didn’t make it far enough to find out.\n\nI honestly thought this game sounded cool, and it definitely has its good points, but ultimately I ended up giving up on it in pretty short order. I generally like the silliness of the game: being able to recruit a chicken is rather novel, and I found having a protagonist as evil-looking as Jordan to be pretty amusing. I also like the snappiness of a lot of the dialogue, but unfortunately its implementation (phrasing, I guess?) feels very unpolished, which detracts from its overall appeal. The story hook was pretty mediocre; not super interesting, but not a deal-breaker in and of itself. What really killed it for me was Jordan himself: I found his character to be unsympathetic and generally unlikeable.\n\nIn another genre, an annoying protagonist is surmountable, but in a JRPG, where the gameplay is usually the weakest part, there has to be some combination of character- and storyline-investment to incentivize grinding onwards, and I just couldn’t get invested in this game.\n\nThis game definitely has some good points, and I think that other JRPG fans who find Jordan less grating might enjoy it. Personally, though, I have enough other unplayed games of this genre in my library that I can’t imagine ever coming back to it.\n","January 21","false","2.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The difficulty is balanced, with some combats very challenging if not prepared. There are a lot of hidden things to find out, a lot of playable characters you can get in your team (some hidden ones too, and sometimes only recrutable in a given period of time), so you can go through some playthrough and experience different things (a few characters can only be recruited by leaving other behind; there are at least two moments where you have to decide between some characters of others).\nOn the other side, there are some flaws in my point of view : the impossibility to ajust the image ratio in fullscreen, some information not clearfully displayed (like, in combat, you can't see what is the max hp or mp the character has, but only the current amount he has), some status not explained (there is a big variety of status you can get or inflict in combat, some classic and well known, like paralyse, poisoned, silenced, but other original and you can't always tell what they do, like lost, scared, ... ; also, you have more caracteristics than in most games, without really knowing their effects, like you have physical defence and magic defence, but you also have resistance, an it might be difficult to choose which one is the most important and therefore, choice of armors and accessories can be difficult).\n\nOverall, there is a good complexity, a lot of searching for those seeking to find everything, a good story, despite not very original and a good gameplay, despite a lack of explanation on some features.

I enjoy how retro games hide items here or there.  But this game PRIDES itself on it.  It just got to the point where I quit caring because I was tired of clicking on every little thing.\n\n-The storyline is pretty bland.  I understand that the creators took the time to make this game in RPGMaker and had a story they wanted to tell.  Sadly, it never clicked with me.  Some of the reviews said the game was/is humorous.  If it is, it was mostly lost on me cause, I don't think I laughed once.\n\n-Here's something else.  When I decide to review a game, I like to play and see all of it.  So I looked into the official guide for this game.  Now its cost $6, which I refused to buy.  Why?  $6 isn't bad for an offical guide but its WORTHLESS.  The only reason you could possibly need a guide for in this game would be to find all the secret/hidden items.  Well, the guide DOESN'T DO THAT.\n\nAs a musican, freelance voice actor, youtube video and amatur film maker.   I get this is a indie effort.  I'm not hating on that.  What I'm saying is, I LOVE me some retro RPG's.  But this didn't really feel like one, instead it just reminded me more that I could be playing a better one.","April 23, 2015","false","35.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

It is a long game with plenty of replay value. The artwork is beautiful. It's settings and characters are very oriental depicted. There are 2 levels of choice to play. No secret rooms as such but plenty of hidden items in all areas. The characters have many facets to themselves and there is a lot of humour throughout the game. Levelling up is a must as they aqcquire better magical skills and a lot of these skills are required. With 28 side quests as well as the main storyline gives this game it's most appeal and length. There are 18 humans - some only available on re-plays, 12 animals plus 1 demon to have in your party list so making the game rather interesting. There are multiple endings depending on your choices throughout the game. A "go-through" is availble after you have finished some areas. The story line centres on finding and stopping demons arising to take over the country and Jordan ( the main character and very egoistic) is given the task to stop the 1st one arising but things do not go as planned and so the real task begins.  The Book of Legends depicts when and where these events will occur. Battle scenes are the usual rpg type and are random encounters. An auto-save  is available and Jordan  also has a save spell. Turorial books are in most areas for help. Party splits are also used in the game. The sprites depicting each character are very artistic and beautiful. Overall it is a very interesting and colourful game to play and I would much recommend it to players.","March 31","true","77.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Really. It has a charm to some of its dialogue that is rare and on the strength of that, combined with its semi-open world approach to plot, I was actually going to recommend this. That is, until I moved on, away from the main land the game starts on. Suddenly, the game went from LOLERSKATE city difficulty (even on HARD) to MELT FACE!!! Difficulty, without so much as a 'by the way, YOU"RE GONNA DIE OUT THERE!!', beforehand.\n\nIOW: The first 2 or so hours are actually worth playing. That is until it becomes IMPOSSIBLE to play.\n\n...\n\n\nFull Review Points:\n\nPro:\n- Charming Banter:\nThis is the first RPGMaker game I've played that gets the banter on point, and in character, most of the time. Combined with meeting some really ODD people in the world, I had to list this as a pro.\n\n- Exploration Encouraged:\nThis is a mixed bag, as you may find yourself obsessed with checking every possible object in the game for potential loot... OR you can do what I did, and simply check the ones on your route and ignore the rest. I still managed to find 2 extra party members and several equipment upgrades this way, so I figure it’s a bonus worth a pro.\n\n- Open World Questing:\nThis is the FIRST RPGMaker game I've played that allowed for side quests to be completed BEFORE you know about them. At least two of them, I didn't even know I had completed until I met the NPC that gave them. The banter even included the surprise that the player accepted a quest they knew they had already completed, and how wrong it felt... This is something more games should do.\n\n\nCon:\n- The intro forest is WAY TO LONG, WAY TO BIG, and WAY TO EASY:\nIt sets up the player to expect a cake walk, only to be insulted and smacked in the face for their trouble, by the time the actual difficulty curve sets in.\n\n- Overpowered until Underpowered:\nThe main character is WAY overpowered until suddenly he isn't, and it occurs without ANY warning. And good luck keeping your optional party members alive... It’s a practice in frustration, and futility.\n\n- No Fast Travel or Sprinting:\nBack tracking is a problem... There are no easy exits to ANY area. And at least one quest had you re-enter an area you already cleared AGAIN to find a new hidden object. It is lame... LAME. But forgivable. It wouldn't be so bad if the back tracking was for a GOOD REASON and had worth wile rewards. But it doesn't.\n\n- Grinding Required:\nEquipment upgrades are few and far between. Optional party members join your party at extremely LOW level, requiring a ton of grinding if you hope to keep them alive longer than ONE hit, and that is BEFORE the difficulty spike from hell.\n\n- The intro, is BADDLY translated... Or filled with lazy typo's. Both possibilities are terrible.\n","June 13, 2015","false","4.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

The plot has twists and turns, but nothing that feels arbitrary; it all hangs together.\n\nThere are two main pathways you can choose – you can even choose to kill off a potential main character if you want.  The pathway you pick opens up different possibilities for the characters you can play, and even within one particular pathway you have great choice over which characters to recruit.  This is just one reason why it has such excellent replay value – you can vary the strategy enormously depending on who you recruit.  In addition to the obvious choices there are optional characters you can find.  This means that you are not just stuck with the A team plus a couple of add-ons; you can (and in some places must) play a wide range of characters with their differing skills and abilities.\n\nMaps are excellent and there are plenty of  rewards if you are prepared to explore.  Side quests add even more interest.  With challenging and entertaining gameplay, lots of varied enemies and plenty of secrets to find, the length of gameplay is not the result of padding but of enjoyable content.\n\nThis is a must-have for any fan of the genre.\n","March 14, 2014","true","45.5"," 59 of 115 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","59","115","0","4"

Especially considering that Final Fantasy VI is my all time favorite video game ever.  So when an RPG Maker game comes even halfway to the point of FFVI's brilliance, it's worth playing.  Granted, I haven't played a ton of this game so far and may update my review later.  Additionally, I'm only playing in Casual Mode, so I can't speak to the RPG Mode's balance/grinding aspect.  (I don't have nearly as much time for games as I did in my youth, so the Casual Mode saves a lot of time for my adulting responsibilities.)  Only down side for me so far is that the main character is a complete jerk.  Fine narrative, but I tend not to root for these kinds of characters.  Aside from that, there's lots to explore, side quests, and even a rooster companion.  My ultimate point is that I've spent money on giving other RPG Maker games a chance in the past and gave up on some within minutes.

It's story rich with easy controls with simple,  straight forward Level-Up progression. You level up quickly as random encounters are frequent and productive.\n\nMy biggest beef so far is that the Map of the world is farily useless. You can't zoom into portions of the map or even see where you currently are so I find myself just wandering around quite a bit, covering the same ground over and over.

However, things go unfortunately wrong and ends up plunging you into a quest to try and take out all of the other demons. To finish this quest, you'll need to recruit numerous allies to aid you. Thankfully, the game provides 31 potential allies for you to recruit. These allies range from being a chicken to a celebrity, and there's even a dragon you can recruit in!\n\nIt's a good thing the game provides so many characters though, even if some are quite well hidden. The Book of Legends has a major love for giving you party splitting sections, ranging from just a few battles to entire dungeons. I really disliked these sections as I've never really been a fan of things that force you to have split parties. Thankfully the game does give experience to those characters who aren't in your active party (though the experience doesn't spread out to those in a split party, at least I never noticed it doing so).\n\nWhile I heavily disliked the party splitting, I did enjoy The Book of Legends overall. There's a lot to do, especially for folks who are completionists, and the story is fairly enjoyable.","September 28, 2015","true","22.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

That's the biggest headache with this game. To get to a boss battle and advance the storyline, the player has to encounter about a hundred battles against the same kinds of enemies ove rand over. There's no way to avoid it and considering that many of the dungeons are mazes, the chance that the player has to backtrack paths is very high and hence even more boring battles with endless minions. The actual battle system is the typical I power up and hit you, you hit me, I heal sort of routine so it's really not much fun. Because of all this, I have to not recommend this game unless you're willing to go through all of it.

To some people, yeah but not for most. There seem to be a good amount of choices to be made (I don't know how much they affect the story but they seem to have a pretty big effect on the dialogue). Also, there are lots of things you can miss so if you're into that kind of stuff then this game might be for you. So far the combat has been pretty much nothing but smashing the action button but I am playing on the easier mode so that probably has something to do with it.\n\nThe writing isn't great and so far the story seems pretty uninteresting. Not much to say about that. If you're expecting serious dialogue you're going to be disappointed as there doesn't seem to be much of that.\n\nAlso, it's an RPGmaker game so don't expect graphics settings. Or pretty much any settings.\n\nThe music is pretty horrible.\n\nLots of sidequests.\n\nThe control scheme is extremely odd. It has the standard JRPG arrow keys, action button and back/menu thing but the action button is enter and the back/menu button is esc... But C and X seem to work too so that's good (and by the way you can't rebind the keys, at least not in-game) Oh and you can also control it with a mouse but I don't really know about that. And my x360 controller kinda worked too. Kinda.\n\nI bought it when it was on sale for 75% off. I don't think I would recommend paying the full price. Actually, I definitely wouldn't recommend that.\n\nSoo if it's not 75% off right now, wait.

Vocabulary is maybe fifth grade level? Use some bigger words.\n\nDialogues are poorly written. Characters are immature. Kids act like kids. Adults act like kids, which in some cases are acceptable but if it's all the time, it just becomes annoying. It's ok to have one annoying character in the party but not all of them.\n\nCharacter actions shouldn't go into the dialogue box. It's like reading a play and the character is only acting out half the actions in the parentheses. There should be an additional animation, sound, or thought bubble.\n\nCultural themes are inconsistent. Everything looks mostly Asian. Then suddenly there's a cross. Then someone quotes from the Bible. I understand that this is technically a completely different world but it's still very confusing.\n\nDungeons are way too big for not having a map. It gets incredibly frustrating to go through them.\n\nBattles are unbalanced amongst both characters and enemies. Characters are either way too strong or die too easily. Enemies from one dungeon to the next have too big a gap in level. Most people will not want to grind 20 levels before entering the next area.\n\nAbilities and the battle system are poorly explained. For anyone who plays enough turn-based rpg's, it's no big deal. We can figure it out. For anyone else who's playing this type of game for the first time, the introduction is horrendous. No tutorials whatsoever.\n\nArtwork is good, although I'm not particularly picky about 2D graphics as long as everything else is good.\n\nPart of me wants to keep playing because I do like exploring all the areas but I think I'd have better use of my time doing something else. People often complain about "RPG Maker games" but I think the game engine is actually pretty good.

If you love randomly pressing the action button on every damn thing on every damn map every damn time, you're going to love this game, because they encourage and nearly require you to do so in order to not wang yourself.\nCombat plays out like RPG maker games do, and if you're familiar with Laxius Power/Force games from years ago, you'll know exactly how to game the system. And if you don't, it's this: biggest numbers for lowest cost, repeat.\nThe story was everything I expected having played Laxius Force 1-3--characters with personalities dealing with global threats that no one else seems to be bothered with undertaking (and they note this, I guess to add humor?). There is plenty of dialogue to read, and it can change based on characters recruited/etc. Seriously, this is a fleshed out universe, but it's one that feels devoid of soul.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the second hour or so of this game, I just don't want to spend the amount of time required to complete this kind of game anymore. We all have to grow up sometime, and jamming the action button against everything just isn't fun for me anymore.","September 28, 2014","false","7.8"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Two, I have only played the first hour of the game, so I haven't got much for the plot. The Book of Legends is an RPG by Aldorlea Games, made in RPG Maker VX (From what I can tell with my minor experiencewith the software) and features a lot a options for both your party, and your competionist fantasies. For those who like old school style RPGs, this is the game for you, and it's definitely worth the money. The game is very nonlinear from the hour I've played of it, and the gameplay really feels like a Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest game (Before they went to ♥♥♥♥, you know what I'm talking about, Sqeenix). If you want a big world, this game has you covered. Trying to get to the town of your first quest would be hell if it weren't for the almighty fast travel mechanic, and exploring is rewarded with two things- A. Bears, bears everywhere. And B. TONS OF LOOTS. The plot is fairly complex, but not to the point where you go "What the hell is happening?". But, after all these good things, I do have some pretty big complaints with the game. First and foremost, not ability to change the sound volume. Music is either on or off. Secondly, no resolution options, now if your playing Windowed mode, that's just dandy. But if you're not and you have a 1080p monitor like me? Prepare to have your eyes fly out of their sockets from the amount of straining you'll do. My third and Final complaint is the most minor of the three, but I think that the 360-pad controls are to slippery. If they gave us the ability to use the D-pad, this would not be a complaint at all. So my point is rather moot, but in the end, this is a good game I recommend picking up if you have the money!","March 14, 2014","true","3.5"," 28 of 68 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","28","68","0","0"

Here's the good.  The character art is pretty nice and the sprites, while definitely RPG maker, are different than what we are used to with the Asian themes.  However.  Combat is painfully boring.  I like the fact that the developers are up front with people about when you will encounter battles and Jordan, our lead, has some cool abilities, but it's basically, spam attack until they die for far too long.  You can get lots of characters, but....that doesn't make them all good...or even fun.  The music is pretty forgettable too...Asian themed, but just not interesting or energetic enough to keep my playing.\n\nI will say, I wish this was better, cause I like the story and character dynamics.  Jordan isn't a hero or an anti-hero, but kind of just a rude ♥♥♥♥...who is still likable.  He has a code of honor against thieves, prefers staves because he never wanted to be a professional fighter even if he is the strongest guy in the world, and has plenty of snarky interactions with other characters and items, particularly Jasmine, who often insults him for his stupidity.  But, the story moves too slow and the grammar on display here is laughable.\n\nIf this game had a lot more polish and was more interesting to actually play, combatwise, I'd recommend it.  As is, only try it if you are a big fan and can tolerate RPG maker-esque games.
