Not just adding features along the way, but also implementing user feedback (ranging from bug reports to game suggestions) from the community. They devs are super approachable, but stay true to the game and their vision.\nThis isn't EA reviving an old franchise to churn out ♥♥♥♥. This is cool dudes making a cool game: we actually care edition.\n\nEven so, that's not enough. I'll tell you why I have faith in this project, despite it's early access status:\n\nRob spent a lot of his free time to update the PC port of Rollcage, 15 years after it's initial release, to please old fanboys who couldn't let go of the game. I'm talking rewriting the rendering engine, rewriting of the audio engine, rewriting of the networking system, all to make it work better on modern operating systems.\nNow he's working on GRIP, earning less than he would have working a regular job, but he's doing it out of love.\n\nDavid is another one of those blokes who worked on the original Rollcage games. Obviously he's not nearly as amazing as Rob, but this guy went dumpsterdiving (in his attic) and dug out some sweet nostalgia from the Rollcage developing-days for us to gaze at.\nAlso, this man made a few of the Rollcage tracks many have grown to love (or hate) and was the producer of Stage II. Dude's an expert on making you feel good. He made me feel good and I want him to do it again.\n\nChris is the one who got the project started and he's cool as a cucumber. He knows that if he messes up in any way, people will come to stalk him in Canada.\nLuckily, for his own sake, he hasn't messed up yet and actually gives the impression that he 'gets' what people want/like.\nProbably has something to do with him being a fan of the Rollcage games as well.\n\nThere are quite a few more helping hands behind the scenes, but I honestly haven't communicated with them all that much yet.\n(Despite it being super easy[forum.cagedelement.com]).\nEither way, this game is in good hands.","February 3","true","48.7"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","71","75","9","1"

The driving is satisfying, the combat feels brutal, and the current tracks are all both fun to drive on and beautiful to look at. The only real problems I have with the game outside of current lack of content are more of personal preferences and small balance issues that can and will be fixed throughout the development of the game. Once this game gets multiplayer and a few more tracks this will be a definite buy for those looking for a fun, high skill high depth kart racing experience.","February 14","true","7.2"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

The current version gives us on the plate three game modes (Race, Arena, Playground), one car and plenty of stages for now. The single problem I had so far was the lack of control, steering of the car proved to be really difficult and I could not maintain my first place at all, I hope it is going to get fixed as soon as possible for a smoother gameplay, I pretty much felt like a newbie. It is one of the few cons I've found so far in the game, the rest of it is simply divine.\n\nGameplay\nGoing onto the game modes, race let us compete against computer controlled cars with some intense combat in the package, basically high speed chasing after the first place with miniguns and missiles. Sad thing is, there's only miniguns, two types of missiles and landmines so far and I'd love some more diversity in the weaponry, but it's early access so they'll probably develop some more in the meantime. While racing gives us a combat for the first place, arena is a merciless carnage where all drivers are put to fight against each other with the mentioned arsenal at disposition along with a speed boost and shield (They are also in the race mode, do not fret) powerup. Then, comes the playground mode where it pits the player to find all the 42 packages on a map that looks like a construction site but also gives us a few hints as of what destruction to expect later on (In the site map you can destroy walls, pillars) yet I ran into the problem that if you crash into certain places and get stuck you can't respawn but to exit and restart it from the start.\n\nGraphics\nThe stages are pure eye candy, just stunning and extremely detailed even for the ones that are prototypes. They all have a different setting which makes them unique but, there's something that bugs me and those are the barricades in the tunnels which are really easy to hit and can make you fall down in the leaderboard to the last place quite fast.\n\nOST & SFX\nThe soundtrack? Drum and bass is enough for an eargasm and some chills down the spine as you destroy your way to the first place!\n\nShould you buy it?\nGrip is already a masterpiece and has met my expectations. You should buy it as soon as possible, because this is a gem that shouldn't be missing from your game collection and its the best experience you can get for this price.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","February 5","true","1.0"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","34","41","5","0"

We need more of these combat racers.  The graphics engine used is perfect, Unreal 4 does a great job here.  For an early-stage alpha, it shows great promise.\n\nThe problem is that I think the controls are a little sluggish.  I can notice at least a 0.25s input lag on every turn of the joystick.  It made it difficult to play, to be honest.  I'm normally very good at racing games, but this game made me feel like I had never played a racer before.  Each time I had to avoid an object, it was like I pressed the controls too late.  Even on easy mode, with the rubberband "catch up" mode enabled, I can barely avoid make last place in a race.  It's actually almost impossible for me, and when I compare my reaction times with something face paced like Race The Sun, this game feels like there is an old grandma at the wheel.  PLEASE make the turning reaction quicker!\n\nThere are only a few modes right now; racing, arena, and playground.  Racing I found too difficult due to lag, and that leaves arena as a focus point.  Well, there are machine guns and rocket launchers.  It's very ordinary.  We need many, many more weapons to make it interesting.  But it's a good start.  Playground could be fun, but there's only one map right now, they should let us explore the racing maps and arena maps too.  In the one "construction" map, there is some fun to be had here, but a problem I had is that you cannot respawn.  If you get stuck, you need to exit and enter the map again.  There are 42 packages to find in the playground map, but you need to find them all before you get stuck somewhere, as every time you reload the map you need to start over.  Lame!  Let us just find all 42 packages once, or at least remember which ones we previously found, otherwise it's not an easter egg hunt anymore.  A fix for this would be to make the respawn button just respawn us at the beginning of the map.  Also, in playground mode there is some excellent examples of map destruction (walls to destroy, pillars) which I suppose are previews of what to expect later.  These are really cool.  But for some reason you can't play local co-op in playground mode.  This would have been the most fun!!!\n\nThe map design for the races are done very well.  There are only a couple that do not have "VERY EARLY ALPHA PROTOTYPE" plastered all over the thumbnails, but to be honest they are all very good.  It was never the maps that threw me off, and they are all very unique and well though out.  Except that one where you go through tunnels and have to somehow fit in a pathway that is the width of the car.  Please remove or limit the size of these little barriers.  I have never been able to make it through that gap.  It's a problem.  Especially with how sluggish the controls are.\n\nSo overall, the game is very hard to recommend.  However it IS an early access alpha, and it looks great.  It feels right, but not tight.  It's just in need of a few more maps and weapons before it's ready.  The hard part is done, now they just need to finish it.  I'm really looking forward to seeing patches for this game come rolling down the pipeline and to watch it progress.\n","February 4","true","1.1"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","7"

Grip, made up of pretty much some big time vets that worked on the originals, they have created, just a small slice in EA, of that high speed, authentic future sci-fi combat racer along the likeless of Xtreme G Racing, F-ZERO days and to a lesser extent Wipeout. With 3 tracks currently, 1 playground and 2 arenas, it's only just launched publicly as I've been a part of private access for a little while now. With a handful of powerfups from miniguns, rockets, seeker rockets, mines, speed boosts and shields with many more to come, even the early combat is feelign strong. My play time doesn't quite factor in the full story as i've probably done about a 100 racers in this so far and wow.\n\nIt stands on it's own from Rollcage even though it is very very like it (and that's a good thing) with the sounds of those powerful engines and the glorious high speed transmission whine which is a fantastic sound sample, one of the most enthralling I've heard in a while, this game is set up to be doing everything right.\n\nCreated in UE4 (yes!) it's one of the first proper games to be coming using the power of this new engine, from the sensation of high speed which is getting better with each update, to the sounds and graphics and of course the physics, which is the most important aspect for a game like this, is on track feeling great.\n\nThis review will be updated in time as more content is added but for now, it is a shining gem in a catagory on PC which all but forgotten. A scifi combat high speed racer that is featuring expansive tracks, a full career mode to come like RC1 and RC2, and brand new additions such as destructible environments (to what extent we yet not fully know), get this now and support a game that is shaping up to be one of the best of this year if the current communication with devs is anything to go by.\n\nLoved RC1/RC2 on PS1 and PC of the past? Love that high speed, combat racer feeling but in a UE4 game? Love that nostalgia from over 16 years ago? Then get it now, support the devs, and be in for a good time!\n\n***Last updated 02/02/2016***","February 2","true","3.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TransistorN/recommended/396900/","TransistorN","TransistorN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TransistorN/","254 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a spiritual successor to the "Rollcage" series from the late 1990's/early 2000's, which means that if you liked Rollcage, you'll absolutely love this, and if you've never played Rollcage but like fast-paced combat racers focused on skill, you're at least certain to like this a lot. Think Trackmania mixed with Mariokart mixed with Rocket League, and you pretty much have this series of games, it's challenging, fun, addicting, and generally just really, really good. It's got online multiplayer planned, and unlike most other modern PC games, it also has splitscreen multiplayer available.\n\nI see that some people complain that the game's currently too hard, which is something I disagree with. Like most other racing games, the tracks themselves are bigger foes than your opponents. The difference being that this game, just like it's predecessors, kick this up a notch through a combination of neckbreaking speeds, tunnels, and obstacles that require skill, timing and precision to avoid in an efficient manner, but of course this becomes harder when the racers in front of you plant mines for you and the other competitors to hit, and the ones behind you fire various projectiles your way. It won't hold your hand, and nor should it. It'll be hard when you first start playing, sure, but this only ensures it being a satisfying experience once you've gained the skills required. I will admit that I find the game a bit too easy at the moment, if anything. In it's current state, the AI's pretty stupid and will do many mistakes, and the tracks themselves aren't particularly hard to master either (explained by the fact that only "Easy" and "Medium" difficulty tracks are currently available, with only one of the tracks being relatively finished). One thing to note however is that the controls currently in place adds some difficulty that wasn't present in the older games; the steering feels a bit clumsy and unresponsive, which is something I hope and think will get fixed fairly soon.\n\nIt's also got a really stable technical foundation, beautiful graphics, and great performance, I've tried it on different hardware ranging from a relatively "low-end" gaming system with an AMD A10 7850K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 560, and a "higher-mid-end" system with an Intel i5 4690K coupled with an Nvidia GTX 970, and it runs really well on both, with the latter system running it with max settings in 1920x1080 with ease, making it a gem compared to most other graphically advanced early access titles.\n\nThe sound design is also really good, with satisfying 3D effects and feedback, albeit it's suffering from some glitches at the moment (certain explosions and bullet impacts sounding as if they're right next to you, even though they're happening at the other side of the track), but minor quirks like that are to be expected in such an early stage of development, and the developers are working on a fix.\nAs long as you like Drum & Base, it's also got an absolutely killer soundtrack.\n\nThe developers are perfect for this game, not only because some of them worked on the previous games, but also because they listen to and interact with the player base, not only on the Steam forums, but on their own forums as well, making sure reported problems get fixed, and popular suggestions get implemented.\n\nI think most of the success about this launch is thanks to the fact that these developers work out of passion. This whole thing started out of love for the original games, and even though their kickstarter campaign failed horribly due to a lack of attention, they still fought on and got it into a working state, as opposed to quite a lot of EA developers out to make a quick buck by catering to popular genres, and then more or less abandoning the project once a satisfiable amount of money has been made.\n\nOh, and if everything goes according to plan, which I have no doubt it will, we will also get modding tools allowing players to create their own cars and tracks.\n\nSo, TL;DR:\n\n+ Fun, addicting gameplay\n+ Splitscreen support\n+ Great sound design\n+ Amazing soundtrack (If you like DnB)\n+ The rare combination of good graphics and great performance\n+ Awesome developers that are actually passionate about their work and release good while listening to and interacting with the community (I.E how Early Access should work)\n+ IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING ROLLCAGE\n\n- The AI's currently a bit too easy/stupid\n- The steering's currently a bit unresponsive\n- Some minor glitches\n","February 5","true","11.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

First things first: GRIP definitely has the "Early Access feel" to it. There currently is only one proper vehicle (though in several color variations), there are not that many tracks yet, my controller doesn't work in the menus and it's a pain to change some settings like resolution. There are also some glitches and bugs I've experienced, plus the physics and collisions don't always feel on point. Yes, this is in Early Access and very much feels like it, so those of you who want an absolutely polished, content-rich game should probably wait out.\n\nNow on to the things GRIP has in store and already makes right - it is ridiculously fun and addictive! I never played the original Roll Cage, but I quickly fell in love with the concept. It's mad fun driving on the walls and on the ceiling and makes for a very dynamic gameplay. The controls, while a little tricky at first, feel tight. Just as tricky can be the car's behaviour on ramps and during landings playing it for the first time, but it's easy to get used to the physics. The sense of speed is in full effect, though it rarely feels like actually driving 400+ km/h ;) Still a fantastic feeling to drive past all opponents when the nitrous pickup kicks in! Speaking of pickups: The current selection of pickups offers the typical variants that I expect from such a car combat game. Nitrous, mines, shields, short-range miniguns as well as chasing rockets. Each pickup can help tremendously when used right, but also be wasted when the usage is timed badly. A great feature that compliments the pickup weapons well is the function to manually activate slow-motion. You can pull off very cinematic sequences with enemies losing control because of you shooting at him, causing him to drive up a rock, spinning uncontrollably in the air - all in awesome slo-mo! The game does a good job at presenting all the action that is caused by the sly tracks, by the use of pickups and by the AI drivers. I quite like all of the three AI presets that this game has to offer. But GRIP is tense even on the easiest difficulty, as a simple screwup or a well timed hit by an enemy in the last section of a track usually results in losing several spots.\n\nLet's talk about content, that is not too shabby considering the EA state. There are three game modes available that contain different maps and tracks. Race is my favorite and currently contains three tracks. Two of those are more or less finished as far as I can tell, with the third one being in an early work in progress state - still being lots of fun already though. Players have several options to setup the action on the tracks. Along with the difficulty setting there are options to disable pickups, to configure the number of laps (2,4 or 8) and the number of combatants (6,8 or 10). On top of that, the engine power can experimentally be raised and a catch-up assist can be enabled. I really like this option for a rubberbanding AI, as it can be easy to mess up and loose the opponents. This option helps catching up on the enemies to ensure a tense race. Arena has all the same options and sees all the combatants trying to damage and eventually frag each other. Once again, there are three levels ready, with one being an experimental early build. Both Arena and Race seem to ultimately get 12 tracks each, which I would be totally fine with. I'm having so much fun on every single one of the available maps that I'm sure that the others will be equally great. Next up is the mode Playground, that has the player collect some orbs spread across a huge, you guessed it, playground and just mess around with the vehicle and lots of ramps and walls. The devs apparently want this mode to have three playgrounds, with one already available. Greyed out for now is the Time Trial mode, which I guess will pretty much be Race without the opponents. Not there yet but hinted at already is "Grip League". As the devs want to add online functionality with a future update, I figure this will be a competititve online league. Lastly, there already is a splitscreen mode for two players in place with the same modes and options as in solo play, minus Playground. Great fun for some couch competitiveness, with four player splitscreen already announced as well. So all in all, I wouldn't call the content sparse, though it's also not packed with lots of vehicles and tracks...yet. The content as of today is solid for EA and there are many great things in prospect.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of some cool Drum'n'Bass tunes that fit amazingly well to the action and always get me pumped. Graphically, it looks pretty good. Even though the early version tracks might look a little barren, the game overall looks good in motion. I'd even call it pretty on the most barebone graphical settings. It has a decent amount of settings in this department, ranging from FXAA and TXAA as Anti-Aliasing solutions to object quality, effects, shadow, post process and texture quality settings. Playing on a R9 390, I5 6600K, 8GB RAM at 1440p, I use most settings at their highest choice and get a decent performance that sits well above 60 FPS for most of the time. I feel that the higher effects settings cost a lot of performance, so I leave that on Low and it still looks really good. Performance is pretty consistent, though the game might dip when lots of opponents are on screen next to explosions. With my slightly lowered settings, I keep the dips at a small pace though. Once again, considering the EA state, I'm impressed with both the looks and the performance.\n\nI absolutely love what I've played so far and immediately wanna get back into the combat madness! The main concept is brilliant and well executed. The content is okay-ish, with much more on the horizon though. There are some smaller issues that still scream "Early Access", but nothing that really comes in the way of having fun. If you are even slightly interested in what you are seeing and fine with content being gradually rolled out, go for it! Now! And thank me later :)","February 3","true","6.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It doesn't try to be realistic or modern in any way  and despite being currently in Alpha, it runs smoothly on my high end PC and on my average Joe laptop.  The pumping drum and bass, meaty machine guns and beefy explosions are a welcome assault on my ears, leaving the crisp (and sometimes quite trippy) graphics to take care of the visuals and turn my stomache.\n\nAnd you are guarunteed a few tummy lurchers.  What stood out in Rollcage, was the multi dimensional nature of the gameplay.  Sure, you can stick to the ground in an attempt to indulge in a casual Sunday drive... but why would you when you can pick up a rocket, drive 90 degrees around a banked turn, fire your rocket down on a player on the ground, jump from the vertical bank into a narrow pipe, throw up a little as you lose all sense of direction, fly out the pipe upside-down landing perfectly.\n\nAs far as content is concerned, there is just enough to wet the appetite of anyone who took the plunge into the realm of early access.  I completed everything available (bar multiplayer) a couple of times in just under an hour but I'm planning to convice a few friends to pick it up to tackle the multiplayer side.\n\nThoroughly looking forward to the development of this title!","February 12","true","1.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Made by a small but very passionate and dedicated team, you can see they've put some love in this title. Counting amongst their ranks co-founders who've worked on the original rollcage back in the late '90s, rest assured this spiritual successor is in good hands, and no doubt it will turn out as a great success once it's out of early access.\n\nGRIP is still in it's early days, but you can already see the huge promising potential it have. It boasts 7 tracks divided in three modes (arenas, race and playground), one vehicle available in different colors, funny powerups and be ready, SPLITSCREEN! just like the good old days!! Isn't something formidable?! One of my favorite stage is surely the night one, which is very reminiscent of the original game. I wish there would be more powerups but what we have there is definitely a good selection. Gameplay-wise it's very intuitive and easy to pick-up, but don't expect to be good on your first try. Even for the die-hard racing fans out there, the fast pace at which you must avoid the different obstacles scattered around means you'll have to learn the best layout (yes there is different paths and shortcuts) and react as fast as possible (think in milliseconds) or else, it will give you a facepalm right on. People tend to push gas-to-the-metal but don't do this or you'll run into constant frustration crashing all the time. Jumps, curved turns, tunnels which you can drive upside down and reversible vehicles means you'll have to deal with lot of ♥♥♥♥ on the go. Key here is to do small adjustments and target straight before you hit a jump, especially when followed by small tunnels packed with objects right in the middle of the road. There is a good chunk of options in menus (number of laps, AI difficulty, graphical options) but right now the game doesn't allow you to rebind keys, although it says it's something coming soonish. Default binding though do make a lot of sense wether you have a keyboard or controller. I've not run into any issues, bugs apart wheels struggling to roll over roadside terrain, and small collision issues not occuring often. AI, well, overall offer a good challenge at medium difficulty for racing mode, but you'll definitely want to crank it up a notch for the arena mode if you want to struggle more going up the killing counts leaderboard. Before I forgot, the 7 songs really suit the game's universe well and not something you get fed up over time, at least not 'til now... one of the best racing game soundtrack around.\n\nAll in all, it's a great little game with a promising future, and for the price you pay (which warrant you a continuous stream of contents still yet to come, including multiplayer), it will probably get you busy for a little while. It's still in early access, so by any means don't expect a finished product, but what we have here is top notch. It's a fresh take on an old time favorite, (best suited for fans of fast paced arcade racers (think Wipeout, F-Zero, Dethkarz and the like)). A must-have for any Rollcage fan out there. Go pick it up before the price raise. I highly recommend this game!","February 4","true","8.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game is only in pre-alpha (only 6 tracks currently, most of which are still under construction), but that alone is already more than just a proof of concept. The fun of GRIP is %50 competition, %50 sensory experience. I prefer to focus on the latter in this review, as I'm sure plenty others will make it a point to address performance/controls/UI (which aren't too shabby imo).\n\nSo, GRIP manages to create that rush of high-octane chaos when you launch out of the finish line and you and the other racers are funneled into that first tunnel section; where the boys get sorted from the men. You truly feel the sense of speed as dilapidated sections of blast doors and support columns whip passed you. You feel the weight of your tremendous battle wagon, HAULIN' it down the track. You feel the GRIP of your monstrous tires claw at the ceiling and walls as you ride them like a damn maniac. It is all just that wondrous combination of STEEL and FIRE and GRIT, all going 10fold faster than what you ever thought possible. I hadn't felt these things in a long time, until GRIP ♥♥♥♥ING RIPPED THEM OUT OF ME.\n\nAnd this is just what the early access pre-alpha dishes out...\n\nSo please, pick up this game on early access to support these awesome guys at Caged Element, and give them your feedback if you do, cause they're always looking for input from players on the forum regarding game mechanics, vehicle and track design, etc. We can bring combat racing back.\n\ntl;dr: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

Racing in the same league as the likes of Rollcage, F-Zero and Wipeout, GRIP brings futuristic combat racing bang up-to-date.\n\nUnlike in F-Zero and Wipeout, your racecraft sits on four wheels (most of the time), but you can ride up the walls and onto the ceilings of tunnels. The brilliantly designed courses go from narrow winding corridors into wide open spaces that encourage the daring racer to take shortcuts to attain first place. Much like in the aforementioned games there are plenty of pick-ups to grab. Speed boosts, machine guns and rockets litter the course allowing you to gain a timely advantage over your opponents. I love how intense the racing is in this game. Everything can change in a split-second, which is very exciting.\n\nApart from the standard races and time trials, at time of writing you also get access to 'arena' mode which throws you into a battleground against a number of opponents in a last-man-standing fight to the finish. 'Playground' rounds off the game modes in the current build, which challenges you to find all of the pick-ups on an elaborate testing ground. Even in early access GRIP provides lots to keep you occupied.\n\nGraphically, GRIP looks and sounds great. The maps are vibrant, the craft are colourful, it just looks nice. The soundtrack is the kind of techno that we've heard in other future-racers, and might not be to everyone's taste but the music's not overbearing and fits the theme nicely.\n\nEven in its current early early-access stage GRIP is shaping up very well, and might very well end up being a modern day contender to the brilliant futuristic combat racers of old.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryumakkuro/recommended/396900/","ryumakkuro","Ryu Makkuro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryumakkuro/","109 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a modern take on a crazy old school racer.\nLet's make one thing straight from the start. It's not Rollcage 3. It's a lot more than that :D\n\nEven at an early access state (highly pre-alpha), the game runs solid like stone. Even with the horrendous streak that nVidia has with their drivers, this game is yet to crash a single time for me. On top of that it runs smooth and utilises my favourite form of anti-aliasing, the TXAA. Optimisation is great and the Unreal Engine 4 powering this game seems like a magnificent choice given that the game graphical wise looks amazing retaining that Rollcage feel to it.\n\nTechnical stuff aside, the gameplay is highly reminiscent of... yet again, Rollcage series. It's a spiritual successor after all, made by people who were also a part of the team that was responsible for the Rollcage series. You have an actual wallriding, not wall-welding known from Need For Sales, ceiling riding as well, a selection of weapons that that allow you to give out tickets to the moon in a disturbingly fast pace and even a pure deathmatch mode aka destruction derby, just with more... weapons and explosions. That said, if you don't like weapons, you can disable them and stick to pure racing.\n\nEarly Access experience is... quite different. I've been a part of DiRT Rally Early Access which has an opinion of being one of the best so far on Steam ever, but let me tell you... those guys here are something else. They really take their time to post on the forums trying to explain the issues, inform and (here's the part that is just unbelievable) apologise for any and all breaks and lacks of activity that may occur.\nAside from having great communication and actually implementing ideas and fixes (I mentioned a fix for a part of track, few days later it was implemented) they share their views and often discuss some of the more interesting topics. They're not afraid to ask for feedback on the forums but also can straight out say "we won't do it", which shows they have a vision for the game and don't want to just put everything there is into the game, which would most likely create a boring mess.\nQuite honestly, those guys put DiRT Rally early access to a shame. And that says a lot.\n\nGiven that the game is still in Early Access, there's not that much content.

I haven't been this into a racing game in a long time!\n\nGRIP is basically a spiritual successor to the popular PS1 and PC classic "Rollcage" (both 1 and 2). If you don't know what Rollcage is, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXfbo9JPM9U\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Beautiful Graphics (Once again, Unreal Engine 4)\n\n+ Runs very well at a constant 60fps with Vsync on at max settings in 1080p (Specs are on my profile)\n\n+ It's fast, intense, engaging, and consistant. This game FLOWS like no other racer i've played before!\n\n+ Weapon Pickups (This is a combat racer after all)\n\n+ Well done track designs, which offer you some shortcuts to either get ahead, or stay ahead of the game\n\n+ Splitscreen multiplayer. Again, we need more devs to start including this in their games. NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ONLINE ONLY PEOPLE!\n\n+ Playground mode, which is essentialy a free roam mode\n\n+ Time trial mode (I'm sure you know what this is by now)\n\n+ The floaty controls have been bettered in this new update. Cars drive much nicer now! As a result, i have now moved this to the pros.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Cars STILL bounce easily on even the smallest things. This can also be a bit annoying at first, but it can be funny when you manage to tumble into everyone causing them to tumble and bounce around with you XD\n\n- Still no mid-air control. You cannot steer yourself in the air like most other racers let you do, which can at times get ridiculous when you just cannot stop running into things and bouncing around everywhere\n\n- Arena mode is kinda lacking, but then again this game doesn't have too much to offer at the moment. I'm not surprised, but maybe this'll be more fun with a friend or friends. All you do in this mode is just drive around collecting weapon pickups to destroy all the enemy vehicles.\n\n\n\nIf they can give us the ability to steer ourselfs mid-flight like a majestic eagle, then this game would be even better! Do i recommend this game?\n\nThe answer: OH HELL YEAH! Go buy the game right now, the devs can really use the money to continue supporting and updating the game with new tracks and more!\n\nI'll update this review as i play more of it.","March 7","true","4.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I loved Rollcage from back in the day, and this game nails it as a clone or spiritual successor! It's still very early in development, but even from the get go (I bought on day one on their website,) one could easily see this game has good direction and great potential for having fun just like the Rollcage days. Todays update (29/01/16) has only solidified the direction with an enhanced UI, better responsiveness, split-screen and some more great drum and bass tracks! I can see me and friends sinking hours into split screen. And even more into the online component when thats ready.\n\nThe game also runs great @ 1440p + 144hz using a 980 ti and an i7 4770k, I maintained 100 fps easily at max settings and the game looks very nice already. The game has perfect controller support too. The game uses the UE4 engine.\n\nGrip is being made with some of the old Rollcage developers/team and i can't wait to see what they do next with the game in future updates, which so far have been frequent and awesome.\n\nRecorded time doesn't account for actual time played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarKAeRiX/recommended/396900/","DarKAeRiX","DarK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarKAeRiX/","215 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview and Bug Report – Developers, this is for you.\n\n3 weeks into early access and I’ve picked up this game, played it for over an hour, and I’m gonna start off this review by saying that this isn’t simply a spiritual successor to the Rollcage series. It IS Rollcage 3, whether you want to call it that or not.\n\nNow, let’s get into the actual review. This is based off of playing Time Attack for almost the whole time, and should be treated as such.\n\nThe sense of speed is exhilarating. I never expected to come into it and do well, and I didn’t; the case was the same with the first two games. I crashed a ton of times on every lap, span off or did a 180, drove up the side of walls, left the track boundaries, always struggling to get back on track, and losing a lot of time in the process. But it never feels cheap, nor is it frustrating. When you do screw up, you always know that it’s because that you just couldn’t quite handle the beast that is your vehicle, and that’s great, because Grip – and Rollcage as a whole – is not an easy game/series by any means – this game is hard. It takes a lot of precision and skill to master handling this four wheeled juggernaut; the smallest mistake can screw you over, but it really is rewarding when you can get it under control. And even if you do crash, drive off or spin off a bunch of times, the game never stops being fun as hell to play.\n\n***BUG REPORTING STARTS HERE***\n\nNow let’s get onto the bug reporting. As it’s only 3 weeks into early access, I can forgive the fact that the UI and everything except the core game needs a huge amount of work. Still, it needs to be addressed:\n\nScreen resolution options: The resolution sets itself every time I click the arrow to go through the available screen resolution settings. So when I go from 1280x720 to 1280x768, screen flashes to black and then sets to the new res. And this happens for as many different available settings there are: the screen flashes to black no more than a dozen times before I can reach 1080p. We need to be able to click through them all without it auto applying every time: give us an ‘Apply’ button or a dropdown menu, the current system is far too slow.\n\nSecond issue – the res resets itself from 1080p (my selected res) to 720p when I alt tab out and back in, and to make matters worse, there’s no ‘Options’ menu in the Pause menu. So all that time spent clicking through every available resolution to get to the one I need, down the drain. After that I just left it at 720p out of frustration.\n\nThe menus can’t be navigated without a mouse – not even the Pause menu. I don’t think the keyboard can be used either. So I can pause the game with my controller (for reference it’s an Xbone controller), but to resume I need the mouse, which requires me to get into an awkward position so that I can left click resume with my left hand while keeping my finger down on the right trigger to accelerate.\n\nThat’s the next issue – upon resuming the game at the Pause menu while holding down the right trigger, it does nothing: I have to release it and press it again to accelerate.\n\nFor some reason I can pause the game after I finish the race and viewing my ‘You placed 1st!’ (Hahaha, me, first…) – This should not be possible. Nor should I be able to pause the game at this point.\n\nPlease auto-hide the cursor during gameplay, or when a controller is in use.\n\nThe hit boxes for the menu buttons are too small to be clicked with a mouse: the hit boxes should be the same size as the menu buttons themselves.\n\nOn the track Transport, on the planet Liddo 5, the frame rate gets cut in half every time I enter a tunnel, and returns to normal when I exit.\n\nThe setup menu needs settings removed from it depending on the game mode currently selected. AI difficulty, number of bots, and number of laps are still included in Time Trial mode, even though there is no AI, and there are unlimited laps.\n\n****BUG REPORT ENDS****\n\nDespite all of these typical Early Access issues (as is the way with Early Access), for the love of god, buy this game, and support the developers. You won’t regret it, especially considering everything that the team has to offer in the Early Access description. I’ve been waiting for Rollcage 3 for over a decade, and well, here it is.\n\nI was gonna give this game 22/10 but then the front half of my car got stuck in the ground when I landed after being launched into the air (fix this pls), so I’m gonna take half off and say 11/10, cos the AI names sound like Transformers.\n\n…\n\n♥♥♥♥ it, one of them is a Transformer and his name is Jetfire.","February 24","true","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","3"

Driving at 500 km/h (or up to 700 km/h!) feels awesome. Controlling the car properly gives enormous satisfaction. When you nail that curve, coming at it 500 km/h, ease off the gas a little to gain better control, dodge that mine in last second only to see that the guy coming behind you hits it, it feels pretty awesome. Or when you see and hear the guy behind you starts his gattler at you, you deploy your back shield to show a middle finger at him, then drop a mine in a tight tunnel and look back as your enemy drives right into it, exploding (then you drive against a wall because of looking back but that is beside the point).\n\nGRIP feels very good. This feeling comes from great soundtrack, gorgeous looking tracks and ofc the racing itself. Sound effects are top notch, for example everytime you fire the gattling gun it feels like it has some serious power. The low "chuckchuckchuck" sound of the gun, the swirling sound of the gattler "swrrrrrr", and the sound when it hits your metal enemy "chingchingching". You send your enemy veering and take the leader position. Soon after that you hear a beeb thats increasing its frequency, and realize a missile is coming to you! Quickly, you manouver to a power up hoping it would give you a shield. No shield? Tough luck. You look back and see a guy coming right after you. You let off the gas and brake just a little, to give that guy the first place. Soon after that the missile hits the guy infront (BOOM) of you sending him flying wildly all over the place, and you take the leader position again. All this while the crunchy drum and bass music plays in the backround to raise your pulse just the right amount.\n\nThe driving itself is great. At first it feels like the car bounces too easily off the little bumbs etc, but you soon learn the use of braking and letting off the gas pedal dramatically increases your control. For example, you see ahead a little hill that you are going to take air from. If you go to that jump with full throttle and you are not driving 100% straight to it, you are gonna bounce wildly all over. Instead, you must ease off the gas a little, and make a little correctional driving manouvers so that you jump so that your car doesn't go all over but instead does a neat little controlled jump. Remember that you are driving 500 km/h, at that speed a little bumb or hill must be taken seriously. This makes the driving feel really good, you feel like you are in total control of your car, and if you get distracted you will be punished for that. It feels like you are on the edge all the time, even a small mistake can make you fly and spin. You cannot go full throttle and hit the walls in curves, like in some arcade racing games.\n\nEven if the game is really awesome, early access means very limited content though. Patches have been regular. I will remind you, dear reader, that if you want a full game experience with proper amount of content, wait longer. If, however, you can't wait to give these metal beast a run, enjoy awesome drum and bass music and wish to support this badass racing game, buy it now! Remember that buying the game now secures that it will come a finished product, and it already offers many hours of crazy speed driving goodness. I normally feel very sceptical about EA games, but this one I had to give a go and I am super glad I did!","April 30","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The controls and responsiveness are pretty frustrating right now but man, the machine gun and missles are pretty satisfying and almost make up for it.

If you don't know the concept of Rollcage yet: your car can drive on walls and roofs and it can drive both on its topside and underside. This creates an unique way of racing, because you can continue driving on falls and upside-down jumps. Combine this with various powerups as mines and rockets and you'll have a lot of fun.\n\nThe gameplay of GRIP is already very enjoyable in this early access version. It's combination of racing and weapony provides a high-paced and intense experience. The graphics are great and the up-tempo music really adds to the feeling of speed. With each patch, the tracks are getting better flow and many improvements are made to the physics. Besides normal racing, there are interesting game modes such as time trial, arena (deathmatch), and playground (capture powerups in a sandbox environment) . The powerups such as speed boots, shields, mines, rockets and miniguns are fun and are visually appealing. All in all, all the main elements that you would expect in a combat racer are already there.\n\nClearly, there are still downsides that can be expected in an early access version. Multiplayer mode is yet to be implemented. The content is still rather limited with one car and three racing tracks, one of which is heavily work in progress. There is also a noticeable framerate drop when shooting a minigun in some sections. Despite these downsides, you can have a lot of fun with this early access version.\n\nAs final remark, I would like to add that this game has a great development team. The developers are easy to approach and are actively adressing player feedback. This gives the feeling that you are really involved in the development.","February 13","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What it does currently have, though, absolutely reeks of futuristic racing games from the 90s(San Francisco Rush 2049, Extreme-G, Wipeout, etc.), just with a modern day coat of paint. The tracks, the music, the vehicle design, the weapons and power-ups, and the overall vibe add up pretty nicely to something that makes this quite a spiritual successor to the game Rollcage, and a kind of game that we just don't see very often. If you want more than a small handful of areas, vehicles and things like online multiplayer(it has local splitscreen for people with actual irl friends), then you may want to wait a while on buying this. Just note that the price will go up ever so much as the early access program goes on. If however you're fine with it as it is and don't mind the current lack of content, I say go ahead and buy it.\n\n"10/10 Like Wipeout with wheels" -IGN","February 15","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was 20 somethinhg :)\nAnd you know what? It was totaly worth it. As a huge rollcage fan, i am realy hopeful for this game. Right now even the early access is looking awesome. Here are my opinions, pros and cons.\n\nI only finished 2 races in the game and tickled with settings. Design of the game is pretty straight forward and fluid.\nGameplay feels like old rollcage and this is a good thing. Develoeprs should keep this unchanged.\nI'm sure tracks and music are gonna be realy fun and appropriate for the context.\n\nOnly downside seems to be high performance graphics card requirement. My hd 6950 is having hard time running on high settings. I think this will be optimized as days go by. But the important thing about rollcage-like game like this is to be fluent and playable. This game doesn't require amazing visuals and stunning environment. This game has to keep to action and excitement up, and the gamer on toes. I'm sure we won't have time to appreciate visual details as we are strugling through obstacles and doding missiles.

Besides that one could say it has not enough content but for early access i am ok with the price.\nThe game is not optimized in any way to any hardware.\nIt heats up my system more brutal than RotTR on Ultra. My i7 4790k is up to 58°C and the Sapphire R9 390x is at 68°C after 5 minutes of gaming. Compared to RotTR on Ultra the CPU is at 41°C and the graphics card barely hits 50°C playing 30 minutes.\n\nYou should keep an eye on your temperatures while gaming.

It can be a blast on its own, but does become a little repetitive, at least at this stage in development. Truly, this game has a lot of potential.\n\nHowever, there are issues that are in needing of resolution in order for it to become a fully fleshed Rollcage homage. This is understandable due to the fact that it -is- just pre-alpha. Though even at this stage, the game is pretty fun.\n\nThat and the music is sick.

The cars do take some getting used to; like a lot of people have mentioned, I got my ♥♥♥ kicked to hell and back on my first race. A couple of rounds later, though, and I was consistently placing higher on the game's default difficulty settings. Hell, I even won one race. The battle arena mode is fun too, and it'll be a total blast if online multiplayer makes it into the game. The weapons that are already in the game feel good, the cars have a great sense of speed to them, the tracks are pretty well designed (although there's not a lot yet) and the sound design's great. I LOVE drum and bass, so the kickass soundtrack is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome bonus.\n\nThe one and only negative thing I can think of so far is the game's sheer lack of content. As of right now, there's: 1 car, 3 tracks, and 3 battle arenas (I haven't tried out the "playground" thing yet). But that's fine since the game's in early access...the devs have shown us what they plan to do and this game can only get better as they add more content and tweak what's already here. The game runs great for me; I have a 6-core AMD processor, 8 gigs of RAM, and a GTX 970 (which is still an admittedly powerful card) and so far on max settings I've never seen a single dip below 60fps. The one guy who said this game is terribly unoptimized must be running Grip on a literal toaster; for an early access game running on Unreal 4, Grip is as smooth as hot butter.\n\nJust a quick note to the devs if they ever see this: It'd be cool if cars had health meters in races; I feel like blowing up and respawning might be a little less punishing in some situations. It'd also be neat if we saw the arena mode expanded with deathmatch-style rounds or even some team gameplay. Just suggestions; don't get me wrong, the game's already a ton of fun.\n\nFinal verdict: Grip's a real breath of fresh air in a racing genre currently plagued with an over-emphasis on realism. It just wants you to have fun. I suggest you buy it now before the price goes up!","February 11","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When was the last time one of the big game companies got involved and actually listened to the public?\n\nGRIP is constantly being updated and improved. The music and the game go together really well. The sound effects of the vehicles and especially the weapons are really cool. The level of detail (vehicles, weapons, and environment) looks really nice, even when going 400km/h. The in-game play is challenging, even on the easiest setting.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game and for less than $20, how can you go wrong?","February 4","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely loved it. The gameplay, the atmosphere, the soundtrack - everything was spot on. GRIP captures the spirit of Rollcage. I am usually very hesitant when it comes to remakes, but when I saw the first video of GRIP, I immediately backed in even though it wasn't even available as a demo or anything. And I can tell you this: THIS IS ROLLCAGE. If Rollcage was made today, that's how it would look, sound and feel. I am absolutely mind blown, this is totally awesome comeback! The game is VERY fast, the powerups and weapons are juicy, the tracks that are available now are well thought out and interesting to drive. The only thing that I'd love is a bit more melodic/fuild drum'n'bass as a soundtrack, the current tracks are great, but they're all a bit samey. Give me Aphrodite! Give me EZ Rollers! Give mee more! Even at this early stage I am giving this game 9/10 - it's an absolute legend of a game. If you like fast paced, futuristic racing and if you like drum and bass - get it now, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!","April 27","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays like it's spiritual predecessor Rollcage, which ate up  countless hours back in the day on my psx. Graphically though its very sharp, using Unreal Engine 4 it shines. Also despite still being in development this game blazes, currently with all settings turned to max its staying pegged at 144fps which is the cieling I set to match my monitors refresh rate. The scenery blazes by, the cars are nicely detailed and little things like the smoke trail from a fired rocket all show nicely. Control wize its spot on. I'm playing with an Xbox 1 pad and it reminds me of a slightly tighter wipeout. The courses are limited currenlty but smartly designed with alternate routes and plenty of oppurtunities to drive on the walls or ceiling in a bid to gain advantage over an opponent. Its in early access and you can tell, the presentation is rough, switching resolutions is kind of a pain.  Game modes are limited but shows the potential of where the devs are headed. Overall I would definately reccomend even in its early state, currently the best futuristic arcade racer on steam.","February 2","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And it’s looking sweet!\n\nIt's still early days of course, so much of what’s here will be getting enhanced, but already it’s a solid build that runs smooth and shows a lot of potential. It is not an easy game in the slightest, there's certainly a lot for the devs to do in the handling department, and there's currently no online multiplayer (although it is coming and is a priority). It does however currently have a 2 player split screen mode.\n\nShould you get it? If you're crazy about futuristic racers, and loved the original, then yes absolutely.

The graphics are absolutely drop dead gorgeous and all the ingredients seem to be there... it just just needs to stew for a few more months.\n\nThis is the most fun high speed arcade racing you can get outside of the Wipeout series of games, only this is crazier, with racing upside down and so much weapon carnage that you can go from first to last and back again within the span of a single lap.\n\nBut right now, you can't control the menus with the gamepad, resolution support is rather finicky, the controls need to be tweaked and there's no online multiplayer component, which they absolutely need to nail.","February 2","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burntrocity/recommended/396900/","Burntrocity","Fen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burntrocity/","198 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: It has incredible promise to be Rocket League on steroids.\n\n\nFor a game that tries so hard to be a 'Distance' reskin, GRIP is an early access that may be hard to recommend. The lack of air control, and steering sens being hard to find, this game is hard to love. There is no sense of "god damn im going fast" other than the engine revving with a deep bass and your tailpipe flaring, but thats only when youre in the last 3 spots and have "catch up" turned on. The tight maps (with the exception of the wide open jungle track thats still in early alpha as of now) are hard to navigate when you do get up to speed or have other racers around you. The collision in the game is made even worse due to the lack of air control or any kind of function to knock other drivers out of the way. If youre going anything above 300mph and hit even the slightest rock or a hair on another racers tire, expect to do go in a random direction with no chance of recevery except resetting your vehicle onto the track.\n\nHowever...even with all of these flaws, the game has the makings of an incredible release. Since the top hitting racing (car) games are Rocket League and anything involving Grid or Dirt Rally and, as mentioned above, Distance; this brings a refreshing 'grit' to the genre. It has the octane feeling of Rocket League, the cumbersome yet tolerable controls of Grid and Dirt, and the scifi thrill of Distance. I would very highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to jump in early on a game that could potentially be a heavy hitter in the racing scene. It needs improvement, but what early access doest?","February 11","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Graphics, Gameplay, level design and even well designed AI make this game a hell of a good BETA. It will leave you with generally only one main complaint, and thats content.\n\nNow of course content will be lacking in an early access title, but grip has managed to create an experience where, even though there is only three maps for racing at the moment, each race will leave you with a different opinoin. This is thanks to level design, incorporating the abillity to drive up walls, take side paths (both of which are usually drasticly different) and landing good items and benefital positions.\n\nThe Kaos of the race, explosions everywhere while you narrowly avoid rocks and ramps wizzing past you, while dust sprays from the back of your tires all the while trying to keep an eye out of the player infront of you, makes this game really really fun. If you apreciate the intencity of a race, this is perfect for you\n\nLong story short, you will pick up this game thinking "This game has so much potential", and at this rate, I think it would be pretty hard to screw up.\n","February 3","true","9.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I quickly lost all desire to play after a handful of races. If you're looking into this game, it likely means that you already know what the positives are of the game currently, which is just the core idea behind it (It also looks nice, for what it's worth). Because of that, I'll only be discussing the negatives and why I don't think it's worth spending money on right now for most people.\n\nThe handling feels very sensitive to me. It's possible that it's just a thing that takes some time to get used to, but in a game where you need to fit your car into tight spaces and are driving down small corridors, I feel like it screwed me up a few times. Related to that, is the camera, which can shift wildly while your car flips or turns and sometimes lingers in an awkward position, making you feel the need to tilt your head just to keep up. It's unbelievably jarring, and I found myself getting completely lost in tunnels and ending up going the wrong direction by the time I got myself oriented again. The last problem that I have with the game is that it punishes you for being in the air by making landing cleanly very difficult. Very often, your car will lose control once it hits the ground again, which seems like a really poor decision to me in a game that's so arcadey and encourages you to do crazy stuff such as jumping off of ramps.\n\nThe game also seems to have some optimization issues and is missing some key features for its options menu, but I don't see these as huge negatives since it is indeed an EA game.\n\nOverall, I found this game to be pretty frustrating, and I think that would be the average gamer's impression of the game if they were to play it in it's current state, which is why it's very hard to recommend at the moment. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this game in hopes that they make some key changes to the game so that I'll want to buy it again once it officially releases.","February 6","false","0.7"," 15 of 41 people (37%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","37","15","41","5","10"

It's also impossible to control yourself in midair which is something that I've grown accustomed to from plahing Rocket League.

The tracks they have so far are prety unabllanced and need a lot more work. The track boundaries are not so well defined and at the speed you're going this is quite a problem as you will inevitably get stuck on random crap while going 500 kph and it will be frustrating and the weapons are also not so great yet ( not so well balaced or explained ). The game is going in a very good direction so far so I just hope that the developers conscience won't let them get a good night's sleep until all is fixed and we can get our Rollcage fix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SenzaFineEDM/recommended/396900/","SenzaFineEDM","XIRA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SenzaFineEDM/","139 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm rarely one to purchase Early Access games due to various reasons (I'm sure if you frequent Steam enough, you can put two-and-two together), but while I am very much a lover of the classic Rollcage games, it wasn't that factor alone that persuaded me to support this game.\n\nNow, this IS early access.  There are two full RACES (Yuri Industrial and Wastelands) along with a couple prototype tracks the devs give you to test out.  There are a couple ARENAS (Biodome, an XMAS Map [as of this review] and a test area) as well as a "PLAYGROUND" mode where, well, you just goof around.\n\nThere is only one car, but a good selection of paintjobs to choose from.  You're able to customize how many racers are in the match, how many laps, toggle pick-ups ON/OFF, and set Engine Speeds (think CC in Mario Kart).  Only SOME of the item pick-ups are in the game as of now, but here's where things get good:\n\nNot only are some of the developers those who have originally worked on the RC games from 1999/2000, but they're VERY active in the community and VERY willing to listen to the community's opinions.  They've got specific checklists of suggestions for the games, bugs, what-have-you on their forums, and the updates they've given the game up to now have proven that these devs aren't simply another collective of empty promises.\n\nBut this is a review for the game, not of the developers, so here are my personal thoughts on how things are ->AT THIS TIME IN EARLY ACCESS<-.\n\nPROS\n- Wonderful Drum 'n Bass OST\n- Splitscreen multiplayer\n- Controller support\n- Graphically, the game is quite pretty (and I have to run it on a lower-res than most)\n- Driving 500+KM/h on walls, ceilings, driving loops in tunnels and cars that drive right upside-down or rightside-up.\n- Fast-paced combat racing shenanigans you knew and loved in RC (or hopefully will come to love if you're a newcomer).\n- The devs listen to feedback and work on that feedback. Hell, even the map-designers and the 3D modelers.\n- Arena and Playground modes give you a couple nice-to-have alternatives if you're not in the mood for just racing all the time.\n\nCONS\n- As of now, there is only one type of car. (More will be added.)\n- A limited selection of tracks. (More will be added.)\n- Some people may find the car handling to be difficult at first. (They're actively working out the physics.)\n- The collision between cars - and occasionally the environment - is pretty wonky right now.\n- You can't rebind your keys or controller settings (it will be implemented).\n- No ONLINE Multiplayer (it will be implemented after core gameplay is nailed down).\n\nBut I would always recommend that you check out some videos for GRIP to see if the gameplay is your cup of tea before purchasing, keeping in mind that some footage may be outdated (from the private Alpha test) as the changes that come with the patches often come in strides.\n\nAnd FYI, you can refund the game as long as you've played for less than two hours courtesy of Steam's refund policy, if it rubs you in all the wrong ways.  So it's a pretty nifty way of getting a "demo" to see for yourself.","February 5","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't used keyboard controls in GRIP (I use a PS3 controller hooked up via USB & DS3 Tool), and the controls feel great to me. The cars feel like they have real weight to them, which never came across in RC, and the steering and throttle make you feel like sonic on acid. Maybe it's because I spent countless days/months/years in RC, but it's challenging enough to keep it interesting, but easy enough that you can thread the needle at 300mph and feel accomplished.\n\nOf course, it's early access, so there's a lot of tweaks that are needed, but this isn't the place to mention them.\nFor an early access game, though, the polish on even the least completed course is incredible!

That one damn song that's been stuck in my head with the female's voice that makes you just want to drive faster. The wooosh of the slow motion power up as you eat deck and flip over in the opposite direction.. Ah the feels.. And this games revives them in it's own way!\n\nI always had Rollcage in my head growing up, game was old.. New consoles were out and I was moving on my trail of life. Till I saw a post of a kickstarter... About a game named Grip. And I looked, smiled, then perceeded to bottle my energetic feels of this game -Grip- Going. "Its a Rollcage remake! Ohhhhhh snap!" (Sadly couldn't get the founder packs before Early release.. O well, I just want to play the heck out of this game, and am and will!)\n\nIt's such a unforgiving game, which makes it great. ((Unless you use the catchup feature... bleh)) Which can get some angry, but it's how a race in the future with bunkers on wheels should be... Un forgiving, intense, mind blowing. This is one of those games that once you find your groove of a track, and you make mental checkpoints of where you need to be in turns, when to boost, and doing a loop in a tunnel to ride that lovely shoulder to lose little speed and fly past other racers. Gives you a real good feeling of being in the zone.\n\nI'm just doing these tracks AT LEAST once a day when time permits. Perfecting my -groove- and waiting for new tracks to add to my list. / The sand and spark pelts of the minigun as you spool up is eye candy, the subtle whine as the boost fuels up and you can't help but grin that wide as smirk as you watch a orange circle appear infront of your vehicle, as if you were re entering the atmosphere from space and reach 450 MPH plus!\n\nThe game is great! Is just all it boils down to. I can't wait for more to come, with cars, tracks, power ups, music, etc etc. ((The engine power being maxed at mid... That's going to be damn good when it's high and max!)) It's a game that if you love racing in any form, should give it a try, understand that the first couple races won't be good for you, and you use them to learn the track more than anything. Once you know the obsticles and hold momentum, you'll get a real feel for the game, and it's addicting.\n\n10/10 would recommend! -Just do eet, you know you want to... Do eet-","February 8","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It increases the intensity and thrill of the gameplay , and i find my head pulling to the side with the car from time to time admiring the round and round physics.\n\nInitially, there were lots of bugs , lack of barriers etc leeading to getting stuck in the map edge, that kind of thing.\nFirst update I've witnessed today addressed quite a few bugs, added new car with very different handling to the first one, a nice change, new music, seems slightly smoother to play.\n\nIn summary its still very early days, but having original team members from the rollcage games in play is telling, they pushed this game even when the kickstarter failed apparently ( if id heard there was a rollcage reboot kickstarter it wouldnt of failed) and im sure their passion for this project will tell, as its already looking and feeling great for an early stage game.\n","March 12","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I now play a game. it combines wonderfully unrealistic driving with over the top action gameplay . it is called GRIP.

I haven't used keyboard controls in GRIP (I use a PS3 controller hooked up via USB & DS3 Tool), and the controls feel great to me. The cars feel like they have real weight to them, which never came across in RC, and the steering and throttle make you feel like sonic on acid. Maybe it's because I spent countless days/months/years in RC, but it's challenging enough to keep it interesting, but easy enough that you can thread the needle at 300mph and feel accomplished.\n\nOf course, it's early access, so there's a lot of tweaks that are needed, but this isn't the place to mention them.\nFor an early access game, though, the polish on even the least completed course is incredible!

That one damn song that's been stuck in my head with the female's voice that makes you just want to drive faster. The wooosh of the slow motion power up as you eat deck and flip over in the opposite direction.. Ah the feels.. And this games revives them in it's own way!\n\nI always had Rollcage in my head growing up, game was old.. New consoles were out and I was moving on my trail of life. Till I saw a post of a kickstarter... About a game named Grip. And I looked, smiled, then perceeded to bottle my energetic feels of this game -Grip- Going. "Its a Rollcage remake! Ohhhhhh snap!" (Sadly couldn't get the founder packs before Early release.. O well, I just want to play the heck out of this game, and am and will!)\n\nIt's such a unforgiving game, which makes it great. ((Unless you use the catchup feature... bleh)) Which can get some angry, but it's how a race in the future with bunkers on wheels should be... Un forgiving, intense, mind blowing. This is one of those games that once you find your groove of a track, and you make mental checkpoints of where you need to be in turns, when to boost, and doing a loop in a tunnel to ride that lovely shoulder to lose little speed and fly past other racers. Gives you a real good feeling of being in the zone.\n\nI'm just doing these tracks AT LEAST once a day when time permits. Perfecting my -groove- and waiting for new tracks to add to my list. / The sand and spark pelts of the minigun as you spool up is eye candy, the subtle whine as the boost fuels up and you can't help but grin that wide as smirk as you watch a orange circle appear infront of your vehicle, as if you were re entering the atmosphere from space and reach 450 MPH plus!\n\nThe game is great! Is just all it boils down to. I can't wait for more to come, with cars, tracks, power ups, music, etc etc. ((The engine power being maxed at mid... That's going to be damn good when it's high and max!)) It's a game that if you love racing in any form, should give it a try, understand that the first couple races won't be good for you, and you use them to learn the track more than anything. Once you know the obsticles and hold momentum, you'll get a real feel for the game, and it's addicting.\n\n10/10 would recommend! -Just do eet, you know you want to... Do eet-","February 8","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take a gender through the forums to understand why these beasts are suppossed to slew around after a sideways landing, they're freaking HUGE.\n\nThe weapons are as volatile and crazy as weapons should be. Never trust a rocket to go forwards if you're not facing forwards. That's what makes the way this game is being built so good, attention is being paid to all appropriate aspects.\n\nThe music is VERY good. Different from Rollcage (I don't think anything can beat Doubelcross by the ever prevalent E-Z Rollers) but very much in fitting with the game.\n\nBut the best bit of the game so far, is how everything works together. Yes, the driving mechanics will probably get tweaked a hundred times through development. Yes, the weapons will turn into pink unicorns at some point, just to see what happens. And yes, things are going to break, and be buggy, and just refuse to drive around obstacles...\n\nBut that's what's so great. All these bugs help shape the game naturally. It can actually develop, and not just be bashed together. It can be continuously tweaked, and refined, and purified until it is the best combat racer for a long time.\n\nBecause, at the end of the day, what makes the game great is how great it is to play. The feeling of the guns, the rockets, the way you can feel the car sliding, even though you're holding a controller and sitting on your couch at home. The way that you literally scream at your screen when an opponent smacks you in the face with a rocket, or tickles you from behind with the machine gun. It takes you back to the quintessential point of a combat racer. Driving fast, driving hard, and being angrier than everyone else on the track.\n\nSuffice to say, I really like this game. And I cannot imagine how good it will be when it's finished.","February 4","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At this moment there's no online multiplayer and only a few maps, but more content is coming as the game gets developed.\nFirebugs is the only Rollcage game I've played and compered to Firebugs this game seems a lot harder. The maps have multiple routes and when you first play the game you will find yourself bumping into walls and losing even to the easiest bots, but as you play you will learn the maps and start winning races. There are no characters like in Firebugs instead there's different colored cars.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\n- The map design seem fresh and the maps are BEAUTIFUL\n- The game works fine even on older hardware (I have a GTX 560ti and play on medium 1080p)\n- Controller support for racing\n- Lets you play unfinished maps and they work good\n\nCons\n- No multiplayer YET\n- Very random walls that you will drive into before you learn the maps\n- The playground map has no textures and looks ugly\n\nI recommend this game to everyoen who thinks it looks fun because it is fun and theres very little bugs for a early acces game","February 4","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ale_Destroy/recommended/396900/","Ale_Destroy","Alpha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ale_Destroy/","68 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nJust bought the early access to the game and had fun with it for at least an hour.\nSmall time to judge but I think first impressions are the ones that weight the most.\n\nBeing an hardcore fan of Rollcage I was super stoked to find that someone was making a game in the same racing style, I played Rollacage and Rollcage stage II till nausea, and I still have them both in original boxes, and managed to play them on win 7. Now I am on win 10.\n\nSo to the game:\n. Graphic is stunning, UT engine is really doing his job at full force here and I played the game at maximum graphic level.\n\n. Music fits perfectly the game pace and puts you in the right mood of futuristic races, I really felt like going back to the good ol wipeout 2097 or Dethkarz (anybody here who played it? that was incredible!)\n\n. Concept is really well done, I loved the different ambientations of the three tracks I could race into. This is very important because a player really need to have in mind the world where the track is located and to have a clear idea of it, I mean "this is snow track, this is jungle track that is desert, etc etc"\n\n. Cars: that's where I would have to point something: I think it would be good to have more differentiation in cars, maybe on the aesthetics but most of all in stats. I was searching for car stats!!! (acceleration, grip, top speed, etc)\nMore car identity please!\n\n. I couldn't really understand the difference between the two leagues, except for car being a little more "tanky"\n\n. Playabilty: difficulty is not a problem, but car control it is. I know we are talking about a "scrambled eggs" race type game, but I played Rollcage a lot, in GRIP if you lose control of the car it's a bit more difficult to regain it.\n\nExcept for this this is a race game I was hoping to find and I am really glad it's in the making (and it's still in Alpha!)\nSo if you like the genre and you come from millions of hours of race with rollcage, dethkarz, wipeout like me, keep an eye on GRIP cause it really may be the present day futuristc race game we always wanted. Can't wait to play online!\n\nPlayed on:\n\nCPU: Intel Sandy Bridge 2550K 3,30Ghz\nRAM: 16 gb corsair dominator\nGPU: Sapphire Radeon HD 7950 Vapor-X\nMOBO: Asus P8Z68 Pro\nOS: Windows 10","May 1","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Its not the easyest game. First few tries I came in 10th or 9th but eventually you learn how the car handles and you are able to lap opponents, even on hard difficulty.\nI found it better with engine power set to high as the cars accelerate a lot quicker and therefor easier to recover when facing the wrong way.\na tip: set engine power to max.\nTrack design looks nice, but sometimes its (especially in the beginning or split screen) its hard to see upcoming obstacles. When you eventually know the track, you know where the are and ok to navigate around.\n\nI also found that the menu is not controller friendly. You really need the D-pad to navigate the menus. With the analog stick of an xbox 360 controller its easy to overshoot that option you want to set.\nThe AI is is OK. If you master the game its pretty easy to get to the front and stay there. Its also nice that the AI tries to block you when you are driving slightly faster just behind them.\n\nWhat I would like to see is that the AI accellerates of the starting grid. Now and then they hit the trottle a bit later, seeming they don't pay attention and you eventually need to drive around or into them. When a race starts, everyone should accelerate as fast as the can!\n\nPros\n- AI that tries to block you\n- Spit screen rules!\n- Grahpics look amaizing\n- Mediocre to learn, hard to master\n- Speed!\n- If you ♥♥♥♥ up, it's really your own fault!\n\nCons\n- Recovering with low engine power is slooow\n- Sometimes the camera has some awkwark anges when hit by a rocket or mine\n- Still early access and room for improvements\n- Too easy when you master it\n- Menus are not that controller-friendly.

Without a doubt, some of the best fun I’ve had in a racing game in a very long time. You’ll have your head tilting and body leaning into corners with these furious races.\n\nPros:\nFast & fun gameplay – jump into a race and put the peddle to the metal. Prepare to 'woo'\nKiller music – original soundtrack is loads of fun and really suits the vibe of the game\nShort game is a good game – great for burst gameplay sessions when you have twenty min to kill\nActual skill is involved – learning when to apply the brakes, deaccelerate and line up your jumps makes you feel like you’re becoming a better racer. Also learning how to cop a hit can save you from spinning out from a missile\nDifferent day, different mode – Multiple modes of play are fun. You have standard races, elimination races, battle arena mode and time trial will keep you occupied\nDiverse tracks – all the tracks are very distinct and have their own unique feel. You can also reverse and mirror the tracks too\n\nCons:\nToo easy – at first I struggled to take first position, but now I can snatch the trophy even when giving the AI a lap lead\nPhysics are inconsistent – much better than what they used to be, but the physics can get annoying when you’re airborne or collide with other racers\nStatic tracks – at the moment there is only one track which can have its course altered by racers. This feature is promised to be fleshed out, but for now it’s lacking\n\nPoints about early access:\nUpdates occur about once a month, but they usually have substantial content. The physics engine is being worked on, so at the moment the car physics are a bit wonky. But I like to think that adds to the challenge.

Without a doubt, some of the best fun I’ve had in a racing game in a very long time. You’ll have your head tilting and body leaning into corners with these furious races.\n\nPros:\nFast & fun gameplay – jump into a race and put the peddle to the metal. Prepare to 'woo'\nKiller music – original soundtrack is loads of fun and really suits the vibe of the game\nShort game is a good game – great for burst gameplay sessions when you have twenty min to kill\nActual skill is involved – learning when to apply the brakes, deaccelerate and line up your jumps makes you feel like you’re becoming a better racer. Also learning how to cop a hit can save you from spinning out from a missile\nDifferent day, different mode – Multiple modes of play are fun. You have standard races, elimination races, battle arena mode and time trial will keep you occupied\nDiverse tracks – all the tracks are very distinct and have their own unique feel. You can also reverse and mirror the tracks too\n\nCons:\nToo easy – at first I struggled to take first position, but now I can snatch the trophy even when giving the AI a lap lead\nPhysics are inconsistent – much better than what they used to be, but the physics can get annoying when you’re airborne or collide with other racers\nStatic tracks – at the moment there is only one track which can have its course altered by racers. This feature is promised to be fleshed out, but for now it’s lacking\n\nPoints about early access:\nUpdates occur about once a month, but they usually have substantial content. The physics engine is being worked on, so at the moment the car physics are a bit wonky. But I like to think that adds to the challenge.

But with great graphics, good pace and awesome action, GRIP has a LOT of potential. If the devs care about it as much as they have been already throughout developement (unlike other games *cough *cough *Dayz *cough), this is going to be one hell of a game in the future. So support the devs right now, so they can get working on release, and have fun with it in the mean time.","June 6","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rollcage was one of my most favorite Playstation 1 games, and when i heard of this spiritual successor i just had to grab a copy on steam. This truly does feel like a rollcage game, and i absolutely adore the HD visuals and that booming sound when you activate the turbo pickup.\n\nNormally i prefer hovering vehicles over wheeled ones, but i can make an exception with GRIP, especially since it was inspired by a childhood favorite of mine. I look forward to seeing this game grow and eventually see an official full release. Screw Rocket League, GRIP is my racer of choice.\n\n\n0.10.1 Update: The new EMP weapon is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥, on certain tracks it's essentially unavoidable no matter what position you're in. Seriously, the radius of the EMP seems way too large, make it smaller.","May 29","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
