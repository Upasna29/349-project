"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/recommended/397340/","el_kemosabe","El Kemosabe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_kemosabe/","1115 products in account","Introduction\nSimplePlanes is an arcade, build and fly, flight ‘simulator’ developed by Jundroo. In SimplePlanes you design your own aircraft and then take to the sky with them! From high-speed jets to slow and steady sea planes if you can think it, you can probably make it. As you can guess from the name, the game’s selling point is that it’s pretty simple and easy to get the hang of, and it is indeed pretty simple and easy to get to grips with.\n\nConsider this an ‘on the fence’ review rather than a straight up positive one. It took me a hell of a long time to decide whether or not I should choose positive or negative but in the end I decided to go positive since, as you’ll read towards the end of the review, it is pretty fun for a few hours but because of its issues which I’ll talk about in my review it just isn’t worth buying at full price.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nThe appearance of the aircraft themselves in SimplePlanes is reasonably good, as you’d expect it’s pretty simple, nothing flashy, but they get the job done while looking reasonably good. The map on the other hand, not so great. By no means are the textures awful, painful to look at or anything else along those lines but the map has a completely different graphic style to the aircraft parts, I just thought that was a little odd. The building menus were reasonably easy to use and the UI when flying was good too, basically just the visual displays you need to be able to fly the plane.\n\nGameplay\nAs I mentioned, SimplePlanes is mainly a ‘build and fly’ game where you build whatever you want to with the available parts and then take it for a flight around the map. There’s not really much to say about just flying around but I will talk about the build mode itself. The build mode is effectively a more simplified version of what you’d find in Kerbal Space Program, if you’ve played that before you’ll know what you’re doing. You select a part from the list of available parts and just drag it to wherever you want to place it. Some parts will change slightly to fit with everything around them but most are just static. Once an object is placed you can edit its properties (depending on whether the part has properties to change), for example you can change how much fuel is held by a fuel tank or the size of a wing. You also have some other options like the ability to mirror your aircraft so that whatever goes on one side, goes on the other.\n\nThe game doesn’t have a huge amount of parts available for you to use but if you’re creative enough there are a lot of possibilities with the game as can be seen from some of the awesome mods that have been made. The other issue with lack of content comes from the fact that the game only has one map and that map is very small. If the game’s pricing was closer to that of the mobile version then perhaps this would be acceptable but even with the launch discount, one map just isn’t good enough, this is a real problem for the game. It is possible to make your own maps and share them (see comment section) but I'm a firm believer that just because you can get extra content elsewhere doesn't make the base game's lack of content acceptable.\n\nAs well as the build and fly mode, SimplePlanes does have a few scenarios for you to try out, such as scenarios where you need to make a plane to use in a machine gun only dogfight or something similar. These are pretty good, and will no doubt be enjoyed by those good enough at building planes in the game to make planes for these scenarios, but there aren’t a huge amount of them and there’s no way to make your own, again limiting how much content the game has.\n\nRealism\nWith a name like SimplePlanes you’d be silly to think this is going to be an ultra-realistic flight sim but since it’s been labelled by the devs as a simulator and described as having "realistic physcis" it’s fair to expect a reasonable amount of realism. Sadly what we’ve got is a bit of a mixed bag. There’s the basic physics in place for weight distribution, thrust, lift etc. and it’s reasonably good for a game edging towards the arcade side of flight sims but there are some inaccuracies dotted in there. For instance if you do a full ninety degree bank turn you would expect to lose velocity, how much depends on how far you pull back, but when I performed such turns in SP my velocity remained constant. I also had a couple of experiences where pitching and rolling simply didn’t work despite the fact that the control surfaces were visibly moving.\n\nMiscellaneous As far as I know there aren’t really any differences between the Android/iOS version of the game and the PC version of the game which isn’t great considering the PC price of the game is more than double the price of the mobile version. Even if you ignore the mobile version there still isn’t anywhere near enough content to warrant the price tag.\nInstalling mods is incredibly easy, you just download the plane you want, open the file and after a few seconds it’ll be available for you to use in-game. You’ll need to save it manually if you wish to use it again. Since the game’s been out on Android and iOS for a while there are loads of planes to choose from.\nThe chase camera view isn’t fixed and can only be moved using the mouse as the movement of the camera can’t be bound to a controller, something I found rather irritating.\nWhat is in the game is good fun for a few hours, probably even more if you really get into building your own planes.\nVerdict\nOnly Worth Purchasing When Heavily Discounted.\n\nSimplePlanes, for what it is, is pretty fun but a lack of content and its high price tag make it a game I simply cannot recommend at full price. If you really want to try it out I’d suggest getting it on mobile until it gets a good discount on Steam.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 261 of 292 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","261","292","18","11"

Most of the reviews out there are by a lot of very impatient people.\n-~=THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR THE IMPATIENT OR EASILY FRUSTRATED=~-\nSimplePlanes is a simple game about building, ironically, not-so-simple planes. This game is really for engineers, such as myself, looking for a challenge. The aerodynamics in this game are rather unforgiving and it can take hours to properly tweak and ballance a plane, but dang does it feel good once you do.\nPeople compair is to KSP, and rightfully so to an extent, but keep in mind- this isn't KSP. It's about building airplanes, boats and VTOL cars within Earth's atmosphere.\nTake it as it is. It's a game. About building planes. That requires a LOT of practus and patience.\nQuit your whining about how it's unfinished and oh how bare it is and oh how it's not KSP, boo-hoo, cry me a river, the LITTERAL name of THE GAME is SIMPLEplanes. SIMPLE is in the name, litterally.\nI got the game on sale, I have a lot of fun with it, it's a welcome challenge and helps mah otter brain to get a bit smarterer.\nIt's easy for many machines to run, unlike KSP- it's easily modded, it's got a workshop bigger than the Earth itself and allaround, it's just *plane* and simple fun.\nIt's not a sin to make something simple AND enjoyable.\nNow quit being eliteist, whiny and impatient, sit down, and build a God-darn plane.

After downloading an Osprey, it became clear that the fuselage block can be customised to pretty much any shape, and if it can't be made with one, add more.\n\nAfter my first a/c, which barely took off, I gave up on the flying variety of transport in favour of, wait for it, an airboat, wooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo! It was a simple beast, so I added a control stick for a bit of eye candy, and to practice using the gizmos.\n\nThe physics are sound and extra features have been added for the beta version (which I used to create the airboat). There are thousands of player creations that can be downloaded from the simpleplanes website with a facility to upload your own. It also has an intuitive search and tags function, making it easy to find the aircraft you want.\n\nFinally, it isn't all about the planes, as mentioned earlier. You can even build cars with an engine block in the current beta version.

The game is as polished as I've ever seen it, at this point. I've purchased it on BOTH amazon and the google play store to help support Jundroo, so this says a lot about what I think of them as a studio.\n\nThe games they produce are always top notch and Simple Planes really takes the cake. The game has always run so well, even dating back to years ago when it was very early in alpha. It runs on pretty much any computer, no matter how bad it might be. If you can run minecraft, you can run this.\n\nThe gameplay has a lot of depth, and lots of content these days. Not to mention mod support and a plethora of planes that people have uploaded that you can download and try.\n\nIf you love flying and love building, this game has the best of both worlds. With realistic physics and a lego-like feel for building. It is the ultimate flight sandbox game. I would say it's basically Kerbal crossed with Legos and plane themed.\n\nThis game is also highly education: it taught me a lot about flight physics and how to properly design a plane with lift. Airfoils, Aileron, Chassis, Dihedral, Center of Mass/Lift (highly relevant).. you will learn all the terms of flight and how to properly apply parts while keeping a mind on their impact - like drag and weight.\n\nThis game is by no means a perfect game, but as far a sandbox, creative building game goes.. this is very polished and well made.

You design a plane or vehicle, take it into a quick combat mission or test drive... and that's it.

However, it needs A LOT more work done for me to say anything good about it. A few problems here include;\n\n-Bad AI, the planes literally crash and kill themselves once they can't find the player.\n-Awful editor mechanics, but at least doable.\n-Not a huge of variety of parts. I would love to see stuff from different eras, such as WW1 Biplane parts and Korean War jet engines.\n-Some "simple" fill-in paint mechanics that can definitely be improved on.\n-Map. Variety. It sucks to just be around ONE SINGLE ISLAND for the entire game.\n-Not a lot of game modes.\n\nI also hope that this game doesn't succum to the Early Access hell with the devs abandoning it. I really do see some great potential here to be either an actual competitor to Flight Simulator and the IL-2 series, but maybe I'm asking a bit too much here in such early stages. It's not that I think that this is a bad game with my current rating, but it's just a game that could've been released much sooner. I hope that with how mediocre it's current state is we see more updates in the near future, and I wish the devs good luck trying to make this amazing concept come true.","February 13","false","9.1"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","24","37","2","1"

The missiles and weapons are fab and I love this game a lot and play it heaps, and build planes, planes, and cars, and boats. I also love the challenges and races. This is a VERY cool game!

I might have started making planes that were overpowered underpowered and stuff but now I understand COM and COL all my planes maneuver better than my planes 3 months ago EVEN my Lockheed U-2, which apparently had designs flaws which stopped it from being a good plane such as terrible speed , wings too large etc... But mine was a replica so I tried to get it as close as possible do I made the COM and the COL not so equal , And I realized that when I moves the Wings a bit more forwards and added more Weight to the front and made my Roll Control Surface bit larger , I realized that my U-2 could have been an acrobatic plane! Anyways stop with the rambling erm I really do recommend the PC VErsion since it has nudging and easy XML editing\n\nQuick Tip to have easy modded blocks just make a subassembly modify it and make it like and actually category such as mine has a lot of stuff , Cluster Bombs , Laser Miniguns , Overlapping Missiles , Infinite fuel tanks I EVEN HAVE A SMALL PROPELLER WITH ENORMOUS POWER =D all I got to say is , the value is great for what a great game it is , I would just lie, to see Nudging in iOS since we dont have modding like Android does , Also multiplayer Dogfights, or races would be r ally cool love to see feedback from the community about Multiplayer tho :)","February 24","true","166.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It is great for what it is, but not really a solid PC title. It would be nice to see games like this that are on Steam to be identified as a port, ensure that the reviews are for PC, and also it is not really a sim, but more of an arcade-y game -- which isn't bad, just needs better visibility upfront.","May 8","false","1.0"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","22","43","0","1"

Controls are impossible to set up ingame for a joystick. There is no option to change a deadzone, and moving the stick in any direction puts it at 100% power as if pressing a button on a keyboard. I found the hidden file that saves the configuration and tried altering it manually, which worked for setting specific axis for controls, but wont alter deadzone or power. I've tested with multiple joysticks and controllers, and they all have the same problem. So my only choice would be to use the keyboard, but that is just as hard to steer a plane as a stick is needed to "hold" the plane at varying degrees.","December 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","34","67","2","6"

It's open and inviting nature quickly gets you engaged into the game. The community is also great with lots of players creating and uploading planes to their website available for download. The building GUI is very nice aswell. The controls are a bit hard to get used to, but part of the fun is learning. I've recently had alot of fun using the weapons. You can have targeting rockets and guns. This game has only crashed once, telling me that it is pretty stable. The devs seem to be active, the website works great, awesome community, fun weapons and explosions!\n\nMe crashing into a bridge: https://youtu.be/ZAC8PeAGHlk (oddly satisfying)\n\nJust an Idea...\n\nThis game should not be called Simple Planes, because you can actually do alot more than building planes, such as cars and boats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnkilo/recommended/397340/","johnkilo","johnkilo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnkilo/","46 products in account","I had initially bought this game, then returned it for a refund here on Steam. I later felt I didn't give the game enough of a chance, and my love of aircraft and building things made me re-buy it. Now I wish I had just kept my money.\nThe sad thing is that this game has the makings of a great game. It is like Kerbal Space Program, but much simplier.\nIt is very easy to snap parts together to make a craft. I do think that there should be a larger variety of structural parts, and it would make getting the desired shapes you want much easier.\nThe biggest gripe I have about this game is that it is way too bare bones to not be considered early access. You make your plane/jet you fly it... and then there is nothing to do. To make matters worse the map is pretty boring with hardly anything to do. As far as I can tell, unlike Kerbal Space Program, the things you put into the map are not persistent, which means jets you leave laying around will not be there again if you stop flying in sandbox. This prevents you from creating your own little stories or senarios. This game does have a cool feature where you can dogfight with/against your created planes/jets, but then you quickly realize that it is so arcade that even the basic wing cannon does the same amount of (unrealistic) damage as an air to air missile. With the "fire and forget" missiles you can target the opposing jet, while they target you, and you can both be destroyed at the same time. You can manage to evade the missiles with maneuvers, but the fact that there are no countermeasures such as chaff and flares is a glaring omission. The AI is also so simplistic that you can fly around the mountains of the island, and without firing a shot, the AI jet will crash because it isn't smart enough to avoid the mountains while pursuing you.\nLastly, they developers state that there are over 100,000 aircraft available for download on their website, created by the community. This is true, and thankfully it is very easy to download them. Unfortunately, the fact that every conceivable aircraft is already available is a big drawback to me. What reason do I have to spend an hour or two creating/recreating an aircraft when every jet/plane you could think of is already available on the website? It is like buying the games Gran Turismo or Forza and then using a cheat to unlock every car. While it seems fun at first, you quickly realize that you lost really the only reason to play this game.\nI can't recommend this game as it sits right now. I wouldn't buy this for the price of $12 (or $10 during the Steam winter sale). I would say an appropriate price would be $5 or less. Not unless the developers really flesh out the game and give the player much more to do. I really hope they continue to develop it because I really think they could have a great game on their hands.","December 28, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

This game allows you to build so much, with so many options. You can either make a "Simple plane" Or you can make a highly detailed airplane such as a Fw-190, a P-51, A B-17, whatever your fancy. This game is definitely worth 12.99 at this point, The only thing i have to gripe about, even though i don't usually care, because to me, gameplay and experiance is better, however the graphics in this game look like they would be perfect for the Playstation 2 era games. I mean, I know this game is supposed to be "Simple" but the graphics, Like i said, i don't think graphics are the most important, but i definitely don't think they should be the least.\nNow that i think about it, another thing i gripe about, and this is the 2nd most important thing a game needs in my opinion, Is sound. Sound is a very important factor on immersion, i feel like sound is more important than graphics.\nThe thing that kinda annoys me in this game, is the fact that the Radial engine in this game sounds like a Merlin V-12\nI wish we could add custom engine sounds, or atleast get to modify all that jazz without having to go to unity maker and make a new part.\n\nAlso... Things in this game explode way too easily, not in crashing, but the weapons... It's kinda boring if one round hits the plane and a nuclear bomb goes off. If i have something like a B-17 just explode after a single hit every time, it gets boring, it's not fun seeing a nuclear explosion everytime a plane gets struck once by a small projectile... Unless it's an actual atomic bomb.","January 30","true","28.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

How do I know? I already posted one about the same problems and it got 9 downvotes in 20 minutes, and the only reply was basically "go buy a joystick ♥♥♥♥♥♥"\n\nOh well, here I go.\n\nTo start.The flight mechanics for this game are disguisting. I also have noticed that there is no tutorial for attacking ground targets. It is simply impossible to hit a ground target because there is absolutely no stability assistance whatsoever. You must constantly tap S to keep your plane in the air. When you are trying to manuever or to aim, the pitch is so jolty that you simply can't.\n\nElaborationThe pitch suddenly spikes and then slows down when your plane is actually pitching. This is so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. It does not matter if this is realistic or not, there is no real way to deal with this. That is why people in real life have developed flight assistance for real fighter planes so that the pilot can actually hit things.\n\nThere is no such thing as unguided bombs anymore unless the pilot is very well trained to use them. There is no tutorial at all for bombing, meaning you have to sit there for hours on end trying to figure out the trajectory of the thing at every speed. There's simply no-one that has the will or time or care to do that. Besides; you won't hit anything because of the instability of the planes.\n\nIt doesn't matter how close or far or in what position the COM/L/T are in, the planes are going to flip around. This may or may not actually be realistic, but there's another realistic thing that real engineers have developed for real pilots so that they can actually hit things with their guns, and that is COMPUTER FLIGHT STABILITY ASSIST. This game does not have that. You have to manually perform every tiny thing. This makes combat impossible.\n\nOf course, the regular part of the game is fine if you can put up with spamming the S key 100% of your time flying, but it's VERY boring when you actually fly. It would be a little better if we had actual missions like cargo transport and more scenery or something, but don't ever try combat. It's garbage. Oh, I forgot, the AI tend to ram you when you fight them\n\nRefunded. While on sale, no less.","May 8","false","1.1"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","14","31","0","7"

The building system is comprehensive enough that it would take a good couple hours to get a proper plane built, but there's frankly just not enough to do once you have something airworthy. There are a handful of races and events available. Yeah you'd need to build a couple different aircraft to complete them all but once that'd be done you would have nothing to do.\n\nOn top of that the game did not detect the rudder axis of my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro flightstick; no amount of configuration would get it to work, and it works fine in other games. When I attempted to use an Xbox 360 controller instead, I found that no matter what buttons or sticks were mapped to increase/decrease throttle it would still reset the power to 0% the moment I decreased throttle. Anything other than keyboard bindings wouldn't work as intended for throttle.\n\nUninterested in taking the time to meticulously craft an airworthy vehicle I downloaded some custom aircraft, beat a few of the events, tried a couple AI dogfights (which helped me notice that many of these planes control like absolute garbage), then turned it off and requested my refund. If you are willing to spend time making aircraft and have little concern with content beyond that then give this game a shot, but if you just want to fly a bunch of different planes get FSX or X-Plane.","December 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

The game acts all high and mighty in the video telling you to learn to make better planes but that really doesn't happen. Mostly you spend an hour and a half being frustrated because the game gives shitall to help you learn and build. After one and a half hours of constant frustration, I managed to make a plane that sort of flies. Sure, it has great realistic aerodynamics but that's part of the problem for a game called "simple planes". Go rename your game "Plane Simulator".

The landing gear was almost non existent, the pylon system would work if it wanted to i noticed parts of the plane falling off for no good reason, the throttle is confusing as there is no way to reduce it past 50 %. The key mapping for the joystick was atrocious, and the overall design or lack thereof of the building mode was terrible. was fun for the first hour and a half sort of, but it kept so much wanting. i wish they could have done something similiar to kerbal space program, but no. The unfinishedness of this game would cause someone who didn't know any better to think it was in early access. If you're into these types of games like I am, there are'nt many options on steam. Unfortunately this game that seemed to hold so much potential for hours of fun designing was tarnished by the lack of quailty control and instruction on how to deal with different issues one may come across while designing. My advice, do NOT get this game if you dont have tons of money. I'd say it's worth 5 bucks. Save up for something proven and respectable like Kerbal Space Program.\n\nThanks,\nDeadHead","December 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","16"

And while the blocks that you have to build with are just basic shapes... It's just that... Basic. Which honestly, can be a detriment to the game, rather than improving. I found building larger aircraft tedious and near impossible, while with smaller designs, you are actually rather limited with what you can do, mainly stuck with doing light, single-engined fighters for the most part.\n\nAll in all, I didn't find this game enjoyable at all, and I will probably be uninstalling it very shortly.","December 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Looks neat. Kind of acts like what you might expect. However, the physics model is clearly very basic and the controls turn out to be a bit clunky even compared to flight in Kerbal Space Program.\n\nI think the gameplay would feel a lot better if pitch and yaw were controllable by the mouse and if, even when flying keyboard only, the keys controlled the "trim" rather than the control suface deflection directly.\n\nBuilding wise, I did not feel like I could really get in to designing what I wanted. The limited parts and few customizations on part shapes felt very restrictive. I had a hard time picking parts that would help move the design in the direction of my vision for it.","December 21, 2015","false","1.9"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","0"

Elaborating a bit further, this is as described, a plane building game. You have a range of parts to choose from in order to construct an aircraft. These parts range from undercarriages, to jet engines, to props, to guns, to bombs, to fuselage types, to different wing types. The list is pretty much endless. And the game supports XML modding too, so the list is even more endless.\n\nProbably worth pointing out that there's a right and wrong way to build planes in this game. As a rule of thumb, keep the centre of mass in front of the centre of lift. That will help you make something that is partly flyable.\n\nObviously, there's a dedicated website for all the uploads, which also has a forum section, which is useful for mod requests, logging your progress, starting discussions and complaining about how you're going to quit because nobody upvotes your planes... I imagine a lot of the negative reviews here stem from the butt hurt from that last point.\n\nAlthough, if you're hell bent on getting upvotes, you have to be an active member of the community and make unique concepts or good replicas... of just your own thing. I've noticed a few people making some really nice looking battleships ... yeah, you read that right, this is a pretty versatile game. People can make anything from cars, to tanks, to ships, to flying houses. Obviously, the primary aspect of this game is the planes though.\n\nThe Dev team is pretty damn dedicated too, and seem to work their backsides off in order to provide new content, keep the website running, and probably a lot of other stuff that has flown over my head. A relatively new feature from the Dev's being the tournaments, in which users compete to make the best plane for its class. Currently there are three classes: blade, unlimited and mod class. Each has there own set of rules. Also, if your wanting to hoard points, I suggest entering these too. Oh, and the live twitch stream of the tournament gets put on youtube.\n\nGiven the clear amount of shear effort put into this game, one has to wonder why people would not recommend it.\n\n\nBut yeah,\n\nThis game...\n\nis fantastic","February 25","true","461.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit like the Sims in build mode, a tiny bit like google sketchup, and in the direction of Kerbal Space Program. It's simple enough for beginners yet has enough possibilities to keep an enthusiast busy for hours- I speak from experience!\n\nPros:\n-almost total freedom to build what you want\n-engine calculates Centres of Mass, Lift, and thrust, which is pretty darn cool when trying to build a flying machine\n-very involved devs, quick to respond to questions on steam and have indicated they're going to continue releasing -updates\n-passionate community, multiplayer isn't supported in vanilla, but fans are working on a MMO version, as well as thousands of downloadable planes\n- ease of mods (I presume). thanks to relatively simple graphics and physics engine, I would imagine we'll see a lot of mods for this.\n\nCons\n- not yet a mission mode. Must content yourself with building, racing, and shooting down AI\n- could use more building parts (this is the turbo nerd aviation fan talking)\n- flight model could be a bit more advanced (for example higher stall speeds in airplanes with tiny wings and high weight)\n*the devs have mentioned they're working on these "cons", so they aren't even really cons*\n\nAnyways, I love customization in games, and this one has tons of it! I'm not sure exactly how but they've managed to capture some of the most fun elements of my 'golden days' of gaming- before everyone just made FPS games.\n\nThis is definitely an indie studio I have no problems supporting.

Joystick is a must if you're planning on doing some of the challenges.\n- Difficult build mode controls, but you can get used to them after about 30 minutes of building.\n- Not enough warbird parts/weapons.\n- Not enough air intake parts for Jets.\n- Pulsating glowing rings in race matches are annoying, they mess with your depth perception.\n-Weapons are too powerful, 1 bullet will make your aircraft explode no matter where it hits.\n-Some bugs when it comes to part collisions, specifically the landing gear.\n-Lack of texture for planes, though this can be atributed to the art style or the fact that it's a mobile port.\n\nCons:\n-Some challenges are too difficult for the average player.\n-The Lack of flares / missile countermeasures make fights with missiles repetitive.","December 25, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

You design a plane, and despite the title, there is actually some complexity and real world physics at work on the designs you produce. You will spend a long time tweaking, altering, and going through a process of trial and error, in order to improve your design.\n\nAt this stage there is not much else to do. There is a limited map in which you can test your plane, dogfights against AI opponenents, races through hoops, and that is about it.

Because you can totally do that, and the thing that you just cobbled together might actually fly. Of course, if you wanna get really[/i] into it, there's all the stuff there to do proper engineering stuff.\n\nAs someone who also owns Kerbal Space Program, I can say that SimplePlanes definitely has much more ease of use when making flying machines.\n\n"Oooooohhhhhhh he said Kerbal Space Program!"\n\nYes, I'm just going to compare this game to KSP. But that's probably what you were looking for, wasn't it? An answer to "how does this compare to KSP?"\n\nWell, SimplePlanes has (as you probably guessed) a much stronger focus on making aircraft that operate within the atmosphere. This means much more content inside the atmosphere, which means that you don't have to understand rocket science. You just have to understand how to fly the hunk of crap that you just threw together.\n\nThe biggest difference between KSP and SimplePlanes is that there are challenges you can try your handa at. There's air races, combat scenarios and... wait, I think there are only two types of challenges.\n\nErm, let's talk aboutt the combat shall we? Yeah, there's combat in this game. All you gotta do is strap some weapons to your plane, and you're ready to get in a dogfight! You can either play one of the combat challenges, or play a quick 1v1 dogfight against an AI. The 1v1 mode also lets you make the AI opponent fly any plane you want them to; you can even make them fly a plane that you made (and then watch as they crash because they can't figure out how to fly your scrapheap-with-wings)!\n\nOverall, SimplePlanes is a good vehicle creation game that's perfect if KSP seems like too much, and still worth a look even if you're a fan of KSP.\n\nJust uh, don't get carried away on your first plane like I did.\n\nEDIT: put the whole rest of the review in because I clicked "post review" WAY before I was done writing it because I'm dumb.","January 6","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been playing this game for over a year now and I think that ever since it has come out on steam, I have been doing a lot of procrastinating when it comes to writing a review for it and a few guides on the things Ive learned. Simpleplanes is problably one of my favorite flight games that Ive played just because you get to fully design and customise your planes from the shape of the wings all the way to making your own custom cockipit. (problably my first "in depth" review. feel free to bash the ♥♥♥♥ out of me in the comments)\n\nPros of Simpleplanes:\n\n1. It does not require a medium to top notch P.C. to run. You can play this game on a potato\n\n2. The etitor. The editor alows you to make your own planes that you can post to the simpleplanes website. It is easy to navigate through and allows you to build planes\n\n3. The races and other levels you can play. Once you get bored of just building planes you can test your skills in "arcade" style gamemodes (I swear im not using that word right). From races to practicing shooting down enemy planes, its hard to get bored\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. Learning to build planes. I think that this game has a steep learning curve and without help of experienced users it takes newer onew a LONG time to learn. When I first got this game on my mobile device long before it was on steam I never would have been able to make something fly If I wasnt taught by Me600. The tutorial dosent help much but reading through the website and the reddit would help.\n\n2. the A.I. is horrible. In dogfights they typically just crash into the ground and are generally just stupid\n\n3. Bullet physics. Getting hit by a bullet pretty much destroys the whole block it hits, which pretty much means that you are done for.\n\n4. The locations. NO north runway location, no north runway final approach, no wrigh runway final approach etc. Pretty much a downgrade from the earlier versions of the game\n\nI really like this game and reccoment it to people who love flight simulators, building things, and anybody who wants to show off their creativity.\n","March 12","true","140.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't have to be a gamer as such. If you have more than a passing interest in aviation in general, you will enjoy building an aircraft from scratch and soon start realising that the few basic rules of aerodynamics and physics are important to get your kite airworthy. For the first 10 - 20 hours, I did nothing but build and test fly my contraptions! It was only then that I started to do the many challenges that are in the game. I now have 75 + hours (a lot for me) and I'm still getting to grips with both the different planes I've built and making progress in the challenges. The graphics may be a tad basic but you still feel like your taking your invention into the real world and seeing how it sizes up!\nI haven't even started on the armaments part of the game, so I still have that to look forward to also.\nAll in all, for the price,Simple  Planes is great sandbox type game and allows the casual aviation buff to delve into the world of aerodynamics in simple but pleasing way.

Now, I have a few things to say about this game. They say it has a lot of content and that's very true. There's so much stuff to build, and if you're not in the mood, just download one of the 100,000 airplanes there is. But I did not enjoy this game. I realize Kerbal Space Program is a little more out of the budget for people looking at this game but it's a better investment than this. I understand people who like this game and honestly, I can't give a sound reason for not like it except that it's hard to get the hang of and the tutorials are badly made. I'm going to suggest this game because it's only out of personal preference that I don't like it.","February 21","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Elaborating a bit further, this is as described, a plane building game. You have a range of parts to choose from in order to construct an aircraft. These parts range from undercarriages, to jet engines, to props, to guns, to bombs, to fuselage types, to different wing types. The list is pretty much endless. And the game supports XML modding too, so the list is even more endless.\n\nProbably worth pointing out that there's a right and wrong way to build planes in this game. As a rule of thumb, keep the centre of mass in front of the centre of lift. That will help you make something that is partly flyable.\n\nObviously, there's a dedicated website for all the uploads, which also has a forum section, which is useful for mod requests, logging your progress, starting discussions and complaining about how you're going to quit because nobody upvotes your planes... I imagine a lot of the negative reviews here stem from the butt hurt from that last point.\n\nAlthough, if you're hell bent on getting upvotes, you have to be an active member of the community and make unique concepts or good replicas... of just your own thing. I've noticed a few people making some really nice looking battleships ... yeah, you read that right, this is a pretty versatile game. People can make anything from cars, to tanks, to ships, to flying houses. Obviously, the primary aspect of this game is the planes though.\n\nThe Dev team is pretty damn dedicated too, and seem to work their backsides off in order to provide new content, keep the website running, and probably a lot of other stuff that has flown over my head. A relatively new feature from the Dev's being the tournaments, in which users compete to make the best plane for its class. Currently there are three classes: blade, unlimited and mod class. Each has there own set of rules. Also, if your wanting to hoard points, I suggest entering these too. Oh, and the live twitch stream of the tournament gets put on youtube.\n\nGiven the clear amount of shear effort put into this game, one has to wonder why people would not recommend it.\n\n\nBut yeah,\n\nThis game...\n\nis fantastic","February 25","true","461.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From small prop planes to big jet engine powered beasts, you can build anything that comes into your mind. There are also a variety of challenges, for example speedruns, dogfight with AI, takeoff challenges and so on. At first building planes is difficult. I can guarantee that first planes you will make (including me) will look like ♥♥♥♥. But the feeling of accomplishment when you take off in the plane you were building the last 30 minutes is amazing. Oh and you can also use weapons on your planes. From cannons to rockets and stuff that goes BOOM when it hits the ground. Dont worry, bombs are not useless. You can sink ships and bomb bridges with them. I also like that game devs are active on the forums and help you with any issues and take your ideas into account.\n\nGame is amazing and worth the money.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nBUY IT.","March 27","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its very addictive, simple (i.e. graphics) but complex in many ways, easy to get your plane to fly by hard to master aerodynamics. Game play modes are okay, I find i'm often building designs to see how the computer can fly them (i.e. races). Regardless the plane building mode is well worth the price of this game by itself. In the future I would like to see them take a crack at developing a multiplayer mode where you can build plane designs to specific parameters and enter into multiplayer dogfights and other types of missions.","April 1","true","61.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is great oppertunity to see if your crazy ideas acutually work! There are a lot of ways you can custimize you planes. However, if you get bored, you can always just download someone else's project that actually works! I know this may sound crazy, but this isn't a bad flight simulator. I hooked it up to my joystick and now it works like FSX! I do with there were a few more fuselage options, and possible some more ways to customize your aircraft. It would also be  nice for them to add in a few new maps. Those are my only complaints.

Then, I took a small hiatus from it. A few months later I came to the simple planes subreddit and HOLY ♥♥♥♥ HOW DID I MISS THIS UPDATE.\n\nLets just say this a really good game. It's not KSP, but it does the job well. The music is entrancing, the graphics stellar, and the flying very fun. The most fun you'll probably find with this game in the most case is watching your plane catastrophically fail into oblivion. Also theres a workshop with at least 99 percent better than your skimpy little plane.","March 14","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From small prop planes to big jet engine powered beasts, you can build anything that comes into your mind. There are also a variety of challenges, for example speedruns, dogfight with AI, takeoff challenges and so on. At first building planes is difficult. I can guarantee that first planes you will make (including me) will look like ♥♥♥♥. But the feeling of accomplishment when you take off in the plane you were building the last 30 minutes is amazing. Oh and you can also use weapons on your planes. From cannons to rockets and stuff that goes BOOM when it hits the ground. Dont worry, bombs are not useless. You can sink ships and bomb bridges with them. I also like that game devs are active on the forums and help you with any issues and take your ideas into account.\n\nGame is amazing and worth the money.\nWhat are you waiting for?\nBUY IT.","March 27","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can start off with an idea for a plane, build it, test it, tweak it, test it, tweak it again... and then it's three hours later and you have a plane that you've evolved into something unique.\nThe plane building tools are easy to use and quite intuitive, and controlling any vaguely competent plane in the air is fine.  The challenges and races included in the game are limited, but good for giving you a start.  After that, it's coming up with your own designs, or taking on design challenges posted through the online community that keeps you coming back for more.","February 6","true","652.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't have to be a gamer as such. If you have more than a passing interest in aviation in general, you will enjoy building an aircraft from scratch and soon start realising that the few basic rules of aerodynamics and physics are important to get your kite airworthy. For the first 10 - 20 hours, I did nothing but build and test fly my contraptions! It was only then that I started to do the many challenges that are in the game. I now have 75 + hours (a lot for me) and I'm still getting to grips with both the different planes I've built and making progress in the challenges. The graphics may be a tad basic but you still feel like your taking your invention into the real world and seeing how it sizes up!\nI haven't even started on the armaments part of the game, so I still have that to look forward to also.\nAll in all, for the price,Simple  Planes is great sandbox type game and allows the casual aviation buff to delve into the world of aerodynamics in simple but pleasing way.

It would be ok for the crazy good desighner people (you probly wont become) and youll just for get about it, DO NOT GET THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.","March 12","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a ton of non-planes too (tanks, cars, boats, cities, butterflies, iphones and I think I saw a dragon at one point)\nThough the first statement was a lie, the flying bit of this game is spot on (though the physics could be thought out; yes, I'm looking at you invincible cockpits...) But beyond that, it is alot like KSP's spaceplanes (move the C.O.L back, plane becomes stable but sluggish). BUT this game goes into ALOT more depth than KSP, for example, the control surfaces in KSP are seperate parts, but in SimplePlanes they are integrated into the wing and can be configurated. Secondly, THE FUSELAGE BLOCK, my favourite block in the entire game (minus the miniguns, of course).\n\nNow, about negatives... Here is a list of what I believe, are this game's shortcomings:\nNo symmetry mode (there is a symmetry option, but it's manual right now)\nGame seems empty (they are working on this, at this moment)\nLimited Part Palette (Steam Community is being added for mods)\n\nIn total, this game is probably the most in-depth game based on what you can build with the selection of parts avalable. And even though it has some problems, it will always be the first game I turn to when I wanna have some fun with planes.\n\nI have already recommended to a friend, and would recommend another.","March 8","true","59.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Might be uneven drag?\nParts when mirrored don't always attach.\nSometimes it's hard to get parts to attach to a certain part, instead of all the parts around it.\nSometimes parts want to lock to another parts connection point and sometimes they don't, this seems to be random.\n\nWow, that's a lot of cons compared to pros. Well anyway it is a fun game and I love building things. Unlike a lot of devolopers they are still adding things to the game, so hopfully most of those cons will disappear in time.","March 8","true","351.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite simple in theory but to make a plane that actually flies, you need to practice a lot. Basically the main goal is to achieve two balances: weight/power and center of mass (CoM)/center of lift (CoL). If you like seeing a problem (plane crashes every time or doesn't take off at all) and then fiddling with parts trying to solve it, then you'll like SimplePlanes.\n\n+ Hundreds of good planes to download from the community website.\n+ The community itself is amiable and ready to help.\n+ Almost everything in this game is adjustable (except engines and landing gears, maybe).\n\n- Few locations to fly.\n- Not much fun to play challenges (for me at least).","March 9","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think of it like KSP, with a full focus on just the planes, the experience in building them and fun of flying your own creations. Think of it like that, except with slightly simpler but more diversified possibilities. For example - Can you very faithfully replicate the Fiat G.91 in KSP? No, of course not. Sure, KSP technically has more to do, but this game caters to the people who just want to have lots of fun building planes and testing them out. If you find that sort of creative freedom boring, then well. I won't judge, and I also won't recommend the game to you. For those that love the idea though, sign up and get this game, it's really worth the money from what fun I've gotten out of it.","March 11","true","95.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think of it like KSP, with a full focus on just the planes, the experience in building them and fun of flying your own creations. Think of it like that, except with slightly simpler but more diversified possibilities. For example - Can you very faithfully replicate the Fiat G.91 in KSP? No, of course not. Sure, KSP technically has more to do, but this game caters to the people who just want to have lots of fun building planes and testing them out. If you find that sort of creative freedom boring, then well. I won't judge, and I also won't recommend the game to you. For those that love the idea though, sign up and get this game, it's really worth the money from what fun I've gotten out of it.","March 11","true","95.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
