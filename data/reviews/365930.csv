The game has been on steam since the 31st of August yet has no reviews or screenshots. It seems the game won't run on any Windows system due to the period at the end of the games folder in the steam directory. I had to run it in SAM to get the minimum playtime required to write a review.","October 13, 2015","false","0.2"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","1"

You can read about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/365930/discussions/0/487870763296052311/\nSince 23 October 2015 Update. it now can run in windows but still need to workaround before you can fully enjoy the game.\nGuide for it here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=540154895\n\nTechinal issue aside, I could say that this game is pretty darn good.\nYou only play with arrow keys in this game and your mission is get to the end point of each level.\nThere are 60 normal levels to finish plus some bonus level.\n","October 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Well, it would be if it wasn't also dealing with annoying scrolling backgrounds (seizure danger?), an avatar moving just fast enough to run into any bot you're following and die, and the angular avatar means that turning a corner is a bit like threading a needle.\n\nThere's no way to exit the game, "partial controller support" means keyboard only (as far as I can tell), the "play" button on Steam always runs the installer, and the game's native resolution is 965*620 or thereabouts.\n\nNot my cup of tea, and even if it was, I'd probably think it slightly overpriced.","December 13, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Nothing to write about.\n\nEdit: Actually the only positive review already mentions all of this, oops!","December 9, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It looks lke it's something made during a gamejam.\nThe gameplay is very basic,  nothing original although it's done properly.\n\nWorst point is probably the music. It's just horrible and you get quickly sick of it.\n\nYou probably won't get hooked by the game enough to finish all the levels and will give up out of boreness at the first  difficult level. For me, it was level 74. Whoever designed this level is a sadist ;)\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
