It takes the same experience and replaces those tactical battles with a space fighter sim. It's definately fun but it's  a bit of a departure from the rest of the series.\n\nIf you are playing on a modern system(xp-recent) then there will be a game breaking bug for this game that will prevent research from completing. THERE IS A FIX FOR THIS and it is a must if you are gonna play it on a modern machine.

Instead of being a turn-based ground combat game, it is an amazing real-time space combat game. Like most XCOM games, you have to manage resources, bases, and soldiers (or in this case, pilots). It isn't too well optimized for modern computers and I think the resolution has a maximum of somewhere around 1080x720, but it is still a great game.\n\nThe best part, though, is that it isn't X-COM: Enforcer.","August 13, 2014","true","0.8"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","29","35","3","2"

Sadly if you are playing on a relatively new machine there will be some game killing bugs. 1) alien data jammers can't be killed. If you try to engage them they just dont show up leaving u in space chasing a radar blip that you can never catch untill u get bored and retreat. Its a pain because they shut down your research and there is nothing you can do about it. 2) pirate bases have the same bug. You can't kill them so get ready to fight suicidal pirate fighter craft every 5 minutes. Not fun. If you have an old rig picking up dust somewhere the sure buy this game and enjoy because it really is a fantastic game. But if you don't then I'd pass.","December 29, 2013","false","4.9"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","31","47","0","2"

I thought it was pretty hard at first, but once I figured out how to play, I had a LOT of fun. I think this game is really underrated. It has all of the cool base management of Xcom, but then the battles are real-time flight sim. The campaign is awesome, and I also really like that there's a "skirmish mode" that u can create your own custom practice battle and jump right into the action and/or practice your fighting skills if needed.

I've never encountered an X-Wing style game where you also control the strategic side. After all those times you were hideously outgunned, or had completely the wrong warheads etc on X-Wing, TIE Fighter etc, it's nice to be able to do something about that. Now it's YOUR job to make sure your craft are up to spec. Also ties UFO, TFTD and Apoc together nicely, and hey its a great game in it's own right. Yes, it isn't the game everyone expected when a new X-Com game was announced back in 1997, but it's a worthy addition to the series.","July 18, 2012","true","11.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

It's... complicated.\nBefore I start explaining, let me link this XKCD[imgs.xkcd.com] comic.\n\nX-COM interceptor is a bad game, but in some peculiar way, enjoyable. Put simply: it's so bad it's good.\nI can not in good faith recommend it, because it's bad, on the other hand I can't not recommend it, because it's possible that you may enjoy it.\n\nOn strategic side, it's a typical X-COM styled game, adapted to specific environment. You build bases, expand them with modules, research techs (story-wise you download them from Galactic Science Corps, gameplay wise it's just like research in every other such game), you hire pilots, buy craft, weapons and equipment, and send them to intercept UFOs.\n\nCombat is centred about classic dogfighting, with "air drag", max speed and other such elements which are staple of oldschool dogfighting, but make no sense in space. Not that it's unusual for "space" flight sim, a lot are guilty of that and it's not necessarily a bad thing.\nWord of warning, combat is very fast paced, so fast that it takes some time to get used to. That's not a problem though, your wingmen are very capable and will win fights for you, until you start carrying your own weight.\n\nThat's about facts, but what makes it enjoyable?\nHard to say, attempts at humour are corny, reading "news from Earth" will make you groan or facepalm, interface is clunky because it pretends to be retro-futuristic in-universe screens/displays, combat repetitive and simplistic which leaks into strategic layer also making it simplistic.\nStill, campaign is short, individual missions rarely take more then minute, big chunk of which is "fly in", and "hyperspace out" animations, and this is probably what saves Interceptor: it's too short to bore you (too much).\n\nAll in all, it's very subjective, I give negative review because it's bad, but I did enjoy it in a way, maybe you will too?\n\n\n\nSide note: there's a bug that makes enemy installations impossible to kill, it's solved in unofficial .exe patch, but launching Interceptor with this exe prevented Steam from properly logging my playtime, hence so low value - contrary to what Steam says, I did play game from start to end.","February 12","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played this game before, it may still get a playthrough thanks to nostalgia. However, if you have never played this game before, it is doubtful that you will both understand how to play this game, nor find it worthwhile to actually play through it. Not to mention, Interceptor was probably the weakest of all the original X-COM games.\n\nWhile it may not really have stood the test of time to be playable to the masses, it is a title that will always be remembered by those who enjoyed it many years ago.\n\n4/10 "Not worth playing today"","January 26","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's... complicated.\nBefore I start explaining, let me link this XKCD[imgs.xkcd.com] comic.\n\nX-COM interceptor is a bad game, but in some peculiar way, enjoyable. Put simply: it's so bad it's good.\nI can not in good faith recommend it, because it's bad, on the other hand I can't not recommend it, because it's possible that you may enjoy it.\n\nOn strategic side, it's a typical X-COM styled game, adapted to specific environment. You build bases, expand them with modules, research techs (story-wise you download them from Galactic Science Corps, gameplay wise it's just like research in every other such game), you hire pilots, buy craft, weapons and equipment, and send them to intercept UFOs.\n\nCombat is centred about classic dogfighting, with "air drag", max speed and other such elements which are staple of oldschool dogfighting, but make no sense in space. Not that it's unusual for "space" flight sim, a lot are guilty of that and it's not necessarily a bad thing.\nWord of warning, combat is very fast paced, so fast that it takes some time to get used to. That's not a problem though, your wingmen are very capable and will win fights for you, until you start carrying your own weight.\n\nThat's about facts, but what makes it enjoyable?\nHard to say, attempts at humour are corny, reading "news from Earth" will make you groan or facepalm, interface is clunky because it pretends to be retro-futuristic in-universe screens/displays, combat repetitive and simplistic which leaks into strategic layer also making it simplistic.\nStill, campaign is short, individual missions rarely take more then minute, big chunk of which is "fly in", and "hyperspace out" animations, and this is probably what saves Interceptor: it's too short to bore you (too much).\n\nAll in all, it's very subjective, I give negative review because it's bad, but I did enjoy it in a way, maybe you will too?\n\n\n\nSide note: there's a bug that makes enemy installations impossible to kill, it's solved in unofficial .exe patch, but launching Interceptor with this exe prevented Steam from properly logging my playtime, hence so low value - contrary to what Steam says, I did play game from start to end.","February 12","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
