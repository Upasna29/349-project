But don't be tempted, the flaws are terrible and many.  After playing 0.1.2.1 in January 2015. I'm going to probably give this game a year or more before trying again.  And now I have given it a year - it's January 2016 - and things have changed but not drastically.\n\nFirst off, the good stuff.  Unclaimed World is like Majesty and Dwarf Fortress at it's core.  You designate tasks and one or more of your free-willed plebs will undertake them.  There is no mico-managing workers.  The banter between the various colonists is the perfect way to introduce the new world.  The scenarios are not random so after a couple of tries you'll know which colonists you get and what their skills are.\n\nI like the graphical style and the smooth character animations, they give a good sense of pioneering on an alien planet.  The character portraits, whilst somewhat caricatured, make knowing and empathising with said characters much easier.\n\nBut.\n\nThat's where the good stops.\n\nThere are currently only three stages, the tutorial which is so hand-holdy it's a chore; and not one I've forced myself to complete.  The first stage which is impossible to lose unless you try really, really had to get your colonists killed.  And lastly the second stage which crashes fairly early in.  Don't expect content, it's not here.\n\nThe user interface is bad - but vastly impoved from when it was first released.  And as things start to take shape it's now possible to see higher level issues with interface.  Right click context sensitive menus have been a 'thing' for a very, very long time now.  Unfortunately the devs have ignored years of progress and have a wierd left click, bring up a small box with an arrow, left click the arrow, bring up the context sensitive menu.  Right clicking hides the interface but doesn't close anything.  Left clicking brings back all the menus as they were.\n\nUnclaimed World is SLOW.  The characters idle along at maybe 5 to 10 pixels a seond but have to traverse areas that are thousands of pixels across.  Leaving the game to run whilst doing other things seems to be the only meaningful way to play.  Even after three version bumps this is still a problem and I suspect it's a fatal one.  I've added more detail in my first comment.\n\nAnd the speed gets worse on the (previously mentioned) second stage.  The characters still move at about the same rate but the screen refreshes at less than a frame a second until eventually it becomes a slide show and crashes.  I'm sure a simple 2D game should run better than this.\n\nThe artificial intelligence in a game where units can't be directly controlled has to be good.  But in Unclaimed World it's not.  It's awful.  I can't seem to prioritise tasks. Gathering seems to take precedence over everything.  So if there are a couple of construction projects going on and I set a new gather task then everyone drops what they're doing and rushes (relatively) to all gather the same stick of firewood.  Practicaly this means as long as there are gather tasks construcion tasks will not finish.\n\nFurthermore the AI in combat is even more deficient, with the characters commenting that they must attack as a group and then walking in one at a time; and only after the previous character has been killed.  It's horrible.  They also seem to get lost and will wander backwards and forwards through an enemy nest despite there not being any tasks near it.  I still haven't found a good way to get the colonist to move and work as a unit.\n\nIn closing, Unclaimed World has a lot of potential with a good exploration and command vibe but it is so far from being completed that it's barely even a tech demo - let alone a full game.  Avoid.","January 24, 2015","false","4.5"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","64","80","3","2"

The soundtrack and graphics are very appealing, and the banter between your scientists really sets the mood for exploration of an unknown world, giving you a sense of possibility and adventure. You assign general tasks and priorities and your scientists go to work, constructing shelters and weapons, exploring their surroundings and gathering materials. The basic concept is fun and draws from fantastic games like Dwarf Fortress, and it shows a lot of potential.\n\nHowever, the game is highly unfinished. The colonist AI is quite buggy despites multiple bugfixes and often they will stand there being slaughtered by enemies, refusing to attack, or fumbling with their hauling tasks. The UI is finicky. There is only one relatively small map and no sense of progression in terms of tech or anything of that sort.\n\nAnd all of that would be forgivable if there was any sense that actual development was happening on the game, as it is in Early Access and is not a finished product. However, since its Early Access in March, there has been very little in the way of significant new gameplay features nor any communication from the developers as to the state of development. They have not updated their dev blog since release in March and a question asking about the state of development in their (very quiet) forum has gone unanswered for a week.\n\nYou could ask the question whether this game is abandoned. Don't buy expecting it to get better, because there is no reason to.","July 23, 2014","false","8.0"," 71 of 106 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","71","106","0","0"

I love how the game combines advanced technologies with very low level primitive technologies to give an exciting twist on economic and town management in a futuristic sci-fi setting.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing the old Caesar 3, Emperor and Pharoah games then then this is your type of simulation game but it is however much more than these games because it combines other aspects into the settlement running that make it a lot less mechanical and requires a lot more input from the player, it really pulls the aspects of building a town that will thrive while ensuring that you survive together into one continuous journey. You will constantly be tested by dangerous beasts that try to eat your settlers and plagued by vermin who steal your food stores.\n\nI bought this game at a very early stage of development and was very disappointed with the lack of features in the game but since the release of a lot more content it has started to become the simulator/town management game that I have dreamed of playing for so long and has really in my opinion become money well spent on a game under development even though I didn't initially feel this way.\n\nBe advised that the game is still in a very early stage of development and there does tend to be a long wait time on updates to the game but when an update is released it tends to add a whole new level of depth to the game which really makes it worth playing which is why I have recently logged so many hours playing this game.\n\nI would like to see a lot more content added to this game both in the world variety (fauna, flora and environment) as well as different scenario types each with their own unique challenges. Unfortunately there is only a single player mode so there is no intertribal warring and there is currently no sandbox mode.","May 29","true","61.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics didn’t seem to be worth a mention … I mean you’re playing with midgets \nWell two days ago I though what the heck, seeing as the devs are not going to drop the price I just get it over with and buy it. They’ll probably reduce the price now that I’ve bought the game (Murphy’s Law).\nI have only 90 minutes on record with this game and I must admit, its 90 minutes that went by very quickly. The reason being that I started enjoying these midgets’ tasks to complete. They seem a bit lazy because they move very slow, but hey their going through a tough time right. And they seem reluctant to start working on tasks that are urgent, but that’s the rebellious nature of man. As mentioned the time spent on playing this game went buy very quickly and that is because I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Its one of those games where you say “I just want them to build this before I quit”, and after that its one more thing and the process just keep on repeating itself until you see the night is gone and you need to get ready for school or work, or even worse you’re totally late for your date with the girl of your dreams. O well, you’re now learning how to survive, so you’ll probably get a new girl. Maybe not your dream girl but hey, if you play sports you have to live with the injuries.\nI can appreciate the fact that the game is still in early access therefor a lot of work still needs to be done. So I think the end product should be very good. The idea of starting with nothing, salvaging, gathering and surviving is a very intriguing idea and I think there is a level of satisfaction to make these guys do stuff in order to survive.\nSo do I recommend buying Unclaimed World in its early access state?

But don't be tempted, the flaws are terrible and many.  After playing 0.1.2.1 in January 2015. I'm going to probably give this game a year or more before trying again.  And now I have given it a year - it's January 2016 - and things have changed but not drastically.\n\nFirst off, the good stuff.  Unclaimed World is like Majesty and Dwarf Fortress at it's core.  You designate tasks and one or more of your free-willed plebs will undertake them.  There is no mico-managing workers.  The banter between the various colonists is the perfect way to introduce the new world.  The scenarios are not random so after a couple of tries you'll know which colonists you get and what their skills are.\n\nI like the graphical style and the smooth character animations, they give a good sense of pioneering on an alien planet.  The character portraits, whilst somewhat caricatured, make knowing and empathising with said characters much easier.\n\nBut.\n\nThat's where the good stops.\n\nThere are currently only three stages, the tutorial which is so hand-holdy it's a chore; and not one I've forced myself to complete.  The first stage which is impossible to lose unless you try really, really had to get your colonists killed.  And lastly the second stage which crashes fairly early in.  Don't expect content, it's not here.\n\nThe user interface is bad - but vastly impoved from when it was first released.  And as things start to take shape it's now possible to see higher level issues with interface.  Right click context sensitive menus have been a 'thing' for a very, very long time now.  Unfortunately the devs have ignored years of progress and have a wierd left click, bring up a small box with an arrow, left click the arrow, bring up the context sensitive menu.  Right clicking hides the interface but doesn't close anything.  Left clicking brings back all the menus as they were.\n\nUnclaimed World is SLOW.  The characters idle along at maybe 5 to 10 pixels a seond but have to traverse areas that are thousands of pixels across.  Leaving the game to run whilst doing other things seems to be the only meaningful way to play.  Even after three version bumps this is still a problem and I suspect it's a fatal one.  I've added more detail in my first comment.\n\nAnd the speed gets worse on the (previously mentioned) second stage.  The characters still move at about the same rate but the screen refreshes at less than a frame a second until eventually it becomes a slide show and crashes.  I'm sure a simple 2D game should run better than this.\n\nThe artificial intelligence in a game where units can't be directly controlled has to be good.  But in Unclaimed World it's not.  It's awful.  I can't seem to prioritise tasks. Gathering seems to take precedence over everything.  So if there are a couple of construction projects going on and I set a new gather task then everyone drops what they're doing and rushes (relatively) to all gather the same stick of firewood.  Practicaly this means as long as there are gather tasks construcion tasks will not finish.\n\nFurthermore the AI in combat is even more deficient, with the characters commenting that they must attack as a group and then walking in one at a time; and only after the previous character has been killed.  It's horrible.  They also seem to get lost and will wander backwards and forwards through an enemy nest despite there not being any tasks near it.  I still haven't found a good way to get the colonist to move and work as a unit.\n\nIn closing, Unclaimed World has a lot of potential with a good exploration and command vibe but it is so far from being completed that it's barely even a tech demo - let alone a full game.  Avoid.","January 24, 2015","false","4.5"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","64","80","3","2"

The soundtrack and graphics are very appealing, and the banter between your scientists really sets the mood for exploration of an unknown world, giving you a sense of possibility and adventure. You assign general tasks and priorities and your scientists go to work, constructing shelters and weapons, exploring their surroundings and gathering materials. The basic concept is fun and draws from fantastic games like Dwarf Fortress, and it shows a lot of potential.\n\nHowever, the game is highly unfinished. The colonist AI is quite buggy despites multiple bugfixes and often they will stand there being slaughtered by enemies, refusing to attack, or fumbling with their hauling tasks. The UI is finicky. There is only one relatively small map and no sense of progression in terms of tech or anything of that sort.\n\nAnd all of that would be forgivable if there was any sense that actual development was happening on the game, as it is in Early Access and is not a finished product. However, since its Early Access in March, there has been very little in the way of significant new gameplay features nor any communication from the developers as to the state of development. They have not updated their dev blog since release in March and a question asking about the state of development in their (very quiet) forum has gone unanswered for a week.\n\nYou could ask the question whether this game is abandoned. Don't buy expecting it to get better, because there is no reason to.","July 23, 2014","false","8.0"," 71 of 106 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","71","106","0","0"

Currently I own several early access games and Unclaimed World is deffinately at the top of my list. Patience is key with all early access games expect buggs. And talk about them. Creating games is a long process especially if the dev team is small. Overall the game has a great concept with unlimited possibilities and I like sim type games so I recommend this game.

I love how the game combines advanced technologies with very low level primitive technologies to give an exciting twist on economic and town management in a futuristic sci-fi setting.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing the old Caesar 3, Emperor and Pharoah games then then this is your type of simulation game but it is however much more than these games because it combines other aspects into the settlement running that make it a lot less mechanical and requires a lot more input from the player, it really pulls the aspects of building a town that will thrive while ensuring that you survive together into one continuous journey. You will constantly be tested by dangerous beasts that try to eat your settlers and plagued by vermin who steal your food stores.\n\nI bought this game at a very early stage of development and was very disappointed with the lack of features in the game but since the release of a lot more content it has started to become the simulator/town management game that I have dreamed of playing for so long and has really in my opinion become money well spent on a game under development even though I didn't initially feel this way.\n\nBe advised that the game is still in a very early stage of development and there does tend to be a long wait time on updates to the game but when an update is released it tends to add a whole new level of depth to the game which really makes it worth playing which is why I have recently logged so many hours playing this game.\n\nI would like to see a lot more content added to this game both in the world variety (fauna, flora and environment) as well as different scenario types each with their own unique challenges. Unfortunately there is only a single player mode so there is no intertribal warring and there is currently no sandbox mode.","May 29","true","61.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics didn’t seem to be worth a mention … I mean you’re playing with midgets \nWell two days ago I though what the heck, seeing as the devs are not going to drop the price I just get it over with and buy it. They’ll probably reduce the price now that I’ve bought the game (Murphy’s Law).\nI have only 90 minutes on record with this game and I must admit, its 90 minutes that went by very quickly. The reason being that I started enjoying these midgets’ tasks to complete. They seem a bit lazy because they move very slow, but hey their going through a tough time right. And they seem reluctant to start working on tasks that are urgent, but that’s the rebellious nature of man. As mentioned the time spent on playing this game went buy very quickly and that is because I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. Its one of those games where you say “I just want them to build this before I quit”, and after that its one more thing and the process just keep on repeating itself until you see the night is gone and you need to get ready for school or work, or even worse you’re totally late for your date with the girl of your dreams. O well, you’re now learning how to survive, so you’ll probably get a new girl. Maybe not your dream girl but hey, if you play sports you have to live with the injuries.\nI can appreciate the fact that the game is still in early access therefor a lot of work still needs to be done. So I think the end product should be very good. The idea of starting with nothing, salvaging, gathering and surviving is a very intriguing idea and I think there is a level of satisfaction to make these guys do stuff in order to survive.\nSo do I recommend buying Unclaimed World in its early access state?

The last few patches have taken this one from hard to play, to you can honestly build a settlement.  The game mechanics are pretty straight forward, not that difficult to master, and a lot of fun.\n\nThe developers on this one I can say honestly care.
