If the fate of the world becomes your responsibility?\nWhat will you do? If you are forced to leave the ones you love?\nWhat will you do? If you know that you have little time left to live?\n\nMillia -The Ending- is a rather short visual novel made by Millia Soft, with a few choices to make, of which those choices will lead to 3 different endings. Even though there are quite a number of translation errors throughout the game, the story is well written and very engaging. The art is beautiful and the song 'Akogare no hana' fits the story really well.\n\nAs stated above, Millia -The Ending- is the made by Millia Soft which is an indie VN studio and it is a cut above most of the other indie visual novels that are on Steam right now. Do consider reading Millia -The Ending- as it is worth your time and the game isn't too expensive. I am definitely looking forward to other works produced by MIllia Soft!","January 19","true","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I played it till the end in one go coz you just can't stop in the middle. At first I was just laughing about all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I have to put up in the story, but slowly I got immersed deeper.. and deeper... into the story to the point that I have nothing else to say. Great story, I would really hope they make the story even longer...\n\nRIP my beauty sleep on the night of January 19th, 2015....\n","January 20","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

It's about how far one would go for love and happiness along with the feeling for on another being expressed. This was just a emotional and intersting novel to me and i wish there were more like, or even a series to the game. I really do recommend this game to anyone that loves visual novels and anime and would like a good story line about romance and the feeling for on another and how love will always prevail.","January 23","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoorPrdx/recommended/428060/","DoorPrdx","Mog Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoorPrdx/","1298 products in account","Millia -The Ending- is a short but sweet visual novel about the lengths one would go to protect the simles of loved ones. Despite the lack of polish overall, I fully enjoyed the story and what it had to offer. It's paced so well that I was able to become emotionally invested in these four characters in such a short amount of time, and every ending wraps up things nicely.\n\nFor $5, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's not the end all of visual novels by any means, but I found it to be really refreshing compared to all the other VNs on Steam right now. I recommend it to those just looking for a casual, fun, and emotional read. Be wary that there is a lot of grammatical errors all throughout this work that certainly makes things a lot less impactful, but it's still a good read nonetheless.\n\nRead my full review here: https://kupowrites.wordpress.com/2016/01/16/millia-the-ending-evn-review/","January 19","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am a big fan of choices and consequences, however this VN had few choices to choose from. Also those choices you don't get to see direct correlation until later in the game. By then you reliaze it might be too late (Thank God for save files......sooooo many.....). Story was well written. At times the grammar/spelling were so bad that I just wanted to quit. But the story kept pulling me in, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Most VNs try to sell off body parts which can be very distracting while reading, but the curves here weren't demanding my attention which was nice. Overall great VN with a good price tag there are VNs out there that sell the curves and ask for a higher price tag but this VN makes up for it in story.","March 30","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
