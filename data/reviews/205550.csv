I hope that the developer continues to support the game since it does show promise in being a laid-back co-op shooter with a unique graphic style and charm, but as it stands there are  better free-to-play games available. Beyond that, I feel a bit swindled since screenshots elude to vehicle combat - which simply does not exist.","July 11, 2012","false","1.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, this game has some really nice graphics and interesting maps but sometimes can get a bit boring and repetitive if you play it longer sessions.\n\nGame PlayLet's start off by talking about some of the good things about this game that really make it what it is. The game play is decent and the objective is simple enough to understand. Keep the generator on and wait for a helicopter to come and rescue you while you defend yourself against zombies. It has a nice way of keeping the game too easy or too hard with the threat level that you can choose from, Low, Medium or High. Starting off you will probably want to start with low just to get used to the game. But where this game falls apart is the controls. You start off without any indication of what each button does or what. I mean it took me a minute or two to figure out, but it would've been nice for even just a screen at the start of the game to show what buttons do what. There is also no story at all to why you are where you are and how you got in this situation in the first place. It would've been nice for at least a little story to go with the game. The community itself is dead, don't even bother trying to find people in a public server because I doubt you will anymore. I would suggest playing this game with friends who already own it or if you're really desperate then buy a 4-pack so that you can play this game with your other friends. The enemies on this game are zombies and ghosts. When I first started up this game it came up with kill the ghost or you will be cursed. I was confused as I hadn't even had time to adjust myself to what the controls were. I would've liked a explanation to what you had to do to kill the ghost at the start when it explains how to win (keep generator on until the helicopter arrives) which would've made it a little less stressful. The game can also get a little repetitive as this isn't much variation to each of the levels which there are only 6 of. The ranking system whoever is nicely presented and well made. You unlock guns by levelling up then use the money you have got form the missions to buy them. It works really well with this sort of game. It's a great way to pass the time either if you're playing alone or with some of your friends. Although I would've liked the choice of First-Person mode instead of over the should Third-Person mode. There might've been a way to change but I couldn't figure it out because of there being no control menu or screen telling me.\nScore (Out Of 10): 6 - Gets repetitive, no tutorial, no story line and public community is dead.\n\nGraphics/art styleThis game has a smooth Frame even for not so good laptop like mine, but the walking animation for me is a bit weird. I would walk forward a step or two and the character would slide along and then do the walking animation half a second after. This really didn't look very good as the graphics in this game where really nicely presented and well polished. The map design was well implemented for the game play.\nScore (Out Of 10): 8 - Nice graphics and map design, but the walking animation makes the game fall a bit\n\nMusic & SoundsThere isn't really that much to say about Music and Sound in this game because there isn't much to talk about. There's some nice music at the starting menu, but once you enter a level there is no background music. There are just some generic sounds that you would expect from a game like this and that's it. Nothing really that unique about the sounds or music in this game.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Generic sounds and no background music once your in a level\n\nConclusionAll in all a alright game, as long as you have some friends to play this game with then you will be okay. The public multilayer servers are dead, don't even try to find people to play with on this game. Graphics are nicely presented but walking animation is a bit weird at times. Nothing really unique or special about the sounds or music in this game. Would recommend to people who want to play this game with their friends.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 14","true","1.2"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

The game isn't a regretful purchase for myself, as a matter of fact i still play the game from time to time, but i only do it when i want to go passing by life, the game is just that, a time waster, nothing more and nothing less.","June 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The online connection will vary, but from the little bits of playing this game online lag was noticeable. The graphics are ok with of course plenty of blood coming through your screens. I can only recommend this game when there is sale for this game but the enjoyment come from playing with your friends online, which sadly the game fails to delieve especillay if you have no friends to play as the online community for this game is a ghost house, since you can't find many people online. Even if you do mange to get a game going, you still face the many bug and glitches the game has compare to the original game (which is base on my experience).  5/10","June 11, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegeekyjedi/recommended/205550/","thegeekyjedi","Zen Diagram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegeekyjedi/","150 products in account","Foreign Legion : Multi Massacre is a game that shows a lot of potential.\nBeing released in 2012 by Sakari Games as a sequel to Foreign Legion : Buckets of Blood.\nThe community of this game is long gone seeing as how you will 99.9% of the time not see a single match up and running, but if you have a few friends that have this game then you will enjoy your time.\nLike I said this game shows a lot of potential, but it seemed to have gone to waste at some point during development and feels as though it was rushed out. Reusing the music from the first game.\nAs of its current state it seems to be stuck in its Halloween update and has been abandoned by the developer for a long time now. There are many glaring issues with the game such as the camera, some gamemodes being completely broken (Deathmatch on Pipeline can not end.), and also just having repetitive gameplay.\nSurprisingly I find myself playing this game more often than I should and it is an absolute blast for me. Unlike the opinions of many other people I really hope they do make another Foreign Legion and I really hope they take on the potential of being a whacky casual third person shooter.\nI would honestly give this game a 6/10 for the fact that it's a dead game when it comes to it's community, it's a buggy mess at times, and it just as so many issues that shouldn't exist even during the time of it's original release in 2012.\nBut during sales especially during the time of this review of being less than a dollar and the 4-pack being less than 2 dollars I find it worth it. Grab a few friends and have mindless fun for a few hours here and there.\n\nTL:DR\n-Game shows a lot of potential\n-Dead community and lots of issues\n-Great time waster\n\nPersonal Score : 6/10","December 24, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
