Its hardcore as you take on the extreme world of puppies, kittens, and even lions, wouldnt be hardcore without lions right?  As Dr.Dasiy life and death must be weighed in your hands as you deal with sick animals who are sad, have broken bones and get sick.  Make life changing decisions such as what type of floor to have, or what kind of desk the secretary should have to maximize her efficient output so you can better work with the animals.  A fun story combined with changes in the scenery and types of animals keeps the game interesting.  Sometimes it felt repetitive at the end of the game, but all of that is quickly cast aside as you realize lives are on the line!\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $6.99","December 28, 2013","true","3.9"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","19","30","9","0"

Especially in pet care, talking to the owners is an important part of the job, and they never even appear in the game. This means that an important part of this profession is actually mistaught in this game.\n\nIt's also not much fun to play.","July 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Your goal is just click in order as fast as you can to get the most pets through before your timer runs out.","July 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Oh how I was wrong.  The simplistic art style is a good change from Skyrim and the cell shading of this game makes Borderlands 2 look lame in comparasion.  The audio for this game is catchy and upbeat, much better than those games which have a real musician.  As for the gameplay all I can say is WOW!!  I never thought this game would be so much fun plus you get to save pets.  Like the pet octopus and dolphin you see on the game description.  I never knew I would feel such joy in helping save the life of someones virtual pet dolphin.  All I can say is get this game, you wont be disappointed, I know I wasn't.","December 28, 2012","true","15.7"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","10","19","12","0"

You might think you're getting a robust veterinarian simulator, but you'd be wrong. The animals even sit in chairs in the waiting room like they're people. This is not the kind of anthropomorphising we need our children to be experiencing.","January 1, 2013","false","0.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","11","21","8","0"

This game has given me a new persepective on life, and the storyline itself is awe-inspiring.  The characters are very fleshed out, the music is amazing, and the graphics are a monumental stepping-stone for what the future of video games should become.  I can easily add this game to the small list of three (now four) video games that i give a solid 10/10.","October 16, 2011","true","0.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","0"
