"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gates_of_Bates/recommended/461880/","Gates_of_Bates","Gates","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gates_of_Bates/","158 products in account","Picture yourself as a ball around on a thin platform (unfortunately no Monkey in the ball)...avoiding obstacles, making precise jumps from platform to platform....and cursing at your inability to make the marble move the way you want. Then picture yourself doing that 100 more times. It's actually quite fun, until it isn't.\n\nBefore I get into it: I'd give the game a 4/10. You'll probably play it once and put it away. But for less than $3, it's not much of a gamble. And yes, I did beat the game.\n\nPros:\n-The mable mechanic is really intersting. It takes some getting used to, but it is really nice once you have adapted.\n-The level variety is pretty interesting, ranging from slow platforming stages, to racing down the strip as fast as you can, to avoiding obstacles that will push you out of the way.\n-Some of the music is good.\n-The level designs are interesting, but get a little repetitive.\n\nCons:\n-There is no incentive for anything. The items are pretty useless. You can only use your coins for lives and slightly different skins. Points...Are just points.\n-Because items mean essentially nothing, there are many levels where you say screw it, move forward as fast as possible and jump until you reach the goal. This is further enhanced with the first bug I list below.\n-There are items that seem to serve zero purpose.\n-No timer of any kind. This would cause some stress and make me feel like I'm playing a game. Add some speedrunning aspect or a countdown timer to make it more interesting.\n-The first 50 or so levels are varied and somewhat interesting. After 50 you end up seeing previous levels with small differences. The last 10 levels or so...just a straight line with a bunch of 1 obstacle. Oh..and screw level 82.\n-Some of the music stinks.\n-Not sure if this is on purpose, but in some of the levels  the end of the platforms are not flush, causing a really awkward stall in flow. For instance, on the ginat ball rails you'll be fine until the end..where you hit the platform and get launched out of bounds.\n\nBugs:\n-Low on lives? No worries, just press start and restart level before you die...no lives lost.\n-Music stops looping on certain stages, so you're stuck with the sounds of the level, which is typically one 2-3 second sound that constantly repeats.\n-Some levels have no music.\n-Some levels are broken. You'll see messages along the lines of "Lighting needs to reinitialize. <X objects did not appear>"\n\n\nAll in all, give it a try if you want. If you've played games like this...you'll realize right away that it's not the quality of other ball platformers, but it's alright to waste some time.","May 6","false","3.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","0"

I read the other reviews and wondered if they had been playing the same game.\n\nI don't usually like "puzzle" games but this one is beautifully balanced between learning - failure and then success.  It's a fair game that won't let you away with mistakes but at the same time - rewards your patience and skill.\n\nThe graphics and music and pleasant but I did notice some frame dropping - but that happened only on certain levels.  Most were fluid and responsive.\n\nThis game has been cleverly made to draw you in.  And it drew me in.  You also get about 28 lives to start with and you'll need them.  But I found that as I got better - I found new life tokens which were great.\n\nIt's been a while since i've seen a game that is beautiful and absorbing without any annoying side issues.  You get right to the heart of gameplay - immediately.  No talking racoons or wizards to annoy and distract.\n\nA very nice example of intelligence - design and thoughtful creativity.

Sadly it did not; it seems a bit too rough and unpolished, the lighting effects aren't too great, the backgrounds can at times be so bright they make the level itself hard to see, and the mixture of different texture styles are a bit jarring to the eyes.\n\nWhen you make a game based around trial and error for solving the levels, a lives-system is infuriatingly aggravating and adds an extra level of frustration to the game. The timer for the puzzles also includes all your previous attempts as well, which makes the solve-timer seem somewhat skewed. My biggest gripe with the controls is the fact that you can't turn the camera around, but rather tilt it left and right in an odd fashion, which makes precision jumping an absolute nightmare. Now I don't mind difficulty, Marble Blast could drive my patience into the ground and grind on it and not let up until I decided to GIT GUD, but compounded with a limited number of lives (although it doesn't take many coins to buy 100 lives) takes away from the experience.\n\nThe physics seem a bit wonky at times as well, there's a sequence of falling platforms that you have to get across in one of the earlier levels, and if you're on the platform when it starts falling, the direction you'll be sent bouncing off into is seemingly completely random.\n\nI feel there is so much potential in this game, but the menus look like they're straight out of the 90's, the aestethics rub me the wrong way (the textures gives me the cheap low-key indie vibe in some levels), and the fact that precision jumping is a total ♥♥♥♥♥ when you can't tell if your jump will be straight or not, and it just makes me long back to Marble Blast Gold and its sprawly levels of creative and sunny look and feel.\n\nIn its current state I cannot with good conscience give this game anything but a thumbs down; the game isn't strictly speaking BAD; while I didn't expect it to be Marble Blast, and I expected to be let down on at least a few points, the fact that it let me down on nearly all points means the game doesn't get my recommendation. I applaud the developer and hope they can take it to heart and make either updates to the current game, or a new one with improved controls, a little face-lift, and perhaps some more cheery backgrounds (that perhaps also wouldn't be so taxing on lower end machines as well), then they can have a new review and perhaps a recommendation from me too.\n\nTL:DR; there is a lot of potential in here, but the games' controls are too restrictive to deliver a good experience. Bad camera controls make precision jumping a pain, and the backgrounds can be too demanding for low-end computers without choosing a very low resolution.","June 5","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hau5test/recommended/461880/","hau5test","Hau5test","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hau5test/","302 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAtum Games developed this game in Unreal Engine 4 and it’s quite obvious that there’s a lot of effect work going on which is sometimes very nice to look at, but on many occasions also very blinding me while cruising along those tracks.\n\nIt’s and interesting spin on a classic idea, yet the execution of it shows some severe problems. Let’s begin with the obvious, the UI of the game does not scale properly, in fact, the font and information shown on screen are sometimes hard to read. I recommend a thicker font maybe and an adjustment of the underlying shadow effect.\n\nBut my complains won’t stop there, ooooh no, there are some logical flaws with the game I just can’t understand. For example, why do we have different currencies with money and score? In classic Jump ‘n Runs the money value stands for a progress until we unlock a bonus life. For example 100 coins turn into one extra life and so on. Here we just collect… for the sake of collecting. I guessed that there would be a shop, as seen in the small menu screen between levels, but whenever I try to open said shop with the prompt of the shown button, only the next level loads. Is this some leftover artifact? Is this game not even finished yet but thrown on the steam market to make some quick money? Those questions are sadly coming while playing more and more of this game.\n\nGood thing I waited a few days to review this game, because now there are at least some improvements placed into the game. So now with 50 scorepoints, you gain 1 live, the shop is finally reachable so you can use your coins to buy more lifes and different skins for your marble. You also see now a small statistic at the end of your run showing you the seconds down to the millisecond that you needed to finish a level and how many coins you got from the total amount in the level. So yeah, at least some stuff had been fixed. But the rest? Let’s continue.\n\nSee I don’t have proof of those accusations, so I tend not to make them, but I still think that some things haven’t even checked properly before posting this to Steam. For example if I set the resolution to fullscreen 1080p, the options menu background is not filling the entire screen. Then the options itself are very limited,  even though the game was running on a stable framerate at all times. Then there’s an input bug, when I get from the game over screen to the main menu and then use the continue function, no controls work, neither from the keyboard input nor from the controller. Somebody had to use this function at least once to check if there is no problem. This bug is reproduceable, so I expect that to be seen from the devs.\n\nSo… is this game even any good? Well… I have to say, when the game is working properly, it is fun. The level design looks good and gives us various settings with different soundtracks, while not being too annoying after a while. I would love to have a better input control on the ball. Because from my perspective, it is more fun to have control over the height of the jump by pressing the jump button for a different amount of time. In this game you can quickly push the jump button or hold it, the height is always the same, making those jumps on the Z axis more difficult as we can not see how far the distance between two tiles is sometimes and we have to adjust our speed in order to get the correct length to jump. I suggest something like a marker, poles for example, would give a visual help to see how far different tiles are apart from each other on different axis.\n\nAt least the gamepad control in this game works, as long as your are on a track. The main menu itself has sadly no controller support and you have to take your hand from the gamepad to use the mouse. This should not be a thing, if I chose at the beginning of the game to play with the controller, I should not switch between different options of inputs to continue the game. A PC game with lacking controller support where the game hugely benefits from a gamepad with sticks to control the player sphere, is not an option, this has to be fixed.\n\n\nThere is one final thing I want to address before I leave my final comment on this game: Why is the continue function after a game over so useless? There are to major things why failing is not a risk or even restricting our progress. First, when you depleted all your lifes you get an way too long game over screen, from which you can continue with one life left, but also with all your money and score. This does not make sense, why should you be able to continue endlessly after you have eaten all your lifes without any consequences? Again I point out to the classic jump and run games: Reset the money and score, and maybe give us 3 lifes instead of one single life.\n\nBut to be honest, you don’t even need to get to the game over screen, which is technically not even a proper game over screen as NOTHING is over after reaching that phase, because you can restart the level if you press options quick enough. Seriously, just cheese your way through levels, because if you miss the track, just restart the level and you’re good to go. You lose your money and score which you have earned from the beginning of the level until your failure, but your lifes stay the exact same. There is not logical reason why to restart the level, if it does not have any meaningful consequences for the player.\n\nThe only real consequence for the player is the few seconds it takes for the game to reload the level which is not only annoying, but from my perspective a bad design of the game mechanic. With the Unreal Engine 4 it has to be possible that if your ball is lost, you don’t have to reload the complete level, causing the music to stop and the player to be left without control for a few seconds. The proper way is to reset the camera, spawn a new ball and all the collectible objects in the level, without the music to stop or the player being left frustrated because of a small error in his calculations. It can be so easy to make a failure not frustrating, when you can easily retry again and again and again. Take a look at the new Trackmania Turbo or any Trackmania game for example. Every time you miss a jump or hit an object which causes you to lose time, just restart and retry immediately. This is how you can remain the game controls as it is, but give the player no additional frustration other than leaving him in his own fault of giving the wrong input.\n\nI can not recommend this game in this state.","May 7","false","1.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"
