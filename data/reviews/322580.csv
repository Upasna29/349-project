You click around to move; have to break all the breakable to get coins, (which gets tedious), solve easy puzzles. Very casual and unsophisticated.","September 21, 2014","false","0.1"," 92 of 133 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","92","133","0","3"

I went into it with an open mind and expecting nothing more than a simple puzzle game. But it feels like a mobile port and the puzzle design is extremely focused on trial and error with buttons that will randomly kill you. It is probably a good way to get people to buy more gold coins for a mobile game but its simply bothersome on the pc. Being forced to smash a bunch of barrels in every room you enter is also not that fun. The puzzles that i encountered in the game were very basic and some of them was just strangely designed.  Combine that with a annoying camera that sometimes wont let you see the puzzle components when you aren't pressing the buttons and you get a pretty boring and cheap puzzle game.","April 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's very frustrating to quit the game, (come on after 2 hours) and when I want to restart, i have tostart ALL OVER again, yes, from the very beginning  I wonder if it's possible to put updates and include a SAVE button???  Also i cannot zoom in.  The fire buttons are working i suppose, I do get a yellow sphere.  but i cannot jump, hitting my space bar does absolutely nothing. Maybe there is an update andi don't know about it?  I have a sony vaio and Nivdie (spelling) sound card. An i7 and the graphics are great but the controls arent all there. Please email me if you have ideas to make it work better.  Thanks.  doug","September 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","25","45","3","2"

This game is ... not good (it sucks.) ... at all. First,\n\nthe good ones:\nThe riddles are... um... ok i guess. It has... welp for a game of it's kind a good kind of graphics (though i have low ram and it lags a bit). It has a good music .. i gues... for this kind of game.\n\n\nThe bads: it's not woth it's money for the below reasons: It is full of bugs, like you can brake athe same jar with your mouse over 3 times if you press it fast (and trust me, not too fast... ), I opened a jar and it threw me a life that went on a spot that i couldn't go, when she jumps somewhere, she does like 1 minute to fall and though she is on air she can moove freely... it sucks.\nI hate all the sound efects it does, they really need to be compressed when played more than one together and not played every time you pass make an event.\nthe movement is a bit off. I hate the way that the camera is, it could be better like resident evil 1 where it's fixed but not always from above, it's quite disturbing.\nyou could (for gods shake do it) warn people that pressing buttons is lethal, don't let them waste at least one life to get it. It's lame. Wright something like "You feel a bad aura..." or "energy" or whatever "from this button"... something!\nIt really got on my nerves...\nI will keep this game on my computer (like i have an option, it's a gift anyways) in the trust that you will read all the bad reviews, mine too (i mean the good review that don't recoment this game ... ) and will do something about all of them in a massive update... else... don't make another game.\n\nConclusion: this would be a very good game in the 80's ... after that ... no. At least try it before publishing it.","January 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There are lots of containers to break that offer coins or, rarely, other items needed (sometimes an extra life), so break them all because the coins can be used to buy extra lives.\n\nMove carefully because you can take a game-ending fall which will mean you must start at the most recent checkpoint (hopefully, you'll remember where you were beyond that point). Unfortunately, the checkpoints, once used, are gone.\n\nThere are puzzles to solve, and monsters to defeat ---- but none are particularly difficult.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated, but the play is smooth enough with enough visual clues so you can find your way to the next objective.\n\nI see that some are unhappy that you are returned to the beginning of the game if you stop for a break, and it took a while to figure out that you have to complete an entire level before the game saves your progress. I don't like that, either, but at least you will be returned to the beginning of the level, not the beginning of the game.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun to play (once you figure out a few of its strange nuances), so because it doesn't allow saving wherever you are I recommend it with a bit of reservation. Maybe the devs will polish it up a bit later on. Might be best bought on sale until this happens.","August 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
