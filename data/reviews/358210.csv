And, of course, tons of items scattered around for points, and secrets aplenty! Some nice extra challenge for completionists who like to 100% levels.\n\nSure the game frustrates me to no end sometimes, with its unexpected attacks out of nowhere, and damn near impossible to avoid tricks and traps, but I can't stay angry at it.\nIt's just so fun, and brings me back to those wonderful days!","October 1, 2015","true","6.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

YES AGAIN!!!!\n\nBack in 1990s there was a "freeware" version of this game (Aka DEMO) and it was pretty long, you had full access to episode 1 which was long enough to make you believe you actually had played the complete game not a freeware. but these days games get released in funny prices $60 for less than DEMOs then $50 season passes which gives you a bit more access to the game time to time.\n\nGood old days that "gamers" used to be developers, today "businessmen" are the developers! just like this game says "R.I.P"","November 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The game is very fun while also being very challenging, with lots of different powerups to use and levels that greatly vary from each other, both on design and on challenge level. It's also curious that for a game that looks cute and where you're supposed to save cats and dogs, it can be a quite gory game as enemies will explode into gory bits when they die.\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is that the boss fights are very lackluster, the final boss in the game in special.\n\nBut the ending completely makes up to that - it's one of the cutest game endings I've ever seen.","December 18, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
