However, Stalingrad improves in areas where Blitzkreig fell short. For example, infantry is much more useful. They don't die so easily and can hold their own in gunfights.\n\nAlso, your units can't shoot through solid objects like in Blitzkreig.\n\nFor those that haven't touched Blitzkreig, Staligrad works like this: In every mission, you're given goals to accomplish with a selected amount of units at your disposal. It's your job to use these forces in such a way that inflicts heavy damage on your enemy's forces while you're miminalizing damage to yours. All while completing your goals.\n\nSounds simple, right? But there's a catch. Units aren't replaceable when killed and ammo is scarce. That's right, you are left at the mercy of whatever reinforcements the game decides to give you and what supplies are available.   More accurate realism as opposed to having supplies at the ready constantly in Blitzkreig.\n\nSo you best take your plan of attack/defence very seriously if you expect to last long.\n\nIn terms of Story/theme, Stalingrad is a WWII RTS based on historical facts on the invasion of Stalingrad during WWII. You can play as the Nazi's or the Red Army in two lengthy campaigns.\n\nIt's a good game that strives to improve upon  where Blitzkrieg fell short and certainly will scratch that hardcore strategy gaming itch.\n\nThere is only one complaint I have with this game. The music. It sucks and doesn't fit at all. I can understand maybe if they were trying to make this game stand out. But the gameplay already does that for Stalingrad. We don't need some really low-quality rock music blaring in our ear drums to appreciate good strategy gameplay. You'll want to mute it and play some good old Blitzkreig music or WWII themed music instead.","April 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 59 of 61 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","59","61","3","2"

It does everything I could want for a fun but still amazingly realistic ww2 strategy, it takes all the fun bits of games like blitzkrieg but makes them far more fun and far less tedious, if anyone is wondering this actually runs on the exact same engine that the first blitzkriegs ran off of\n\nSo if you ever missed blitzkrieg I think you’ll find this right up your street!  If you have never played one of these games you will be in for one hell of a treat! Especially if you love hard core ww2 strategies (but don’t worry it’s still pretty laid back for those of you who want a more relaxed rts)\n\nWhat do you do? How does it play?\n\nIn Stalingrad you’ll get the choice of either leading the Russian or German forces to victory (with the odd bit of help from their Romanian and Bulgarian allies). Instead of most ww2 strategies you’ll play Stalingrad will give you a reasonable sized force, and your marching orders, it’s then your problem to make what they have given you  complete the mission, your troop are not replaced once lost, SO BE CARFUL however you are given supply trucks and repair vehicles so you can resupply your troops with ammo and fix up your damaged vehicles this means most of the time its far better to carry out small organised skirmishes and fall back before the enemy gets wise as opposed to enormous spams  or bum rushes. Your also often given allot of air support in the forms of fighters, bomber, fighter-bombers, and recon planes.\n\nMy personal opinion\n\nOver the years I have seen countless games made on this engine spanning from the scorching deserts of north Africa to the bug ridden jungles of the Philippines even the bloody trenches of the first world war one, and now finally the frozen wastes of Stalingrad so it’s very easy for me to say this is one of the best uses of the engine it’s probably my favourite to be honest (maybe World War One is A BIT better) although the previous games allowed you to replenish you troops from supply trucks, this game works far better with that slight struggle,  and shortage on men you experience in the later missions  (especially since this was a major issue for Germany during the war) besides, the game usually gives you more than enough equipment to achieve your goals, most of the time. Which more than counters this short coming.\n\nIn a nutshell this easily makes my top 30 games ever and possibly 20, which says something since I have over 260 games on steam and over 50 PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 games\n10/10 everything has been executed to perfection, constantly engaging, I didn’t get bored and finished it in one sitting, the one change that I had issue with I had was tiny, and actually served to make the game better in the long run.\n\n\nPerfect\n\n\nDoes it work on windows 7 and 8?\n\nWindows 8? I have no clue sorry! However on windows 7 it runs perfectly, there doesn’t even seem to be a trace of a bad port, but what I found even better was it ran full screen on my massive 1080p HD screen without those annoying black bars, like so many other old games and concerning it ran like that on windows 7 it’s a fair gamble to say you’d be fine if you were dumb enough to get a windows 8 (windows 8 is ♥♥♥♥.  ♥♥♥♥♥’ DEAL WITH IT!) ;)\n\nI found this little bundle of joy a real pleasure to play this is so easy to recommend, I would still recommend this even if it was £10 as it is its £3 and I’ve only played the Germans so far. I’ve had some fun memories of storming Stalingrad as the Germans, now it’s time to hold it as the Russians; I’m so happy to say I’m not going to be disappointed!\n\n10/10 everything was perfect.","March 27, 2015","true","25.4"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","49","69","7","0"

In BK 2, mortars and artillery can barely fire longer than a few 100 feet.\n\n- infantry can ride on tanks!! I love this aspect of the game because its such as small feature but makes the game feel so immersive\n\n- a large variety of tanks and armored vehicles.\nThere are like 10 different versions of the German Pz. III, ranging from commander versions with special radio equipment on the sides and a tank commander actually visable on top. Some tanks will have ammunition boxes on the back and sides while others have Nazi flags! The detail in this game is just great.\n\n- infantry are actually useful and aren't just slaughtered. They can survive a few hits and can fire at targets from a reasonable range.\n\n- Each mission is highly detailed with plenty of scripted events like suprise counter attacks and enemy air strikes. BK 2 and Cuban Missile Crisis: The Aftermath suffer from the same missions played over and over again.\n\nBesides being sorta old, the game has no real drawbacks from what ive played so far. Both the Russian and German campaigns are highly detailed and give intense missions. Best $5 ive ever spent on steam!!","March 19","true","9.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

Sort of a cross between COH/Faces of War and Theatre of War/Combat Mission. It's heavy on historical fact and covers the Stalingrad campaign from the summer of 1942 and the drive on the city by Army Group South, right through to the battle for the city itself. You can fight campaigns for both sides too.\nThere is no skirmish mode and ovbiously the graphics aren't state of ther art any more. Having said that it's graphically rewarding compared to some of the more serious games where you only move units on a bland map.\nJust about every vehicle from both sides is represented along with all types of infantry squads. You move from battle to battle in a type of operations mode, each battle faithfully reproduced and historically correct. Expect to fight for fortified villages and river crossings early on, and later fighting in the ruins of Stalingrad of course.\nYou even get to use resupply halftracks and trucks, to re-arm and re-provision your tanks. A first for me. If one of your tanks is immobilised then it just has to sit there until you can repair it, often under fire.\nHighly recomended, especially for wargamers who prefer historical type games.","October 29, 2015","true","2.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

I tried to read the manual and it is in other then English but did Goggle some of it and ,was surprised at the historical accuracy that went into this game .\nFirst I paid 5. bucks US for this so @ 14 hours I got my moneys worth in play time the reading of deatils was English was very good . the maps surperb as well.  Since I did not know what I was doing with know manual to speak of I played the first few battles of the campiagn on easy .  they were evry easy to beat if you have played any military type games before . stratagy wise . Next I went to normal play and this was a bit more  differcult . I really enjoyed the setting a lot better . as the Russians took the field wanting to kick some German butt  on this setting ....\nthe graphics are good for the game . I am playing this on a older laptop so there was a bit of mouse drag but on a faster machine this would not happen .\nDurring one mission I thought there was a bug and it froze up not ending the mission but I did not see a unit I needed to take care of . Durring this time I wanted to see if my Stuka would blow up a bridge I was using to cross the river . Big boom and it was gone . I took out the unit a few minutes later the mission was over /.. Nothing was said about me blowing up my own bridge ..\nHowerver a few missions later that bridge appeared and was blown up  I needed it to escape a Russian counter attack / cross it and hold the other side ...  I had to go back replay the mission i blew up the bridge on and not blow it up this time ...\nWhat I am getting at for 5 bucks this game has the same AI feeling of some of those new 80 dollar RPG games that what you do early reflects later on . was this a pleasent surprise ....\nFor the money you cannot go wrong if you want a game that you can play a hour or so save it come back later the next day or when in the mood .\nI am going to be looking at more from these guys in the future for sure ..\nBuy it I would pay up to 10.00 if your into these games heavey if your not sure about the game style pay 5.00 on sale and you still will be real happy . if not so what it is less then the price of a 6 pack of beer . and lot healtier\nCrazy Bear Flutes","August 19, 2015","true","78.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","12","14","5","0"
