"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smaxx/recommended/263960/","smaxx","Smaxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smaxx/","942 products in account","Wyv and Keep is a great puzzle platformer with a few twists. It's important to note that this might look a bit like games such as Spelunky. While the theme is similar, the gameplay isn't. Basically you control the two treasure hunters - either alone or in coop with a friend. You'll have to avoid enemies and traps rather than fighting or destroying them.\n\nThe goal sounds simple: Reach the exit door. However, it's typically not that easy. You'll have to avoid pits, traps, and enemies, while also triggering buttons, moving boxes, etc. Some things can only be solved involving team work. For example, one character might have to fill a gap in the ground, while the other pushes a box over. On another map a wall might be too high, so you'll have to move a box, jump on it, and then use your friend as a stepping stone.\n\nI've been playing this game since its initial Desura release and it can be lots and lots of fun. The game's pixel art is well made and tries to emulate late 16 bit era games (i.e. Super Nintendo and other 2D consoles). Some parts of the game are higher resolution though. If you're not a fan of pixelated game and prefer HD graphics, better skip this game.\n\nThe game offers replayability through challenges: Beat a level as fast as possible, beat it with as few retries as possible, and try to collect as much money as you can. Also, the old Desura release had its own level editor. Accordin to the devs (see comments under this review) the editor will return once Steamworks integration is working/complete.","August 9, 2014","true","0.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","2"

It follows two treasure hunters, Wyv and Keep, on their adventures to and through an ancient temple. It’s a puzzle platforming game which features block-pushing and button-pressing mechanics across 60 levels. The goal of each level is simple: open the door and have one character reach it to beat the level. It becomes more difficult than it sounds. After a level has been cleared, players are scored on treasure collected, number of retries/deaths, and completion time.\n\nThe game plays the same in single-player or two-person co-op, which basically means drop-in/drop-out support to the max. The default set-up is local with one keyboard controlling both Wyv and Keep. Player 1 uses WASD, Player 2 uses the keyboard arrow keys. While I’m usually not a fan of two players using one keyboard to play a game locally, WaK is one of the very few games I found it actually worked with. The 360 controller is also supported for play, but I didn’t experiment with that. Also, online play is also supposed to be supported, but at the time of play it was down while the devs ironed out some kinks.\n\nThe graphics for WaK are delightfully retro, featuring a pixelated art style that is astonishingly detailed. While playing the game, I was very impressed with how much detail the artists had managed to imbue into the surroundings and especially Wyv and Keep. Wyv and Keep have multiple facial expressions throughout the game (whether in scripted events or idle animations) that never fail to successfully convey the correct emotion.\n\nWaK definitely succeeds in a number of ways. The level design is absolutely spot on with puzzles that get progressively more challenging throughout the game. Order of events, block placement, and timing are eventually all blended in together to make some very challenging, but ultimately satisfying, puzzles. New mechanics are added in at just the right times so the puzzles never feel stale. The idle banter between Wyv and Keep is also pretty amusing. Also, an “Easy Mode” is supported for players who want more of a puzzle-lite experience. Though I didn’t mess around with it too much, the puzzles are supposed to be the same with some elements removed (e.g. less buttons or blocks) to make them a bit easier to solve.\n\nComplaints I had about the game were fairly minor. Sometimes the simple control scheme (up, down, left, right) felt a little hindersome when it came to making some tricky jumps, or getting some very precise timing down. I also wasn’t a huge fan of the scoring system and eventually began to pretty much ignore it. Most of the puzzles took me and my partner multiple attempts to complete (as I feel was completely intended), so I felt that the score for retries/deaths was a little silly. Players can always go back to the same puzzle later and attempt a better score, but in my opinion most of the satisfaction is taken out of the puzzle once I know how to complete it, so I probably wouldn’t go back to do it again purely for the reason of a higher retry score.\n\nLast, though the game is completely available to play in single-player, as I mentioned, I don’t think I would ever play it that way. Later in the game, some intense synchronization is required between the two characters, and I’m doubtful I could pull it off reliably on my own. It’s definitely best as a co-op game where the two players can talk to each other about their plan of action. I honestly think it’s probably best as a local co-op game where players can point at the screen to more quickly demonstrate their ideas.\n\nWaK is the solid game with adorable sprites and intense puzzles. It has some minor flaws, but these are easy to overlook with its stellar level design. Any puzzle platformer fan will likely not be disappointed.","December 22, 2015","true","6.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

It is a basic notion, pioneered long before Wyv and Keep's existence and an idea that will persist long after. It's only fitting that, in a puzzle game as efficiently simple as Wyv and Keep presents it's challenge often in obfuscation usually reserved for more complicated physics puzzles. In addition from the charm of its beautiful spritework, the witty back and forth of the game's playable duo and the awesome sound track, the game accomplishes great challenge that is easy to pick up and enjoy thanks to effective use of its puzzle design that -while a  perfectly awesome single player experience- can be enjoyed by two players on the same computer as well as online. Definitely a game worth its salt.","February 9, 2015","true","9.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

If you retry a level more than a few times, you're rewarded with a steaming pile of poo as your rating. Expect to die many times due to bad jumping mechanics, especially when standing in mud/quicksand. You can't jump in this muck, which unfortunately seems to transfer to the patch of ground next to it, causing extra suffering.\n\nYou can push blocks but not pull them. You can pick up select items but not jump while carrying them. Too much trial and error for a game that deducts points for the time it takes to solve and number of attempts is just bad. I was expecting Adventures of Lolo gameplay, where restarts were expected but you weren't punished. This game unfortunately falls short, which is a shame as the sounds and animations are pretty decent.","August 31, 2015","false","1.4"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","20","34","2","0"

Each puzzle takes place on a single screen and has a kind of Sokoban-style gameplay. If you play in single player mode, you switch between each characters. If you play with a friend either player controls a character. The price might be a little high at the current $15 for the depth of the game play, but there is a lot of content here if you enjoy the puzzles.\n\nI played with a friend, so my experience with this game is from that point of view. I have not tried single player. The game consists of moving around crates to reach new areas, activate buttons, block traps, and eventually open up the exit which both characters must reach. New obstacles are added in each set of levels, such as arrow traps, spikes, enemies, and lava. In addition, there are new objects to play with such as dynamite and crates hanging from ropes that must be cut down. Without giving away any spoilers, if you make it to the end of the game you are in for the quite the surprise, or at least it was for my friend and me.\n\nThe platforming part of this puzzler comes in a lot in the later stages. Once you have figured out where the crates need to be moved around in a particular level, there is still a lot of timing and precise jumping involved.\n\nAll in all, I think anyone who is a fan of this genre will enjoy this game, even more so if you have a friend to play it with.","November 22, 2014","true","11.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/263960/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1465 products in account","IntroductionToday I will be talking about a Indie game that you might of heard off called Wyv and Keep: The Temple of the Lost Idol, avaiable on Windows, Linux and Mac. Developed and published by A Jolly Corpse on the 8th August 2014, this game is filled with many puzzles for you to solve with the two characters that you play as throughout the game. With 60 levels of pure puzzle and platforming, this is a enjoyable game whether you play it solo or with a friend.\n\nGameplayThe game starts you off with these two characters called Wyv and Keep, who are treasure hunters, on their adventures to go through an ancient temple. The objective of each of the levels is to try to get to the door in the least amount of deaths/restarts and in the lowest amount of time. The games most useful mechanic is to be able to stand on your partners head to be able to reach your goal. This is the main mechanic that you will have to use throughout the game as you play through each of the levels. It focuses primarly on the trial and error way of playing some of the puzzle levels without having to think through before taking action. This may be a downfall to the game because of the amount of retrying you may have to do the level. Another thing thjat slightly infurated me was the 1 tile gap to be able to jump to the next platform. Sometimes you are under time constrain because some of the enemies throw projectiles at you. So when you are trying to jump a one tile gap and you can’t because your not in perfect position to jump it you don’t actually jump it and therefore get hit by the enemies projectile. The game doesn’t really gain in difficulty until the third world, making you have to think and plan ahead with each move that you make throughout. From then on the game tempts you to sometimes make shady and difficult jumps in order to gain more coins and treasure that you will find along the way of each of the puzzles. On some levels there are secret passages that lead to more treasure that looks unobtainable until you find that area that you can pass through. Later on in the game you will be able to purchase hats with the money and treasure that you have obtained throughout the game. As far as I know, that is the only way you can spend the treasure that you collect over the course of the game.\n\nYou will be rated upon each level on the amount of deaths/restarts and how long it takes you to complete each level. For me, I didn’t really care much about this rating system that went along with the game. I felt like some of these puzzles you really had to be able to complete it first and then come back to it to get a better scrore. This means that the game has a rather nice replay ability, for you to try to complete the puzzle in less deaths, and possibly in a better time than before as well.\n\nYou can either play as both of them, switching between the two characters or playing with someone else with Local Co-op. The game seems to have a online feature, but it seems that the servers are kinda dead so playing solo, with a friend on Steam or local co-op would be recommened. Although I found that playing local co-op sometimes would destory your friendship with your friend as the simplist mistake could lead to having to restart the puzzle again.\n\nNow lets talk about the audio of the game, the game has a rather atmospheric music throughout of the worlds that you go to. With the soundtrack continously looping in the background, it really sets the mood for the game and the sort of area that you are currently in. There isn’t any voice acting when there is a cut scene or when you read a note, which there doesn’t need to be on every game. That being said, some of the best games haven’t had voice acting in them and have been rather successful on Steam. I think that because the game does well to create a nice atmosphere with the music and sounds that the voice acting wouldn’t be needed throughout this game.\n\nThe graphics of the game are rather retro and simplistic that really suits the way the game plays out throughout. The sprites are rather simplistic and well designed, with the simple few frames on animation as you walk and jump throughout the game. The graphics have a sort of charm to it, each of the objects and characters are rather indetifiable. They did the resolutions of the graphics rather nice, it’s not too high resolution but it’s not too low either. It’s a really nice balance between the resolution of the graphivs throughout the game. Although the resolution for the game is nice, there is no option the change the window size or to be able to put the game in full screen. It seems to be locked into a window which might annoy some people.\n\nPros+ Fun local co-op or single player\n+ Challenging and fun\n+ High res graphics\n+ Music sets a nice atmosphere\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons- Fixed resolution sized window\n- Online multiplayer is dead\n- Sometimes the game is too difficult\n- No Steam achievements\n\nResults/Final ThoughtsAll in all, this game is a very enjoyable yet difficult type of puzzle platformer game. The game supports solo, local co-op or online multiplayer which kinda seems to be dead at the moment. The graphics of this game are retro styled and rather simplistic which makes this game rather nice to play and enjoy. The graphics are also in a high resolution that makes the game look crisp and clean throughout. The music is atmospheric, and there is a nice amount of replay ability throughout the game. Although you may find the game stressful and too difficult at times, completing a level is rather satifying after a lot of trail and error. I have to say that the price of this game is rather expensive for the content and difficulty throughout. Despite the few negative things about this game here and there, I still recommened this game to those of you who like puzzle platforming games\n\nRating 7.3/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Deduction's Review Club's curator group here.","April 19","true","10.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
