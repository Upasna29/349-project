There were some OK puzzles but for the most part this is simply a hidden object game with a Robinson Crusoe theme LOOSELY slapped on. I couldn't help but chuckle every time I would see a scene that would say something to the effect of "They have Friday trapped! Quick, find 12 feathers"...  The images were interesting for the most part, but sometimes items are difficult to make out simply due to the clarity and lack of detail in the picture.\n\nThey have a casual and survival mode. They are the same with the only exception that you are timed on the survival mode. And if you run out of time you have to start the whole chapter over - which is 0 fun because nothing changes the next time through.\n\nI could see this being fun on casual mode playing with your son/daughter. But other than that, I would pass.","January 15, 2015","false","3.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

Indeed, you don't have any story in it apart being Robinson Crusoe during his 20 years of stay on a lost island. You'll begin on the ship after the accident, then explore the island, then build your house, etc..\n\nThe game is a pure hidden objects game: nearly each location begin by finding X times the same item, then you get a list of objects. Some are hard to find, mainly because of a little problem with graphics and because it was like that back then: items were often hidden behind another or being the same color as the background, etc.. Some locations are puzzles: differences, play the right tune, jigsaws, etc.. You even have a guessing game, which is not easy if you're not skilled in English. However, the game isn't punishing you for that, you can give up and you'll go to the next word.\n\nAs I've said, I've a problem with the graphics. Indeed, for recent monitors, the game isn't adapting to it. The game was reduced at 1/3 of it and the result was that I was under the impression that it got badly reduced. It can also have played in my impression of not seeing the objects. Apart that, they were pretty acceptable, even if you can say that they're outdated. You have some bright landscapes before getting in a much somber atmosphere with the cannibals part.\n\nThe soundtrack was also acceptable, though I didn't have really time to listen to it as I had to play it with the music low for not disturbing my mother, that was watching TV (I could have taken my headphones but I was too lazy to get them).\n\nIf you're in for some good old hidden objects games, Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is a nice game, though I would prefer largerly Mystery P.I., Escape the Museum, Mystery Case Files or Hidden Expedition. If you prefer to look for a casual game, you'll better check Artifex Mundi's or Alawar's.","April 3","true","2.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The bulk of the game takes place within hidden object puzzles. This game is a little older and it shows on some of the scenes. Objects can be pretty difficult to see unless you have a ginormous monitor.\n\nThis game has approximately 30-31 different puzzles which average around 2.5-3.5 hours of game play. There is also a survival mode for those who dare to step up the difficulty. The $10 price is outragous for the age, length and overall story quality.\n\nWorth $2-3; If you really want this grab heavily discounted!","March 29","true","3.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

And while it is commendable to show where they started at in 2009 with this genre, the decision to sell it on Steam is questionable at best.\n\nI’m saying this because Adventures of Robinson Crusoe is not a good HOG. Not because the developers were bad but because it is ancient by this genre’s standards: made in mid-2009, when games had nothing but hidden object scenes in their low-resolution, space-saving pixelated glory. Nowadays it just cannot cut it unless you are an old and nostalgic HOG player.\nAnd even then, this game is nothing spectacular. Sure, it has some plot (very loosely based on the title material), the scenery looks nice, the hidden object scenes are fun enough for their age, and there is variation in them… but that is not enough to warrant a purchase.","May 8","false","4.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game is not a mix of hidden object puzzles and 'adventure game'-type puzzels (if you know what I mean), like you see in a lot of modern hidden object games. And you can just skip all the story, if you want to.\n\nI recommend this game, but before you buy it you need to know: this game runs at a resolution of 800x600, which can make finding some of the objects difficult on a modern high-res screen.\n\nIn short:\nPros:\n+ Most puzzles are hidden object puzzels\n\nCons\n- Low-res graphics can make finding objects difficult on a high-res screen","June 2","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good fun for a couple hours. Puzzles aren't too challenging, HO scenes are doable, though you'll probably need an occasional hint. Can't recommend it at $9.99 though. I got it in a bundle, which is how I'd recommend getting it. Worth it if a sale comes around for under a buck and you're a fan of the genre.","March 26","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, find a cat, but all you can see is the tip of it's tail. The game wouldn't run properly, and had to be played in windowed mode, which was small and made things even more difficult, or was black screen if I tried running full screen, even after applying the fixes mentioned in the forums.\n\nOn the good side, the music and sound effects were fitting. The graphics reminded me of a remastered Monkey Island, and the game even had one easter egg towards the aforementioned game. The puzzles within the HO scenes were really well done and required a lot of thought, something more modern HO games could borrow from.\n\nOverall, if you like HO games, and fancy a challenge rather than a story line, you could do worse. I don't think I've ever needed to use the hint option in a HO game as much before!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/recommended/334470/","kaotia","Kaotia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/","310 products in account","Old style hidden object game about Robinson Crusoe's adventures. The hard difficulty has a 60 minutes timer to complete each of the 6 chapters, you can skip puzzles paying a penalty of 15 minutes and miss-clickings cost 1 minute each, so 60 minutes for a chapter sometimes is barely enough and this makes the game very challenging. Graphics aren't very good and this makes spotting objects frustrating, there are lots of HO scenes but only a few puzzles (mostly memory games). It's certainly not a game for everyone, but if you don't mind low graphics and old style adventures you may like it.","April 8","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
