"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/23380/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","290 products in account","Gyromancer is a match 3 puzzle R.P.G. developed by PopCap Games Inc. and published by SquareEnix. Players assume the role of Rivel, a summoner who is sent by the king into the enchanted Aldemona Woods in search of a group of zealots known as Temperance after their leader murders a well known member of the empire. This being a match 3 game, one can safely assume that the battles all take place in puzzle format. I've read that this games battle system is heavily based on Bejeweled Twist which is another popular PopCap title however I've not yet played that game myself so I can't testify to the validity of that statement? When you battle, Rivel summons one of three beasts in his stead against his opponent. The goal is to match three or more gems on the battlefield and build power in order to unleash your chosen beasts abilities to try and defeat the opposition. Throughout the game you will have the opportunity to command over fifty different beasts or monsters a la Pokemon...I'm assuming as I've never played Pokemon and am only guessing that the two are similiar in this fashion? Pikachu...here boy!!!\n\nWhile the story in my opinion is a little lacking the gameplay is definitely the gem, pun totally intended, of this great title. The puzzle battles are extremely fun and like all great puzzle R.P.G.'s require some strategy to win. Do you pass up an easy match 3 on this side of the battlefield in order to block your opponents potential match 3 on another part of the field? These are just some of the many dilemmas that you will have to face. You'll have plenty of chances to battle as this title spans twelve unique stages but beware because this game could quickly become as addictive to you as it did with me.\n\nGraphically this game is beautiful...it's a Square Enix game so that's a given. The gorgeous hand drawn art of the various characters and monsters is both pleasant to the eyes and makes you want to see all the beasts. The battlefield and gems are bright, colorful and well animated. The music is catchy and fits the title well although it's not nearly as great as the musical scores in the Puzzle Quest games. The sound effects in this game, however, are spectacular. You definitely hear it everytime you connect a match 3, build power, make combos and launch attacks, etc..\n\nI'm thoroughly enjoying this game but I have to mention one big problem with it. I've played many a puzzle R.P.G. over the past year or so and this seems to be a consistent problem with almost all of them. With the exception of Puzzle Quest 1 and 2, most of these games do a completely horrendous job of explaining what you need to do and what various things in the game mean. The tutorials, if you can call them that, are severly lacking and there are very few instruction manuals to read. I looked and looked on the internet and could not find an instruction manual FOR THIS GAME!!! Thankfully I was able to find some fan created walkthroughs and F.A.Q. links to help me. Everything else I learned through trial and error by just playing the game and figuring things out on my own. Fear not because there is light at the end of the tunnel because once you know what you're doing the frustration quickly goes away and you are able to finally enjoy the game. With that said, I still love this title and will be playing it for years to come and highly recommend it to any match 3 or puzzle R.P.G. gamer. Gotta catch 'em all...please don't sue me Nintendo.","September 6, 2015","true","28.2"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","43","45","3","4"

Maybe i thought it would have more things later in the game. But the game is more of the same stuff and it gets too repetitive and boring fast. Also the vague story telling doesn't help to improve impressions. Dialogs are often weird, story twists are silly and confusing. Hero controls on the global map are annoying. Connecting 3 items (or more) in a row by rotating a square of 4 items clockwise is a bit of too much. One has to have a very good spacial imagination to quickly see combinations. Enemies don't have to do that, so this is a bit unfare. They use your combinations for resources for their attacks. Also you don't  just have to make your attacks, but proactively remove enemies attacks from the board. It quickly becomes very frustrating as game starts to introduce more blocks (locking certain items, making enemies' attacks to trigger faster, punishing for idle rotating of items, etc.). And the attacks your monsters have don't matter much. Yes, some trigger faster and do less damage, but you still just connect lines of items all the time without keeping much attention to them and the attacks trigger automatically. Puzzle Quest is way better in this regard, where you have to select what attacks to equip, when to trigger them and it actually matters what colors you connect. This game also has steep difficulty curve. You run easily through one stage and then stumble on another because monsters are much harder. Some challenges are based on simple luck (you have to make a cascade of 7 subsequent combinations, and you can't really prepare the board for that, because the board is too small and you have to rotate 4 items at a time, so you just sit their and mindlessly rotate them hoping to get that challenge..).\n\nThere are better and more interesting games in that genre (both mechanically and story wise). Gyromancer is a bland and boring clone, which can't offer much strategy. You have to repeat samish battles over and over again, slowly grinding levels to beat stronger monsters. And the story told is boring and not rewarding.","December 27, 2014","false","29.8"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","0"

Its very challenging but you have to go through the tutorial to really understand it , because if you write off this Bejeweled Themed game as a puzzle game with a visual skin slapped on it, you will not win at this game.\n\nThere have been people who have not been able to run this game.

I've posted a workaround in the forum for this that should work for everyone but it will result in a 640x480 resolution.\n\n","August 10, 2014","true","0.8"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","2"

Sure, it's cribbing on the whole Puzzle Quest phenomenon but the game was fun at least. Then a few missions into the game, they added a new rule where you can't switch jewels without causing a match without getting penalized. That, combined with an enemy ability that locks certain jewels into place makes this game too hard and too unrewarding. If you really want to play Gytomancer, just get one of the Puzzle Quest games instead.","December 27, 2013","false","2.9"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

Up to this point, the only types of those games that I did like were the actual Puzzle Quest series. Puzzle Kingdoms, Dungeon Hearts, and Legend of Fae were almost good, but not good enough in comparison to the quality of the PQ series. I loved Runespell: Overture, but that involves cards instead of gems. I've been looking forward to Gyromancer for a while and had it held up in my backlog for even longer. I definitely enjoyed it at first, though the latter half of the game may turn off some people. And like PQ, it does feel good to earn you wins through a bit a strategy, but I found alot of "close calls" came out in my favor purely due to the luck of the way gems dropped on the board.\n\nInstead of swapping adjacent gems horizontally or vertically, you swap them with a rotation tool of sorts. While unique, it does feel rather annoying when you have an easy match, but can match gems because they are in a odd corner, to the left of your cursor, or stuck near locked gems that can't be moved. This is part of the game design of course, but in the later levels especially, you often feel like you may not have what you need to match gems to prevent damage to you or attack the enemy. Only the player gets to make the gem swaps, but over time and also depending on which gems you swap, the enemy's ability meter will increase until they activate and morph a gem into a timed attack gem on the board or cause a status effect to one or both monsters. You then have a limited amount of turns to use that morphed gem in a match and remove it before it causes damage to your monster. This generally requires strategy and a bit of luck. My other complaint is that the game does appear to want you to potentially replay completed levels, as some paths of a stage are not cleared until after you beat it, which also mean you can't complete all the stage challenges in one run.\n\nOne annoyance in gameplay I have is that you don't get enough items. In the start of the game, you get a few, but I never felt like I needed them. Once I got into the 3rd part of the world map, rounds were harder and there were so many situations where I could have used a Magic Mirror to rotate gems counter-clockwise or a Magick Key to unlock a locked gem, but couldn't because I only had one left that I wanted to save or had none at all. Items are found in chests and not in any store, but it almost feel like luck to get them because chests are found on certain parts of the level trail and you can't see the entire trail to know where to go.  You have to assume where your route will take you.\n\nAnother irritant is that it seems like you will probably need to grind to play the later half of the game succesfully. When my monsters were around level 20+, I started seeing monsters at level 50 plus. Thankfully, some older levels will have paths you couldn't get to before, but can now, but it also feels like a pretty articial way of extending the game more than it needed to be.\n\nGyromancer seems pretty good from the few hours I played. It doesn't keep my interest long enough which each sitting for me to have long play sessions like I did with PQ. The need to grind and backtrack put me off a bit - I don't mind it in certain games, but I don't really care for it here. That could be part of the reason it isn't well known, since this can get fairly difficult for casuals. This is probably the next best thing to the Puzzle Quest series from what I played, outside of Runespell: Overture.","September 7, 2014","true","8.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

There's no equipment, no choices when levelling, you only get one unit in a fight,  you can only have 3 units in your "roster" at a time and have to take into a map and have to pay in-game currency each time you want to replace one, the overland movement in a map is sloooow, as is the actual combat.  Some parts of a map don't open up until you defeat the boss - and then you're dumped straight to level selection so you have to start the map over from the beginning if you want to explore it further.  And the enemies in a fight don't even make moves the way you do - instead they automatically gain action points (or whateve their called) and then place countdown tiles similar to the way goons do it in Marvel Puzzle Quest.\n\nAnd I had to use a third party utility to limit the framerate to 60, becuase the game insisted on putting my GPU at 96% load for 800-1500fps, and the ATI drivers were as useless at forcing vsync as they always are.\n\nReally, the only reason you might want to play this game is the "rotation" mechanic for gem matching which I haven't seen in any other Puzzle Quest style game.

I quietly suffered through cringeworthy writing and an interface that is so bad I was amazed that any one at Square Enix allowed it to be published. I made it through an obnoxious boss battle where the guy keeps running away but the screen dramatically announces my "DEFEAT", then I chase him around on the silly map until he finally stops and I can go through it over (... and over and over) again.\n\nThese weren't the reasons I decided to put the game away for good. What really got to me were the things added to provide a "challenge". I need a good challenge but there comes a point when it's not fun anymore. I'm very familiar with match 3 games and lots of them add things like locking or freezing pieces on the board or making pieces require timely removal before something bad happens. This game uses all of those but in ways that are excessive. There were too many times when a dangerous piece appeared but had a very short timer and I had no matches on the board and frequently no matching colors anywhere near the piece. So I'd have to make what the game calls "Idle Twists" to move the pieces where I needed them. The game makes sure you know every time you've done this by filling the screen with the words "IDLE TWIST" in an overly dramatic way and punishing you. It feels excessive because it's making an awfully big deal about a necessary part of the strategy.\n\nThen to top it off, when you produce a special attack piece it gets locked in place. I don't know why. It seems unnecessarily cruel. But it's fine, right? I mean, in most match 3 games that's not such a big deal but in this "twisting" style of game it creates big limitations and to top it off you need those pieces fairly quickly to advance but you also immediately need to get rid of the "bad" pieces but none of the matching colors you need are on the board or if they are you still need to slowly nudge them over while getting punished with every careful and tedious click. On some boards I played I had absolutely no chance of winning because of the game's design and algorithms. That wouldn't have been so annoying if a loss didn't mean such a heavy penalty as it does in this game because of the "rpg" elements. I just wanted to play a cool twisty match 3 with a fantasy story and pokemon-like pet collecting and nice pictures. That's not what this is.

The Bejewled Twist mode is definitely not my favourite one, the first challenge is to understand everything based on the tutorial. The instructions are not necessarily clear, but with a little trying out, you'll get the hang of it. The difficulty grows throughout the game, but not too much. The fights aren't timed so the ability to leave your chair for a moment if necessary without having to pause the game or losing progress is a nice plus.

The music is well done and the artwork is very good although cutscenes do not use any animations and are mostly reliant on text updates.  The Steam Overlay is supported but widescreen modes are not, resulting in a letterboxed image and squished aspect ratios on the intro splash videos.  While these minor issues are irritating, they are not enough to prevent me from recommending this title to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, particularly fans of Pokemon or Magic the Gathering will find the tactical system adds an extra layer of interest to an otherwise fairly standard puzzle game system.

The monsters slowly increase in difficulty but you never feel like a battle is impossible. Unlike other puzzle games that restrict the board layout or prevent invalid moves, this does neither. If you perform valid moves  in a row your multiplier goes up. If you get stuck you can do an invalid move to set up for more plays. The only penalty is a reduction in the multiplier.\n\nThere is a lot of variety to your roster and the effects are nice as well.\n\nThe only downsides are that the audio is choppy and there is no native controller support. I was able to create a controller mapping in Pinnacle Game Profiler in about 10 minutes that matched how it played on the xbox.","February 8, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oh yeah, I figured this game would be awesome!  Boy was I wrong.\n\nThe graphics are OK.  I don't expect puzzle games to be winning awards for revolutionary graphics.  What I saw was acceptable and fit with the game just fine.  If I wanted a theatrical production with my game I'd be playing Final Fantasy 23 or whatever it is up to now.\n\nThe plot I didn't pay much attention to as I skipped later cut scenes after the first one.  I don't see how anyone can come up with an engrossing plot for a matching game.   What of it I did pay attention to was adequate.  You are the Good Guy on a Quest to stop the Bad Guy who has done Bad Things.  You meet someone I assume will be your Companion and a possible Love Interest.  You choose three monsters from a pool at your disposal to battle mobs on various maps.  Now go match stuff and beat the Bad Guy. There is your plot.  Ta-daa.\n\nI did not find the tutorial very helpful.  It seems that it was trying to explain too much while you are playing the tutorial, making you pause between each move so you don't really get a feel for the flow of the game or a concept of the rules.  I went through the thing twice and left it thinking it was a turn-based game when, in fact, you are the only one making moves.  If you match colors that correspond with your opponent, you give them the 'energy.'  I prefer written tutorials followed by a short video support.  This one was like watching a movie while someone was talking and hitting the pause button.  Annoying, to say the least.\n\nMusic in games is not generally a factor for me.  I tend to decrease the sound (I use a headset) so I can hear what is going on around me.  Sometimes I leave it on higher than normal for me if it is really good, but in this case, I found the background music absolutely awful.  I could not mute the music on this game fast enough.  I removed my headset so I did not have to suffer it further while I desparetely searched for the Options menu to silence what sounded like a large bag of cats.\n\nI also greatly dislike the one-way twist mechanic about this game.  I would prefer that it at least allowed you to rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise.  When I play standard Match 3 games, I can move the objects to be matched in more than one direction, so why not here?  For me, the twisting is already bad enough but I am restricted to just one direction?  Ugh.\n\nShame on me for not doing more research on Gyromancer before I purchased it, but at least it was on sale so I am not out the full price for something I will be uninstalling from my machine and trying to repress in my personal memory.\n","December 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As far as tablet games go, the quality is quite high.  But it's a tablet game! What is it doing on Steam!!  No support for advanced graphics, no option to even change the game resolution.\n\nIf you're a man and don't want to be caught playing Bejewelled, but can't resist the pretty gems and shiny colours, then there's enough veneer of mythology glued on around this one that you could argue to your imaginary girlfriend convincingly that you're still a man.\n\nOtherwise, it's Bejewelled, and it doesn't have PC game qualities.","February 2","false","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

I got it in a humble bundle and wasn't expecting much, but it seemed like it would be a fun little time waster. I like match 3 games well enough for a little mindless, positive feedback fun. And I like rpgs/story games. So I hoped it would be more amusing than the standard bejeweled-type game. But either I rushed through the tutorial, or it just did not explain well enough. I can't seem to figure out the specifics. I make matches, trying to maximize the gem matches for my creature's affinity - sometimes I win quickly, other times I'm overwhelmed quickly. And I haven't figured out why yet. I know a little more of the mechanics than I'm typing here - their are gem color affinities, and good/bad enemy match ups, etc. - but the flow of "battle" still seems mostly out of my control.\n\n\nI'll try playing a little more, with a more serious mindset, to see if it suddenly clicks. But it really doesn't seem like the type of game you _want_ to give that much thought to - I doubt the end payoff is worth the effort. Sad to say I can't recommend it.

I was fortunate enough to not have the game crash on me or wipe my save - but at this point it doesn't really matter as I have no incentive to continue playing.\n\nAnother element that I did not like about this game was that the AI never took a turn, so you are endlessly rotating tiles. AI just casts a spell after *you* take enough turns that don't involve matching the AI's color. Very boring and lazy on the part of the devs.\n\nVery disappointed in this collaboration. Got this on the steam sale so I didn't spend much, but I also didn't get much out of it either.","February 6","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Additionally the UI seems like it was thrown together in an afternoon.\n\nNot worth the time.","February 20","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely a good way to kill some time. I do like the way it's combined RPG elements with a puzzle game. At its core, this is simply a bejeweled clone, however I will say that the battle mechanics definitely add something to the experience. The game is a tad on the easy side, it does get harder after on like the 4th level though. I would only recommend getting this game if you don't already own a similar puzzle game, but there are plenty of more relaxing puzzle games.","May 19","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
