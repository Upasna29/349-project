Quite nice, but way too repetitive. Goes great with my own electronic music library though :)\n0 Can't tell about keyboard support, only played it with controller. But guess keyboard might suck as when comparing analog stick to controller DPad.\n0 Single player challenge maps somewhat nice with different obsacles and later ones pretty hard. But at least for me still not that entertaining. You might feel differnt, though.\n\n- AI. It's fine for classic mode with basic maps and for a basic training. But they don't really work with some of the game modes and maps containing lava and such.\n\n\nDon't buy if:* You neither have friends to play this with locally (only!)...\n* ... nor like repeating levels to beat your highscores and collecting medals/achievements-\n* You do not like Narwahls.","September 16, 2015","true","3.8"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","35","37","10","0"

It should be yours too.\n\nNarwhals (Monodon monoceros) are an aquatic mammal that live in the icy Arctic Ocean. In Old Norse nár means "corpse" for the animal's mottled grey skin colour resembled drowned sailors. It's scientific name is derived from Greek, meaning "one-tooth one-horn." It is this horn that is the defining characteristic of this majestic beast. Growing up to three metres in length the narwhal tusk is actually a tooth that pierces through the lip and protrudes past the upper jaw. The general consensus among scientific community is that this tusk is a secondary sex characteristic to garner attraction from all the lady narwhals (size does matter).\n\nNot alike their earthly narwhal cousins, the galactic starwhal also features such a tusk but this is not a tusk to attract mates, it is a tusk to destroy enemies (size does matter). The goal of game is simple, using your tusk, just the tip, you must impale the heart of your opponents. Only a strike to the heart will yield any damage and the game has a cool bullet-time slow-motion effect every time a heart is within range of being pierced.  It is a  hectic, tense, and often awkward struggle.\n\nAs of right now it is an early access game but it is fully playable with only more content and game-modes to look forward to in the future. Its not really a game you can enjoy by yourself and there is no online multiplayer although that may change heading forward. The game shines with local co-op; best played with four players. I had no issues connecting and using four 360 controllers. It may lack in lasting appeal but if you have a few friends over and are looking for a quick, fun, and competitive gaming experience, look no further, looks to the stars.","February 19, 2014","true","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The twitch of a thumbstick unerringly points the tip of the starwhal horn in a new fabulous direction, but only the horn. New players will need to get used to this. You can't turn the whale, just the tip o fthe horn. Once you understand this conept, the controls are actually fairly simple and precise. The gameplay is like a rainbow that has been crushed into crysaline form and mainlined through your eyeballs, it is fast paced and frantic couch coop in it purinst sense. I often throw this game up on a big projecter and it always draws crowds. People will scream when the horns start getting close to the enemy hearts and the camera zooms in for a slow motion shot.\nThis game is absolutely amazing when ti works. Luckely it works more often than not, but there are still a few issues, such as frequent lag on levels with moving parts, that keep from being the best game ever.","October 1, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Then this game is for you.\n\nThe game is like a mix of Super Smash Bros and  Nidhogg. Play it with friends (in local multiplayer) and enjoy the coordinated mayhem! Controls and physics are great (easy to pick up, but difficult to master). The goal of the game is to attack your opponent's heart whith your Starwhal's horn (only the tip of the horn does damage, hence the "Just The Tip" in the name of the game) while avoiding having your heart attacked. The game does a slo-mo anytime that a player gets his/hers horn close to another player's heart, so every attack or dodge feels epic (and this allows all players to really see what's going on and think about their next moves). You wil learn how to use your Starwhal to stab an opponent, pin him down, fling him away, bait him, etc. And all those actions are not predetermined moves, but rather actions derived from the mobility of your Starwahl and the physics of the game.\n\nThe game keeps getting more content and feels very stable, despite being in Early Access (I have not encountered any bug or glitch). untill now it lacks online multiplayer, so it's a local multiplayer experience only. But it's one of the best local multiplayer games I have ever played (next to Super Smash Bros. Melee, Castle Crashers, Battle Block Theater). If you have a couple of controllers and competitive people next to you, play this and enjoy a great experience. I find that even against the bots the game is awesome, as the AI is very good and seems to have some behavior variation.\n\nI gave it 9/10 as the game is still in Early Access and thus, it lacks some options (like the ability to create custom games, choose songs, maybe a level editor, more content). But so far it feels that this is already a solid game that is in the phase of getting more content.

It's an awesome passive distraction for everybody, and it's simple enough that lots of people feel comfortable picking up a controller to give it a try.\n\nBecause it's still unfinished, expect a few bugs - the game quits recognizing all controller inputs once every hour or so on the OSX version I play, requiring a restart. It isn't quite in good enough shape to be turned off and left unattended, but that shouldn't scare you away from giving it a try.","March 9, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The main characters are in free nature very rare narwhales which are here colored and flow in space for the casual playing and fun.\n\nIt has basically two gamemodes.\n1. Challenge mode is like a skilled timemode to run through labrinths.\n2. Versus mode is a PvP arena upto 4 players, but just local Co-op.\n\nThough you can have some fun for a few hours with the wonky controls and beating your Steam friends as ghost whales in challenge mode. But then the stimula is mostly over. No locked maps to unlock, no other excitement. Just earning medals and die trying over and over again.\n\nIf you are somehow finished with the Challenge mode then comes the really most grinding part: The Versus mode. Naturally you play against yourself if you don't have your friends at home all the time. But you have to do it many many times to get the extraordinary high amount of kills (10k in classic 32k in score) for the achievements. And even if they are similiar to do (stab other whales into their hearts) they don't count for each other. That's quite annoying to have such an artificial playtime extender in there.\n\nMy conclusion: Starwhale could be a casual and fun game. But in reality it demands too much time for grinding some achievements. Also it has just local co-op and is pretty high priced unless you can get it for cheap in a bundle.","November 12, 2015","false","100.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

The game to my knowledge runs incredibly smoothly, and has a nice cartoony graphics style.

Even for people who don't care for games at all, Starwhal seems to be an exception. The simple controls are easy to grasp, and before you know it, you'll be screaming and swearing at your former human allies.\n\nAfter playing the demo for countelss hours with flatmates, the Steam release with multiple levels, game modes and customisation of narwhals  has only added to the experience. Along with the vibrant and poppy graphics and fab soundtrack, even at the moment this game is well worth the asking price.\n\nSo yeah, it's pretty great.

I'm yet to play with more than 3 people, but I look forward to playing full games with 4 users. Controls are a little tough to get used to at first, but the learning curve is the same for most people and knowing that your struggles with your Narwhal are the same as the person next to you eases the curve a bit. I wasn't expecting the games to get as tense and competitive as they did, but it escalated quickly. A fair amount of the game modes I have no interest in outside of the main timed and multi-live combat sessions, but those themselves are worth it if you have a regular group of people to play with. A great party game for friends who want something a little different that isn't altogether unfamiliar territory. If the developers are looking at this, the only suggestion I have is to make this online multiplayer, so I can experience this with friends who I don't live near.\n\nYou can check out a bit of myself and a friend playing this on my channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeX-qZPEqoM","September 17, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's almost the price of Skyrim !","October 4, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
