There are definitely big pros and cons to this game and I hope they decide to fix these areas in their future sequel if there ever will be one.  Which I doubt since Grid series,  their signature line up is doing extremly well.  Which by the way am a BIG BIG fan of.  Unlike other kart racing games there are almost little to no drifting! Which could be good and bad.  Basically focrces you to pay more attention to lines you take in corner entry and exit.  Some may find this annoying and others might appreciate the challenge.\n\nLet's talk about the PROS of this game first\n\n+ Clean eye pleasing graphics\n+ Car damage and pit system\n+ Team play mode\n+ Price if you can grab it at 75% (4.99)\n+ Slip stream!!! (shake and bake)\n\nOk the downside....\n\n- TOO MUCH DLC (seems to be becoming codemasters trend)\n- Online multiplayer is dead.  You'll need to get your buddies to play\n- Weapons were not very creative\n\nOverall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend buying this game to any silly kart racing fans out there then immediately adding ME!!!\n","June 29, 2014","true","7.7"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","40","56","0","4"

But ultimately it is frustrating and somewhat lacking in comparison to other top kart racing titles. It is fun to play as your favourite F1 drivers in cartoon form, with lots of nice power ups, and some truly original and very innovative racing modes which keeps interest levels high. The graphics are quite good, though of course they are meant to be very cartoon-like as opposed to photorealistic. Overall, there's a lot of good to be said about the game. It is certainly a challenge!\n\nBut here's the rub: the game is challenging in the most frustrating of ways. Firstly, there is essentially no difficulty level. The 1,000 vs. 3,000 cc only changes the speed of the cars. Facing the AI is like a baptism of fire. It is relentless, and one can win only with a mix of skill and luck (luck being by far the most important factor). I don't like to win every race, but when I lose I want to be able to remedy that by improving my skills. Not so in F1 Race Stars. You can be racing at your very best and come dead last by virtue of a bit of bad luck; likewise you can race like a drunkard and come first with a contrary amount of good luck. This, unfortunately, is a very nearly game-breaking fault. As a result, what could have been a classic kart racing title will be one to forget in comparison to a Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. But all in all, it isn't a bad game. Fun but frustrating. 7/10.","July 23, 2014","true","15.4"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

Seeing your skill and knowledge of tracks increase and slowly you start to win cups that seemed impossible.  When is it at it worst?  when too much luck is involved. Blue shell anyone?\n\nThis game is all-in on the luck part. Tracks dont require much knowledge outside some basic shortcuts + key/gate locations and certain rare spots where you actually need to use brakes.\n\nWhat decides the positions is actualy what you get for powerups. Torpedo or Teleport once or twice in a game and you are golden.  You better also know how to defensively use power ups also right at the first 1000cc cup so dont expect 1000cc to be the 'training wheels' cup. it is just the least broken one.\n\nCareer mode is a mess.  You will be pressing restart quite many times during multi-track racing cups. Luckily the final order of drivers seem to be much more random than on Mario Kart where your main rival is faster than anyone else.\n\nMultiplayer is dead. DLC structure is a mess. Tracks as DLC i can understand but the rest is some of the most useless crap i have seen in a DLC. And the prices. oh my.\n\nTime trial works. Thank goodness.\n\nF1 license in the game - has any reviews even mentioned it? must have been a good investment. ^_^  No difference to anyone.\n\nDoes it work as a couch game? Yes. If played casually it is wonderfully goofy. The shortcoming start as soon as you try to seriously play the game. I rather study Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed more complex mechanics or just go back to Mario Kart rather than try to seriously play this game. I will be putting some more hours into this but it's clear already i can just forget about a proper career game and just play this casually. That way it's obviously been designed too.\n\n4.5/10","April 4, 2015","false","5.6"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

Due to very frustrating power up and repair mechanics it is often luck and not skill. Boosting is only possible with power ups, boost jumps or specific boost sections in corners (not every corner though). You'll find yourself being frustrated instead of having fun a lot of times.\nIt's a last resort buy for me - I recommend getting "Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed" instead. Alternatively you could just wait for a better game to be released on the PC - or just play the original: Mario Kart is still the way to go in this genre.","June 29, 2014","false","7.9"," 40 of 61 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","40","61","0","0"

Because everybody has to know thats its totally extremly and absolutly... ♥♥♥♥. Dont buy it. Dont let the shiny graphics, license and comparison with mario kart blind you into buying this! Why? Because the game mechanics is bad. The team did really a good job on polishing the game. But the mechanics... for example, if you get hit by an enemy extra, you get a double punishment. Not only for the extra that hit you, but also your car is broken now and you drive more slowly. You have to drive trough a pit stop (normally around 2-3 on the map) where you lose AGAIN time to repair your car. If you add the pit stop you get triple punishment... wtf...\nIt also has no kind of fun mechanics like in sega sonic all star racing or mario kart where you can use your skill to get extra boosts. Instead you have Kers... and Jump Boots... where you just have the possibility on some occasions by simple button releasing and pressing to gain an extra boost. Yay again... Please DONT BUY Save your money!

I was expecting it to be so moronically cutesy that i would find it unbearable, and yet it's actually quite an enjoyable game. Despite clearly being aimed at younger players, the game is actually quite tough, with the AI drivers being quite ruthless in their use of power-ups and short cuts, often resulting in you leading the race into the final corner and yet finishing 9th or 10th out of 12 racers. This can be rather frustrating but if you can deal with that, it's a fun game. I should point out that i only got this game as a result of it being free when pre-ordering F1 2013...

I quit. I can't take it anymore.\n\nPure Racing is the worst game mode I've ever played in any game, EVER. Spent two hours restarting Monaco over, and over, and over just so I could finish 4th. Despite the fact that it's IMPOSSIBLE to finish 1st in this gamemode unless you started first, somehow the AI that had won previous races also won again at Monaco and I ended up 2nd in the series. All that work, just to get my best possible finish of never-higher-than-fourth and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t AI wins, AGAIN.\n\nOnce you strip this game down of all its mario kart clone mechanics, there is literally nothing left -- this game accomplishes absolutely nothing. I had already grown weary of these ridiculous physics at this point. You can't make any corner because you just drift back and forth across the track, sometimes completely unpredictably. If any of the moronic AI get within an inch of you, which they seem incapable of NOT doing, they will trigger an absolutely unforgivable knockback effect that COMPLETELY stops all of your momentum. Naturally, it affects the AI less than it does the player so navigating through the clusterf*ck of garbage AI seems perfectly legit.\n\nThis is quite possibly the worst AI I've ever raced against in any game, at least in recent memory. Maybe it's just emphasized by the ridiculous physics which are, I suppose, designed to discourage less than optimal racing. Trying to retain a faint connection to real F1 racing, they make it abundantly clear that COLLISIONS ARE BAD, MMKAY. Be a respectful driver.. and wreck them with power-ups like a good boy/girl.\n\nHowever, optimal racing is an impossibility, especially when comparing a play to an AI. All of these problems are almost mute when a part of this merely acceptable Mario Kart clone. Then, strip the game down to "Pure Racing" and you just get slapped in the face with its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nUnbelievibly, despite the AI never taking an optimal race line or hitting any of the apexes of any corner, they are still consistantly as fast as if not faster than the player, unless you rely on the ridiculous draft system. If you brake into a corner properly, you WILL get rammed from behind and your race ruined. If you try to carfully overtake an AI through a corner on the outside and miraculously don't get hit from behind or have an AI slow to a crawl right in front of you, then the car on the inside WILL turn into your line and ruin your race.\n\nSo to recap, the AI never brake in corners and overtake you with easy, an often ram into you from behind. Yet, often times when entering a corner they will brake unpredictably and cause you to ram into them, even though they never brake. Despite the fact that the AI never take an optimal race line around the track, they make perfect time around corners, never missing boosts, while the player is in a constant struggle not to drift out of bounds while somehow managing to brake in a way to not get hit, enter corners in a way you can't be surprised by AI braking, or allowing any AI an opportunity to try and pass you on the side or enter your racing line.\n\nHonestly, even though this game is a Mario Kart clone I expected it to have a stronger more realistic racing feel than it does. Furthermore, the amount of control I actually feel like I have over the car feels about comparable to ice tracks in Mario Kart, but not quite that extreme.\n\nThe power-ups lack any originality.\n\nOh, and the pit stops, oh my god the put stops. I could rage about them forever, about how AI will go into the pits on the last stretch and still win or even pass me, how if I go into the pits I will get passed by 3 other cars, all this mostly due to the fact that some pits are LONG AF and waste so much time while others might even be faster than the main race line.. seems legit. Ultimately, this inconsistancy leads to times where the standard of not pitting on the last stretch ends up with you losing the race. So, just keep in mind that whichever decision you make is probably the wrong one.\n\nI would die for some online matchmaking to this game so that I don't have to deal with these AI, but I have yet to see a single person any of the times I've looked for a match.\n\nPerfectly decent party game -- it's exactly what you'd expect. I'm not disappointed with my purchase, as these types of games are fun just to mess around on. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is into this type of game, despite the fact that they are probably better off just continuing to play their kart racer of choice. Jimmy Johnson's Anything With an Engine, right?\n\nEdit: Just spent the last couple days playing Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and it blows this game out of the water. It really made me realize how all the parts of F1 Race Stars work against each other, making it an incredibly unfluid and irritating experience. I'm not sure if on top of everything else that the tracks or poorly designed, or if it's just the terrible gameplay and uncontrollable cars that make it feel that way.\n\nIn the end, I could only recommend this game if you already know you want it. If not for the ridiculous collision effects, this game would still be passable. Truly one of the worst mechanics I've had to struggle against in any racing game.","March 17, 2015","false","12.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","5","7","4","0"

The catch up is decent the slipstream is effective and some of the powerups make it easy to recover from mistakes but if you are in front it is one of the most frustrating experiences.\nI keep racking my brain trying to figure out why these corners are physically unable to be made unless you "powerslide" (i.e braking until stopped and moving) or turning well before you would be normally instinctive to do so, The catchup powerups make it so the first place suffers the most while everyone else affected very little. The Safety Car powerup makes the first place and anyone catching up slowed to barely anything while the behind catch up and the Rain Cloud powerup is god awful, causing me to come second on the final strip in more than a few races. The damage system is innovative but in the end flawed as you are permanently slowed until you divert to a repair station, often longer than the actual track in it's own sense, just constantly punishing you\n\nThe graphics kept me entertained for the time i played and the little animations were pretty cutesy and enchanting but unless you are withering it out with a friend, pick up Toybox Turbos, another game made by the same developer which has the same arcadey charm but not as punishing and when it funnels down to it, it is actually fun to play","September 6, 2015","false","7.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

If you are a Formula 1 who liked Mario Kart at any point in your life, this a great game to get during a Steam sale. Sure, the items are frustratingly rigged and the whole game's full of gimmicks, it's still great fun, especially since you can race as caricatures of your favorite real-life drivers and even some  slight  exaggerations of real racecourses (from 2012, at least).\n\nDo note this is NOT a game to treat as a simulation in the same way that Codemaster's flagship Formula 1 games should be seen as. This is simply old-fashioned, item-throwing, boost-abusing, absolutely almost chaotic random fun you'd expect from any arcade racing game. And it excels at that, though the Multiplayer feature is a bust, unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of DLC, the addon tracks are great fun, and ignore the accessories. They're borderline useless and a waste of money. Other than that, you've got yourself a pretty solid arcade game to kill some hours. And you'll have plenty of fun, if your expectations aren't built around the Formula 1 simulators.","March 9, 2015","true","20.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are alot of flaws in this game, first off there is NO drift, every cart racer needs a drift no matter what, i found myself crahing into a wall and getting stuck constantly. The second thing are the powerups, when i wasnt getting stuck i was getting hit with bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Third is the lack of fun things to do, it was very repetive and made me sleepy after an hour or two. This should DEFINETLY NOT  be $39.99, the most it should be is 5.00 - 10.00 dollars at MOST, luckily i got it free by pre-ordering F1 2013, which i HIGHLY recommend!

F1 Race Stars stands alone in being...exactly like all of the others.\n\nThat's not a bad thing - this is quite enjoyable, and I like Codemasters. The game is fun, it's wacky, there's tons of DLC's that add new things, and two years after the release I buy it in a bundle. For the price? It's excellent! It's well balanced, not buggy, doesn't crash on me, and it's playable with a keyboard or a controller.\n\nThere's a ton of content to unlock, lots of achievements, etc. You know, all those fake psychological bonuses you get for playing a game. So, if you think that Sonic All Stars Racing is getting boring, or you're tired of any of the other SUPER WACKY RACIN' GAMES, you might want to give this a try.\n\nDefinitely not bad, especially if you can get it on a huge discount with all the DLC, but it isn't worth dropping double digit bills on.\n\nFun factor is huge, music is lame, characters are bobbleheads - all the gimmicks are there! Fun, polished, and I think that's the whole point. I do think they went a little bit crazy with the DLC, though.\n\n6.5/10 - You'll get your money's worth if it's on sale, but it's not the greatest game of all time.","March 19, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

And then the game makes very very much fun!\nUnfortunately this game had no racing wheel support. Just controller support. But a good thing to say about it is that the Controls are pretty easy (WASD+Shift+Space+Alt) and that you can play this game in Co-Op mode with a splitscreen and on 1 computer. But you have to have a controller for each person you wanna play together with, just one person can use the keyboard.\nBecause of the easy Controls, the Replayability is very good. Also this game has very many game modes, a campain with several cups on several roads and a quick race mode. I took away 1 point because of the eventual Rage Quits because of the (Un)Fairness.\nThe Graphic is pretty good, the maps look cool and the special effects are well detailed. Everything is in a pretty comic style and there is no violent. You can play it with your whole family (if you turn off the damage...I am already hearing your kids cry...) and your friends.\nThe only thing I have to fault is the sometimes angular graphics. The sound is nice, too, but it had a bit potential upwards.\n\nTL; DR\nThis game is a Mario Kart for PC with an unfair Single Player Damage and no Online Community. Play with your friends or Offline and have fun!

The racers are real f1 race stars, and the items have been changed to fit the game.  Unlike mario kart this is not a very good racing game.\nPersonally I've played almost all of the mario kart games, so this game was not very hard in the slightest for me.  The reason it's so easy is that fact that you have no “rival” racers.  In Mario Kart, you usually have a few characters that get 2nd or 3rd place as you get first and keep really close to you in points for the standings.  In this game I would be able to finish 5th and 6th at times and still win because some other person with no points would win the race and I'd still be in first.\nThere are not that many different tracks and you will go over the same tracks over and over again in different cups.  There are 30 cups, which vary in the amount of tracks they have.  At first they are just slandered races but eventually the other cups apply a variety of challenges  instead.  Sometimes you have to stay in first to get points, other times you have to collect cups on the road to add to points.  Each track also has a shortcut system that I personally never used, but if you are having troubles I'd recommend looking their locations up you can win races just by using them.\nThe racers are not really exciting, and the attributes each pair of racers have didn't alter my experience.  The power ups are balloons, and other real world things that aren't creative, like a torpedo, a ghost boost that makes you invulnerable and move quickly.  One of the most awful idea's the game put in is this stupid pit system.  If you get hit by a balloon or something, your car is damaged and moves slowly, and you have to go out of your way and lose placing to drive through the pit stop.  Really stupid idea in an arcade racer.\nOne more thing to say about the difficulty there are 2 cups that are an insane spike in difficulty. In these they have the damage set to extremely high so if another racer even touches you you have to go pit and they all pass you.  It took me 3 hours to do the first and 3 to do the second.  They are quite random and will aggravate you so much you might just quit the game.\nI bought this game for about 5$, it has a few dlc's that are for multi-player which doesn't exist.  This is not a very good game unless you are a diehard mario kart fan.  Even then go play that instead.","October 28, 2015","false","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Corners are bland and witohut the Mario Kart style handling but with the MK styled tracks it just feels like a weird mashup that makes no sense. It's like they wanted to make a fun party racer, but decided the F1 cars should handle like F1 cars.\n\nThe majority of the power ups are so uninspired, most of them being carbon copies of MK powerups which is mostly the norm since, it's not too otherworldly, but everything is just, bubble. Red bubble, blue bubble, purple bubble. The only other power-up is a safety car which slows down the lead racer, but just slows them down.\n\nI would appriciate this game more if the safety car was introduced as rubber banding, making sure that the lead racer can still stay first, but can't get to a point where they're unreachable especially playing a solid defense. Also if you could just drift, I swear if you could just drift this game would be fun.\n\nJust don't buy this, Sonic and Sega Allstars is a much better game.","May 19","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/203680/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","Alright, so I'm pretty torn on this. I'd been waiting a long while, debating a long while on whether I wanted to get my hands on it, because it looked quite fun and silly and right up my alley, and it's from Codemasters, but the reviewers I normally trust noted frustrating difficulty with it. Having finally picked it up for a little under $4 USD, I think I can sum up all the problems with this game in one word: "Arbitrary."\n\nThere's an arbitrary elimination mode that's horribly unbalanced and basically just means the person in first at the beginning wins. There's an arbitrary shortcut system that requires you to find a key on the track and drive through a specific gate to basically win right off the bat. There's an arbitrary random interval of time between the "3, 2, 1" and the "Go" to make boosting at the start that much harder (though honestly I found that kinda funny). There's an arbitrary damage system that slows your car down after each item that hits you, which serves only to force you to pit and to let those in the lead keep their lead. The whole freaking point of item racing is to keep it competitive, make it so that it's a constant fight for position based on skill. The gameplay mechanics routinely defeat their own purpose here. Hell, there's an item that  instantly teleports the user to lead position. How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lazy is that, destroying the entire purpose? In a great deal of the career mode's races, I didn't feel any satisfaction whether I won or lost, feeling instead like I just ended up wherever the game decided.\n\nNow, if you've read all of that and still want to give this game a try due to curiosity, sale price, a love of F1, or being charmed by the trailers, then I can recommend this to you. If you want a better racing game, you're spoiled for choice here, but Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is name-dropped so often for a reason. If you just want to check this in particular out on sale, then go ahead; you'll definitely get your $4 worth.\n\nThe course design is a major, major plus here. I'm not too familiar with F1, but I know a lot of the real tracks from other racing series, and especially racing games (and especially games by Codemasters, at that!). The KERS system encourages taking your time in sharp corners, meaning that places like Monaco and the mountain roads of Japan (because come on, it's a Japan course in a racing game) get to be twisty and winding without ruining momentum. Each course is a loving, cartoonish, theme park version of its setting, be it the country entirely or just the city, and national stereotypes are played for humor, creativity, and really exciting scenes. Racing on bullet trains in Japan, leaping through the castles of Germany, and battling in the factories of the UK are grand fun. As an American, I personally found the USA course to be absolutely adorable, and love the effort they put into these. The original courses are part of the design, of course, and it's quite impressive to see familiar sweeping curves recreated in the country's landscape. I will also have to give some points for sheer awesome value of Abu Dhabi starting with a back-to-back combo of Yas Marina and Ferrari World.\n\nThe character design is your usual exaggerated cartoony look, but the animation sells it. Seeing your driver put on their helmet a random way every single time you start the race livens up the usual countdown, much like the Battlefield games having those one-in-ten-thousand reload animations. I don't know the drivers all too well, but was able to find pretty much all of the ones I've heard of. The voice acting is serviceable, and playing mostly as Kimi Räikkönen, it took a while before I realized that every driver speaks their own home language with a peppering of English. It does add a good deal to the experience to hear an international field, even if a bit exaggerated in performance.\n\nThere is a massive amount of bloat in this game, from extraneous unfun game modes to a wealth of gameplay mechanics that are never, ever explained. The key and shortcut system is never once mentioned. Boosting at the start by pressing the pedal right at "Go" is never mentioned. Boosting after a jump by hitting the gas the second you land is never mentioned. And so on, and so forth. You're gonna probably need a guide for this one.\n\nThe sense of speed honestly isn't too impressive outside of boosts. It doesn't really feel particularly like F1. It's the courses and the KERS system that really hammer home what it's based off of. All in all, it's absolutely goofy in a great way, but I mostly only recommend it to those out there that, say, would go into a game store and pick out a racing game from the bargain bin just to see what the experience is like, not for completionist's sake or out of serious hope it'll be a major timesink and investment. For the most part, I really was tempted to hit that "Not Recommended" button. But I haven't stopped playing, so I think that answers that.","May 24","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
