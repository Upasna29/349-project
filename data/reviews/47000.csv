Instead of aiming for points, your objective is to make your way through the levels by breaking the path with your matches. It was a great surprise--I didn't expect much, but ended up having some fun for a few hours!\n\nPros:\nInnovative mechanic on the match-3 genre\nTotal of 64 basic levels, plus 4 hidden-object and 16 spot-the-difference levels, making it just long enough for this kind of game\nSmart puzzles that require fast thinking\nA unique atmosphere in each "world"\nExcellent difficulty advancement--you'll find it too easy at first, but it'll get harder as you move on\nSpecial powers add another layer to the puzzles\nPleasant BGM and cute graphics\nCons:\nTerrible (almost non-existent) story, but who cares?\nFixed very low resolution\nHO and STD levels were really annoying, mostly because of the low res, making me just click around like crazy\nBoring animations and character cards (that you collect to progress in the game)\nBought on / for: Razor Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$0.35 (R$ 0,91).

It's a great time sink.\n\nWhat this game does well:\n1. The artwork is beautiful.\n2. The Match 3+ puzzles are based on a maze-type "map" where you need to find your way from your starting position to the end, rather than a simple X by X board. Aided by 4 usable rechargeable items, you need to make your way to the end of the maze by any means necessary. And there are also explosions when you match 5 or more gems!\n3. The hidden object games are nice and challenging.\n4. The spot the differences game is lot's of fun - some puzzles are quite tough, too.\n\nWhat this game does poorly:\nIn my opinion - nothing, really... I guess the spot the differences puzzles could have had more differences to spot, but then again, it works fine as it is.\n\nThe conclusion:\nA magnificent casual 5+ hours game, with wonderful artwork and fun gameplay, which would cost you under 1€/$ on sale (like right now). This is cheaper than a bag of peanuts or chips, or a beer and will provide you with way more hours of enjoyment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/47000/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","4 Elements is a fun match-3 puzzler weighed down by unnecessary seek-and-find sequences and occasionally frustrating level design. 4 Elements' generic fantasy presentation hides an addictive game that will appeal to fans of Bejeweled and other "casual" puzzle titles. There's nothing wrong with story in a puzzle game, but with the relatively low resolution of the somewhat blurry art in the seek-and-find sequences, gamers will want the title to get out of its own way and let the real game breathe.\n\n4 Elements tells a simple story of an ancient evil that was locked away by the power of the titular elements — earth, wind, fire and water — but has now been unleashed. It's up to the player to unlock four books to release the elements and save the realm. It's inoffensive and flat, but the story is bolstered by a fairy who accompanies the player and periodically provides tips and hints. Unlike some other games that have overused the "helper" character while not allowing the player to discover and explore, the fairy is here to explain the various rules and power-ups and won't get in your way.\n\nThe main gameplay of 4 Elements involves creating chains of three or more jewels of the same colour to clear a pathway for a liquid to reach the tree at the end of each level. The 64 timed levels are large and sprawling, with multiple pathways and strategies for the player to take. There are 16 levels per "element," and the colours and visuals change depending on which element you're playing, adding a bit of variety to the proceedings while playing; as you progress, the levels become harder, longer and with more obstacles. For example, you might stumble upon a stone that can only be destroyed via a bomb power-up, or a frozen tile that must be chained several times before breaking.\n\nThere are environmental tricks, as well, with arrows that help clear large sections of the level when the liquid reaches them. There are several power-ups, such as the aforementioned bomb, the ability to swap any two regular jewels, "dig" out a tile to make way for another, and a power-up that reshuffles all jewels in the level besides stones and frozen tiles. Some jewels sit on more than one layer and must be cleared several times, as well. The time limit is rarely going to make players nervous, but it does add a good bit of tension as players scramble to reach the tree after a long journey.\n\nSupplementing the main gameplay are four hidden object sequences to find the key to each elemental book. The still paintings, while pretty, are a bit washed out on both the top screen and the touch screen, making it difficult to find each item. The fairy is available to point players in the right direction, but these sections feel like filler. There are also near-identical cards that require the player to spot the differences, which are short and relatively simple, but the small pictures on the card had us resort to pixel hunting and tapping the screen until we found something; these sequences aren't challenging so much as frustrating, and feel extraneous to the rest of the game.\n\nAlthough the colours seem a little washed out, the visuals are lovely and soft, evoking a fairy tale fantasy realm. The music and sound effects are quite soothing and peaceful, and the pay-off to a large combo or clearing a huge section of a level with "whoosh" and "ringing" sounds is surprisingly effective. The top screen is used as a map, while the bottom screen is where the action takes place. There is not much 3D implementation here, but it's not missed.\n\nThough 4 Elements is hampered by its filler hidden object/seek-and-find sequences, the puzzle gameplay is very fun and surprisingly involving. So while it's not the perfect puzzle game, players could certainly do worse. For a lengthy and well-crafted experience, 4 Elements is recommended; just be ready to do some pixel hunting in-between matching those jewels.","February 13","true","84.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Is there anything extraordinary? Nah, not really. But it has a story at least.\n\nThe Magic Land - yeah, this is the name of the realm that we are in. Creative I know, bear with me for the time - is in turmoil! The altars of the 4 Elements fell into ruin and the careful balance of nature is tipped off to result in catastrophes all over the place, so it is our casual gaming skills that shall save the Magic Land. With our trusted fairy companion - that girl is useful, I tell you - we are to unlock the books of 4 Elements and bring peace to the realm once again! For a casual game, it comes with a story and some lore about magical creatures. I must say that's a bonus.\n\n4 Elements is an entertaining, casual puzzle game that takes attention, quick-thinking and resourcefulness. Rules are very simple: your aim is to open a path way for the energy flow through the puzzle board labyrinth within a time limit, by matching as many possible same colored stones at a time. Your casual Match 3 game. It starts easy enough, and progresses to become 'what the heck I'm doing, I wonder???'. It has some HOG and “Find the Difference” scenes between chapters that are moronically hard: I couldn't decide whether they are a plus or a minus.\n\nThe game itself is kinda addictive. You find yourself passing an hour or two, then realize that you've just lost that hour, which is the exact purpose of these games. Theme is really pretty, and the design is well above the average. I'd recommend it to whomever that looks for a fancy Bejeweled alternative with flashy gameplay and needs a game that doesn't use much brain activity rather than some attention span.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 15, 2015","true","10.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

The graphics are so sweet. Unfortunately the resolution is fixed to 800 x 600. Could be HD. A really relaxing and outstanding soundtrack. Love this instrumental music. Panpipes, whistles, guitar and piano.\n\nLike every puzzle game it starts easy. Connect some chains with min 3 tiles ... but then the hardness raises quickly. Destroy stone blocks make longer chains. But it's much more. Every book part level has it's own break to solve a "spott-the-differences" minigame. Really not easy. To enter a new book you have solve a "quest", meaning search a big picture for several item parts. It's unnatural hard. But if you proceed you'll get into the game and enjoy the thrill of puzzeling. The last two levels are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You have to quick solve chains and may need many tries ...\n\nHighly recommend as a classic puzzlegame","April 28, 2014","true","11.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","3"

The objective of each level is to clear the blocks, which destroys the path below them, which allows the water to progress. The goal is to get the water from the start to the finish. As the levels progress, the size of the board increases and obstacles pop up. Destroying colors builds toward power ups. Collecting green blocks builds towards a shovel that allows you to dig away a piece of the path, for example. Making long chains creates explosions to destroy obstacles like ice.\n\nWhile the game is designed with a ticking clock each level, I think I only ran out of time maybe twice just from bad luck on what colors came my way. It's not really difficult. After a few boards, the game switches things up with some puzzles where you need to find the differences in two pictures or search for hidden objects. Many of these items/differences are extremely well hidden, basically blending into the backgrounds, which made that a bit of an annoyance. I had a few times where I just went click crazy all over the screen.\n\nThere are A LOT of levels in this game. After a while I thought it would never end, so it does feel like it stretches out a bit too long. It's still fun and completely worth a play through, though I can't see me playing it again anytime soon.

It takes you through a fairly lengthy single-player campaign and even manages to mix in a few Hidden Object and Spot the Difference mini-games. It is however not a game that can stand up to the more modern tile matching games and it's attempts at branching out, through the use of a small storyline and the previously mentioned hidden object games, does not add much to the experience.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, you have to lead a liquid from the start of a maze to the end by matching tiles to open up paths. Most of it is pretty straight forward but the game does add in a few special puzzles and traps as you progress however the really interesting ones only show up in the very last levels and you don't really feel challenged until then. You get a few special abilities that are charged by matching tiles of a specific color however their use is mostly limited to the areas where they are required to progress.\n\nOne bug that kept annoying me throughout the game was that the on-screen arrow that shows you which direction you need to go always blocks your view of a tile.\n\nAll in all there is not much to see here. The game is not impressive or interesting and the fact that the individual levels are fairly lengthy means it does not even qualify as a decent timesink.

The gameplay is excellent: simple, solid mechanics, good level design, nice graphics and sound produce a game which is fun and, in later levels, challenging enough to give a sense of achievent when you complete the game. The only weakness in the gameplay is occasional visability problems caused by the automatic camera and direction arrow. This problem is rare however, it took me several playthroughs to encounter it. The game also features Spot-the-Difference levels, which add little, and occasional Hidden-Object levels, which are diverting and challenging.\n\nUnfortunately, the presentation and "story" are as cliched as anything I have ever witnessed in a game. If you find bad fantasy irritating, I advise you to click to continue whenever prompted.\n\nIf you enjoy timed puzzle games, this one is worth getting. I recommend waiting for a reduced price, they are quite frequent.","October 6, 2014","true","83.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is somewhat appealing as it consists of roughly three types of minigames. The structure is pretty much the same. First you do a hidden object minigame, which then allows you to play 4 match 3 levels. The RNG is pretty fair, although sometimes I found that I could breeze through a level after a few attempts and restarts. The final level is a "Spot-the-difference" level. Unfortunately as with the hidden objects game, I just randomly clicked around until I completed the task. At first I was trying to actually find the things, but I realised quickly that there would be a  modicum of tedium involved. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't so much a game you play for the story. I don't even know what the story was. I just skipped as much of it as I could.\n\nIf you can get the game in a bundle or when it is on sale, I say go ahead.","July 18, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game its self will take you about 9 hours to play though if you need to restart a few missions, I had to on the last 2 of them since they pretty much make you rush a few parts which I found hard to keep up at times. Over all I really enjoyed this game, it was like bejeweled mixed with a new things. I can say if your looking to get this game for a kid it is well worth it. My self being about 25 I found it just as fun as the many other games I have played. It was a nice relaxing game that made you think before you did every move.\n\nPro's:\nHas 64 levels that progressively get harder as you play.\nPerks when you get stuck, or have no way of getting past one area fast.\nYour fairy will randomly mix the jewels when there are no more move's left which made it more relaxing and fun.\nThey give you hints when you get stuck, and there are some points where you will need it if you have bad eyes.\n\nCon's:\nLevels are timed and sometimes you will make it 1or 2 secs after timer runs out (done this on a few levels/missions which dose give you the win).\nI found the game to go from easy to hard vary fast then back down to easy. The tips the fairy gives you helps though not by much.\nWhen you get to the last few rounds, the power-ups take a lot more to charge up and even take more jewels the more you use them (last two levels I found this).\n\nOver all I would recommend this game for its fun Bejeweled style look and its short story. Just remember this is one of those games you can knock out in a night, so take your time.","October 8, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just buy it for 75% or more off because it's only worth a few bucks--unless money isn't a concern to you.\nMost of the game is match 3-style puzzles that are easy; I only had to repeat a few levels. The final levels are a little challenging but nothing you'll break your keyboard over. There are other puzzle elements in the game such as finding hidden objects in pictures. These might prove annoying if you only want the game for the match 3 puzzles because you have to do the other puzzle styles in order to progress (unlock all elements/levels).

They saved the best two stages in the game for last.

With most stages taking no more than five minutes each, the ability to save and quit at any given time, even in the middle of a puzzle and continue at your convenience, the creators have clearly put a great deal of thought into smoothing out not only the mechanics of the game, but the way it is presented to you, the player.\n\n'The baby's crying?  Dinner is ready?  Don't worry--we'll leave this just as you left it.'\n\nEverything within this simple puzzle title is polished to perfection:\nThe artwork and related 'find the difference' mini-games are masterpieces on their own, especially in the way that they are assembled according to your progression.  Every click of a button results in a harmonious tap or chime, rewarding your headway with a rush of flowing water or wisp of wind, weaving an encouraging musical atmosphere as you restore the world around you.  The stages themselves have a smooth difficulty curve as well, challenging enough to feel rewarding and encourage creative strategies without leading you to frustration.\n\nA brilliant puzzle game and highly recommended.

Though, this time, no tile to move but tiles to select, starting at 3 that have at least one border in common. The more you link, the better. At 5 linked (or more) an explosion happens, clearing more background and tiles. Some more options can be set during the game (bomb, swap tile, etc.), provided you filled them up first. Throught the four books, representing the elements, there are four "find the differences" mini games per book, and one other "find the object" mini game per book.\nThat's the basic of gameplay. Design wise, it's a very pleasant trip. The graphics are beautiful and music is relaxing. "4 Elements" starts easy but quickly becomes challenging. Near the end, it leans towards the very difficult.\nAround the last levels (amongst 66) the automated camera may show a part of the screen that isn't very useful. And that's  about the only issue I've found.","December 1, 2013","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love puzzle RPGs but this was really boring and repetitive. Only played through it because of my OCD for achievments and feeling like I wanted to get my moneys worth. You only get 4 spells which you get in the first area or two and use throughout. The spot the difference puzzles were too easy even when windowed so I could barely see the pictures. The object finding puzzles were entertaining but there are only 4 and most of the items are really easy to spot with a few being almost impossible to see. Only the last few levels were interesting. Also I got excited about voice acting at the start but that is the only time there is any, not even some at the end.\n\nBasically I am minutely irritated that I have spent £5 on it and many hours of my life.

That means 800x600 resolution that messes with my desktop and results in other programs getting rescaled and thrown all over the place and my monitor flashing up a warning to change the resolution every time I start the game. There is no option to change the resolution... because it was 2008 and 1080p was like something out of 2001.\n\nYour options are limited to playing fullscreen with horribly stretched graphics and the desktop suffering or playing in a tiny window too small to see anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/47000/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","Mini games amd colour maching the game.\n\nintroduction:\nTo start out with, you are introduced to the story, wich involve the elements running amok in a magical world. We are told to restore peace to each element; earth, wind, fire, and water. On the menu screen we can see all the levls representet by books and gems, and we get an idea of how long this game is going to take.\n\nTherefore I felt the introduction to be really boring. It shows the whole game from the get go, and there are no surprises along the way.\n\nGamplay:\nThe gamepaly is split up into 3 diffrent games, where one acts as the main game, while the others are mini-games. The main game is very simple, match coloured blocks in a chain, in order to make sand dissaper. When the sand is gone, the water you need to get to the end of the stage can continue to flow. After you let the water flow to the end, you win the level.\n\nThe levels have diffrent obsticles along the way that can block the way to completion, these items is for eksample rocks.\n\nThe levels are getting harder along the way, but you also unlock power-ups, that will help you to reach the goal. The power-ups fells really overpowered, and can easily make the game a win for you, nearly every single time. This was a huge letdown for me, since I never really felt challenged. The powerups can be things like changing around blocks and blowing up paths.\n\nThe two mini games are done, in order to unlock new levels. The first one is a "spot the diffrence" game, where you click a place on a picture, to spot the flaw on the other picture.\n\nThe other part is a "find the objects" game, where you must spot things hidding in the background. All the games are controlled by simple mouse-clicking., and it fells rather slow and boring now and again. The overall games are not boring as such, but it quikly get`s repetative.\n\nCharecters:\nWell there are only two charecters in this game, and they both have no persanality. This game is clearly not story driven, but in my opinion, they did not need to include these charecters to complete a already unnesesary story. The charecters are a wizard, which we never see after the starting scren, and a fariy which guides you throughout the game. There is not much to say to this part, so let`s move on.\n\nVisuels:\nThe game looks kinda ok, but I really did not exspect anything brillaint to be honest. The overall visuesl in-game are accually pretty fluid, and looks fine. But when you do anything outside the main game, the grafics fells weaker and more bluery. It`s hard to explain, but I felt there was something wrong.\n\nSound:\nThe music is acually ok in this game. I fellt it was a nice thing to include, and the diffrent themes are acually not that bad. Other then that, there are not much to say to the sounds other than the star theme will blast your speakers out, it is so loud!\n\nStory:\nSo the story is pretty basic as said, clear all levels to controle all elements. The boring part is that the sory really has no twists and turns, instead it fells like it only is there to give you a reason to why there is 4 main levels.\n\nThe other mini-games really has some cool story. Not so much the hidden object part. But when you complete the spot the diffrence game. You see the real picture, and get`s the lore of the charecter on it. This was some intresting reading, and felt like a nice inclusion to the game, and the lore of the establist world.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is far from a masterpice, and it really is just another time killer game. This dose not mean I dislike the game at all, I am just saying you can find better games of this type out there. I completed the story and it really is just a congratiolation screen and nothing more. But if you are looking for a simple game to sit down and play, this one coul be a nice choice. I give this game a thumps up.","December 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Main goal in match 3 mode is to transport a green liquid until it reaches a tree that grows and shows that you have finished the level. Each level is designed very different and makes the game more challenging and gives it variety.\n\nThe only compliant with this game i have is the unskippable sequences between levels. I can see such comfortable features were not common in these type of games back in 2008 and there are much better games released based of comfort function.

You can beat it and earn all the achievements in rather short order (my play time includes needing to start over again roughly halfway through due to computer issues). Yet, it's well worth getting on sale. Basically, it's a match-three game in which you attempt to create a path for yourself through each level, using power-ups to assist you as needed. Longer chain matches lead to ever bigger explosions, making your work easier and faster. There are some fun twists to some of the levels, each world has its own feel to it, and it really is rather relaxing. To be honest, there were very few levels in the game that I was not able to beat the first time without running out of time, and none that took me more than two tries, so the degree of challenge might not be quite enough for some, but I view it as a positive. While beating the game is faster that way, it is also rendered largely free of the frustration that comes with countless deaths on the same level. Overall, if you like casual/match 3 games at all, then this is one to check out.\n\nIt does seem fair to warn you of some negatives before you do so though. First, and most annoying, while there are hidden object and spot the difference style mini-games that you play at regular intervals to advance further in the game, the images are in rather low resolution, making what you're meant to spot rather difficult to see much of the time. Fortunately, there's a hint feature and no time limit, nor is there any penalty for random clicking, so when you can't see something these levels are still easily beatable. Also, as a fairly unimportant negative to the game, all the story elements that go along with the gameplay are not exactly going to fill you with excitement, if you care about such things in this kind of game. At least you'll now be a bit aware of what to expect though.","December 18, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You dig by eliminating tiles on top of the dirt. The camera scrolls on its own as it follows the liquid, and you can't scroll back to earlier parts of the level, so you have to deal with only what you see on the screen. Sometimes the randomness will deal a bad hand, but you can get out of trouble with planning and clever use of powerups.\n\nI admit, I first thought it was a bit easy and simplistic for my tastes -- there are only four colors to match, and the powerups were a bit too powerful. About halfway through the game, I realized the main enemy was the timer, and it could put up a good fight. Later levels got fast and frantic as I had to dig through huge levels in only a few minutes, and the final few levels were quite a satisfying challenge.\n\nOverall, it was pretty good! It seems like something straight out of the golden age of PopCap. If you have fond memories of Zuma, Bejeweled, Chuzzle, Bookworm, and the like, you might find this very enjoyable.

And if youre looking for a Match-3 RPG DO NOT look here!\n\nOk, so the tags are misleading. This is mostly a fantasy themed HOG (Hidden Object game), not a match 3 RPG like Puzzle Quest.\n\nIt has a tiny "match 3" component, if you can call it that. Basically, youre trying to draw a path from a start point to a finish point by breaking the "rock" by linking gems, which breaks the background "rock" and creates an open path. You select gems by dragging over them with a mouse. In any direction, including turning while dragging. Its so easy it isnt even funny. It goes HOG scene, where you have to find the pieces of various items in a picture, then use the items in the picture to open more scenes (IE a pickaxe to break a cave in). That gets you a key to open a book.\n\nThen a few rounds of the aforementioned match 3. THEN a "find the differences between two images" HOG. You do that a few times in each book before going back to the "find pieces of items HOG" to get the new key to open a new book.\n\nTheres no choice, no choosing of puzzles, and a very weak fantasy plot with an annoying fairy that constantly flits around the screen. Its like its badly built for 5 year olds. If you like HOGs (oh god, why??) theres WAY better ones out there. And if you like Match 3 RPGs theres way way better ones.\n\nThis MAY entertain a 6 year old. But I doubt it. Do yourself a favor and dont waste your cash.\n","August 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","5"

It isn’t as genius as any of Popcap’s creations but it does have a place on the list of casual games worth playing; especially if you are in to the Match 3+ type games. The game plays pretty much like any other match 3 games, except with quite few more additional twist. You can directly chain multiple gems together to create larger explosions to clear paths to reach the end goal while at the same time build up magical energies that match the colored gems destroyed. These magical energies unlock powers that include re-randomization of the game board, defrost/destroy gems, etc. In addition to the already huge amount of game changing twist, at the end of each book chapter you have to undergo a spot the difference and hidden object challenge. The story, while very limited in scope, is a nice touch and it adds on to the overall theme of the game.","May 24, 2012","true","29.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game will then have you search for several differences between two seemingly identical pictures (search the difference).

I'd say it's a good buy even at the regular price.\n\n\nA few points that could use improvement (perhaps in a v2):\n\n- No real replayability. Once you've solved level 64, and perhaps hunted down the missing achievements, there's no reason to fire up the game anymore.\n\nSuggestions: let the game keep track of your individual level solution times or scores, to add an incentive to replay for better scores. Additionally, the game really should offer a built-in way to replay specific previously completed levels. As it is now, if you like certain levels and wish to revisit them, the game forces you to play all previous levels first to get to the ones you actually wished to replay, or... you have to edit the savegame xml. Ugh.\n\nA slightly more ambitious suggestion: a level design or mod tool would extend the lifetime of this game considerably.\n\n- No graphics/resolution options. Well, there is exactly one: fullscreen y/n. Fullscreen appears to be fixed at 800x600 regardless of screen native size, and windowed it cannot be resized either. Trying to find the hidden pixels of a tiny 800x600 window on a full HD (or more!) screen becomes very tiring for the eyes.\n\nIt really should not need to be said that graphics and resolution options are a must for PC games.\n\n- Very frequent, randomly timed freezing. The game very regularly -every few minutes on average, but sometimes several times a minute- freezes up while playing a level, and becomes completely unresponsive for 1-5 seconds at a time. Very annoying!\n\nI haven't been able to figure out a pattern in this. Sometimes it seemed to happen when the cursor moved to/over the edge of the window. Other times it seemed timed with one of the animations onscreen. Browser, Steam client, notepad, task manager, Windows menu all respond fluently at the time the game freezes up, so it is very clearly just the game window. The only actual bug I've encountered, but it's an annoying one.\n\n\nEnd verdict: Annoyances aside, it's a good game for a good price if you like this sort of casual puzzles. Very kid friendly too (my 2yr old niece approves).","April 20, 2015","true","24.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Although the game can get a little repetative after a while (much of the game is drawing paths to move energy from one place to another), it keeps it difficult enough and paces itself well enough to keep you on your toes. The hidden-object parts feature very well illustrated scenes and are placed at different times throughout the game so that finding the objects don't feel like a chore.

The puzzles follow a similar pattern (4 puzzles to solve a level, 4 levels to a world, then one world puzzle). This in itself is not a huge issue as you want puzzle games to be lengthy and have variety. However, the difficulty of the game provides no variety up until like the last couple of levels.

I had to play it that small windowed mode with the monitor closer to my face. This, I can take, but already fills up the dislike bar a little bit. Other details made the rest of the work and the bar resulted in this review.\n\nThe game itself is fine although a little bit repetitive and not very innovative. If you like lighly washed-on themes of fantasy and match-3 type games, no problem so far. But let's go to the list of annoyances:\n\n- There's one chance to shut the fairy up, when she asks if you want to keep receiving tips and stuff. If you don't shut her at that moment, you'll be stuck with her to the end of the game. The "hints" option only refers to the in-game matches, apparently.\n- You cannot choose what book you want to unlock next and there's no thematic justification for that, it is just "later books, harder levels". At least let us pick what card from a book to recover next or something, that would be easy to implement even keeping the levels linear but only changing their name, to present players with a "false choice". Everything is so linear that even this kind of insignificant choice would be cool to have.\n- You cannot replay any levels after they're beaten once. W-what?? That is a pain, because there are achievements that require you to start a whole new game if you don't get them at first.\n- The Epilogue took so long to appear that I have already clicked the screen thinking nothing would happen if I didn't. It skipped the ending and guess what? Once gone, you cannot access it anymore. In fact, forget your progress. At the time that screen appears, your progress is deleted and the only option is to start a new game. I hope there's a youtube video or something so I can see what the hell the Epilogue was about.\n\nThe smaller the game, the heavier these details become. Overall, I don't recommend 4 Elements. Even without all the annoyance, it's still a repetitive and very forgettable game.","May 28","false","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After every four levels, you'll get to play a short game of "Spot the difference", but that's pretty much all the excitement happening. Oh, and you get to search for objects before you open up another part of the game.\n\nThe plot of restoring four books of magic, so that the powers within are in balance again, are a nice little touch, but pretty much all there is to it. After 64 levels, the game is played through completely, and you have the choice of starting all over again. (I played the first 16 levels again to gain the last two achievements, but that's it - I'm done with this game.)\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you are really a match 3 fan, and find it funny to have a fairy at your side making you think of Navi. Granted, the fairy in this game is not as obnoxious, but not as helpful as Navi either. And that is a feat.\n\nDone with the game, moving on to something more entertaining - at least I hope the next one will be more entertaining.","February 4, 2015","false","10.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

All I could think of was how there are so many ways in life for my time to be more well spent, whether with other, much better games, or anything outside of games in real life. It is just a series of still pictures that you find items then point-and-click then a bunch of uninteresting, unfun, bleak, bland, boring jewel matching.

The power ups are woefully slow to load back up and some of the time your just going to lose because you have to wait for a power up to recharge. Now games do have some luck involved of course but when it becomes a game mechanic instead of skill then we have some issues with it.\n\nMostly a game of luck rather then a game of skill really. ALso the dumb idea to add a timer is stupid and dumb and a little cruel to people who pay for this. Why does this need a timer at all??? It doesnt. . Also the price is way to high for this game bought it on sale for a buck. Im really not liking this game as much as I thought I would.

I picked this up in a bundle, so for the price it couldn't be beat. I really think that they should cut the regular price in half on Steam, however, because of certain elements of the game. It's in a very low resolution, which stretches to the size of the resolution you have set on your monitor.\n\nAt least from what I saw, there's no way to change this. A bad soundtrack is always my main complaint with games, but that's easily fixed with this game by just turning it off and putting on your own music - as I've stated in reviews for other games. 10 hours is about the maximum amount of time you'll get out of this game by the time you complete it.\n\nThat isn't entirely a bad thing.\n\nIt combines several different types of casual games. Click'n'find, image matching, and matching up crystals which give you some useful powers. Interesting, and not a bad game, just not amazing, either. Even for 2008 and a casual game, it could've been better. However, it did soak up 10 hours of my time and for that, it's definitely worth it for you to check it out next time it pops up in a bundle.\n\n6.5/10 - Fun factor is huge, everything else is just okay.","June 5, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingomelette/recommended/47000/","flyingomelette","Flying Omelette","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flyingomelette/","765 products in account","I'm beginning to agree with all the Steam reviewers who think we need to have a "neutral" button for reviews. While I enjoyed my time with 4 Elements, I can't *strongly* recommend it, but if you like match-3 type games and find it on sale (I got it while it was only 99 cents), then there are probably worse ways to spend your time and money. The game also features Hidden Object and Find the Differences scenes, but the (very) main focus are the match-3 puzzle scenes in which you clear a path for a flow of energy to make it to a goal by chaining together three or more objects of the same color in a row. The more objects you chain up, the bigger an explosion it makes, causing the energy to flow farther. It's kinda fun and addicting, especially to scout the screen for the largest possible chain to make and to watch the ensuing chaos as it explodes and takes out the surroundings, sometimes even setting off arrows that travel across the screen and blow away even more crap.\n\nThe game is long, but rather easy. The last few levels introduce some new gimmicks that make them harder, such as one where the screen auto-scrolls and you have to manically keep forming chains so that the energy flow keeps up with it. But it seems like more of this kind of thing was needed. I know, welcome to Casual Gaming, right? While I replayed the game just enough to get the achievements, I wouldn't want to go all the way through it again right away because it can get monotonous.\n\nFinally, the richness of the story is a bit overstated in this game's description. Mostly it's in the form of cards you get after doing the "find the differences" scenes, which have a picture of a fantasy animal, knight, or humanoid race on it with a description of them. The hand-drawn graphics are beautiful, but the style sometimes makes it difficult to tell where the differences are or the hidden objects are.\n\nIn short, if you like this type of game and it's on sale, go for it.

I was expecting a classic Bejeweled-style game, but instead of swapping tiles or sliding rows, you form chains by clicking and dragging a path through adjacent matching symbols.  The paths do not have to form a straight line, you can zig-zag any direction except diagonally (for all the explanation the game gives, they never actually tell you this).\n\nAs the game progresses, you will encounter obstacles such as ice, immovable blocks, narrow passages, and rocks; however, you will also gain access to rechargeable tools that help you overcome these obstacles.  There is a timer, but chances are you will not need to worry about it until 3/4 of the way through the game, and even if you fail you just restart the level with no penalties.  The levels are increasingly challenging, but never frustrating or boring.  In fact, I found I enjoyed the later levels more because they forced you to use a bit of strategy to complete.\n\nI thought it was a nice touch that each of the four elements have a slightly different level aesthetic, which helps keep the levels feeling fresh.\n\nAs great as the gameplay was, though, there are things that destroy the replay value:\n- The story is cheesy.  Although, that's to be expected for this genre.\n- The chatty fairy.  She was fine for the first playthrough, providing necessary instructions and tips to help you learn and understand the game.  Subsequent playthroughs, though, are a different story - her dialogue cannot be skipped or turned off, so you will have to suffer through "Pop-Ups: The Game" every single time.  This is annoying if you just want to sit down and replay a few levels casually.\n- There is no option to select your starting level.  Whether you want to challenge yourself by replaying a tricky stage, or whether you are just trying to go for a specific achievement, your only choices are to continue from your last autosave or to completely start over.  Again, this is fine for the first playthrough, but an unlockable freeplay mode would have been appreciated.\n- The achievements are a bear to get.  It took me 1.5 playthroughs to get "Overachiever" because it is partially luck-dependent, and "Quick as a Flash" took 11 angry hours: The first FROG screen does not count toward the achievement because the fairy's dialogue and tutorial eat up so much of your time, so you are left with only three chances per game to earn it (the FROGs for the fire key, the air key, and the water key).  Basically, this means you will need to play through 16 match-3 levels and 4 spot-the-difference puzzles before you even reach the first applicable fractured object screen, and you will be continuously forced to deal with the fairy's "helpfulness."  If you miss the 90-second timeframe on the fire key puzzle, there is no way to just try it again because the game autosaves just AFTER you complete it.  You will either need to restart the game, or hope that you have better luck with the air key.  Regardless, you are looking at another 16 levels and 4 puzzles before getting a second opportunity to win this achievement.\n\nIf there had been either a freeplay mode, or a way to turn off the fairy, I might have given this game a 9.5/10 because the gameplay is solid, and it would have been incredibly replayable.  As is, though, I would have to give it a 6.5/10.","January 1, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a variation on the match 3 genre. There is some nice variety between the four elements but the last two (wind and water) are obviously the most polished.  There are some really nice backgrounds with some animation (like fish swimming in some of the water levels).  The story is minimal but nice although the ending is really anticlimactic.  SPOILER   The intro has voiceover and more than one image but the ending is only a static image and some scrolling text.    After each four levels is a spot the difference game and once for each element there is a hidden object game.  You cannot revisit levels you have already played without starting a new game because there is only the linear story.  Also disappointing is the fact that you cannot scroll around a level and some of the action will happen offscreen at times.\n\nIn summary, this is a casual game in the match 3 genre with some nice polish that slightly outweighs its faults.","May 3, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the levels are based on sheer luck, or force you to just grind to build up your power-ups, which I dislike. There is a time limit on each level, but this is not obvious and not pointed out to you until you're a good ways into the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a different kind of match-three game, you'll have some fun with this.

The game is a variation on the match 3 genre. There is some nice variety between the four elements but the last two (wind and water) are obviously the most polished.  There are some really nice backgrounds with some animation (like fish swimming in some of the water levels).  The story is minimal but nice although the ending is really anticlimactic.  SPOILER   The intro has voiceover and more than one image but the ending is only a static image and some scrolling text.    After each four levels is a spot the difference game and once for each element there is a hidden object game.  You cannot revisit levels you have already played without starting a new game because there is only the linear story.  Also disappointing is the fact that you cannot scroll around a level and some of the action will happen offscreen at times.\n\nIn summary, this is a casual game in the match 3 genre with some nice polish that slightly outweighs its faults.","May 3, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing it, for the most part. It does have its downsides, though. First of all, you can't go back and re-play levels, or select your level at all. You're forced to progress level by level, which I think is a massive oversight in a game like this. Some of the achievements don't seem to work. Some of the levels are based on sheer luck, or force you to just grind to build up your power-ups, which I dislike. There is a time limit on each level, but this is not obvious and not pointed out to you until you're a good ways into the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a different kind of match-three game, you'll have some fun with this.

It's a casual game and starts off pretty easy but does offer a little bit of a challenge near the end of the game. What's great about it is that quick thinking will often get you much farther rather than just mindlessly matching colors and hoping for the best.\n\nThe game only has one mode which is the main campaign but being as long it is (4 books / 64 levels to be exact) you'll find yourself occupied for a good while. That however does negate the game's replay value unless you like going through the same levels again.. the music is great and offers a soothing distraction from the fact that you're being timed on every level.\n\nThe artwork is quite beautiful to say the least which brings me to what I consider the only downside of the game.. that being that there's no option to change the resolution so you either have to play it in a tiny window or fullscreen which works alright but feels a bit stretched out. Other than that, it's a great game which can be enjoyed for quite some time casually.. or if you're obsessed like me; can be played through in 6 hours depending on how skillful or lucky you are. I'll stay quiet this time and leave it to personal opinion whether that's worth the price.","April 27, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had a blast with this one. Get it, love it, uh.. don't have children with it. Unless you like your kids to give you a puzzle to do each and every fricking day....","July 7, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(took me about 12 hours)\n\nPros:\n- Nice artwork and lore;\n- The "find the hidden objects" and "spot the differences" puzzles are great;\n\nCons:\n- No resolution adjustment;\n- Gets really repetitive and boring later on;","July 10, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avatai/recommended/47000/","avatai","AvaTai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avatai/","653 products in account","I'll start with the few bad points: This game can only run in 4:3, which, as an Ultrawide user, means that I can literally do my maths homework in the black space on either side when running fullscreen. Also, no 4:3 resolution has a 1080-pixel height so everything looks aliased because you have to enlarge the textures (again, in fullscreen). The music is rather repetitive. The fairy is as annoying as the one in Zelda. And, I don't like the few non-match 3 elements.\n\nNow, the flip side of those: First, while the game does only run in 4:3, It looks good in 4:3. If you play this in a window, the textures and such look really really good. The music, though repetitive, is very good. If I could buy the soundtrack to this game, I would. The fairy can be made slightly less annoying by turning off her 'new item' tips. And, while I don't like hidden object and point-and-click games, this game integrates them very well and they are few, short, and far between.\n\nAnd finally, the good: This is one of the best match-3 games I've ever played. The animations are amazing, the mechanics work very well, the auto-panning camera works very well, there is a good story (not much of one, but still), and it's not too hard. Oh and on my system (4.5GHz 4690k, 2 1450MHz 970s, 16GB 2133MHz RAM, running off two HDDs in RAID0) it runs at around 4,000 fps, which is nice.","June 25, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course this game is basically 3 match with a added story.\n\nThe story is basically pointless because you just follow the matching madness. The acheivements are easy to get and the game itself is not complecated.\n\nWhy would I recommend it? Because its great for those causal gamers out there and its also great for people with a knack for puzzles.\n\n10/10","June 28, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
