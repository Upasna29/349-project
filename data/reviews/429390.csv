It's still a fun core game, but the glitches and game issues make it too frustrating. This game is hard, and requires every resource to be used effectively. If you can't use something because of a game glitch, it pretty much kills the enjoyment.\n\nSo the game itself is great. I'm a veteran of tabletop and electronic card games of a similar nature, although I never played the tabletop version of Xenoshyft. The mechanics were easy to understand and pick up, and the card selection and balance seemed fine.\n\nThe reason I'm currently not recommending this game is due to the myriad game breaking bugs that we found in only about 4 hours of gameplay. After a patch or update, I will gladly re-review this game.\n\nWe had the following happen:\n\n* Milita couldn't be played to an empty space on the board. When I discarded him at the end of the round, it also discarded a surviving stormtrooper. This can be a pretty huge swing in a game like this. Our assumption is that some sort of internal "card ID" got mixed up, and the game though the stormtrooper and the militia were the same card.\n* To go along with the game getting confused, playing with one of the expansion powers (Grafting Lab), the tier 2 ability lets you bring back a card from the discard pile into your hand. It was a crapshoot what would happen when I would use the ability. Sometimes I would get 1 card, sometimes I would get all of the cards, and at least 2 or 3 times my TEAMMATE got the cards. This did not adversely effect the game since he could play on my cards, but bizarre nonetheless\n* We had tons of bizarre issues playing cards on other people's lanes. On death effects like the vindicator armor weren't usable if they were played on another lane. We also had troops discarded at the end of combat we had placed in another player's lane for no discenible reason.\n* The biggest, and gamebreaking-est of them all happened to us twice. We were in the 7th or 8th wave, and while we had both clicked done on a reveal phase (2 green check marks), the game wouldn't advance us to to the draw phase. We tried several things to 'jump start it', like both unchecking, one person leaving the game. It just wouldn't go forward. Very very frustrating after spending 30 minutes working towards the finale.\n\nThe UI is serviceable, but could use some help\n* Why is your resource (Xenostathem) not indicated with the icon instead of the text. Pretty minor, but they have pretty icons for everything, I had to literally ask my buddy in the first game where on the screen my total resources were.\n* Should give you a checkbox for 'auto pass' if you don't have anything else you can do in a turn, or if you and your teammates know you won't have much impact on their lane.\n* I was constantly double clicking when I should be single clicking to use abilities, and it could be confusing what state you were in. The text seemed to blend into the background a lot. I wouldn't mind some more highlighting around the 'Done' button, or other text that tells you you need to do something before you continue.","April 1","false","14.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","1"

After playing (at this point) four-five hours, I haven't won a single match even on the easiest difficulty and even when I was playing with two friends we failed countless times. However, the challenge makes it much more fun and honestly semi-addicting. The closer you get to success, the more you want to try again - and that's what led me to play from midnight to 4:30 am (only to stop because our play was getting sloppy due to exhaustion at that point).\n\nWe have encountered a bug or two like a card being unable to be played, and one time the game froze. However this game just came out so likely those bugs will get patched, and even if I had prior knowledge of the bugs before getting this game I would get it all over again. It's cheap, it has a good working online system, and it's not hard to learn.","March 30","true","7.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","2"

Depending on your threshold for glitches. Other reviews are right about there being some annoying mutliplayer glitches, but we didn't run into any show stoppers. We felt the game was still worth playing despite the occasional bug, but obvious some players will understandable hate it and refuse to play.\n\nThis isn't a detailed review of the game, but it seemed important to get the state of multiplayer out there ASAP.","April 4","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only thing you can change is whether you want to play in windowed mode or fullscreen, selectable only before you start the game in what appears to be the default Unity popup, Playing in fullscreen results in a square shaped view area with nothing using the left and right sides of your monitor. UI that could be placed in this area is instead crammed in the top and bottom of the screen, which means you have to pan around constantly, even when zoomed out.\n\nSpeaking of zooming, it's incredibly slow and requires several full mousewheel turns to get close to the cards. I thought adjusting the zoom sensitivity setting in the options would alleviate this, but it barely made a difference. I have a Logitech mouse with a free-spinning toggle on the wheel that's useful when you're reading documents with many pages. Scrolling up 40 pages or so this way takes a few seconds. It takes about the same amount of time just to zoom in this way in XenoShyft.\n\nWhen you want to pan, you have to click an area outside of the playing field and drag the view (the way you would do it on a touchscreen with your finger). If you click on some cards this way, it will instead show you a zoomed in view of the card. But it won't do this on some other cards (like generic Militia cards).\n\nI could have dealt with all of that, annoying as it is, but the real dealbreaker is that sometimes pieces of the UI do not respond, breaking the game by not allowing you to advance to the next phase of the game.\n\nThe game was clearly ported from a mobile version and it shows all over the product from the nonexistent resolution options, to the unresponsive and cluttered UI, to the awkward panning and zooming controls.\n\nThe tutorial does a good job at teaching you the rules of the game, but is done through a slow and annoying "AI" voice that reads to you and cannot be disabled. At least I know how to play if I decide to purchase the physical card game.\n\nIt's a shame because the underlying game seems fun. As it currently stands, I can't recommend it until the developers fix a lot of these issues, which really seems like they'd have to redo a large part of the game.","May 1","false","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In addition most of the enemy abilities are ZERO fun as they are overpowered to the point that ANY strategy you come up with quickly be nullified without ANY recourse.   Literally they have cards that can kill any soldier with 1 hit no matter what you do.  It is a poorly designed and programmed game.

Where the significant issues come to light is when you get further into wave 2 and then ultimately wave 3.  I am all for difficulty and a challenge that requires strategy, however, after playing several times you quickly realize that strategy becomes nullified.  How does the game nullify the initial strategy? The enemies becomes so all powerful in wave 3 that their special effects (reveal) consider near all strategies you may have.  Essentially the game becomes a roll of the die of cards drawn (especially the money you need) OR a game of chance hoping that your cards line up perfectly in comparison to the enemies.  This means there is no strategy, just a game of puckering your a$$hole up and praying you have enough money, purchased the correct cards in a given round and then pray you don't run into most of the wave 3 enemies that deal damage first, burn you and then r@pe you after you are dead.  Good luck.  Rethink the purchase.\nI.E. The actual game is buggy during gameplay that may result in premature game over.  So basically, it's a game within a game.  Will you even be able to finish without a bug?  Good luck again.","April 11","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The deckbuilding game itself was the result of a successful Kickstarter, raising a touch over $242,000.\n\nThe deckbuilder is a tough as nails cooperative romp that has been overall well received, currently holding a rating of 7.21 on BGG. All of that being said I do feel this is a game better played in it's physical form. There's just something about the drawing of cards and having friends around that can't be beat by a digital game. Though that's true of all board games I suppose. It is a pretty solid port, a few odd card interaction mechanics aside. Hence I'd have to recommend it if you're interested in the game. This is a far less expensive way to get it anyway as the board game costs 5x as much for just the base game without expansions.","March 30","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
