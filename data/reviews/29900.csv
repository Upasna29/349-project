A good idea that's been hammered and melded and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized by the publisher to resemble the games that were all the rage in 2007. The cover based third person shooter. The modern military shooter. More zombies yay.\n\nThe thing is the concept alone was enough to bring this on a slightly higher level. It's a ♥♥♥♥ port, so that brings it back down.\n\nStill, if you play and enjoy warframe, this should shed some light on quite a few things. After all, Warframe is the game Digital Extremes were trying to make when they made this one. I personally LOVE warframe, so seeing little recognizable things here and there keep me playing. It's--It's kinda like the videogame equivalent of Agents of Shield. It's the content you go to the movies for, but filered through layers upon layers of bureaucracy and rushed out the door... But the chunks of the cool stuff the creators wanted to create make the whole thing a bit more special.\n\nWhat's the moral of the story? Publishers ruin everything.\n\ntl;dr: If you like Warframe, play it. If you like Gears of War, play it. If you have a soft spot for the early last gen titles of 2007, which was arguably the golden year of that gen, give this a shot. If you're not tied to any of these, this game will do absolutely nothing for you.","April 7, 2014","true","1.8"," 78 of 83 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","78","83","3","1"

It's not that is bad or anything. It's fun, but it could have been so much more than it is. The things that made this game "fail":\n1-It tried to fit itself within the fads of it's time (AKA feel like a Gears of War knock-off) rather than try to have it's own thing.\n2-The upgrade and weapon marketing system it's just there to make you look for bonus items and money, making the campaign a bit longer (hint: play the game only using the single handed guns, it plays waaay better)\n3-Fighting the soldiers is more interesting than fighting the mutants, but in most of the time, you fight the mutants.\n4-The campaing was too short (especially if you ignore the bonus hunting).\n5-The story is a mess of events and characthers that you don't see most of it. Who is Yago, what's the beef with Nadia, what I did in the past that was so horrible and haunts me to this day? none of these are answered.\nBut, I still recommend it: tons o' fun, each single handed weapon (the pistol, the sub-machinegun, the revolver and the sawed-off shotgun) complety changes the way you aproach a level, and at many times, you'll feel like a boss when completing a mission. In short: this game coulda been awesome, but it's just... good.","November 26, 2013","true","29.0"," 59 of 64 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","59","64","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/29900/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Dark Sector is a game clearly designed for console play (xbox 360) which means a few things: The graphics are good, simplified controls, and checkpoint style saving. The gameplay is actually very much like Resident Evil 5 & 6. The first thing you should do is make a modification to the games config file DS.cfg and insert the line below (if you have a 16:9 resolution monitor):\n\nGraphics.DisplayAspectRatio=FullScreen4x3\n\nThe game was messed up in converting to Windows and the 4x3 is actually 16:9. If you don’t make this change the screen resolution will stretch weirdly, and cut things off at the edges, unless you keep the resolution at 800x600.\n\nThe game’s story is not fully explained, kind of like starting to watch a movie halfway through.  You play Hayden Tenno, some kind of international secret agent sent to the former Soviet country of Lasria to find and stop an evil guy (scientist?) named Mezner. Apparently Mezner is trying to spread a virus that converts people into mindless zombies and eventually mutates them into armored creatures. Unfortunately for you (or maybe fortunately) you get infected pretty early on and have access to a kind of drug that slows the infection while still keeping you from going insane like the other zombies. The virus still gives you powers though, such as a throwing glaive that pops up out of nowhere, and the ability to absorb the powers of some of the boss mutants you fight.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the game is very similar to the later Resident Evil games. For example it’s a third person “over the shoulder” view and the default movement is walking. You need to hold a sprint button to run, and hold a button to “prepare” your gun for firing. There are a number of weapons in the game which you can pick up from fallen (human) enemies but they all have an electronic device that disables the gun after about 15 seconds. That means you need to find another gun or stick to your personal pistol + glaive. The glaive is a large spiked throwing star (like the Predator throwing weapon in Alien vs. Predator) that you throw at enemies and flies back to your hand. It can be pretty powerful, killing most human enemies in one shot if you charge it up. It’s also used for various puzzle solving since it can pick up “elements” such as fire, lightning, and ice. Most of the puzzles are pretty obvious once you recognize what’s needed, but your first playthrough you might think you’re stuck a few times. The game doesn’t have a map or objective tracker so if you somehow get turned around, you might not know you’re going in the wrong direction.\n\nRegarding the firearms in the game, you can actually buy permanent weapons from an underground black market arms dealer. These guns have no automatic disable lock and can be upgraded with “kits” that you find as collectibles throughout the game. These kits are one time use and do specific upgrades such as increase damage, fire speed, or clip size. You also find rubles (money) throughout the game and use it for your gun purchases. Bear in mind that both the rubles and the upgrade kits are limited. You will only get enough to buy 2-3 guns even if you know exactly where all the money is in the game. You’ll probably find more upgrade kits than you’ll ever use though (guns can only be upgraded a few times), just make sure you find the ones you want (damage and fire speed!). Side note here, the gun turrets that you can commandeer at various points in the game are practically useless. In most games when you jump on a mounted gun, you can kick some ♥♥♥ until you need to move on. I don’t know if it’s because the damage is low or if it’s just wildly inaccurate (old style iron sight), but when you’re using one of these turrets, it takes like 20 seconds of spraying to kill anything. When the enemies use it, they can kill you in a couple seconds if you don’t get to cover. And yes, I did try using short bursts instead of just holding down the fire button.\n\nIf you’ve tried the Free to play game Warframe, you may recognize the hero’s name Tenno and the design of the armored creature that he’s slowly transforming into. The same game developer created both games so you can kind of think of Warframe as the distant future of Dark Sector.\n\nPros:\n+Interesting glaive weapon is used throughout the entire game even though it doesn’t really get “stronger.” Not overpowered, and not too weak. The various elements can look pretty cool, like throwing a flaming glaive will catch your victims in a fiery explosion.\n+I enjoy horror games with hordes of zombies and interesting boss mutants. The bosses have weaknesses that you need to learn and exploit. You can’t just fire all your bullets at them. There is no difficulty setting in the game, and it can get pretty challenging at certain portions near the end.\n\nCons:\n-This is one of those games which can give you a headache visually the first few times you play it. This may have something to do with the dark (almost black & white) game environment, and the slow movement speed (when you sprint, the environment kind of blurs a little around you).\n-Despite the fact that you can pick up guns from dead guys, there really aren’t that many kinds of guns. And the limited money you have means you will probably need to save up for a while to buy the “best” gun. That means you’re stuck with pistol + glaive for most of the game. If you just buy the first guns available, you’ll be missing out.\n-The game can be kind of buggy. If I alt+tab out, I have trouble getting back into the game window. There are a couple times you get into a power armor/walker and the button to exit doesn’t work. Not sure what’s going on there. Also, the game’s visual resolution setting I mentioned at the start really should have been fixed in a patch.\n\nI would recommend a controller to play the game, except that when you’re using a gun, aim is very important and I have poor control using my xbox controller. Even with my mouse, I miss a lot when shooting at distant enemies. There is only one sniper rifle in the game, and it’s the only gun where your aim drifts around when you’re looking through the scope (for realism). I don’t know who thought that was a good idea. Overall though, I’d say give this game a try if you got it in one of the Bundle Stars bundles a few months back.  It’s not horrible but there’s definitely room for improvement. The game takes about 7 hours to complete.\n","October 17, 2014","true","6.4"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

The graphics, in my opinion, were relatively good, not very bad, though I tend not to be able to judge graphics very well, so, take that as you will. The enemy AI was relatively simple, typically they would just use cover, some would throw a grenade, some had shields and machetes so they would charge you, the AI overall wasnt too special, but not too bad in my opinion. The boss fights were all pretty simple, but still somewhat challenging, again, not too special, but not too bad. I found the glaive to be a fun and useful weapon throughout the entire game, being able to steer it mid-flight, throw it through fire, ice, or electricity to give it that element, and then explode that element if you wanted, and time your throws to do a power-throw, which did quadruple damage. The enemies were usually easy to deal with, except near the middle and end of the game, where there were a lot of them, doing a lot of damage, and taking a lot of damage. Though there were some problems with the resolution, which can be fixed through editing in the game's data, and a lot of issues with the controls, in some cases not even telling you how to exit a certain vehicle, *The key is X, by the way.* I still enjoyed this game overall. I got this game because of my interest in Warframe, and if you are interested in Warframe, or are just interested in Dark Sector itself, I recommend getting this game.","December 11, 2013","true","8.8"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

With multiple posts in the discussion about ways to fix graphical issues. I still could not manage to calibrate this game to my exact monitor resolution and ended up having to run the game way below my specs.\n\nNone the less! As a game Dark Sector can be really fun. As you progress through the game you will unlock more weapons, get to ride four legged tanks, acquire more elements for your glaive (blade boomerang), and go from having just your arm infected to having a full blown exo suit! The storyline can be mildly forgettable (Big Bad Guy who wants all the power) but the game makes up for it with it's dark atmosphere, crisp power suit design, and responsive combat situations. Now I don't know about picking up the game at full price as there are a lot of other games out there with far more modern features on them. Though when the next sale comes around and the game drops down to 50% off. I highly suggest you purchase it as it is a fun little time waster and the combat system and lore within helped pave the way towards "Warframe" which is one of the top played games on Steam.","January 5","true","9.2"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","1"

Essentially what I'm trying to say is, I loved the game, but even for those who may not like it for who knows what reason,(aftr reading a few other reviews seems like some didn't think too highly of the storyline,) you may enjoy it if you're a Warframe player just because you get to see origins of the frames and you can also see how the game of Dark Sector evolved into Warframe.","July 7, 2015","true","12.3"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","28","35","6","0"

Too bad I just recently played this game.\nWell I didn't know anything about the game except the old trailers about a guy in a suit sabotaging a space station. Then they didn't annouce PC version just console one and I didn't bother to look after the game. Few weeks ago I played it and here's my opinion!\nSo the game changed so much since the old 2004 trailer but it's still a lot of fun. At first I didn't know what is this all about. Looked like a Metal Gear game but later it turned out to be a Resident Evil game. Especially simmilar to RE4. It's a standard 3rd person shooter game with over the shoulder view. The gameplay changes when you get the Technocyte virus and you gain access to the Glave. The Glave is a powerfull all purpose weapon you can throw and melee with. You can throw it into fire, ice barrels and electric boxes to steal thir effect. So you can electrocute,freeze, and ignite enemies. These elemental effects are also play big part in puzzles.\nYou have a pistol at first and a secoday weapon which you can pick up from fallen enemies. Later in the game you can find upgrade packs like +accuracy, +punch, double fire and so on. These upgrades are cool but you have limited slots for your weapons. The bad thing is that you can't buff your Glave and most of the time you only use the Glave not the secondaries. So my suggestion is to buy stuff for your pistols.\nThe enemy variaty is wide. You fight agains regular soldiers, shield guards, heavy soldiers and a large selection of infested citizens and soldiers.\nThe only big problem I have is the movement. It is really stiff. You can't jump, crouch and you can't turn or strafe while sprinting. Also the levels are stuffed with invisible walls and there are not many secrets. Other problem is the melee system. you can't move while doing it and you have to wait 'til the animation is finished. Also there is only one execution move / enemy. Also a little problem that you have one button for many things like melee/vault/action...\nSo yeah it's clearly a console game ported to the PC but at least we have it. The game lasts like 6 or 7 hours and has a lot of great moments. I recommend it when it's on sale.\n\nPros:\nHorror Scifi elements\nThe wepons are cool and the Glave has solid mechanics\nStory is good but not rly original\nChallenging situations\nWide enemy varietyCons:\nStaight console port\nClunky controlls\nLimited movement\nSome minor bugs\nInvisible walls","July 26, 2014","true","9.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

If you are a fan of Resident Evil 4 or 5, or a fan of Dead Space, then you will enjoy this game. Although it is a little rough around the edges, Dark Sector is a gem that is severely underrated.\n\nGameplay: The game plays like other third-person shooters. It is cover based, so you will spend most of the game with your back against a chest-high wall while bullets fly all over the place. The weapons are pretty standard fare; you have some pistols, submachine guns, and some assault rifles. As you progress, you can find upgrades hidden throughout the levels that will let you augment your weapons at the black market dealer, as well as purchase entirely new ones. The most unique feature of this game is the Glaive, which is more or less a frisbee made out of sharp blades. You gain access to it after the tutorial level, and throughout the game you will gain new abilities, such as guiding it in flight or having it conduct electricity or fire. Guiding the Glaive through the air and slicing into enemies is very, VERY rewarding. Boss fights often center around using the Glaive to exploit a weakness of your enemy. Also, the Glaive can be used to pick up enemy weapons and ammunition from a distance, which is rather nice. As far as exploration goes, the game is very linear, with some puzzle solving here and there.\n\nStory: The story for this game is average, nothing out of the ordinary. You play as Hayden, a special agent who becomes infected with a virus that changes him into....well, you get the point, right? Your infection grants you superhuman abilities, and the Glaive as well. Aside from that, it's a decent storyline that gets the job done.\n\nGraphics: This game looks rather nice, maybe a little dated now, though. The enemies look good, and the envirnments are rather appeasing as well.\n\nOverall, this game is well worth the money. At only $10, it's a steal. If it goes on sale, then you should definitely think about purchasing it. However, you don't have to wait until it's on sale to buy it. If you want a game that is in the same field as games like Resident Evil, or Gears of War, then look no further. It also doesn't just copy and paste those games, but rather it goes in it's own direction.","February 15, 2014","true","12.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It's what defines this game as BADASS! As you progress, you get more and more powers involving your infection and some of them are for the glaive, you can throw the glaive around and control it in mid air to slice your enemies more precisely when it comes to the limbs and hear their screams of agony! You can also apply elements to it like fire, electricity and ice for some really satisfying results. While the special powers are cool, the guns themselves aren't particulary great, except for the shotgun and the revolver. Oh, and the boss fights are really good altought there are some that have attacks with insta-kills, which makes the fights a whole lot more intense but at times quite frustrating.

In it, you play as a military spy named Hayden Tenno who travels to russia to stop the spread of an infection that a bioterrorist is spreading and ends up infected himself. Due to a mental conidition, he feels no pain from the disease and doesn't turn into a crazed monster like other victims. His arm also spawns him a glaive, a weapon you'll probably be using a lot in the game no doubt. As Hayden progresses, his mutation advances and he gains new powers.\n\ngameplay. The gameplay is pretty fun and the storyline makes even more so. While the story doesn't affect gameplay, the plot is at least detailed.  as for the gameplay itself, it can be tiresome and frustrating from time to time. Often, you'll end up taking cover behind objects to avoid enemy fire while they do the same. Often, this results in long tedious fire fights. Thankfully, you can sometimes kill them faster by using your glaive and aiming at them carefully. There is one enemy that makes fire fights difficult and it's a melee solider with a riot shield. They'll come to you while you're behind cover which often forces you to fight back. Here, the only way to break their cover is to either run behind them or hit their shield with the glaive and shoot them while their stunned. This can get a little frustrating at times.\n\nAs mentioned eariler, the Glaive plays a major role in combat. The Glaive can be thrown to slice off enemy body parts and limbs, used as a regular melee weapon (not exactly the best decision IMO.) or used for a finisher when enemies are stunned (they'll glow red) This violence caused the game to get banned in Australia actually. Eventually, you'll be able to aquire other abilities, such as covering your glaive in fire, ice, or electricity for additional damage and stun properties.\n\nThe game also has a variety of guns but you'll need to pick up money found throughout the game to purchase them. This is another flaw with the game. Since there's only a set amount of money in the game, it will take a while to be able to purchase anything and you'll never be able to purchase everything. The Glaive can be used to pick up fallen enemy guns (as well as other objects in some cases) and use them for a short time (they have sensors that indicate if someone infected is using them or not and stop functioning after a few seconds.). This can prove useful in log fire fights. The enemies and monsters/infected are varied and each one fights a little different. Soldiers will throw inferon gas at you which is dangerous since you're infected. The infected range from using clubs to throwing projectiles at you. The bosses are big and each one has a different strategy to take down.\n\nThe thing that hurts the game is that it came out during a time when other third person shooters hit the scene causing it to lose some attention and causing some to classify it as a "clone". It had to compete with Resident Evil 4 as well as the Gears of War game of the time.\n\nGraphics. They look good and they're not too hardware intensive even at 1280x720 res with all settings enabled on my computer, I can get a decent FPS most of the time. Like most newer games, the graphics use post processing. The environments are also pretty dark and mysterious as well most of the time.\n\nSound. The sound is pretty cool. The Soliders will yell at you when they see you and scream in pain when you slice a limb off. The infected will make a variety of groaning and hissing noises which can be a little creepy at times. The music ranges from creepy to stealthy James Bond style music. It really depends upon what's going on in the current chapter at the time.\n\noverall: 7/10. Due to flaws with money and and certain gameplay aspects, it's not perfect but not bad either. There isn't a whole lot of replay value as unfortunately, you don't get to restart the game with your powers and weapons but replaying can be enjoyable enough. The game was made by Digital Extremes Ltd, the people that made the ftp game Warframe (also here on steam.) Warframe is considered by many to be a sequel, due to the numerous references to Dark Sector and the faction the player's in being called "Tenno" in honor of the first tenno. (which the devs said was Hayden).  Worth picking up if you enjoy warframe. The price is fair and cheap as well. 9.99 for the game.","July 5, 2014","true","41.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It wasn't perfect, but it was very unjoyable.\n\nThe Positives: The story is nice, the gameplay was interesting, the sound design was pretty good, and the way your character developes was handled well. On top of that, several of the enemy types were interesting cosmetically.\n\nThe Meh: The controls were a little wonky, but not bad. There were some glitches and oddities, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nThe Negatives: Sense of direction wasn't always clear, I got lost at times. Also, the gunplay wasn't very reliable. I usually had to rely on the Glaive (melee/thrown weapon you get early on), and only found the semi-auto weapons to be good with ammo conservation. Also, the boss fights were kind of weak because all you have to do is repeat a few steps to kill them.\n\nFinal thoughts: It's worth playing through. It's fun once you get used to the controls, and is great if you're interested into where the Tenno (from Warframe) began. That being said, I'm amazed that very few things from this game made it over into Warframe!  There are several things that I wish would be added to Warframe from Dark Sector in a future update!\n\nRating: 7.5/10","March 14","true","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

The Graphics are smooth, dark and well balanced with visual effects. This is indeed the offical (not offically confirmed but lets be real) prequel to Warframe and its visuals, lore, and general gameplay (more or less minus the healthy obession with a glaive). Id reccomend it to anyone thats a hardy fan of 3rd person shooters with some thought required to play it.

All that aside, I really like the game.\n\nThe glaive is hilariously good as an unlimited-use ranged weapon. The fact that gun pickups last 30-odd seconds before blowing up in your hands and if you like it you need to go buy one is kinda ingenious.\n\nGiven how little cash there is scattered throughout the game world, you have to pick and choose what weapon upgrades you get. Do you want damage? Increased clip size? Explosive rounds?\n\nThis (in addition to the linear fashion of the game mentioned earlier) actually contributes to replay value, as you can go back again and find all kinds of stuff you missed the first time and use completely different weapon builds.\n\nThe story's fun, a bit dark, and has twists to it that are actually done in a manner where a second playthrough makes you say "How did I not see that before?"

The plot is forgettable and much like the time warp, this gimmick also wears out fast. However, the mindless killing and badass glaive kills made me stick with this game until the credits.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game with little depth but loads of fun, this is it.

Mostly unoriginal, heavily inspired by Half Life 2, originally made for consoles, looks like another victim of publishers. It's fun to play, but has clunky keyboard/mouse controls and a not very entertaining take on combat challenges. I had to play it in god mode (cheat engine) because of the controls, and I enjoyed it. No regrets for money spent. I suspect that originally the story events took place in Poland, or Romania, or Hungary, and later they hastily changed it to Russia, to please the publishers. Because there's nothing Russian there except for Google-translated labels on crates. Sometimes I'd get stuck, not knowing where to go, which was actually a breathe of fresh air after all these modern games that tend to hold your hand and drag you along the script. The story makes an impression of something made up in a hurry, but while being nothing special it isn't insulting either. I like how it drops you in the middle of some action and you're figuring out what it all means. Also I like how you are forced to think and come up with some ideas when you're dealing with bosses - it's not just shooting it X times to kill it. It even has some economy, you can buy guns and upgrade them. It felt a bit short, but then again - it would have gotten really boring, be it any longer. Keeping all that in mind, you're welcome to give it a go, especially if it's on a sale. A sequel with better controls and updated graphics would be not a bad idea. Throwing this glaive was quite fun, especially when charging it with elements.","March 11","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game suffers from an identity crisis of trying to be Gears of War and Resident Evil 4. Although it more closely resembles RE4. The glaive turns out to be more than a mere gimmick as it cuts down swathes of soldiers and mutants alike. It can be used in conjunction with your side arm as well, making for some satisfying fire fights. In addition the character animations are note worthy.  When Hayden vaults realistically over obstacles, or when you trigger a stealth kill it looks gorgeous. Speaking of looking gorgeous, this game is a true looker. Whether you're fighting enemies on a harbor, or traversing puzzle ridden graveyards, Dark Sector looks brilliant. Depite all that it does right Dark Sector still has flaws. The story is muddled, things get repetitive toward the end, and the upgrade system needs to be more accessible. However the $10 price tag makes this a steal.

The environment is great and lively overall; some of your enemies seem outright ready to ♥♥♥♥ themselves when you approach. It supplies some very tense moments that, even though you are the first Tenno (Warframe players know that this means a beast of a person that can take out hordes of enemies...), for at least the beginning of the game - You will feel like the small fish in the pond next to some of the enemies. It's a fun challenge that set me often muttering "No no... Don't tell me I have to fight that.. I ain't ready for it." Just look around for items that will help you. It's not always well shown. There are some problem solving elements you need to work out as well,  but as noted in the bad, it's not always well directed that you're supposed to do things, you have to figure it out on your own.\n\nThe bad; it is a port from the Xbox 360 and the controls reflect this, lacking a lot of tuning that the PC release needed - Prepare for sloppy controls that take a lot to get the hang of. It seems to be missing a minimap feature or any sort of guidance at all... Though some classic gamers may feel this is how things used to be, but I spent thirty minutes sculking around a dead end only to discover I was supposed to figure out I had to something for another five on a hunch that 'this may be it...'. The mod system is interesting but like many - You can't remove the mods. There is no explaination toward it and to be fair some mods would be great to allocate elsewhere after learning this early in the game.\n\nIn all, worth a play at least if you can get around the controls and don't mind figuring out exactly what you need to do on your own.","December 25, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For such game released in 2009, it has really done bad in both graph and gameplay. For example, when you are running, you just can't turn with mouse, really hard to operate.\n\nThe glaive and the element system is a good try as it was introduced then in warframe, called damage 2.0. The glaive is used to solve most of the mistery and kill bosses, sometomes boring though.\n\nMeet the prototype of Excalibur and NYX, also a boss called jackal are fun, you can see how they evolved these years.\n\nIn general, a good game without detailed enough designation, a fan game, I hope DE would give us a better SP game with this universe but a better experience like warframe","March 25","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can also find upgrades throughout the level that you can customize your weapon of choice.\n\n+ The boss battle are somewhat interesting only because the rest of the game is so repetitive in its design.\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThis game looks bland both artistically and technically.  Each level looks and feels the same with very little variety between them.  Textures seem washed out, characters are not very well detailed and the levels look very uninspired.\n\nThe story is mostly told in between levels. The story is very forgettable, characters are one dimensional and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. The main character is boring and uninteresting. The story feels like it was created after the game was made as an excuse to kill things.\n\nThe level design suffers from 'corridor shooter syndrome', you go through linear hallways until you get to a wide open area where you proceed to kill the enemies and then proceed to the next wide open area...over and over and over again.\n\nThe gameplay and combat only make matters worse, there is nothing wrong with it on a technical level, everything controls smoothly but the combat scenarios change very little throughout the entire game. Nothing interesting happens in combat. The main premise of the game is that you get a glaive that you can use on your enemies and solve puzzles. The glaive is fun to use and it does feel satisfying to decapitate your enemies. As you progress the glaive gets upgraded making it more powerful and useful to use in combat.  However you can only carry one sidearm and one two handed weapon thus your strategy in each combat encounter changes very little.\n\nTo make matters worse enemy variety is also lacking. For the majority of the game you will face only two types of enemies, those that shoot at you and those that rush you. Every once in a while you face a third type of enemy that actually requires some strategy to take down, the problem is, these are introduced late game and are so few and far between it makes little difference in the end.\n\nConclusion;\n\nEverything about this game is average. It does everything right on a technical level but it feels so repetitive to play because there is little to no variety in the environment, enemies or combat scenarios.  Getting this game on discount is the only way you will get your money's worth here.","March 11, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Pick it up in a bundle or at 90% off.\n\nPros:\n- Looks pretty nice\n- Has some fun spots\n\nCons:\n- No cover system. In a shooter. Oh the enemies can take cover, just not you. You can't even crouch.\n- You don't really need a cover system anyway, because enemies are dumb as bricks.\n- You have to manually fix the widescreen resolution in the config file or the game warps it. I'm pretty sure widescreen monitors existed in 2009.\n- Everything is bulletproof. Just stand behind a tent if you're getting shot at.\n- The powers suck for the most part, and the game forces you to use them by taking away most of your guns. The pistol you get to keep is still better than the powers. The best thing about the powers is picking up dead enemies' guns so you don't have to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ powers anymore.\n- The story suffers from the eight deadly words of writing: I don't care what happens to these people.\n- You have no context for anything, and the protagonist is a whiner. See the eight deadly words above.\n\nAnd yet I still somehow recommend it. There is fun to be had - just don't pay full price for it.","April 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

The "plot twist" was expected, I'm not even sure if it was meant to be a plot twist or not.\n\nThe gameplay feels fun and unique at the start of the game, but the more you play the more boring it gets. The sprint system is awful, the turning sensitivity while sprinting is so slow that there really is no point in even attempting to sprint.\n\nThe story is slightly cliche and like stated earlier, cheesy, there is an infection and for some reason your character isn't killed or turned crazy (there might be an explanation that I didn't catch though, if there is can someone please tell me in the comments)\n\nThe same enemies come back over and over again and this wouldn't be too big of a deal if it wasn't for the fact that they are so boring to fight. Get into cover, wait till they stop shooting, peak out press and hold c, release, almost kill, press c again (or run up and do a finisher), dead.\n\nLevel design was pretty good and has a very different feel from any other game I've played, sometimes I would get confused about where to go which wasn't really a bad thing. The way the enemies pop out in the levels is same old, there is a door and the enemies magically pop up infront of the door.\n\nAnd for people who are here because of Warframe, just know this doesn't exactly explain the lore of Warframe like I thought it would. It shows how the entire thing started but not much more.\n\nTl;dr just watch a gameplay on Youtube, the game is very boring to play through and doesn't explain much about Warframe (for people who came to understand the lore of Warframe)","January 2","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallytoltage/recommended/29900/","totallytoltage","Toltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallytoltage/","259 products in account","As a fan of Warframe, I decided to take a look at Dark Sector, the supposed prequel to the Warframe lore. However while this game may have that within, I couldn't be bothered to go beyond chapter 4.\n\nAt first I couldn't even load up the game properly, it would just futz around like a fish out of water trying to display in the right resolution. It wasn't until I found a guide on Steam as to how to properly config the game before startup, which revealed to me how laughably bad this port was.\n\nAs for the gameplay, being a product of the cover-shooting era of gaming, that is literally all the game is: find convenient waist-high cover to plop behind and just start shooting or throwing your glaive. Obviously none of the high-speed acrobatics that Warframe is known for, but Dark Sector just plays super slow in general. Sprinting feels bad, rolling feels bad, melee combat feels bad, and Hayden has the frailty of a wet sheet of paper. The only thing that really felt good was pulling off insta-killing power throws with the glaive. And even then I got to a point where I realized that the glaive was the end all be all weapon at mid-to-close range, so guns became almost silly to use.\n\nOverall, I just feel like this game has been a victim of bad aging; gunplay is super clunky and unsatisfying, unlike things like Warframe that are super quick and at least somewhat responsive. Then again, that could also be me being used to Warframe and expecting something closer to that. Either way, I didn't enjoy my time with Dark Sector. But if you've got some interest in some Warframe backstory, it's on sale, and you think you can deal with slower cover-based shooting, definitely pick it up and try it out. Otherwise stay far away from this one.","January 2","false","1.7"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It is locked to a 4:3 resolution, anything other than this will break the game, it had massive frame rate issues, a lot of controls are bound to the same keys, glitches left right and center and the menus are frustrating to use due to half mouse half button combination that messes both up.\n\nThe concept for the game is pretty solid but the execution is very lacking. The Glaive is fun to use at first but then it just becomes another dull part to a dull game. The setting should be interesting but I found myself not caring. The enemies are bullet sponges and no fun to fight. The weapons are shoddy and annoying to use and finally the story, what story.\n\nIf the idea of the main weapon interests you play the first half but don’t bother finishing it, most of the game is just boring and frustrating leading to no pay off.\n\nHave fun? ^_^","May 6, 2014","false","11.6"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Despite playing as an elite military operative, you are completely unable to reliably hit targets at 10 feet with any weapon. This incredible inaccuracy makes Dark Sector one of the most annoyingly dull games I've ever played, a problem that is only compounded by the fact that the enemies become more bullet-spongier as the game progresses.\n\nThe story makes no sense and the promise of turning into a resident evil style bio-weapon Ninja is cut short by the fact that, rather than undergoing a full body mutation as the game makes you believe, the ninja shown in the trailers is just the protagonist in a weird ninja suit. Furthermore, this ninja suit doesn't actually do anything. You can't take more damage, you don't do more damage, you don't move faster, the invisibility skill is obtained on route to pick up the suit..\n\nThe only thing it really changes is that you're able to pick up miniguns dropped mech-suit enemies. Considering the reason you go to get the suit in the first place is to defeat another weird ninja suit guy and that fight doesn't involve a minigun the whole thing just feels ♥♥♥♥ing pointless and dumb; which more or less sums up the whole game.\n\nYou'd be better off playing Warframe, the spiritual successor to Dark Sector, and is actually half decent if incredibly grindy.","October 11, 2013","false","7.0"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

At all. I played a long way into it, until the invisible boss you fight in the water, and it was such a horrible boss fight that it was, combined with the rest of this games awfulness, just the last straw. This game, just like Velvet Assassin, is one of the most terribly generic games I have ever seen. Your guy is a p-ssy and can only take a few hits but you do get a magic shield that you can activate but it only blocks things from the direct front. You get to carry two weapons and get a special power blade you can throw that comes back to you but it completely ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, one of the worst weapons I've ever seen in a game. The levels are extremely linear and the graphics are horrible. It has decent gunplay though. Use guns whenever you can, although ammo is scarce and most of the time I was forced to use the truly God awful blade weapon. However I did find a ammo glitch around chapter seven. Well maybe not a glitch, but I sold my AK and bought a shotgun and it came with 184 ammo which is a lot. I was so thankful when it happened because like I said, the blade sucks real bad as a weapon.  The sound is not programmed well either. Voices are very, very low in some cutscenes and the sound of the wind blowing really loud overpowers every other sound in the game and gets very annoying. It is very generic and very easily forgettable but is worth it though if you can catch it on sale for like $3 or less because that's about all it is worth. And if you are using a 16x9 resolution such as 1920x1080 like I am, you will need to apply a scaling fix that is easy to do. Search the games forum for a post I made titled "16x9 resolution fix". And NEVER alt+tab out of this game or it will crash, which is something that is unforgivable with PC games. Games that aren't alt+tab friendly should be outlawed. This game is easily a 4/10 and that is being generous.","February 20, 2014","false","5.6"," 5 of 21 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","5","21","0","0"

Which I actually can't believe it made it to console in the first place. The graphics are kind of dated but the good side is they run well on my system, I get a steady 60 fps, and they look clean. The story is "weird", I can't quite get what's going on with it. I guess it's some sort of zombie game? But then there's soldiers and giant robots and giant monsters??? The story just kind of started and once in a while I get a cutscene that sort of tries to explain stuff. The blade thing doesn't do as much as I thought it would, I use guns way more. There are puzzle aspects to it but no direction as to what to do, you just have to experiment with the blade thing. I'm going to go ahead and recommend this game but ONLY if you get it cheap like I did in my $2 bundle.

It does it well with the whole mutants running about, Hayden becoming a super human freak of nature, and the russian backround.\n\nConcept:\nSimple, Hayden the main protagonist is a merc that goes to russia to get a job done, he gets it done, shoots down a helicopter, runs into a mad scientist, gets shanked by a walking scrap of metal, gets infected, he tries to avoid transforming because it turns other people into horrible mutants, but eventually our protagonist: Hayden, instead of avoiding the transformation, he willing accepts it because the powers he slowly gains through out the game makes him very powerful, we are talking x-men levels here only much more violent.\n\nGameplay:\nThird Person "Action" shooter more like, it has a resident evil thing going on but it has a lot more focus on action combat gameplay compared to other third person shooter games. His main weapon isn't a gun which is why it is hard to classify this game as a third person shooter. His main weapon of choice is the Glaive, a very unique weapon type that i've only ever seen one action/hack n' slash character use, and that would be Van Helsing.\n\nTo make this quick, it is fun plain and simple. You can throw the Glaive as a projectile type weapon like a very violent boomrang, or get up close and personal by slashing people up. The finisher moves in this game are also awesome, It is a bit violent for my taste but cant deny it is very stylish looking well animated finisher moves.\n\nGraphics:\nNice for a budget game. Which I assume this game is.\n\nSound:\nNice sound effects for the Glaive, it sounds very blade-ish, the SFX used sounds extremely brutal when hack 'n and slashin away at legions of mutant freaks and generic soldiers.\n\nThe music gets pretty frigg'n scary though, the music is scarier than the actual game itself.\n\nHaydens voice acting is great, budget game or not whoever his voice actor is did a great job. Everyone else is pretty junk though.\n\nStory:\nBadass (albeit normal human) merc for a Main Protagonist: Hayden, turns into a super human freak of nature, gains super powers such as creating shields made of pure energy to reflect projectiles, slowly gains metalic like armor, can absorb three elemental powers with his Glaive and use them against his foes ~ Lightning, Fire and Ice.\n\nI also like his character design, it isn't often modern game designers that aren't japanese, chinese or south korean that make male characters actually look cool looking with a modest slim build and a cool hair cut, the hulking tall grunts from games like gears of war or god of war are very common and I don't like those types of designs for male characters.\n\nEntertainment:\nGame is entertaining overall. It is a welcome twist on the third person shooter genre, throwing in super powers, a likable male protagonist with a cool character design, good voice acting, fun gameplay. Yeah, pretty gewd stuff.\n\nReplay Value:\nFair, only because to play with the Glaive weapon. Not many games have a Glaive class for fighting styles, it is a unique style of gameplay, too bad this version is extremely violent for the most part. Still fun though.\n\nConclusion:\nFun game, if the price is below $5 on steam sale or if you can find a retail steam code cheaper, go for it, it is worth it just for the unique gameplay when you are tired of shooting crap all day, get up close and start slashing away.\n\nTHE GOOD\n*Likable main male protagonist, Hayden is a badass.\n*Glaive is a badass unique weapon, a fighting style not used often.\n*Decent graphics for a budget game, character models are good.\n*Decent Storyline, better than most budget games.\n*Finshing moves look very stylish and flashy, well animated and violent.\n\nTHE BAD\n*No option to turn off blood and gore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/recommended/29900/","ValkyrieIsland","ValkyrieIsland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/","314 products in account","TL;DR near the bottom!\n\n\nA quick note:  If you're a fan of Warframe, Dark Sector is definitely a game you want to check out.  I actually had the game on Xbox 360 a long time ago, and I didnt get past the first two chapters;  imagine my surprise when I found out the game is actually a prequel to Warframe! All this time, I had no clue.  I thought Dark Sector was just a third party title inspired by Resident Evil and Gears of War, with a protagonist who I've always thought resembles a young Donny Osmond.\n\nAs far as gameplay mechanics go, this game is unique and fun.  The protagonist's main weapon, the Glaive, is really cool to use and is satisfying to kill enemies with.  However, the game is also painfully hard at parts where it doesn't have to be.  Some parts are easy and you feel like a Glaive weilding Super Soldier (Warframe roots in play).  At others, it feels like you've been dropped into Dark Souls. Don't get me wrong, I love Dark Souls.  It's just a very drastic change of pace that happens quite frequently.\n\nThe story, felt a little weak.  There were a lot of unexplained things, and I feel like had there been more explanation the story could have been great.  For example, the protagonist comes across a character he seems to have had extensive history with.  Players, being new to the game's story, have no idea who this person and want to understand more.  We're not told anything about their past.  Ever.  This is very unsatisfying in the long run, because it just feels like wasted space for character connection.\n\nEven details about the main character himself, Hayden Tenno, are missing - we're shown where he is throughout the gameplay but we're not really sure how or why he's there.  The story does explain some of it, but not enough to really make sense.\nThe game has a "Black Market" where you can buy weapons and apply upgrades you collect throughout the world.  However, the system seems almost pointless.  It takes forever to get enough money to buy a weapon.  And, if you get a weapon and decide "meh, I don't like this", chances are you won't have enough to buy a different gun if you sell it back.  I made this mistake, and went through half the game with a gun I didn't want.\n\nPro tip (not a spoiler, really):  Although the Black Market "VX Carbine" looks like a normal semi-automatic rifle as depicted in its picture, it actually functions like a bolt action sniper rifle and has a scope you can't remove.  Why the devs did this, I don't know.  And yes, that was the gun I got stuck with, which wasn't bad because I like snipers, but was annoying because I thought I was buying a semi-auto mid-range rifle.\n\nOne final comment I have is about what I'd call the game's "Puzzles".  The game tends to go from fast paced combat to slow paced "figure out how to progress" parts.  Some of these puzzle areas feel less like actual puzzles and more like "figure out what the devs actually intended for you to do", which was frustrating.  Some took one minute, while some took 20-30 minutes for me to un-stick myself from.  This would be ok if I was playing, say, Portal, but it feels very out of place in this game.  I think the devs were just trying to be creative with how the player could use the Glaive to interact with their environment, which is always cool, but it wasn't executed well.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n-Prequel to Warframe, shows how it all started\n-Fun Gameplay; The Glaive is a very unique weapon.  A fun side note:  The Devs are adding more of it's features into Warframe (I can't wait for that).\n-Donny Osmond\n\nCons:\n-Story ≠ Clear\n-Game has one difficulty, yet seems to switch between Easy and Hard very frequently.\n-Poorly implemented features such as gun shop and environmental puzzles.\n\n\nOverall game ratings based on your enthusiasm towards Warframe:\nNone: 5/10\nKinda: 7/10\nWarframe Addict: 8.5/10\n\nPlay on, Tenno.\n\n\n","November 27, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is cheap and predictable, and you get reminded of whats going on so infrequently that it's easy to forget why you're even there.  I kept hoping the story would redeem itself but the ending was the definition of anticlimactic.  The controls are terrible, you move at a brisk jog while "sprinting", and you can only dodge in the four cardinal directions.  It has a mechanic for taking cover, but it's almost not worth it because so much of your body is still showing and can be shot at.  The bosses are cheap and just have a lot of health.  The fights get really repetative and you go on for hours fighting the same types of enemies in almost the same conditions.  I got the game because I thought it would give some insight into the story of Warframe, Dark Sector's successor, but there is no such insight to be gained.  I wouldn't have minded that if the game was fun, but it's really not.  Cannot recommend.","August 30, 2015","false","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dark Sector is a, well, dark and gritty TPS game in which you play as Hayden Tenno, A CIA agent stranded in a city infected by a virus known as the technocyte virus (both you and the city are infected) and somehow the virus gives you superpowers and the world's deadliest boomerang. Sounds legit. Very fun although short by my standards, Dark Sector is worth a try!","August 30, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060197211/recommended/29900/","76561198060197211","Leshain: "FFXV Soon..."","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060197211/","137 products in account","Quick review of this underrated game.\n\n\nPresentation:\nThis game presents itself to you as a dark Alternate Reality Earth. It does it well with the whole mutants running about, Hayden becoming a super human freak of nature, and the russian backround.\n\nConcept:\nSimple, Hayden the main protagonist is a merc that goes to russia to get a job done, he gets it done, shoots down a helicopter, runs into a mad scientist, gets shanked by a walking scrap of metal, gets infected, he tries to avoid transforming because it turns other people into horrible mutants, but eventually our protagonist: Hayden, instead of avoiding the transformation, he willing accepts it because the powers he slowly gains through out the game makes him very powerful, we are talking x-men levels here only much more violent.\n\nGameplay:\nThird Person "Action" shooter more like, it has a resident evil thing going on but it has a lot more focus on action combat gameplay compared to other third person shooter games. His main weapon isn't a gun which is why it is hard to classify this game as a third person shooter. His main weapon of choice is the Glaive, a very unique weapon type that i've only ever seen one action/hack n' slash character use, and that would be Van Helsing.\n\nTo make this quick, it is fun plain and simple. You can throw the Glaive as a projectile type weapon like a very violent boomrang, or get up close and personal by slashing people up. The finisher moves in this game are also awesome, It is a bit violent for my taste but cant deny it is very stylish looking well animated finisher moves.\n\nGraphics:\nNice for a budget game. Which I assume this game is.\n\nSound:\nNice sound effects for the Glaive, it sounds very blade-ish, the SFX used sounds extremely brutal when hack 'n and slashin away at legions of mutant freaks and generic soldiers.\n\nThe music gets pretty frigg'n scary though, the music is scarier than the actual game itself.\n\nHaydens voice acting is great, budget game or not whoever his voice actor is did a great job. Everyone else is pretty junk though.\n\nStory:\nBadass (albeit normal human) merc for a Main Protagonist: Hayden, turns into a super human freak of nature, gains super powers such as creating shields made of pure energy to reflect projectiles, slowly gains metalic like armor, can absorb three elemental powers with his Glaive and use them against his foes ~ Lightning, Fire and Ice.\n\nI also like his character design, it isn't often modern game designers that aren't japanese, chinese or south korean that make male characters actually look cool looking with a modest slim build and a cool hair cut, the hulking tall grunts from games like gears of war or god of war are very common and I don't like those types of designs for male characters.\n\nEntertainment:\nGame is entertaining overall. It is a welcome twist on the third person shooter genre, throwing in super powers, a likable male protagonist with a cool character design, good voice acting, fun gameplay. Yeah, pretty gewd stuff.\n\nReplay Value:\nFair, only because to play with the Glaive weapon. Not many games have a Glaive class for fighting styles, it is a unique style of gameplay, too bad this version is extremely violent for the most part. Still fun though.\n\nConclusion:\nFun game, if the price is below $5 on steam sale or if you can find a retail steam code cheaper, go for it, it is worth it just for the unique gameplay when you are tired of shooting crap all day, get up close and start slashing away.\n\nTHE GOOD\n*Likable main male protagonist, Hayden is a badass.\n*Glaive is a badass unique weapon, a fighting style not used often.\n*Decent graphics for a budget game, character models are good.\n*Decent Storyline, better than most budget games.\n*Finshing moves look very stylish and flashy, well animated and violent.\n\nTHE BAD\n*No option to turn off blood and gore. (I don't like blood or gore in games, i prefer style and fantasy.)\n*Buggy cover system\n*Linear gameplay, no exploration or any extra discovery.\n\nScore:\n\n7.5/10 ~ recommended | Note: Only if you can purchase the game under $5, if not don't bother.","March 28, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more of a "monster" you become, the more "human" you become (well, despite all the brutality he must partake in to survive).  Tenno also gets to use an awesome pinwheel of death that grows out of his hand, blatantly ripped off of the cult 80's sci-fi/fantasy film "Krull", name and all (the "Glaive").  Graphics are great, soundtrack is a bit repetitive but great, Tenno's powers become more awesome as you progress, and the whole affair serves as a prequel of sorts to "Warframe" (I played Dark Sector first, way back in 2007 on my Xbox 360, so I was drooling over Warframe when it first came out on PC).
