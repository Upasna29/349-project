Everywhere we look for entertainment or relaxation reminds us of the discord and disorder seen more and more through images of violence and confrontation. Where do you turn when you want to get away from the realities of the world we're being reminded of every day?\n\nOf course everyone enjoys the challenge and hyperactive action of first person shooters but as some of us grow older we tire of their melodramatic, heavy handed, and needlessly intense nature. Could it be possible to have that same action in a more refined, artistic, and abstract style? Lovely Planet is exactly the kind of shooter to bring us this sort of peace so needed in an entertainment industry fueled by glorified aggression.\n\nLike a series of condensed blasts of Unreal Tournament's frantic chaos rolled up into a Katamari Damacy world of simple origami aesthetics and uplifting pop-folk melody, this is definitely a game for the open minded.\n\nLovely Planet has a very esoteric and eastern feel to it with it's outgoing style and upbeat pop melodies composed by multi-talented musician Calum Bowen, giving me nuances of saturday mornings as a youth watching Japanese children's programming on old VHS my Grandparents would tape and mail. While this is obviously a very personal feeling of nostalgia, there's a different form of it each player will end up discovering in their own way and tied somehow to their own past. If that reminiscent feeling isn't there for the player initially, it will be a new memory engraved into their mind in the same way our favorite things as a child stick with us.\n\nDespite the heavy Japanese overtones from the bits of stylized text and the simplicity of it's cute and attractive design, the game was actually created by Delhi based QUICKTEQUILA and the bridging between cultures by this up-and-coming developer gives the surreal nature of it's atmosphere a touch of authenticity.\n\nBeginning your journey into this Lovely Planet is almost overwhelming, assaulted with bright and stupefyingly cheerful audiovisuals. You're presented to an abstract world of random and seemingly unrelated trinkets and collage of colorful shapes,  sitting somewhere between the mysterious indie charm of Proteus and the otherworldly grandiose of Katamari Damacy.\n\nAlthough the attractive and charming visuals may ease you into a false sense of ease and comfort, the game is no pushover. It features a very progressive learning curve that keeps you on your toes and constantly alert. The stages require finesse as you dance around a well choreographed ballet of bullets.\n\nThe first world titled simply 'City' gets you into the motions with some short and mostly linear pathways sprinkled with some adorable visual design through bright colors, odd decorations, and an onslaught of peculiar words and phrases in Japanese strewn about. Beating this first handful of levels is a lightning quick affair where each attempt will be over before you even realize it, leaving you craving the next hit of fast paced shooting and jumping action.\n\nThis pace quickly changes as you enter the second world and on as the levels begin to twist and turn into more complex patterns. Different enemies and obstacles appear forcing you to think quicker before every jump or turn of a corner, and new increasingly peculiar tasks become prevalent from protecting your distressed looking blue companions to shooting down cartoonish apples before they plummet to the ground. The obstacle-course like stages just get harder and harder, you'll begin retrying more and more, and you'll slowly become consumed in the competitive spirit of the World Records shown at the end of each stage.\n\nLovely Planet will cause you to wear out your restart key as you mash it mercilessly to conquer that one seemingly simple stage and in good time. You'll eventually beat these difficult and meticulously planned later levels and instantly get a feeling of satisfaction, which quickly turns into the crush of defeat as you're shown a world record only to realize you are still seconds from being the best.\n\nLovely Planet is a game with roots in culture, art, and the essence of what 'fun' used to stand for. It proves that art games don't need to all have the same boring or pretentious gameplay, and can be just as engaging and fun as anything else out there.","July 24, 2014","true","29.3"," 377 of 425 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","377","425","2","11"

I'm sitting in my living room playing “Lovely Planet” for review purposes and junk. It's pretty adorable; that's my first impression. I'm running around a world that could easily be confused with “Katamari Damacy,” shooting little red squares and pins, rushing to reach the pink and purple flagpole that signifies the end of each short burst of a level. With every victory I'm shown my time, accuracy, and the stars I've earned. I finish each level in a few seconds... at first.\n\nAs I progress this cute little game takes a sinister turn. Suddenly I have to deal with innocent geometric dudes I can't shoot, platforms that disappear should I linger a moment too long, and giant apples I have to shoot before they hit the ground - all while bouncing and dodging (and screaming curse words so vile and bizarre that they haven't been conjured up, not in this plane of existence, anyway. Only in “Lovely Planet”).\n\nRemember that level in “Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare?” I think it was called “Mile High Club” or something punny. Yeah, this whole damn game is that level. There are no screw ups, no second chances. I've never clutched a controller so tightly, a fact made all the more disturbing because I'm playing a game with a color scheme straight out of the Teletubby-verse.\n\nThose with weak constitutions should avoid this title as the catchy music and rainbow explosion background will literally drive you to slavering madness as it mocks you; taunts you. You'll replay any given level a dozen times, each death increasingly unfair to you. Your shouts of disbelief will slowly transform into maniacal, sobbing laughter as you come to realize you're the devil and sinner in this Kafkaesque Hell of your own making. And finally, with victory nearly in your desperate, grasping reach, your sweat-slicked hands will betray you and you'll fall to your death.\n\nAnd then you'll click retry. "Lovely Planet" is endearing, unapologetic in its challenge, and fun to play. This game has heart and charm usually absent in your standard 'tough as nails' fare, and it is a refreshing change of pace. For twitch gameplay enthusiasts and fans of the wonderfully weird, I can't recommend "Lovely Planet" enough.","July 23, 2014","true","1.5"," 220 of 247 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","220","247","4","1"

You can jump extremely high, you run very fast, and every shot has to be calculated. The game comes down to, shoot every red thing then touch the exit. The developer does a really good job of working with these simple rules into making a really fun game. Later on you can encounter apples, which have to be shot before they fall to the ground, enemies that can shoot at you as well as some other things I won't spoil.\n\nThe gun works in an interesting way, theres no crosshair on screen but I do not think it would make sense for there to be one, the gun is effected by the players momentum and you do not exactly shoot straight, but one you get the hang of it you feel really cool after you complete a level.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is really good, the songs match the areas well and get stuck in your head easily. I'd reccomend checking out Calum Bowens bandcamp to give it a listen\n","July 31, 2014","true","2.5"," 77 of 92 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","77","92","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/298600/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Lovely Planet is a FPS platformer in a surreal and cute world. However do not let the cuteness fool you, this game is brutally hard.\n\nThe graphics remind me of the Nintendo 64 games with crude 3D shapes mixed with occasional simple 2D textures to give character. I know this is a bit far-fetched, but I find it cute in Lovely Planet.\nThe gameplay is swift and responsive, the only weird part being sliding off some ledges that look like it would be possible to land on them. Framerate is perfect and the game runs well. However the FOV cannot be changed.\n\nThe idea is to get across a short level while jumping on platforms and shooting baddies. Simple enough, so there are leaderboards to compete, and stars given according to accuracy and speed. At first I kept trying to go faster and faster without understanding why my impressive runs didn't get rewarded by the game, until I learned that the third star was only given for 100% accuracy. I like a good challenge, so I worked on finishing all levels 100% with three stars.\n\nAt the start the levels were pretty straight-forward and it was fun. But then... then the apple fell too far from the tree. Literally, because falling apples is the one game mechanic that ruined the game for me. Any single apple hitting the ground triggers a game over. The early ones are thrown at the player, which is fine. However after a bit the apples are shot in the sky from a different place in the level, and just fall right where they are, whether the player is around or not.\n\nLet me explain better how this is infuriating. You are in a part of the level, merrily shooting and platforming your way. And then, suddenly, you cross an invisible line and hear the dreaded sound of an apple been released. And now, the only thing that you can do is rush forward in the level to reach the part where the apple is located, and start shooting from afar (because the bullets take time to travel), without a target nor a crosshair, where you predict that the apple is going to fall . And then you realize that three apples were triggered, and you need to pre-shoot three different locations with pinpoint pre-accuracy and timing. So, basically, you have no choice but to quickly shoot in several directions and hope for the best, and do it again and again until you are a robot that has complete muscle memory of the right way to deal with this nonsense. And let's not talk about the moment where you have to jump on a jump-pad, and while in the air, shoot where an apple is going to land BEHIND you, then quickly turn back forward and shoot where an apple is falling in FRONT of you. I managed to do it. I did all of this. I had three stars in these levels, so 100% accuracy. But instead of being happy at my achievement, I was thinking "why? why so much time wasted being a robot and not having any fun?". Then I started the 4th world, and noticed that the levels were engulfed in fog. Superman 64 level of fog and fun. With the nerve-wrecking treat that I also had to pre-shoot apples that I couldn't even see, and it was made even more obvious that completing the levels would be a tedious chore of memorizing every single move and shot.\n\nNo, thanks, I like a good challenge, but this is just a waste of time, and the cute graphics are hidden in fog anyway, so why bother. Goodbye Lovely Planet, I only recommend you at a very cheap price to fool around in the early levels, otherwise I do not think that you are a good game worth investing my time and sanity to complete.","July 17, 2015","false","7.4"," 85 of 134 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","85","134","5","4"

It looks adorable, it feels adorable, it is adorable.\n\nThen you start playing it.\n\nThis game is a first person shooter that is essentially a very cute target practice sim. You need to haul it as fast as you can through various obstacles to the ending pole, shooting any and every red enemy that you see, while avoiding shooting at the blue ones. You run pretty fast, you jump very high, and you have infinite ammo in your block shooting gun. No enemies take more than one hit to kill, and only one type will shoot back at you; shooting the bullets they shoot kills them as well as stops the bullet. You have three objectives to get stars at the end of the game; beat the level (duh), beat a minimum time they give you, and have 100% accuracy on all of your shots. Sounds decently straightforward, right? That's because it is, in theory.\n\nThe first world is decently easy. However, even in this world expectations are quite high; a lot of the levels I beat the minimum time by few milliseconds, just because it's so fast paced. This might just be me being bad at the game and not being fast enough, because a lot of the world records are half the average speed. However, as angry and frustrated at both yourself and the game you get, you're never genuinely mad, because of how cute and fun the world around you is. Beat a 10 second minimum level in 9.997 seconds? That sucks, but holy sh*t this soundtrack!\n\nThe second world adds a new mechanic into the game; you need to shoot apples (tomatoes? large red bean bags?) before they hit the ground. Now, this would be very easy if your bullets had normal bullet physics; however, they move at a consist speed, about the same speed you run. So, if you need to shoot one of these things from a good distance as it's falling down, you need to aim your bullet down just above the ground so it'll collide into it. This is not as easy as it sounds, and I've had amazing runs destroyed because the apple hit the ground a few frames before the bullet hit. However, as all this difficulty stacks up and starts to become extremely frustrating, the amazing soundtrack just slowly washes it all away.\n\nIs this game relaxing, fun, and a good takeaway from stress and other more violent and dark games? Absolutely.\nIs this game frustrating, rage-inducing, and the bane of speedrunners everywhere? Absolutely.","January 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

You'd have to be an absolute fool to neglect this purchase.\n\nLong version: My roommate suggested me this game after learning that I was looking for games to speedrun. I purchased it, fired it up, and not a moment later, fell in love with it. That kind of love you feel that just warms your whole body. My initial reaction was, "Wow, this soundtrack is incredible! And these graphics! It's so simple, yet so capturing and quirky!"\n\nI started on 1-1. The first level in the first world. As the music changed from the Menu music to City, I got swept away in a feeling of bliss I hadn't felt in years. The controls were simple, the enemies were clear, and the objective straightforeward. Use the keyboard to move and jump, use the mouse to look and shoot. Reduce the enemy count to 0, and walk into the purple pillar. So simple! Why aren't more games like this?\n\nAs you reach the goal, a new window shows up, displaying information such as how quickly you completed that level, how quickly other people completed the level (a leaderboard), as well as how quickly the fastest person completed that level. Just like that, you already have a new way to enjoy the game, as if the gameplay itself weren't enough. Now you can not only compete against your own times, but other people too? Game on.\n\nAs you try to get top 15 times on the leaderboards, you start to try new things. Push the routes you used to take, or plan entirely new ones, hoping that they're faster. As you inevitably burn through all the levels in City, you move on to world 2, named Village. With each new world, new levels, obstacles, and enemies stand between you and those sweet sweet top 15 times. Can you hack it?\n\nThis game is designed in a way that the player doesn't feel coddled, but at the same time, it's not impossible to win. It's designed to be challenging, but not unwinable. New enemies are revealed in open, contained areas that let you see how they function, before throwing them just around a corner in the last levels of that world.\n\n227 in game hours ago, I had the biggest, stupidest grin on my face. The joy of this game hasn't left me, even 227 hours later. If you're looking for a fun casual game, then you've found one. If you're looking for an speedrunning game that puts your skill to the test, then you've found one. Buy. This. Game. It's worth every penny.\n\nNote to potential speedrunners: This game contains little RNG. The only RNG it DOES contain, bears no effect on how the game is run, or how it affects you or enemies. The only RNG occurs when an enemy dies, or your bullet registers as a hit, your gun will be showered in stars, providing a visual cue so the player can continue without having to watch the shots connect. I can find no pattern to where the stars appear. This is the RNG. That's it. This is an extremely skill and execution based game.","August 1, 2015","true","251.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","1"

Controller has no mapping, and while it has cute icons in the environment to go with it, I wouldn't at all recommend using it because of the difficulty. Graphics options are minimal (AA, Vsync, Adjustable Frame Cap incl. Unlimited). Supports multi-monitor and all common aspect ratios if not everything. No FOV Adjustment (default is okay enough for average PC user), No Crosshair even optionally. No performance issues.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is amazing, but not for the feint of heart, or for those with even average dexterity. Beyond the middle of the 3rd world, out of a total of 5, the game becomes extremely difficult, and that's even with an on-screen crosshair (built into my Asus Display), which the game completely lacks by default. Up through the 3rd world I was able to complete the 2 bonus stars for time and 100% accuracy, but beyond that point more and more levels become an immense challenge just to finish at all. In other games, if you aren't good you can beat things, but you just wont get all the points or whatever. In this, if you aren't exceptionally good, you literally will not beat the game.\n\nMore enemies, mechanics, and obstacles are added as you progress, and while most aren't portal levels of brilliant, they do a good job of mixing up how you think about different situations. Though because of the difficulty near the end, it makes it a challenge to experiment with various timings, as it puts you in situations with very little time to react and execute, though retrying from the beginning of each level is nearly instantaneous.\n\nThe controls are extremely responsive (they really need to be for the end-game), and there's more variety than you'd initially expect. Though again, you need to be good enough to even see all of it. However, once you unlock a new world, ALL of the levels are open to you instantly. You're not completely stuck if you find a level right in the middle that gives you trouble, you can come back to it later, or never at all as you only need a certain amount of stars to progress.\n\nPresentation\nThe visuals are very minimal, but extremely charming in combination with the music. The game is frustrating, but the amazing music by Calum Bowen forces a smile onto your face for most of the experience. The soundtrack was free around the release of the game, and I've listened to it a considerable amount. The only thing I'd wish for, is more variety in the environments. There's definitely some there, but ones with drastically different color palettes or even nighttime levels would be a treat.\n\nTLDR - Summary\nI completely and totally recommend it for fans of shooters both old and new. It's extremely responsive and the music and visuals just make you smile. The beginning levels are a joy and they're worth experiencing for it's common sale price. Just don't plan on seeing everything unless you're already skilled in twitch shooters, or you're willing to work at it. This was clearly made by a fan of shooters and PC gaming, and other than some small adjustments, I tremendously appreciate it.","January 1, 2015","true","9.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"

It reminds me of Super Meat Boy in the sense that it encourages replaying until you ace a level, and is not as frustrating as it may seem due to the great soundtrack that continues to play through deaths, quick restarts, and the real sense of accomplishment one will get once they beat a level that has been the bane of their play. I have not finished it yet, and have only finished 2 out of 5 worlds, but I am sure I will come back again and again when I need something relaxing, yet challenging to play. Which is a good point to bring up. Lovely Planet is a very relaxing game. The cutesy pastel aesthetic is one that really sets it apart from other FPS style games and combined the soundtrack backing it, makes for an almost meditative experience. Sure, there will be some moments where you feel frustrated, but every death of mine (and there are many) has felt like it is my fault. Not the game's. All in all, I can't believe this is only 5 dollars. It is a wonderful experience. One that I feel many will enjoy. If you are easily frustrated, I would say stay away, but if you are curious, go for it. I think fans of the "just one more try" games will love this.

(And suffering in school work as a result, but that's another story.) There are a lot of great games that I've played that were released just this year. It's hard to pick exactly one.\n\nBut if there was a sub-category for "Best FPS I've played that was released in 2014", it would be this one, hands-down. Why? Well...\n\nLovely Planet. It's as its namesake suggests. An incredibly cutesy, Japanese world with Japanese-styled characters. Everything pretty much looks like it came from some weird utopian anime with lovely planets and lovely worlds. But beneath that cute and cheery appearance lies a game that has far more depth than you would have thought it had.\n\nFor starters, despite its Japanese themes and Japanese-styled soundtrack, it was actually coded by a guy based in India. Vidhvat Madan - remember the name. I certainly would be. In terms of his games[vidhvat.com], Lovely Planet is the most polished one that he's come up with yet. And the soundtrack...not by a Japanese, but by UK-based Calum Bowen. Incredibly catchy, and still miles better than the turd that passes for radio pop nowadays.\n\nYou're armed with a gun that shoots purple cubes of DEATH love, and you use it to kill love all the red enemies friends that you see around the map. They need your love. But don't shoot the gray ones, they already have enough, and any more than that will cause them to die from too much love. There are also a few types of fiendish traps strewn across the levels - for starters, apple bombs that trigger once you reach a certain point, you have to shoot them before they touch the ground, or else you go BOOM*! Other traps include a proximity trap which, when set off, renders a certain area unsafe after a few seconds - going into that area, uh, vapourises* you.\n\nThe first few levels start off easy, but after a while, you're involved in increasingly trickier scenarios. Take this one level for instance. I walk past an apple bomb, jump off onto a jump pad, and before I land on the jump pad the apple bomb I just walked past triggers and is launched into the air, along with ANOTHER apple bomb further along the way. You somehow have to turn around, shoot that bomb that you passed, then quickly turn back around and shoot the next bomb. All while you're probably in the air or trying to land on that jump pad. That was possibly the first level I really struggled with.\n\nLovely Planet's an incredibly punishing game. You have no crosshair (it feels really weird, mind you) and you have to judge your shots right. Most of the level solutions are learnt by rote - fail, fail and fail again, all while discovering how to pass some parts of the stage each time, and then perfecting the method for that one exhilaratingly perfect run. Good challenges, too - there's a speed challenge for beating a certain time, and an accuracy challenge where none of your shots go to waste.\nThe game also takes cues from games like Super Meat Boy - respawns are near-instantaneous so you don't have to wait too long to try again. Because you'll be trying again and again a lot of times.\n\nI've been notoriously bad at FPS games, so I don't forsee myself being able to complete this one, unfortunately. But even if I didn't, I'd be damned if I claimed I didn't have fun with it.\n\n\nOh, and before I end off: I like reading PC Gamer Reviews because their writers have a masterful command of English. For the most part, I agree with them. However, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say I disagree with this particular one. The presentation, contrary to what they say, is NOT MEDIOCRE. In fact, it's perfectly appropriate for this game. Not every FPS must look like CoD or Crysis.\n\nI will concede though that they at least gave one of the better scores. Other critics don't appear to like it as much, and that's a real shame, because this is such a...wait for it...lovely gem. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'll stop now.\n\n\nWhen to buy: If you're into FPS games, you'll probably enjoy this, it might be worth full price to you then. If you're into FPS games with a large modicum of seriousness...put that all aside and get this. Don't be serious for a change.\nIf you're not either of the two, it's been bundled at least once so try trading for a key.\n\n9.0/10\n\n*For dramatic effect only. The game isn't really that scary. Far from it, actually.","October 9, 2014","true","9.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

The gameplay is solid - one part FPS, one part platforming. Both parts perform well, and while there are enemies hiding around every corner, somehow you feel like it's your fault if you die. Even though you may not see an enemy at first, you will see one of their bullets whizzing by your head, and that usually gives you enough time to react. My only gripe here is the cherry bomb - once it hits the ground, you have to restart the level, and it's a bit jarring at first because you have to experience it a couple of times to understand what happened and why.\n\nAs for level design, well... it all seems really repetetive. That's really all I have to say that's negatie, though. You play one short level after another, and there after you beat a level, it gives you your time and a 'record' time for you to beat. After enemies are introduced, it's your job to exterminate them. Miss one, and you have to start the level over. Concept is really simple. Difficulty curve is slow, if not spot on - new mechanics and enemies are gradually introduced to you so you have time to get used to what's happening.\n\nGraphics-wise, everything is simple and polygonal, however, that just helps to boost the aesthetics. The environment is colorful and cheery, with bright pastel-like colors. The music is a nice touch as well - not fast, but still cheery and upbeat, fitting in quite nicely with the environment.\n\nSo should you get this game?\n\nIf you're into FPS games like CoD and Battlefield and such, no, this game is probably not for you - you will not be offered a high-octane competetive FPS, as that is not what this game is about.\n\nHowever, if you want to relax and have some fun without the competition and fast paced gameplay, go for it. You'll have a lot of fun with this game - it's very easy to pick up and play.","July 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It's truly oldschool arcade FPS with a huge number of different levels that require skill in using mouse, keyboard and your own head to find out which path is the best to pass certain level. The difficult level is balanced, because you start from the easiest levels, through average ones and end on the hardest on each world. You get stars for your effort, up to 3, although this game has it's classic feel of "one more time, I can do better", which I liked the most, maybe because of nostalgia over some classic games I haven't played for years. Also, you can compare your results with your friends and see global scores (the best ones and those, which are close to your own score). Generally speaking, it is simple (but it very easy!), funny and recommendable game both for younger and older players.","January 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

My first impression of this game was that it was going to be a short game that I would enjoy for no more than a minute. I enjoy games that take time to be more artistic and unique than most games out on the market. This game is great because it shows that there are still ways to make games unique, and more games should take note. The simplistic-ness of the game fools you, because in order to beat the levels, you need to form some type of rhythm fabricated to each level. I would recommend this game to almost anyone just because of how unique it is, and I personally don't even feel this to be a first person shooter, but more of a puzzle/rhythnm game.","August 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's a very minimalistic First Person Shooter type game.  If there were a game used in the future to train hardcore FPS players to become even better, this would be that game.  You just hate it!  You hate it so much, and all the little guys that have little smiles on their face as they fire purple cubes of death at you... YOU JUST WANT TO SHOOT THEM IN THE FACE, BUT NO!  IF YOU DO THAT, YOU LOSE!  So you just have to get by them, intercepting their bullets without shooting them.  This game requires you to turn so fast at certain moments that it causes whiplash, and as such, comes with a free promotional Lovely Planet Neck Brace.  The game is very fast paced, and it's really satisfying when you complete a level.  This game is one of the hardest games I have ever played, and I'm proud to say that I finished every level of it.  If you finish it too then maybe we can hang out and compare neck braces.","November 14, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is how I can most accurately sum up Lovely Planet. Fast reflexes, intricately designed bite-sized stages that will sometimes take forever to figure out, and a real sense of "just one more try" are the three strong points that Lovely Planet relies on, and for the most part it handles them very well.\n\nEach stage of the game lasts about 20-30 seconds (if that, in most cases) and is an obstacle course you must find your way through without ever falling off of the level or being hit by various obstacles or enemy "bullets."  Lovely Planet doesn't rely on tracers or hitscan to determine if you or enemies were hit. Bullets exist in the world and travel at varying speeds and this is something you'll need to be highly aware of and learn to adapt to if you're more used to modern FPS offerings. In fact, leading your and your enemies' shots is highly important the further you progress into the game. Old school Quake and Unreal players will probably feel right at home almost instantly.\n\nLovely Planet takes a pretty harsh difficulty jump once you hit world 3 and it only keeps getting harder from there. Some may really reach a point where they've hit their skill limit with how accuracy based so many of the challenges are near the end of the game. The game also introduces a fog effect later that can make obstacles like homing bullets start to feel really unfair and cheap when you have to sacrifice multiple tries in order to find out where the shots are even coming from.\n\nAside from the slightly lopsided difficulty, Lovely Planet is a solid "masocore" shooter with a fun and cute aesthetic married to  a rock solid set of simple to grasp mechanics.","September 12, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you like games like Super Meatboy, this is like the First Person Shooter version.\n\nPersonally I only played the first few levels before I got frustrated and moved on, but for those first few levels, it was worth it :D\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Amazingly upbeat music! It gets you jacked and makes you want to beat it!\n-Cool graphic style. It reminded me of the Katamari games :)\n\nTHE BAD:\n-Difficulty scales way too quickly! You'll be moving from one level to the next, fighting more and harder enemies, then suddenly the game introduces a bomb. The bomb launches into the air once you reach a certain point in the level, if you can't shoot it in time and it touches the ground, you die and have to restart from the beginning.

You'll be screaming at the game, most likely sluring a lot, yet you'll get weird feeling of a satisfaction after completing the level you've been grinding for the past 15 minutes.\n\nThere's really not much to tell about it: it's basically a fast-paced puzzle platformer with weird Japanese graphics and j-pop to pair with. As of the level design, you usually have to grind as hard as you did in Super Meat Boy to complete each zone -- you have to memorize the maneuvers and timings, time your shots and watch your step carefully; hell, late levels are a lot more hardcore than Super Meat Boy, I tell you!\n\nShooting 4 apples in the air simultaneously, then landing a few inches from spikes, dodging 2 shooters (shooting off their bullets with yours, then shooting them) and jumping from the disappearing platform -- all of that happening in a timespan of 1.5 seconds; that's the harsh reality of this game.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIs it worth buying? Hard to say. I'm not a fan of the genre, so I'd rather pass on it if it wasn't in a bundle. But hardcore die-a-lot puzzle platformer fans might find it interesting. So yeah, I'd recommend this game to them.\n\nRating:  6.5 out of 10.0","June 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I find that this  game has a very kawaii approach at first and it seems like the easiest game in the world so you continue to play. Hours go by like minutes and minutes go by like seconds once you are trapped in this games unstoppable vacuum. You finally feel like a mlg pro when you get past world 1 but you soon realize that you are no more then a simple meal for this excellent product. [World-2||Stage-3]: Will make you eyes water with ketchup like-substance BUT, in a fantastic exhilarating way that makes you want to just explode with the joy of 1000 Meerkats!\n\nMoving on to the next incredible subject about this just completed amazing game is the sound track, I mean honestly calum bowen is now the official kawaii mozart ( in my world of course ). I love the soundtrack, its the real motivator in this game for me.\n\nThe controls are fairly basic, although when you enter the game you have extremely slow sensitivity, this can be fixed by going into the options and scrolling down the list of options, Speaking of which I like their unique user interface although it can be a little weird at first I like how you have to tilt your head to understand it better :].\n\nOverall I think this game is definitely worth buying, its worth every cent, and I'm not sugar coating one bit (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","August 11, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It's an FPS on the surface and into the core, which is not a bad thing, it's a very good thing actually. With pastel like colors, angry squares shooting at you and a lovely upbeat soundtrack composed by Calum Bowen, Lovely Planet is a great game with everything on point.\n\nWhat do you do in Lovely Planet? Well you shoot purple bullets towards other purple bullets, shapes with eyes that just stand in place and shapes with eyes that shoot homing bullets at you. And many more things you can shoot at (or be shot from).\nMost of the skill of the game comes from taking the right paths, taking them quickly while managing to avoid and shoot  "baddies". You can also "ace" (or 100%) levels by completing them under a certain time limit while not missing a shot. The game gets to a point where my brain can't handle all the things happening on screen, which makes a great practice game with a sense of triumph at the end of every level.\n\nIt also has a leaderboard, my favorite thing! Where you can see how good you are compared to strangers and your steam friends. Most of my steam friend gave up on forest, so I mostly have strangers, lovely.

It is fast paced and the controls are so fluid it will make you feel amazing! Even after the 15 minutes I have spent playing before writing this review I can say I haven't had so much fun with an FPS in a while.\n\n--Story--\nThere basically isn't one (I don't think) but that makes it even more fun as you can use your own imagination and become anything you want, a fabulous cube man whos destiny is to save the world from pink because...pink...\n\n--Overview--\n\nThe level design is creative, new and well crafted as even within 15 minutes and still on the first world I have seen many new mechanics that have changed up play and suprised the hell out of me. There is also many secrets hidden around and world records to beat 'when the game is out of course' so you can be the best of the best. Also the game has a massive hate for the color pink for some reason incase you haven't guessed yet.\n\n--Conclusion--\n\nOverall the game is fun, well crafted and has the greatest soundtrack ever made that really makes you want to keep playing and there is alot of replay value as you can try to get the best times or get every star on ever level, and there are ALOT.\n\nOverall I give the game a 9/10 as it is colorful and trippy and a hell of a lot of fun, definately worth picking up.\n\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBRVmll8Xt8","July 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Nowhere near as fun as quake live's race gamemode. It's kind of different from that, but with less depth, with the former being about movement+precision aiming (rocket jumps etc.) and this game being ONLY about precision aiming. The movement in this game is not very good. Walking down a slope will just make you instantly slide down it, way faster than you floating down from jumping.\n\nI don't know why a game entirely about precision aiming has no crosshair. Just because the projectiles inherit momentum doesn't make a crosshair useless. All removing the crosshair does is add guesswork to the game, which is stupid when most levels have very small frame windows in which to shoot homing projectiles. The stupidity multiplies whenever said projectiles are waiting for you in front of a teleporter exit.\n\nThat being said I think most people could find enjoyment out of the first 3 worlds since their less cheesy and actually give you some freedom of how you complete the levels. The swamp (4th world) levels are filled with guess-working tiny windows of opportunity, and guessing where the falling apples(?) are going to be when your screen is entirely fog and you have no depth perception. Mountain (5th world) has even more homing missile spam in-front of you as you leave a teleporter. Not very fun or exciting, but the main point of saying all of this is that there's no freedom in how you execute these things. There's no discovery on what the most optimal route is, or how to do it.\n\nThe music is alright. The visuals are alright but they feel a bit lazy. They're not bad and their artistic talent is still there,  it just looks like the developers could do better.","September 29, 2014","false","2.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","1"

A Super Meat Boy-like twitch FPS with the artstyle of Katamari Damacy, it is a happy, deppressing, and angry game with hours of gameplay. The baddies explode into hearts when you kill them, the flowers on the grass are just little hearts, and dying causes you to respawn in a fluffy burst of blue stars. The music and the pastel color scheme are also among the many things about this game that are on the same tier of happy as the cutest of cat videos.\n\nThen you get to world 2. Hell freezes over and you begin to lose your way. Fragments of your soul disappear each time you die and restart a level. You kill the same baddies countless times. Time ceases flowing as you enter a purgatorial state of mind, begging for everything to just end. You die before the end goal and stall in introspection. You begin questioning your entire life, everything you have done that let you to this game, to wish for success at every attempt and have your hopes crushed in an endless cycle.\n\nBut as you come back out of your mind, you see that the game is still there on the monitor before you. You hear that music is still playing, hearts are still fluttering, and a curious, pastel-banded planet still floats in the background. You press on through the weaboo-imagined landscape, happy as ever, as if no mind trip ever happened. Repeat this cycle until you either quit the game or amputate your middle finger from perpetually holding down the 'W' key.\n\nBest emotional roller coaster 2014.","August 10, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only requirements are that you kill every single baddie and not necessarily in a specific order, so you're free to develop strategies to complete any level as fast as possible. Even if the game looks very primitive and simple, it's challenging and rewarding. I've spent around 3 hours and reset around 500 times to get the world record on 1-5 and that's a rather simple level. It gets much, much tougher (I'm looking at you, apples.) and levels get longer, so if you're going for that WR, you'll have to get some extra patience, because you're going to see the words "Look ahead" and "Start" many, many times. So go on, get this game. I'll give a cookie to the person who'll be able to beat me on my WRs (1-2, 1-5 and 1-4).

The graphics are colorful, awesome, and rather minimal, which makes the focus (i.e. objects and objectives) of the game clearer without clouding it with complex textures and what not.  The soundtrack is lovely and light-hearted and a great addition to each area in the game (each one is accompanied by a new track).  Lovely Planet is a great and fun experience and is perfect for speedrunners.","October 12, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a cutesy but challenging game which will test your reflexes and memorization of patterns. Deceptively simple in the beginning, it adds more and more content as you progress, and what was simply a "bounce forward through the level shooting static enemies" experience becomes: Immediate 180 turn, forward and left past moving blob of death, bunny hop gap, shoot blob blocking landing then instantly shoot dude right in front of you, then jump onto bounce pad, then shoot a falling apple in midair, then quickly jump across three dissapearing platforms, hop over spikes, dodge shots and kill two more guys around corners, then shoot an apple with unhittable targets behind it, and finish. Then they intoduce homing projectiles and flying enemies and stuff, and the content gets really frantic. The level design retains the same aesthetics, but with small changes on each particular level, and more stage hazards as you progress. There's also a couple possible paths on most levels, and there are secrets hidden throughout the game as well. There's not a ton of motivation to find them in my opinion, but if you're an explorer then you can poke around for the achievements. The game is arcadey, and scores you based on your performance. Getting three stars for a par time and perfect accuracy for your bullet ballet feels great, although don't expect to do that past the 2nd or 3rd world. It's a good example of a videogame that comes out of left field to provide a neat experience I didn't know I was missing. It's not perfect, but it's certainly worth a look. 7.5/10","December 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the enemies don't move (and the ones that do have consistent behavior, i.e. moving in an arc or homing in on you) so a lot of the gameplay is muscle memory-centric. It has a great difficulty curve and it keeps going until the last world.","November 30, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game starts off easy but gets really difficult. Your projectiles are slow so you have to lead moving targets, and you fail the level if you let some targets hit the ground or get hit by an enemy projectile. The gameplay is very trial-and-error. You have to figure out a sequence of shots and moves and execute them close to perfectly, or you'll fail. To give you an idea: often you have to jump into a teleporter after which you are greeted by three projectiles flying at you from different directions, so you have to shoot them to not get hit, but at the same time jump on a disappearing platform and reach around the corner just in time to hit two tomatoes before they hit the ground. Very difficult. For enthousiasts, there are achievements for being fast and for 100% accuracy in each level.\nIf you like difficult/trial-and-error games with instant restart (such as Super Meat Boy), get this game. But don't expect a lot of variety. There are about a hundred levels and they all look similar.","July 9, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Good, because there's more to it then just that!\n\nThe game features five worlds and about 16~23 stages in each of them. When you first start out, the game's just telling you to go from point A to point B with almost no resistance in-between.\nQuickly it goes from being hilariously easy to 'moderately' difficult as they introduce:\n-Jelly people that shoot back (some of them you can't actually hit or you will instantly lose).\n-Apples that can't hit the ground.\n-Timed mines.\n-Homing bullets.\n-Fog that limits your vision.\n-Ice that freezes you in place for a couple seconds.\n-A lot of restarting....\n\nOnce you start getting into the groove of things though the game does actually get really enjoyable. Restarting will become second nature and you will probably be getting used to not knowing what's around every corner, or where every apple is falling in the stage at any given moment.\n\nLovely Planet gets compared a lot to games like Quake/Serious Sam with its fast-paced fps nature, Beautiful Katamari with its aesthetics, and Super Meat Boy with its emphasis on speedrunning.\n\nThe game has a beautiful soundtrack that during the frantic, heart-pounding gameplay tries to keep you calm and relaxed. All the while you're fighting back the urge to not break your mouse/keyboard (or controller) over that shot you missed that was ever-so slightly off mark on the last thing before the stage was about to end...\n\nI'd highly recommend Lovely Planet but it is a short game, so unless you know you're going to be replaying stages for better times/stars or going for some of the achievements then just wait for a decent sale.","May 28, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I wasn't ready for this.\n\nI hurts too much, because I love finishing games and here I'm physically unable to complete it. This game starts easy, but quickly becomes uncontrollably hard, requiring you to react in microseconds and relaying the levels at infinitum until the "right" path between bullet hell and enemies is so much burned into your brain that it REALLY hurts. I'm not against hard games, I finished plenty of them that aren't exactly called "Casual friendly", but the amount of reflexes and dedication to actually finish the game is unbelievably high. Unless you are REALLY good at FPSes, you have a chances. And by REALLY good, I mean you are getting something around >70% accuracy in Quake 3 Arena match. Those annoying Apple Cannons  obstacles deserve a special mention for extreme cheapness.\n\nPresentation also is a letdown. Novelty quickly wears off. Upbeat music from the first level is replaced with dull melodies later on. Assets are constantly reused. Levels look the same all the time. It looks like Katamari at first glance, but the art style becomes boring, suprisigly, very fast. Maybe because all of that frustration? Not completely sure. Fun and satisfaction from playing the game is essentially sucked out from the game the longer you play it.\n\nIf you are real MLG-Pro-360-NoScope gamer, you will have extreme fun with this one. Everyone else, that just want a normal game, with reasonable difficulty curve, fresh artstyle that is possible to beat... No you won't get it here.

The level design largely reflects on Super Meat Boy's level design ethos in that levels are pretty short, typically lasting around 15-20 seconds, but are packed with plenty of obstacles to make things challenging. These obstacles range from friendlies that you can't shoot or else you'll end the level, apple launchers in which you have to shoot the apples before they hit the ground, baddies that can shoot homing shots which you have to shoot out of the air (don't worry, it's a lot easier than it sounds), as well as plenty of other obstacles. Worlds one through three are quite a bit of fun; in fact, there was really only one level that I didn't like out of these first 62 levels.\n\nThen comes World 4. I'm just gonna be blunt; World 4 is stage memorization central. Why? First and foremost on the bad design checklist is thick fog. Seriously, designers, limiting the player's vision is not a good way to create challenge; it's just a quick path to frustrating the player. There's also plenty of points in this world where you pretty much have to take shots in the dark to be able to complete the level (See Level 4-20 which the designers had to be high to think was a good idea). Whenever you consider that a condition for completion of the game is 100% accuracy on all stages, this really becomes one hell of a frustrating experience. Second on the bad idea checklist for world 4 are shots that literally come out of nowhere. No, that's not just the fog fooling you; these shots literally come out of thin air (obscured by the fog, of course), and you can't see them when you look forward at the stage before attempting it. The only saving grace for the average player is that these stages are among the shortest in the game, but for the completionists, this can be the worst world, as some of the par times are ridiculously strict. Worlds one through three took me 30 minutes, 50 minutes, and 60 minutes to complete respectively. World four took over three hours and even then I didn't 100% the world.  As for world five... world four has put me off too heavily for me to want to play the game anymore right now. Maybe in a couple of months.\n\nMaybe world five will be the big comeback from world four. I sure hope so. Again, worlds one through three were excellent, save for that one stage. It's just too bad about world four. 7/10.\n\nStory: Not really any here, so I'm not gonna bother going into detail about it.\n\nGraphics: The game sure does look great; at least, until world four where everything becomes terrible and fog. Man, though; world four really is an absolute blight on this game in nearly every respect (even in music, but I'll get to that later). But anyways, at least for the worlds that are actually good, the game really does look great. It's certainly a game that'll look great ten, maybe even twenty years down the line. You can't say that for a lot of games. As for the technical aspects, the game says that it runs at a solid 60FPS, and I can verify that it does indeed run at a solid 60FPS. No lag spots whatsoever. Also, thanks to the simplistic nature of the graphics, you can run this on pretty modest hardware. So yeah, the graphics side of the game was definitely not a disappointment. 5/5.\n\nSound: Only the OST to talk about here, and - *sigh* - yes, the world four song is the weakest of the bunch. Apart from that, the OST is excellent. Calum Bowen sure did a great job with this one. The tracks are sort of like if you mixed Ape Escape's OST with any Katamari OST. Very catchy, very quirky, and just very good. As for the sound design, it uses Engine of Whimsy +10. Good stuff. 5/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/5/5; 8.5/10. Man, if it weren't for world four, gameplay would get a 9/10. Everything just went so far downhill in that world. Oh well; I'll be editing this review later on when I play world five, so maybe it'll give it a shot in the arm to bring it up to 8 or something. As for now, my advice is to play worlds one through three and then stop.","August 10, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The teams are divided into two teams; counter-terrorists and terrorists. Your role as a player is to shoot your opponents while avoiding getting shot. Getting shot will instantly result in a death since everyone has AWPs. You have to watch out for grenades as well, as they are also instant-kill and have a massive radius. To avoid these, you have to shoot them like what kennyS did in SS7. The top players are either extremely good and have spent a lot of time in this game, or have just abused bugs/exploits/hacks/etc. Matchmaking is very fast with each game taking <10 seconds to begin. Everyone who I have met was friendly, especially Penguin-san. I'm probably going to play a lot more of this.","August 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","1","2","4","0"

The goal of the game is too beat the levels as fast as you possibly can and this where the multiplayer part comes in. Players can compete to become the fastest in certain levels and it's really fun. The game supports tons of levels and content to keep you coming back along with difficulty slowly highering with each level you play. The soundtrack is so bouncy, creative and fun and really pumps you into the mood of the game. The only complaint I could really make is that the game doesn't have a crosshair when it really needs it specially for all those percision shots you have to make. Altogether the game is worth it's price tag of £3.49 and can easily support hours of entertainment it still has active sales and makes it even easier to pick the game up.","July 27, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Like Prince of Persia Sands of Time did, and it wasn't good back then)\nThe first few levels are quite easy until you get the enemies with the homing missiles, then it gets frustrating.\nThe missiles have a very narrow turnradius so that you can't dodge them (which would've been fun, think of N or SMB), you have to shoot them before they reach you, there is no crosshair and aiming your shots is unintuitive (I guess they retain some of your momentum; they definitely do not behave like rockets,  thtough it's not as intuitive to aim as Tribes Ascend).\nThose enemies look exactly like previous enemies with completely different behaviour, except that they have a hat on. Same color, same shape and even the projectiles look the same!\nWhen you fall down a ledge, there is no physics, instead of falling with the same gravity as you would had you  jumped, you get instantly teleported to the lower ground which is very jarring and can make you run into (non-homing) projectiles that you didn't even see.\nIf your gun clips into enemies, you can't kill them until you back out again.\nThe leaderboards are full of cheaters with impossible times and unlike Dustforce, there are no replays; this leaves you with just finishing the levels like that or trying to get 3 stars by beating a preset time (which is sometimes hard but doable) and finishing the level with 100% accuracy which is both a matter of memorization and patience.\n\nThe music is upbeat, which lessens the frustration.\n\nIt's not the worst but it's sub-par.","January 3, 2015","false","2.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baconjets/recommended/298600/","baconjets","BaconJets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baconjets/","307 products in account","This game needs more exposure. It's an addictive FPS where the objective is to shoot every baddie in the level and complete it as fast as possible all while bunny hopping across the treacherous terrain like a maniac. The levels typically can be completed in about 20 seconds and this is where the game taps into the same nerve for efficiency as Super Meat Boy, where you'll complete a level and say "I didn't do that well enough" and do it again. You'll be rated on both time of completion and accuracy and the game continuously brings in bombastic, insane mechanics such as apples that launch into the air and cause an instant fail if they aren't shot before reaching the ground. It's brutal in difficulty as everything is a one hit kill, but entirely fair.\n\nCounteracting the absolute insanity of flying apples and projectiles is the aesthetic. It seems indie devs are starting to move onto turning the low poly graphics of the 90s into a visual style much in the same way as 16 and 8 bit graphics have been. The closest game I can compare this to visually is the Katamari series. Everything has a quirky, colourful aesthetic to it with delightful bouncy music by Bo En. This is a world made out of origami floating inside a PS1 while you're on LSD and it's absolutely amazing. Best of all, it will run on pretty much anything.\n\nThis game is extremely cheap and if you're a fan of FPS games and want something different, you'd be a fool for not picking this up.","August 1, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's even a couple of graphics options that allow the game to scale.  It's got a unique theme and artistic direction.\n\nCons: Nintendo covers this genre way better.   There's not much to the game.  The theme and artistic direction aren't really aimed at PC gamers, it really is something for little schoolgirls or people overdosing on Prozac (call the poisons helpline for medical advice and stop playing computer games with lovehearts all through them).\n\nIt's worth noting it's a tough decision to drop a thumbs down on this one - the developers did achieve what they set out to do, the technical execution was solid enough.

In the game you traverse through different colourful levels, trying to kill alll enemies, not miss any shots and beat your time. It may sound easy but believe me when I say it's not... there will be many obstacles alog the way.\n\nThe love and the hateIf you rage easily in games dont get this, okay? Most of the time you will be repeating the same stage time after time again because you made stupid mistakes. The other portion of the time you will be smashing your keyboard and screaming words that you didnt even know you could say. But: Im not saying thats a bad thing because its not. It adds to playtime and it make winning a level feel very rewarding.\n\nThe two most amazing aspects of this game for me are the artstyle and soundtrack. It really makes me chuckle when I realise Iv been screaming at a bunch of colourful polygons and a happy japenese tune. They both remind me alot of Japan and I think thats what they were going for considering the random japenese writing everywhere. The artstyle consists of minimilistic colourful blobs that make it easy to tell enemies and ground apart with their colours that stand out. The music in itself makes the game. The music is a nice upbeat happy track which makes you forget about all your troubles and just stand and listen. It is so happy I wonder how it could be played over the top of such an evil game! In fact I am listening to it while reading this review and it makes me not want to list a bad point about the game!\n\nThe gameplay in this game is the usual. Considering that it is mainly concentrated on platforming and twitch shooting which I hate it still felt smooth and I felt as if my shots were hitting when they should. The gun felt nice although you couldnt change what gun you had which I thought would of been cool although it probably would of messed up the leaderboards for speedrunners. So I think this game could use a bit more variety to make it a bit more intresting and unique.\n\nSomething this game is missing is a story which although twitch shooters dont normally have a story I think that super meat boy pulled of a pretty nice story so this could probably do it to! I felt as if that made the world I ran through feel empty and without meaning. Also I think a story would of made me want to progress a bit further into the game whereas right now Iv given up because Iv been stuck for an hour. Also It might add to the replayability.\n\nThe verdictLovely planet is a rage inducing twitch shooter with platforming aspects. Its soundtrack and world makes up for the lack of story. Beware you may break something.\n\nLove\n+Soundtrack\n+Graphics\n+Gameplay\n+Long playtime\n\nHate\n-No story\n-Rage\n-Variety\n\n6.5/10\n\nThank you for reading, if you enjoyed dont forget to:\nJoin my curator group!\nVisit my website![axlshack.wordpress.com]\nWatch me on youtube!\n\n\n","July 4, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately while it pulls off the art style and music very well, the gameplay is just completely lacking compared to a game like Katamari. The levels are repetitive and don't have any sort of connecting plot to make people interested. The enemy designs are boring, just boxes with eyes on them. Finally, there are apple bombs that end the level when they land, no matter where you are, which just feels like an unfair design decision. Ultimately I would say that this game is less for typical gamers and more for hardcore speedrunners.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/298600/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Wanted to like this game, and started to, but then when I finally realized the idea behind the game and and mechanics reinforced by the design I ultimately have to say no. I'll start by saying I love the idea of the opposite setting to the gameplay; hard precision fps in a cartoon world. The characters are cute, the music is nice. I have no problem you only use a bow and shoot the game people, and the levels are pretty similar. At first I loved the game, as I found it tough but mostly fair. Most parts just took a little practice. Around world 3 and especially 4, the game really started to go in the wrong direction. I have been playing FPS games all my life and have gotten very good and have played tons of different types of ones, so I can comment pretty confidently on this.\n\nMy first problem is the aiming. There are no crosshairs, which I would be fine with, but the shooting and aiming is off. Instead of your shots going in front of you where they should, they go off to the side and are unpredictable. You have to turn your body to shoot in front of you. They should either have included crosshairs showing where off to the side you shoot, or just had you shoot in front of you without crosshairs. I died so many times from something coming at me in the center of my screen or something I wanted to shoot, only the have the bullets go to the side, or below, or anywhere but where they should have gone. In a shooter requiring precision and timing, this is a no-no.\n\nThere were problems with enemies. First off, there are homing shots. Now normally with a homing shot if you dodge it is misses you, and with a bullet or something it would keep going and hit into something. In this game thats not true somehow. If you dodge a homing shot, you instant die. Which means if you miss the tiny little moving thing (with the poor aiming) coming at you, you auto die and restart the level. My dodges should count, but the same makes a mistake here. Next up are the apples in the air you have to shoot. I have no problem with shooting things out of the air, but the game starts to overuse it. Instead of it at certain parts and in certain levels, the game starts having them throughout the level, and EVERY single level. They usually also use 2 at a time, and pair that with homing missiles. It just becomes annoying. This changes the gameplay. Instead of me having to make precision shots and sometimes shoot things out of the air, but also have little breaks and go at my own pace at times in between things and make levels more fair, you basically just have to keep moving forward at all times and you need to follow the developers set pace. This makes me not feel like I'm moving through the level, but I am only a roller coaster the developers made, and my only input is turning and shooting. It also makes it so even if you dodge and shoot things, if you don't keep pace or see where the apple is, you die and start over. Where before you got to enjoy yourself with the challenge, and time was for the leaderboards and tryhards, now it becomes the only thing that matters.\n\nThe game finally comes to a head in the 4th world, where (dumbest design decision I could think of) the entire world is surrounded in fog, and you can't see ahead of you. This turns every level into you jumping not knowing what is next and where you are going. You see a ball at the last second or the homing missiles right when they are on you, taking away aiming and making it reflexes or luck. The other problem is this forces this game into the worst offense. Instead of it being skill, it becomes repetition. Because you can't see where you are going next, and every next part has a new homing missing you have to hit first try and you die, or 2 apples falling that you can't see but have to keep running forward and start shooting hopefully to hit, you have to find out from error. Every level becomes the same. You start one part, fail, repeat, figure that part out, jump into the next area without seeing whats next, keep running because you hear falling object, get there too late, start over, keep redoing all of that till you sprayed enough to kill the object, get to next part, die because you can't see whats next, die, repeat ALL of it over again, and keep doing that till you finally beat that 1 level. It becomes less based on your skill or ability to think on the fly, but slowly figuring out where each little thing is, and spending 100 tries on one level before you finally beat it. That's not good game design. I can make a boss with 150 hitpoints and you do 1 damage a hit, and you have 1 hit death and you have to start all over. People will spend hours repeating the fight till they beat him, and only a few will, but just because something requires 100 times doesn't make it well made, some people just like it because the few that want to waste their lives to try and beat it feel good about themselves after they finally do. Some of us have better things in life to do. If the game design in these later levels was well made, it would just take skill, and those of us with good aiming and everything would be able to beat it quickly and relatively easily. But spending dozens and hundreds of retries memorizing patterns and every single little thing to finally beat 1 level, isn't worth it or a sign of skilled design. And since there are no checkpoints or amount of life, and 1 hit means you have to redo everything, even if you beat a really hard part or a few in a row, and a new part you havent seen yet punishes you for doing it for the first time, you lose all of your progress, which is annoying. Also since a lot of parts require spraying and some luck, you may not be able to beat the part you did before again for a bit. Multiple parts I had to shoot an apple in the fog I couldn't see before it fell, so I had to start shooting based on memory of where it was from my last playthrough, and I wouldn't know I had been missing it until it was too late, now thats poor game design. And mix all the problems of homing, poor aiming, tons of timed apples, and the grinding memorizing gameplay, and fog, and you made me realize this isn't a game about skill or fun, its about repetition and tiny little progress after tons of repeated efforts. I'd rather find something that rewards talent more than time spent. If only the game stuck with the ideas of the first 2-3 worlds.  5.5/10.","May 21, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Lovely Planet is a Quake-esque first person platformer and bullet hell shooter. People are comparing this game to Super Meat Boy, but I disagree completely. Not only that, but I think this game is ♥♥♥♥♥. Here are my points:\n\nSuper Meat Boy is about precision, and tight controls. Meat Boy himself is basically a walking hitbox- he's a tiny cube that dies if he touches any enemy or any environmental obstacle, and while that insta-death aspect is true in this game, really nothing else is even close to similar to Meat Boy.\n\nUnline Meat Boy, LP is in first-person, which is a challenge for bullet hell-style insta-death games, because traditionally the idea of a bullet hell is that you can see what's going to hit you and be able to dodge it based on your hitbox, whether it be that glwing dot on the back of your spaceship or Meat Boy's tiny, but rigidly defined body. In an FPS, however, you lose that precision. When a bullet is flying toward you, you have no clue how far you need to dodge to actually have it not hit you, which makes a lot of deaths in this game a result of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design rather than lack of skill. First-person view also restricts your vision- in a 2D shooter or platformer, you have all the information right in front of you, but in an FPS, you have to be constantly swiveling around, trying to see everything around you, and that restriction of your vision can be frustrating.\n\nThe same goes for the platforming- very few FPS games ever do precision platforming because it's just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pull off: in a game where you can't see your own legs and can't see your own hitbox, jumping into obstacles and getting a death can often be the result of hazy game design rather than being bad at the game, and people don't like that. People want to die because they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, not because not enough thought went into the design of the game.\n\nYet again, the shooting suffers from similar falling-off points: lack of clarity being the main one. I find it hard to even call this game "precision" when it doesn't even have a crosshair, and if, say, the weapon you're holding came out of your character's midsection Quake-style, then that would have been a little bit better, but no- it actually shoots at an angle to the left, making it incredibly unprecise.\n\nSoundtrack's good enough, though- I get that what they were going for was kind of an ironic, disingenuously quirky theme to contrast with the hard gameplay, but it really just didn't do it for me.\n\nAs you can see, I haven't even played very much of this game yet- I'll admit, I've tried the first level of the second world maybe 200 times and no matter what I do, I die seemingly at complete random when I'm not close to even touching any obstacle. I'm sure it's something that the game just hasn't explained to me, and for ♥♥♥♥s sake I don't need a completely hamfisted tutorial to understand it, but holy ♥♥♥♥. I literally just die every time I move in any direction in the first level of the second world, and I can't get past it. And I'm not terrible at FPSes, either- the game is just so unclear that it's not fun for me at all.\n\n(sigh)... if everything I just said made you leap to your feet and think, "finally! a game just for me!", then for ♥♥♥♥s sake buy it, it's only six dollars. But I think it's a prime example of when a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game gets acclaim just because of the unique visuals and concept, instead of quality gameplay, and for a game that really does lean incredibly heavily on its gameplay, that's a very bad sign.","June 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It's here.\n\nThe concept is simple - kill all enemies, get to the end. Mastering it is another matter. Blasting your way through the levels is extremely fun and addicting. Every shot and movement means life or death in Lovely Planet, yet at no point does the game seem too unforgiving or sadistic. Nailing the moves needed to pass a level feels absolutely epic, whilst trying to find shortcuts to get quicker is uttely compelling and addicting. In terms of content, there are more than enough levels to go through, with plenty of secrets and new enemies to come across along the way.\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack may not be to everyones taste, but they work to make a fully engrossing experience. It makes a refreshing change from the grim, darker colours used in the majority of other shooters giving the game a rather different yet fun feeling. There was always the risk of seeming pretentious or contrived when going for a derivative art style but Lovely Planet seems to nail it.\n\nDo I recommend it? Most definitely. If you like fast-paced games, shooters or platformers in general, get it now. It is hard to think of what better to buy at this price.","August 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

I don't seem to be blinded by the kawaii-vision and I've never played Katamari Damacy.  It's rather dull and shallow.  It's not really a fun world to be in, and you have to "make" your own fun, so to speak.  In the 90 minutes or so I played I got to level 4-10 and... oh boy.\n\nThis is "challenging" for the wrong reasons.  I'm a veteran FPS player and not having a crosshair just feels like a lazy handicap rather than a "feature".  Projectiles having a travel time are fine and all (even though I see them as inappropriate for a twitch/speedrun game like this), but not -that- slow, PLUS the zero crosshair.  This is the basis for my other complaint, which are the apple bombs.  You have to lead your projectiles on a moving, gravity-based sort of artillery round, and if it ever hits the ground you just die.  Immediately.\n\nThat in itself is fine and all, whatever, but when it gets to the point that you have 4 homing bullets zooming at you while your vision is greatly reduced (in the later levels) while you're jumping on platforms that you have to shoot only once to remove the hostile... ketchup blob thing but not twice or it will disintegrate, only trying to rush through all of that to shoot the two apple bombs that are already on their way down because they fired outside your vision range... it doesn't feel like a fair challenge.  It's just dumb.  I feel like they should be an occasional danger rather than nearly as common as the standard fodder enemy.\n\nThe music is passable, not bad but not my preference at all.  The sound effects are awful.  I had to turn them off because the various things that emitted high pitched screeching (akin to the "mosquito" noise) actually started to really bother me because you hear it so damn much.  Not like I was missing out on the single sound effect it made when you either died or shot something, or the single sound effect for firing your gun.  I did find out the hard way, though, that that gimped me from hearing the apple bombs fire so I knew when to hurry up, or even hinting that they were there in the first place.  In some levels I had no idea why I was dying until I blasted through things only to see the apple bombs for half a second before dying.\n\nGot this in a humble bundle, and I sure am glad.  I'd be frustrated if I actually bought this outright for anything more than 2 bucks tops.","May 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

A guy who takes a  interest in a funny Japanese looking game called lovely planet. Apparently the game is not at all as it seems.\n\nIt starts out with some light run and gun shooting over some fluffy music and animation. But at world 2 (close to world 3) the game starts to show it's True colors. The game is hard, very hard and not in the good way. I'm no stranger to frustrating games but this One Just seems unfair.  The point of hard games is to overcome the difficulty and feel like you have achieved something. But lovely planet becomes annoying. My main reasons for this are the bombs and the lack of crosshairs.\n\nTrying not to go into to much detail, bombs are flying fruit that end the level if you don't shoot them before they touch the ground. A lot of the time the game will throw bombs at you out of nowhere and flustered you aim and shoot them. Although alot of the time you will miss. Not due to your lack of skill but because you had no idea where to aim\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is the game kills you in one hit and the difficulty because frustrating due to the lack of crosshair and One hit kill mechanics.\nTl:dr if you are into hard games maybe give it a try but if you are looking for something light don't try this game","May 3","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

The art style is really nice for me, all FPS games no day are just "FAMINE DEATH WAR DESTRUCTION APOCALYPSE SHOOT GUYS BECAUSE... WAR AND KILL PEOPLE AND NUKES AND-" I'm kind of sick of it. But Lovely Planet is just... Cute, how they made a shooting game cute, I don't know, but they did it. They're all just litte blocks that fire purple squares, no death, no blood, no war. Now, this game is pretty hard, in fact, this is a rage game, so I wouldn't play it too casually, each level has a obvious way of beating it, and a hidden quicker route, all levels are timed, they track your accuracy, and, you need to hit all the baddies.

The game starts off easy, and dying is quite forgiving. Every level has a maximum yield of three stars; One for beating the level, another for beating it within a time limit, and one for having 100% accuracy.\n\nAs the game progresses, you will most likely find yourself redoing levels over and over and over because you missed a shot, or you weren't quick enough causing you to not get all three stars. There are basic mechanics in the beginning, and as the game progresses, there are much more complex ones. It really tries to teach you how to play the game during the whole game without too much obvious tips.\n\nNow for the bad of the game.\n\nSadly, the game doesn't feel as if it is made with all the effort the developer could have put into it. The first thing you will find is that the game doesnt have settings to change mouse sensitivity, or even a way to rebind keys. There is also no cross hair for your gun, which can be frustrating considering you are striving for that 100% accuracy. There isn't much else to do after the game is done, making this game pretty straightforward to complete.\n\nIf you are looking for a game to just try and complete without any worry of how many lives you have, or if you just want to try and challenge yourself by completing every level, this is a good game for you. It has a ton of secrets in it, and the achievements work just fine. If you don't like games that can be frustrating, or games that have no storyline whatsoever, then I would recommend looking for another game. This game has a casual feel to it, but it feels a lot like a bullet hell type of casual fps.","August 18, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Those two words sum it up. Oh? You want to know why?\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2cizOpJycc8\n\nFine! So Lovely Planet; just what is this bizarre looking, and named game? In simple terms, it’s a time trial first-person-shooter, with amazing music.\n\nMany might get all giddy over the colours, and yes, the game is certainly colourful. Employing soft pastel-like colours up the hooha.\nPersonally I think it’s the music that makes this game. It’s beautiful, fun, energetic; and it makes you want to go faster, play more and just had a very good time.\nThe music is simply amazingly, I just can’t get enough of it. As I play, I want more, I need to get more, so I need to play more, get deeper into the game and keep on going.\n\nIt’s somewhat faced paced, while remaining delightful, and this is exemplified by the fact that the game runs really well. It’s fast paced, smooth, and will wreak havoc on you if you twitch with a sensitive mouse.\n\nThe developers claim it’s designed for 60fps, and they’re certainly telling the truth. The mechanics, and gameplay need to be smooth and respond to reactions well.\n\nIn the game you just have to save the lovely planet from some nasty buggers. Who all happen to be pink. How dare such a colour invade and disrupt the harmony of this lovely world!\nEliminate them; all. With your trust semi-automatic block thrower, as you run and ballet jump over obstacles and deadly pink goo.\n\nThere isn’t much else to say, I simply enjoy this game. I suck at it, horribly so. Yet I enjoy it.\nThe colours, music, and gameplay mechanics blend together really well and leads to an enormously enjoyable experience.\n\nJust play it, buy it and play it.

Lovely Planet leans more on the challenge and precision of a 100% speedrun attempt side of things. If you’re going through the game just to play it, it can still be as frustrating as trying for the perfect run.\n\nLovely Planet is nice enough to give you unlimited ammo and infinite lives. Let’s say you want to go for a perfect 3-star run. First off, you need to get it done fast. While you’re getting it done fast, you’ll also need to work on your shooting. While you have all of the ammo in the world at your disposal, you are dinged for poor aim. You’ll need to work on the motto of a sniper with the “one shot, one kill” thought process. You may want to work on your platforming skills as well since there is a lot of jumping in Lovely Planet too.\n\nIf you’re just looking to do a simple romp though the game, you’re still up for a challenge. The game starts to place bad guys around corners or put a few of them with itchy trigger fingers all looking and waiting for you to come out of a door. The jumps can be a little difficult as well since the jumping is almost so precise that it feels a little too strong. It takes some getting used to because most games have been focusing on realism and all of a sudden Lovely Planet says, “jumping should be more fun!”\n\nScore: Meh...\n\nWhile the “Meh…” rating may feel a little harsh, it just accurately reflects what this game makes me feel. I realize that it will be around the $6 mark, but even still I can’t say it’s personally worth it. If you’re looking for something to speedrun and set world records against the Steam community or just want to have a tutorial in FPS mechanics, then you may find some enjoyment here. If not, I would say not to bother. It’s got the depth of an Angry Birds game with better gun mechanics than some modern FPS and that’s about it. I’m not sure if this feeling is what they were aiming for, but if it was they nailed it on the head. At the same time it’s just not for me. I’d probably recommend picking it up for around $1 for a time-killer app, but anything more than that just seems excessive.","August 28, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

If I got a baseball bat shot up my ♥♥♥ with a naval cannon ten times a day for the rest of my life and even to my corpse long after I am dead, that would be preferable to ever playing this again. The only reason I have any time in it is because I played a few levels while my 11yr old niece was over and we were crying laughing at how god damn dumb this is.\n\nI am proud to have 99% downvotes on this review because anyone who likes this will forever live in the absence of the knowledge of what the touch of a woman feels like.\n\nEDIT: I am adding game details at the request of another user lol so be mad at him not me. Be mad at steam for obviously having no quality control anymore lolz. The paper cutout style graphics are neat there is nothing wrong with them other than such little thought seemingly went into the design of this game that it seems like the graphics were done in about a days time. However the art style would be okay but it is not because this game is more gay than a gay pride parade float designed to look like two guys making out on top of a rainbow. The weapon is a crap crossbow that you shoot love into the enemies, not death. I am all for people being happy. Go get married be gay be happy, but this game is the equivalent of two guys coming to my house and showing me what they do in their spare time. Keep it private and I am fine with it. This is a super fast shooter where the point is to clear each stage and be the top on the leader boards worldwide. If I had actually accidentally gotten onto the top ten display for any of the levels I would pay to have my name removed. The enemies suck, the weapons suck, the levels suck, all because it looks like a game for the gayest of the gay, or for a two year old. There really is nothing more here to say as far as the game goes, just a really dumb waste of time game that couldn't be fun even in hell.\n\nLook closely at most games and you will see that just because a game has mostly positive user reviews does not mean that it is actually a good game. This is true for a lot of games now that have mostly good user reviews. This isn't even funny-bad, it is just homeless guy laying in his own p-ss in the gutter sad. And gay. Big time.\n\n9/10.

The presentation of this game is amazing. I like the fact that the world inb lovely planet looks to be a game made for the Wii by a bunch of idiots who have never made a game before but behind its adorable mask is an extremely challenging game. Lovely planet starts off with some simple levels with little to no conest from start to finish but quickly becomes frustrating as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game has a couple of enemy types: enemies that stand still, enemies that stand still and shoot you, enemies that shoot hard-as-♥♥♥♥-to-dodge projectiles at you, and red blobs that either stand still or try and touch you. These may sound simple but any one of these guys can ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up in an instant.\n\nThere are no checkpoints in Lovely Planet, meaning you ♥♥♥♥ up, start the level over again. This game reminds me alot of Super Meat Boy. Same premise. Die over and over again until you beat the level then repeat. Admittedly the game isn't  near as polished as Super Meat Boy is.\n\nThe game throws in some artificial difficulty here and there. Like the fact that there is no crosshair, making it hard to aim  and hit moving targets without just spamming the fire button. Also, some of the later levels have some confusing design. If you buy it, you'll know what I mean. Some of the platforming is a little bit "ehh" but overall its pretty fair.\n\nSpeaking of playforming, there are these ♥♥♥♥ing blue platforms. You can only stand on them for a second or two, and there are enemies under them. ♥♥♥♥ those.l\n\nAnyways, I LOVE Lovely Planet. Its a fun FPS that has a moderate amount of content and will make you rage so very hard at the MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING APPLES.\n\nFinel Verdict 8/10","December 19, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combined with the aggressively cheery (and quite good) J-pop soundtrack, it helps mitigate that the game is (at points) ridiculously difficult--I know I would probably have lost my patience with a game of this style that insisted on being grim and gritty. But, beyond that, this kind of game just flows better with minimal environments. By stripping away most potential distractions, the path and objectives (shoot all the red things, don't shoot the blue things, get to the lavender thing) become very clear.\n\nThis is important, because Lovely Planet is a game that encourages you to move very quickly: if you stop moving, you will probably die. This can lead to a pretty rocky start, but as you get the hang of the game, you get better and better at whizzing through levels, bouncing around with your impossible levels of FPS air control and felling enemies with single shots. As such, the game's biggest strength is that its level design facilitates this kind of gameplay. The levels are quite hard, but they are constructed so that finding the right path through them is fun rather than a grind.\n\nOne criticism I have seen leveled at the game is that the gameplay can get somewhat monotonous, but I think this is more due to the visual design than the individual levels. The environments don't change very much between worlds, which, although preserving the nicely minimal atmosphere, gets dull. Also, some of the later enemies' abilities aren't very well explained, and given that everything instantly kills, it can be kind of hard to tell what an enemy is doing the first few times it gets you. However, this doesn't weigh too much on the game compared to the one big problem:\n\nA lot of the challenge comes from tests of accurate shooting, rather than tricky platforming jumps or constant reflex tests. This is quite a sensible approach, but it would be significantly more fun if the gun had a crosshair. As it is, it doesn't, and given that the second and third worlds are largely based around skeet-shooting of a sort (enemies that kill you if they hit the ground) and enemies with homing projectiles that you have to shoot out of the air, respectively, this adds an unnecessarily irritating learning curve to aiming.\n\nStill, none of this overrules the fact that the first time I started to write this review, I thought, "Wait, why am I writing about Lovely Planet when I could be playing Lovely Planet?" and stopped. Once you get the hang of aiming and jumping, it's got addictive gameplay and a nice difficulty curve, set against a pleasant and cheery background. If you're strange like me and find ultrahard trial-and-error gameplay relaxing in a way, this comes recommended; otherwise, proceed with caution.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very simple game, but it is simply challenging. Using simple straightforward mechanics, they make a really captivating game, but it is in no way easy. Im pretty crummy at shooters, so take that into account, but this game is very satisfyingly difficult, and rather unforgiving too. One hot, you're back to the start, no excuses. I love it personally, but it could be very frustrating if a lack of progression at times annoys you. The game make you be precise, and moves you forward at its own pace, which is a very brisk one. You don't often get breathing room, as right after you've killed a couple baddies, two platforms away there is a target you have to hit before it hits the ground, and it just launched. Its got a retro feel, and is pretty much the fps version of Katamari Damacy, a favorite game of mine. Very fun game.","January 7, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combined with the aggressively cheery (and quite good) J-pop soundtrack, it helps mitigate that the game is (at points) ridiculously difficult--I know I would probably have lost my patience with a game of this style that insisted on being grim and gritty. But, beyond that, this kind of game just flows better with minimal environments. By stripping away most potential distractions, the path and objectives (shoot all the red things, don't shoot the blue things, get to the lavender thing) become very clear.\n\nThis is important, because Lovely Planet is a game that encourages you to move very quickly: if you stop moving, you will probably die. This can lead to a pretty rocky start, but as you get the hang of the game, you get better and better at whizzing through levels, bouncing around with your impossible levels of FPS air control and felling enemies with single shots. As such, the game's biggest strength is that its level design facilitates this kind of gameplay. The levels are quite hard, but they are constructed so that finding the right path through them is fun rather than a grind.\n\nOne criticism I have seen leveled at the game is that the gameplay can get somewhat monotonous, but I think this is more due to the visual design than the individual levels. The environments don't change very much between worlds, which, although preserving the nicely minimal atmosphere, gets dull. Also, some of the later enemies' abilities aren't very well explained, and given that everything instantly kills, it can be kind of hard to tell what an enemy is doing the first few times it gets you. However, this doesn't weigh too much on the game compared to the one big problem:\n\nA lot of the challenge comes from tests of accurate shooting, rather than tricky platforming jumps or constant reflex tests. This is quite a sensible approach, but it would be significantly more fun if the gun had a crosshair. As it is, it doesn't, and given that the second and third worlds are largely based around skeet-shooting of a sort (enemies that kill you if they hit the ground) and enemies with homing projectiles that you have to shoot out of the air, respectively, this adds an unnecessarily irritating learning curve to aiming.\n\nStill, none of this overrules the fact that the first time I started to write this review, I thought, "Wait, why am I writing about Lovely Planet when I could be playing Lovely Planet?" and stopped. Once you get the hang of aiming and jumping, it's got addictive gameplay and a nice difficulty curve, set against a pleasant and cheery background. If you're strange like me and find ultrahard trial-and-error gameplay relaxing in a way, this comes recommended; otherwise, proceed with caution.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few reasons why I say this:\n\n1. Despite its lovely facade, the game is HARD. Small mistakes are punished instantly, resulting in the player restarting the level.\n\n2. To add to the difficulty even more, the crosshair is nonexistant. You're only able to shoot "from the hip". Further, the gun doesn't shoot instant projectiles like many shooters. The gun shoots slow moving cubes, so you must accurately predict moving targets' paths.\n\n3. Often, especially later in the game, there are several mission-critical targets flying around at once, and you need the presence of mind to accurately and rapidly shoot each one.\n\nLong story short, the game is hard. Don't bother with it if you're not already reasonably good at the FPS genre.\n\nFor people who are generally competent at FPS games, this game has a lot to offer. Each level gives three stars based on your performance. The first star is just a gimme for completing the level. The second is a time star, meaning you can't just take the time to slowly aim all your shots if you want to perfect the level. The final star is for accuracy and is only awarded when you don't miss a single shot during the level. Perfecting a particularly hard level is a very rewarding experience.\n\nIf you love FPS and love a good rewarding challenge, this game is for you.","October 23, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation of this game is amazing. I like the fact that the world inb lovely planet looks to be a game made for the Wii by a bunch of idiots who have never made a game before but behind its adorable mask is an extremely challenging game. Lovely planet starts off with some simple levels with little to no conest from start to finish but quickly becomes frustrating as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game has a couple of enemy types: enemies that stand still, enemies that stand still and shoot you, enemies that shoot hard-as-♥♥♥♥-to-dodge projectiles at you, and red blobs that either stand still or try and touch you. These may sound simple but any one of these guys can ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up in an instant.\n\nThere are no checkpoints in Lovely Planet, meaning you ♥♥♥♥ up, start the level over again. This game reminds me alot of Super Meat Boy. Same premise. Die over and over again until you beat the level then repeat. Admittedly the game isn't  near as polished as Super Meat Boy is.\n\nThe game throws in some artificial difficulty here and there. Like the fact that there is no crosshair, making it hard to aim  and hit moving targets without just spamming the fire button. Also, some of the later levels have some confusing design. If you buy it, you'll know what I mean. Some of the platforming is a little bit "ehh" but overall its pretty fair.\n\nSpeaking of playforming, there are these ♥♥♥♥ing blue platforms. You can only stand on them for a second or two, and there are enemies under them. ♥♥♥♥ those.l\n\nAnyways, I LOVE Lovely Planet. Its a fun FPS that has a moderate amount of content and will make you rage so very hard at the MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING APPLES.\n\nFinel Verdict 8/10","December 19, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game brings you difficult challenges and tests your reaction time and ability to race against time. If you wanna be the very best and test your skills in this FPS, then this is a game for you.\n\nPros:\n-The price of 4,39€ makes this game totally worth it.\n\n-The art style is cute and beautiful.\n\n-The music is very cute/lovely and makes you happy.\n\n-The game is very challenging and might make you rage.\n\n-You feel satisfied after you have finished one of these almost impossible levels.\n\nCons:\n-The settings isn't very advanced and the settings layout is kinda annoying. But then again, i don't think the settings needs to be very advanced, but some more settings would've been nice. I still think almost every computer here could run this game though.\n\n-There are no guidance or tutorials. You have to figure everything out yourself. You can preview the map before you start though.\n\n\nThis game is difficult and might make you punch your screen, but if you fall for the cuteness in this game, i think you'll be fine. You don't wanna punch those cute blocky creatures you wanna save, right? That's what i thought! :3\nIf you really want a challenge and feel satisfied after completing it, then you should buy this game.\nScore: 8.5/10 "A very enjoyable game."","September 6, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level has the simple goal of shooting all the stuff while running and jumping to the exit. The amount of the stuff coming your way gradually piles on you each level until you are forced to become the world's greatest multitasker and marksman in 15 seconds or less. It is essentially lightning fast Unreal Tournament target practice time attack with a lovely flavoring of Katamari Damacy and Jumping Flash! Calum Bowen/bo en's fantastical soundtrack gives it an even more cheery disposition over the sheer insanity of what Lovely Planet expects you to be able to flawlessly accomplish each level. Especially when it comes to the endgame.\n(If you really like the soundtrack, go give bo en's 'pale machine' a listen or a hundred.)\n\nFor speedrunners, levels are open ended and full of shortcuts and exploits that in other games would meet you with an invisible wall. Not here. Rather, you are likely met with the twenty homing bullets you've activated by skipping most of the map. You'd better turn your mouse sensitivity up to warp speed to get WR times and 100% lazer-precision accuracy in this game. It comes near the level of some of the most complex TF2 jump maps. At a smooth 60 FPS that leaves no room for mistakes if you're hawking for those star ratings, IT IS INTENSE. Plus, leaderboards have just been implemented.\n\nLovely/10.","August 6, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't been this engaged and had this much fun with a video game in a long time.  It's very challenging while not being relentless.  As far as FPS games go, it's pretty different from anything else out there.  The goal of each level is to shoot all the enemies (and certain objects) that are strategically placed throughout the course all in one go.  There are no checkpoints.  If you die, you start the level over.  Completing the level with proficient time and gun accuracy awards you with an extra star.  The game's difficulty increases at a moderate pace and each level offers a unique challenge.  New game mechanics are thrown in at certain points along with new enemies.  You may get stuck on a level now and then but you don't feel hopeless.  You learn from each failure and feel like you are improving as a player.  The gameplay is complimented by the visuals which manage to be quirky and charming all while being extremely simple.  The music fits right along with the art style with an upbeat tempo that puts you in a good mood.\n\nMost AAA titles these days have not given me the amount of enjoyment I've gotten from this game.  And those games cost roughly 5 to 10 times more than this one!  I honestly would have spent 20 dollars for this game. It's a steal for the price.\n\nTry this game.

An FPS dedicated more towards movement than killing, the objective is to get to the end of each stage as quickly as possible while shooting all the baddies with your star gun, avoiding all the red things that could kill you and more. There's a pretty clear path through each stage yet it seems each (if not all) have easily missed shortcuts and other tricks that shave seconds off each run. Its frantic, restart-as-soon-as-you-miss mechanics works so well in reinforcing the drive to improve your time. Each group of stages introduces new mechanics gradually but in a way that challenges without becoming frustrating. Of course, these mechanics compound in the later stages becoming downright sadistic at points.\n\nI'm disappointed by the lack of leaderboards as the world record just doesn't give nearly enough motivation to improve. The movement is also a bit floaty and takes some getting used to if you're more familar with Source movement but it's consistent throughout.\n\nTotally worth the $6.","August 2, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game brings you difficult challenges and tests your reaction time and ability to race against time. If you wanna be the very best and test your skills in this FPS, then this is a game for you.\n\nPros:\n-The price of 4,39€ makes this game totally worth it.\n\n-The art style is cute and beautiful.\n\n-The music is very cute/lovely and makes you happy.\n\n-The game is very challenging and might make you rage.\n\n-You feel satisfied after you have finished one of these almost impossible levels.\n\nCons:\n-The settings isn't very advanced and the settings layout is kinda annoying. But then again, i don't think the settings needs to be very advanced, but some more settings would've been nice. I still think almost every computer here could run this game though.\n\n-There are no guidance or tutorials. You have to figure everything out yourself. You can preview the map before you start though.\n\n\nThis game is difficult and might make you punch your screen, but if you fall for the cuteness in this game, i think you'll be fine. You don't wanna punch those cute blocky creatures you wanna save, right?

I thought, "finally, a FPS that doesn't involve shooting someone in the head." It is quite addicting and fun, and the frame rate is always high. I played this on a 2009 Mac, and i thought it might be a little slow, just like all my other games. But the settings make the game run at a good 60-100 fps at all times. However the layout is kind of weird and hard to understand and there arent any crosshairs for your gun (this is vital in the gameplay), but other than that its totally worth those 6 bucks.\n\n9/10","September 6, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level has the simple goal of shooting all the stuff while running and jumping to the exit. The amount of the stuff coming your way gradually piles on you each level until you are forced to become the world's greatest multitasker and marksman in 15 seconds or less. It is essentially lightning fast Unreal Tournament target practice time attack with a lovely flavoring of Katamari Damacy and Jumping Flash! Calum Bowen/bo en's fantastical soundtrack gives it an even more cheery disposition over the sheer insanity of what Lovely Planet expects you to be able to flawlessly accomplish each level. Especially when it comes to the endgame.\n(If you really like the soundtrack, go give bo en's 'pale machine' a listen or a hundred.)\n\nFor speedrunners, levels are open ended and full of shortcuts and exploits that in other games would meet you with an invisible wall. Not here. Rather, you are likely met with the twenty homing bullets you've activated by skipping most of the map. You'd better turn your mouse sensitivity up to warp speed to get WR times and 100% lazer-precision accuracy in this game. It comes near the level of some of the most complex TF2 jump maps. At a smooth 60 FPS that leaves no room for mistakes if you're hawking for those star ratings, IT IS INTENSE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/298600/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","As a person who is not at all familiar with FPSes and barely plays them, I am most certainly the best candidate for writing a review on this hardcore twitch-FPS game.\n\nI am just absolutely in love with this game.\n\nI expected to enjoy it at least in the easier parts of the game, but I was not ready for how much bloody fun this little game is to play, and I did not expect how INSANE it could get. Even more insane is the fact that... yeah, I *can* deal with this. Somehow. (At least, up through world 4 as of writing)\n\nThis may be because, secretly, this game is identical to precision platformers in every way other than the basic gameplay style. Steep but smooth difficulty curve? Check. Short, but challenging and tightly-designed levels that never drag on too long? Check. Scoring system that focuses on optimization and speed? Check. Instant restarts? Check. Heavy trial-and-error based gameplay? Check. Lives counter? Haha, not in the slightest.\n\nIt really *is* right in the same vein as precision platformers. Yet it's not the least bit frustrating. At all. I have not found myself raging at the game even once in nearly 10 hours of play (as of writing). There are a few minor instances of somewhat questionable level design (mostly in the form of apples that you have to blindly shoot in world 4, but there are only a few of those) that annoyed me, but every obstacle is overcomeable with enough practice and there's never too long of an iteration time to get back to where you messed up. The more challenging/precise a level tends to be, the shorter, too, so you don't have sudden difficulty spikes in the form of longer, mind-numbingly fast-paced levels that come out of nowhere. Everything feels smooth and natural. You approach a new level with a feeling of "how the hell am I ever going to do this" and then you beat it and have the same experience with the next level. Going back and replaying the easier levels after completing the harder levels only makes them better, too; you can completely annihlate them and feel like a champion for doing so.\n\nAlso, did I mention how gorgeous the game is all around? Absolutely wonderful art style, fantastic soundtrack, very polished controls. It's presented wonderfully, and the cutesy wrapping hides one hell of a hardcore experience. For $6 this is a steal, I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about it and it's certainly in contention for game of the year for me.\n\nI also wouldn't be surprised to find that I am better at FPS games than 90% of the people who've been playing triple-A titles for the past 5 years, because I doubt any of them give as intense of a training course as this game.\n\nNow for world 5 to kick my posterior mercilessly... help...\n\nEDIT: Post world-5 update.\nSo... the game gets incredibly quirky... and even more amazing... some of these levels are among my all-time favorites in any game I've ever played, haha, and the difficulty never lets up, only getting crazier. And yet... no frustration. At all. Nearly 18 hours to perfect every level and I did not get the slightest bit mad at the game. It's just... perfect, I don't know what else to say.","November 5, 2014","true","74.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation of this game is amazing. I like the fact that the world inb lovely planet looks to be a game made for the Wii by a bunch of idiots who have never made a game before but behind its adorable mask is an extremely challenging game. Lovely planet starts off with some simple levels with little to no conest from start to finish but quickly becomes frustrating as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game has a couple of enemy types: enemies that stand still, enemies that stand still and shoot you, enemies that shoot hard-as-♥♥♥♥-to-dodge projectiles at you, and red blobs that either stand still or try and touch you. These may sound simple but any one of these guys can ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up in an instant.\n\nThere are no checkpoints in Lovely Planet, meaning you ♥♥♥♥ up, start the level over again. This game reminds me alot of Super Meat Boy. Same premise. Die over and over again until you beat the level then repeat. Admittedly the game isn't  near as polished as Super Meat Boy is.\n\nThe game throws in some artificial difficulty here and there. Like the fact that there is no crosshair, making it hard to aim  and hit moving targets without just spamming the fire button. Also, some of the later levels have some confusing design. If you buy it, you'll know what I mean. Some of the platforming is a little bit "ehh" but overall its pretty fair.\n\nSpeaking of playforming, there are these ♥♥♥♥ing blue platforms. You can only stand on them for a second or two, and there are enemies under them. ♥♥♥♥ those.l\n\nAnyways, I LOVE Lovely Planet. Its a fun FPS that has a moderate amount of content and will make you rage so very hard at the MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING APPLES.\n\nFinel Verdict 8/10","December 19, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Want to know why? Too bad, moving on.\nThen, you have to shoot red cubes that shoot back at you, although if you shoot the cubes' projectiles, they die.\nIf you get shot by them, you restart the level, but the timer doesn't reset. The "gun" is pretty cool. I wish all guns had spinning stars on the barrels. The only thing that could make this game better is if it had a reticle. Other than that, it's a Japanese(?) game with mostly English words that doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't really have to.\n\nTL;DR: Get this game, you won't regret it.","January 2, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And that's only after a grand total of maybe 70 minutes of playing it. Don't let the cute aesthetic with its simple pastel colored shapes and cutesy cheerful anime music deceive you, this thing right here is about as hardcore FPS as it gets. Why? First person precision jumping levels while wielding a gun without a crosshair, that's why. You have to hit every single enemy or you can't win the level. You have to dodge every projectile because everything is a one-hit-kill. You have to shoot out apples from the sky after they're being launched from a catapult before they touch the ground, otherwise you lose the level. And for some enemies you actually have to shoot their projectiles themselves since they home in on you, before you can engage the enemies themselves. The game is hard, and I do mean hard because everything is on the clock, events constantly trigger while you're just moving forward and if you're not 100% concentrated on the game you can forget getting anywhere here.\n\nThe game does give you some help though, at the start of any level you can preview the upcoming challenges to prepare yourself for what's to come, which is a nice feature, especially when the game at the end of a level tells you you missed an enemy and you have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clue where he was hiding.\n\nFor all the praise I can give it for being an undiluted FPS experience that truly tests your skills as a player, there are a couple of criticisms I want to lodge at it. First and foremost, it seems like a very short game overall. They claim that there are a hundred levels in the game but after 70 minutes, my arthritic old ♥♥♥ that's not used to twitch shooters anymore managed to get through 75% of the levels. And that's with excessive trial and error since most levels can be beaten in a couple of seconds. So I simply have to assume that by the end of it, a more skilled player will beat the game in under say 2 hours. It doesn't cost much so I guess the price is justified, but in the end, the whole experience is just running through levels as fast as possible while taking out all the enemies and never getting hit. There's literally no story here, just obstacle course after obstacle course and it's clearly geared towards speedrunners because the game keeps time of your performance and then insults you by showing you all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who managed to beat the game 5 times faster than you did. I can appreciate the game for what it is and the execution is basically perfect, but to me this isn't a game that I'll be remembering all that much because there's really no substance there. I'm the kind of gamer that likes a game to tell me a story, not just present me with some mechanics, well thought out they though may be.\n\nThey're not asking for much cash here so I guess even though I'm not overly pleased with the game, I'll give it a recommendation for people who really want a challenging, unforgiving shooter that just might catch you off guard because of the unconventional aesthetic. Though if you want to have it a bit cheaper, there's currently a Humble Bundle offer that's definitely worth picking up so you can get it a bit cheaper.","January 3, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like how there are no loads between respawns, when you restart the level.  This allows your mind to get lost in trying to acheive each level perfectly. You may retry the same level many times trying to get through it, but it does not feel tedious since you are thrown right back into the action. The simlicity of the graphics really tears the game down to its essential components. I have not played much yet, but I can see this being my new go to time waster.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that I have a tendency to hold my breath through each runthrough.  I am sure that is not healthy, but it is just that intense. Lucky for me that most levels can be completed in under 30 seconds.","January 3, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think its a bad idea for a game; in fact there are some challenging levels as you get farther into the game.\n\nHowever, its too easy to find yourself outside off the planned path the developers want to you take, and then kill everything and finish the level. You can avoid the bombs and the spikes, and virtually all the challenge.\n\nBut there is hope, in the genre of "my first FPS" this could be a very nice game.

The game boils down to shooting anything that is red and/or has an angry face while navagating through a labyrinth like map that can range from easy to hard all while being timed as you compete against a leaderboard of other players who have beat the game in a certain amount of time. What makes the game difficult, enjoyable, and challenging is that the gun does not have cross hairs and that the movement of your character is enhanced (in the sense that you move fast, you jump far, and you just have an overall snappy and springy movement). The time aspect makes the game addicting as you constantly try to compete with others (the closest I've gotten is roughly 5.45 seconds to complete a map where the #10 rank for that map was 5.25 and goes down to almost 2.20 seconds for rank #1).\n\nThis has been repeated quite a few times in the reviews I've read below, but I would like to repeat them once more as they are a very accurate description of the game. Lovely Planet takes the speedrunning aspects of Supermeatboy, the springy mechanics of the Super Sam series, and the aesthetics of Katmary Damacy to create an enjoyable game for the price that is offered of $5.99. I myself bought the game in a recent humblebundle for roughly $5 with other games, but would recommend it to anyone who finds themself debating if $5.99 (or the regional equivalent) is worth the investment. If you are someone who enjoys speed running and some nostalgia from old Japanese-esque aesthetic PS2 games then Lovely Planet is worth the price.","January 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think its a bad idea for a game; in fact there are some challenging levels as you get farther into the game.\n\nHowever, its too easy to find yourself outside off the planned path the developers want to you take, and then kill everything and finish the level. You can avoid the bombs and the spikes, and virtually all the challenge.\n\nBut there is hope, in the genre of "my first FPS" this could be a very nice game. When my kids get a little older I will introduce them to this game and I think they'll love it. The colors are bright, there's no blood or gore, just right for kids starting to play games.\n\nOverall good kids game.

A mixture of snapshot FPS and time-trial platformer, levels are just long enough to be manageable and rewarding, but require several attempts before you get the hang of the precise movements.\n\nThe only cons are it could've used more polish and less repetition.  The levels aren't painfully identical, but there isn't quite enough variety to win me over.  A few of the platforms could've been just slightly better placed to allow for better flow, and while the simple art style is okay, it could've been smoother.

The game boils down to shooting anything that is red and/or has an angry face while navagating through a labyrinth like map that can range from easy to hard all while being timed as you compete against a leaderboard of other players who have beat the game in a certain amount of time. What makes the game difficult, enjoyable, and challenging is that the gun does not have cross hairs and that the movement of your character is enhanced (in the sense that you move fast, you jump far, and you just have an overall snappy and springy movement). The time aspect makes the game addicting as you constantly try to compete with others (the closest I've gotten is roughly 5.45 seconds to complete a map where the #10 rank for that map was 5.25 and goes down to almost 2.20 seconds for rank #1).\n\nThis has been repeated quite a few times in the reviews I've read below, but I would like to repeat them once more as they are a very accurate description of the game. Lovely Planet takes the speedrunning aspects of Supermeatboy, the springy mechanics of the Super Sam series, and the aesthetics of Katmary Damacy to create an enjoyable game for the price that is offered of $5.99. I myself bought the game in a recent humblebundle for roughly $5 with other games, but would recommend it to anyone who finds themself debating if $5.99 (or the regional equivalent) is worth the investment. If you are someone who enjoys speed running and some nostalgia from old Japanese-esque aesthetic PS2 games then Lovely Planet is worth the price.","January 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lovely Planet takes the speedrunning aspects of Supermeatboy, the springy mechanics of the Super Sam series, and the aesthetics of Katmary Damacy to create an enjoyable game for the price that is offered of $5.99. I myself bought the game in a recent humblebundle for roughly $5 with other games, but would recommend it to anyone who finds themself debating if $5.99 (or the regional equivalent) is worth the investment. If you are someone who enjoys speed running and some nostalgia from old Japanese-esque aesthetic PS2 games then Lovely Planet is worth the price.","January 14, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To start, Lovely Planet is a game about shooting angry red guys. In order to get all 3 stars for a level, you must kill every enemy, beat the level fast enough, and not miss a single shot. With the low shot speed of your bullets, this last one can be a pain, but all of the game's enemies are stationary (except for apples, which can hardly be considered enemies) and you'll get used to the gun.\n\nThe game has great visuals and music, especially if you enjoyed the katamari series. Even after hearing the same song for a few hours, you shouldn't get sick of it unless you really hate jpop.\n\nFor me, the game really shines in its wonderful level design and difficulty curve. The first world is quite easy and will introduce you to the mechanics without being too punishing. As the game progresses, however, you'll find that every new level is just slightly outside of your skill level - not easy but never impossible. As someone who never plays first person shooters, I never felt that a level was too difficult to complete with all 3 stars. As far as the level design, there were multiple occasions where I saw what the level wanted me to do and got giddy with excitement, completely in love with the elegance of the design.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. This is a game that I will always remember fondly, and I'll probably play it again in a few years when I've forgotten the specifics of the levels.","June 26, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the surface, this game begins as a fun, cute platforming FPS in which you have to reach the finish pole while also eliminating every enemy in the level, these enemies being red blobs of various shapes. Some of these enemies shoot bullets which you can parry by shooting with your own gun. Wanting to get all the achievements, I had to get 3 stars on every level, one for finishing, one for finishing quickly, and one for 100% accuracy. This was an enjoyable challenge because it kept things tense in the first few worlds as I had to aim my shots carefully and be hasty.\n\nThe last 2 worlds, Swamp and Mountains, were a whole different story however. Homing bullets were introduced, ones that you must shoot or death is basically guaranteed. Levels became misty, and homing bullets started flying out of nowhere. Bombs that are launched and must be shot before they hit the ground or you are killed instantly involve having to gauge where the bomb will be at a certain time and shooting at that spot, which is more fun than it sounds. With all these elements combined, eventually, the game turned into one of the hardest FPS/platforming experiences I've had, at least in order to get 3 stars in every level. Due to a requirement of 100% accuracy, every shot had to count, and no excess shots were allowed. After hours of memorising and practice, I would have to progress through the level, flicking and swiping to the next target, doing 90 and 180 turns constantly in order to shoot the various obstacles in my way. Despite all this difficulty, when you finally reach that finish pole with 100% accuracy, it feels makes you feel like some action movie star or an aim-botter of some kind :P. While torturing and rage-inducing, the experience of succeeding in this way is unmatched, and the main reason why I recommend this game, and what makes it so enjoyable.\n\nThere are also a number of secrets in the game, which are fun to look for and find, especially the fabled "Planet Shrine" secret which is an elusive one and may require some research to be discovered.\n\nOverall, much better than it seems on the surface, and should be played and 3 starred until the end for maximum enjoyment.\n\n10/10","May 22, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its easy to get stuck on levels, not because you can't beat them, but because you can't beat the top scores and you just know in the back of your mind that this next run will do it.  Just don't expect anything spectacular from it since the whole goal is an fps quickrun challenge.\nIts definitely worth checking out.

First the game is made of every j-pop fantasy the nineties could muster. Its like Keita Takashi's design seinsibility with Jumping Flash's music in a world so symbolic it can only be parody. That said it's not a vertigo introducing exploration platformer like Jumping Flash was, rather is a simplified run and gun FPS with mild platforming elements and a lot of twitch gameplay. Not as demanding as Hotline Miami, but the premise shoot, dodge, jump, react is simple enough you get straight into flow. Being in flow is a good thing. Flow is like when the Harlem Globetrotters made a 3 point shot from inside your cranuim as you eat  a hot dog. The game disurpts Japanese mascot culture with a neo-psychedlic style reminiscent of Harajku fruits. The levels are small and bite size meaning the game is neo-arcade and like Hotline requires a bit of replay. However it never tried my patience... so far. even with a slightly buggy copy cat ps2 controller and a somewhat buggy laptop trackpad however that said the trackpad doesn't register numerous LMBs in game for some reason making the firing mechanism a tad frustrating, but easily solvable. I am only 6 levels in, but its a joyful shot of adrenaline and a lot of fun to play.","October 5, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the surface, this game begins as a fun, cute platforming FPS in which you have to reach the finish pole while also eliminating every enemy in the level, these enemies being red blobs of various shapes. Some of these enemies shoot bullets which you can parry by shooting with your own gun. Wanting to get all the achievements, I had to get 3 stars on every level, one for finishing, one for finishing quickly, and one for 100% accuracy. This was an enjoyable challenge because it kept things tense in the first few worlds as I had to aim my shots carefully and be hasty.\n\nThe last 2 worlds, Swamp and Mountains, were a whole different story however. Homing bullets were introduced, ones that you must shoot or death is basically guaranteed. Levels became misty, and homing bullets started flying out of nowhere. Bombs that are launched and must be shot before they hit the ground or you are killed instantly involve having to gauge where the bomb will be at a certain time and shooting at that spot, which is more fun than it sounds. With all these elements combined, eventually, the game turned into one of the hardest FPS/platforming experiences I've had, at least in order to get 3 stars in every level. Due to a requirement of 100% accuracy, every shot had to count, and no excess shots were allowed. After hours of memorising and practice, I would have to progress through the level, flicking and swiping to the next target, doing 90 and 180 turns constantly in order to shoot the various obstacles in my way. Despite all this difficulty, when you finally reach that finish pole with 100% accuracy, it feels makes you feel like some action movie star or an aim-botter of some kind :P. While torturing and rage-inducing, the experience of succeeding in this way is unmatched, and the main reason why I recommend this game, and what makes it so enjoyable.\n\nThere are also a number of secrets in the game, which are fun to look for and find, especially the fabled "Planet Shrine" secret which is an elusive one and may require some research to be discovered.\n\nOverall, much better than it seems on the surface, and should be played and 3 starred until the end for maximum enjoyment.\n\n10/10","May 22, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an aesthetic that isn't merely like that of games like Katamari Demacy but explicitly displays those inspirations, and is one I'd never thought would be a part of an FPS experience but now seems so much better than any other FPS's aesthetic that playing even something like Team Fortress 2 (which could be much less visually appealing than it is) seem trite.  The soundtrack, done by Calum Bowen aka bo en, is jaw droppingly original and compells the experience beyond any skill based FPS I've ever played. One of my all time favorite games and my most highly recommended experience on Steam.","June 18, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
