I have changed it to a positive review. It is worth at least a few hours of entertainment, just really wish they wouldve created something Spectacular ^.^\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is the same exact game as the first one. With a slight graphical side-grade..... Hardly any ACTUALLY new maps unless you want to spend dozens of retries if not more on the insane maps... (which are really only hard because of the negative placement of your start) - the only difficulty programmed into in this game is when you start at a large disadvantage while having to 2v1 or 3v1 sometimes. That IS the Only difficulty programmed into this game.\n\nI would give a thumbs up if they had actually created a $20 game instead of this $10 copy of the first. I would not say this game is worth the money sadly, considering everything is just about the same as the first with some environmental effects thrown in. Just wish they wouldve really taken the time to Develop an amazing full content game.","June 2","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

A challenging one too, it gets verz interesting and tough at the end of the first constellation. Recommended! :)","June 5","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
