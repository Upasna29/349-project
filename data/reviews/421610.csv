(Updated Review as of 3/3/16)\n\nIf you ever thought to find your normal everyday life wasn't normal, then you've come to the right place, we start out our story of the Azure/Blue/etc. with Touya Kagari, a normal High School student with his pals Hinata and Akira, but when Touya comes to a place of remembrance, he meets a mysterious girl by the name of Es, and the two start their journeys together.\n\nAs it is, XBlaze is the prequel story to the popular fighting game series "BlazBlue", the lore you'll seek from BlazBlue will also be mentioned here as well, including some characters within similar familiar names and other viable info. Originally available on the PS3/PSV, the Steam release is more or less the same as it is, with a few PC options to tweak to your style, along with the option to have the subtitles either in full English or Japanese. The game is pure Visual Novel, so the game relies on its own system called the "Toi" (which also has Character Bios), using it wisely will decide your fate, from getting the good, bad, or even the gag endings. Using "Tips" will let you know on info of the XBlaze world, though some of it will differ depending on which character route you're planning to clear.\n\nEither way, the port is great, and it loads scenes and such faster than the console version (also, bonus extras if you happen to clear all routes in the game), but yes, as usual with majority PC players, there will be problems with people trying to run it, it happens to some, but not all, but it happens. That's what there's the forums/discussions are they for people to check out the issues and for users that can help out on it if at all possible.\n\nAs of 3/3/16, a 9.1MB Patch/Update/Etc. has fixed some of the game's issues as I've originally mentioned before, that being the A.O.S. crash, the half and half localization errors, and probably crashes when trying to continue certain chapters/routes. There still might be some bugs in there, but will be known whenever necessary.\n\nWell, if this gets enough praise and sales, I and maybe others will hope that XBlaze Lost: Memories would come out too, perhaps!

I think one of the great things about how they went about doing it is that lore is first introduced then explained (such as Izayoi and its curse). This gives some satisfaction to those who are fans of the series as well as not alienating the new comers.\n\nI have been a great fan of the game, ever since I saw a preview of the first game, Blazblue: Calamity Trigger, in a magazine. This game was great in helping me answer some questions (the origins of Takamagahara) as well as providing me with more questions for this already confusing lore.\n\nThe art is not that amazing. It looks abit pixlated and stretched on my monitor. However, the music featured was nice, some of the tracks even paying hommage to the blazblue tracks. Moreover, the game play was interesting. As a visual novel, the game allows you to "make desicions" through reading articles. The type and amount of articles you read affect the decisions made by the characters, and by extension, the type of ending that you would get. Lastly, the story was actually quite cliche. If you are a long time anime viewer, the plot would not surprise you one bit. Before events happened, I had already kinda predicted what was about to occur.\n\nThe major turn off of this game for me was the main character.  Did you watch the anime Gulity Crown? The MC is almost exactly like Shu , Season 1 Shu. He is seriously irritating. He is the kind of character which I know would die first if he was not MC.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time playing this game. I recommend this game to any Blazblue fan out there.","March 10","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
