After a google search it turns out this is an app ported like I suspected.\n\nAs it is it definitely feels like a ripoff when the game is free on mobile. The hilarious part is they've kept the bits of the game that were clearly meant to get you to pay money to make the game easier and now they are just there as either a really dumb mechanic or an unreasonably costly character that was clearly meant to be purchased in the app which has microtransactions while this port does not. This healer character is available from the start for 25k gold...which isn't really feasible unless you opt to not upgrade your guys. Honestly though you won't require the upgrades the combat is ridiculously easy the only reason I died once was because I wanted to see how the death system works. This is it: your character dies on the field and a gravestone drops there, you click on gravestone whenever you want and pay gold to resurrect him instantly....The game still has the exact same pay2win mechanic of letting you instant resurrect characters mid-battle for currency even though it is ported onto a pc without any microtransaction system, they clearly couldn't be bothered to give it any semblance of a challenge but just throwing away the resurrection in battle option completely.\n\nOnto the game itself:\n\nGeneral gameplay: Bad. Abilities are dull and damage values make no sense, your monk has a healing touch ability which damages enemies or heals allies. Now this ability is somehow able to damage regular humans but does less slightly damage than his basic staff attack, this would be okay if the holy spells annihilated the undead they are meant for. In reality when you do use holy abilities on undead enemies you get a slight damage increase that a lot of times is completely unncessary.\n\nThe UI is clunky, it's clearly designed for a phone and the friggin bottom part doesn't even fit the screen properly. The gold counter at the top during battle areas is halfway offscreen so you can only see the bottom half. Oh, did I mention the game feels a need to throw up a loading screen every single time you end your turn for no good reason? It's doing nothing but calculating the enemy's next move so why can't it just have a little animation saying loading at the corner like every other game? Especially when two thirds of the bottom of your screen are available because the ui is so badly placed.\n\nAudio is just as bad, there is an attempt to make the game stereo but barely, characters and sfx are either in one audio channel or the other. When a character is walking and the camera is following him while he talks this results in the audio literally jumping back and forth between both sides a couple times in a second while the other side's dialogue disappears completely.\n\nGraphics: Again, not good. It looks like your standard facebook fantasy game, a background and then a sprite laid on top which looks out of place. The sprites are admittedly not bad lookingt but they are very, very low resolution. If you even zoom in a little you can see the blur which is fine because I play zoomed all the way out to avoid the ugly.,, that is until the game forces me to see it. Sometimes when your enemy attacks it zooms in to show them, why? The models are blurry as hell why on earth would you choose to zoom in and show the low resolution models along with the glitchy animations?\n\nWhich brings us to the glitchy animations, for starters all the characters in the game float. Not because of magic but because it's easier than a walking animation. Even characters that say they are walking clearly just glide across the floor while their feet drag behind them liike they were either sliding on ice or a puppet getting dragged along. Now for attacking, when units shoot at each other instead of just shooting directly at each other the game decides to throw in the animation at whichever one of the six sides makes the most sense to it. Half the time this results in the arrows coming in from a completely different direction than the person who shot it. Okay, that's somewhat tolerable, now here's the kicker: the game makers couldn't be bothered to flip the sprites when they move or attack. This means in a firefight you can have the two guys literally looking and firing away from each other while arrows are doing sharp 90 degree turns to hit enemies,\n\nThe plot is dull and lackluster and the one saving grace is the narrator that does the major cutscenes is decent but the devs even manage to screw that up by screwing up the timing between audio clips and creating awkward gaps of silence in order to show off some ugly animation that bears no relevance to the plot.\n\nDon't buy this game it isn't worth it right now 40% off and it definitely won't be worth it at full price, if you really want to play it do it on mobile for free.","October 8, 2015","false","1.6"," 110 of 123 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","110","123","3","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/363960/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Introduction‘That looks like a fun game.’ Those were literally the first words that popped in my mind when I saw some of the screenshots of Devils & Demons. It’s not uncommon for us gamers to think that, I assume, but still; I was intrigued to say the least. And I somehow naturally assumed it would be a mix of a few other games (like Diablo, Puzzle Quest and turn-based strategies) but then combined into one, amazingly fun, little package. So, was I right or…?\n\nGameplayNot entirely, but yes. The game certainly has some influences from aforementioned games. In my opinion, at least. It has the atmosphere from Diablo and Puzzle Quest, the same casual feeling of Puzzle Quest and… turn-based strategies that can be found in many, many other games. Thankfully Devils & Demons still has an identity of its own. Even if it is at times (seriously) flawed.\n\nFirst of all, let’s discuss the most important part: the combat. ‘Combat’ in this case means turn-based (semi-)strategic battles. You start out on a big map where you can move freely along a grid. Downside is that you always have to use turns, even when there are no enemies around. This gets tiring fairly quickly.\nThe battles themselves consist of multiple characters (who you can each control individually) using specific skills to destroy the enemies around you. For example, you have a Thief who can backstab enemies and a Demon Hunter who can travel great distances and inflict damage by shooting arrows. There are multiple classes, most of which can be unlocked by just playing through the game (so far), but there’s also an option buy classes. Here it becomes painfully clear that the game was built around in-app/game purchases…\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530372336\nAnd I can’t tell how sad this makes me. When I first started the game I was enjoying it very much. And then it suddenly goes overboard (just a few hours in) by making some of the enemies feel overpowered or just by throwing some extra enemies at you. Now, there’s no need to actually buy lives or potions with real life money, but you will have to use earned gold (in-game) to buy potions or revive your allies. A few hours into the game I started spending much more gold than I originally wanted to. But I had no choice; it was either this or trying it again and I’m not crazy enough to start the same battle again and again: I play games to relax and/or for fun, not for frustration.\n\nNow, you can argue with me that the battles require tactics/strategy, and I couldn’t agree more, but if you start to get that feeling that the game is playing unfair then you know something’s up. What a wasted opportunity this is; the game is actually very fun until your characters start dropping like flies. It seems they haven’t been able to find a good balance between leveling up your characters with the acquired gold and using that same gold to buy things like extra potions. You need to do a lot of grinding if you want to earn enough to get you through the game. Enemies drop gold as well, but it’s hardly ever enough. Ultimately you just have to depend on world events and other quests.\n\nThe setting is great, reminiscent of Diablo. Cities and villages are on fire and demons, skeletons and other creatures are waiting for you in the shadows. I would’ve liked it to be a little darker even (the title isn’t enough I’m afraid) but it’s not a big deal. It’s a personal taste.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530372372\nBesides the clearly visible mobile roots there are a few other things that bothered me. One that dragged the experience down, one that didn’t, but as always they’re worth mentioning:\nI think it was a bug on my system but the tutorial dialog windows were shown in big colored boxes that filled the entire screen. I’m not sure if it’s intentional – I don’t think so – but it’s incredibly ugly and distracting.\nAnd after each player turn there’s a load screen of about 1-2 seconds. It’s slightly annoying and it’s more frustrating due to the fact that when your enemies have made a move none of this happens: you get to play again immediately. Every time it happened it became very clear that I was just playing a game. It ruins the immersion completely.\n\nOn the maps you’ll also be able to find treasure chests and other interactive items that you can click on if a character gets near. These usually contain health potions, mana potions and gold. But exploring also brings out other dangers (which are usually still part of the story, mind you): more enemies. And then the whole ritual begins again. These enemies usually aren’t so tough, but if you have to fight 10-15 more just a few minutes later then it’s a different story. Now, this differs per situation so it’s not always the case, but it has happened to me at least a few times.\n\nSo the game is basically ruined by the terrible economy that should’ve either been removed completely or tweaked to make things more fair (by handing out more gold, spawning less enemies or receiving less damage). There really is a good game beneath it all, believe me.\nIf you’re a patient person or like hard(er) games in general then by all means go give it a try. You won’t be disappointed, trust me.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe music is bombastic and worthy of a strategy RPG. The lines, while sometimes a bit corny, are generally well spoken but they are repeated a few many times in my opinion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530372301\nOkay, we’ve come to the part that reminded me of Diablo and Puzzle Quest in the first place: the graphics. They consist of nicely animated characters (although not fully) and environments, but in this case they’re unfortunately a little too pixelated/blurry when run in full screen. If you run it in a window and don’t zoom in too closely then it all looks nice and sharp, however.\n\nLength/Replay ValueI haven’t been able to finish the game yet and I don’t think I ever will. Right now it’s practically impossible or just extremely time consuming. I think I’ve played it enough the last couple of days to write a little bit about it, though, hence this review. But I assume that finishing the game will take you up to 30 hours, maybe even more. That’s plenty of value.\n\nConclusionWhat could’ve been a great, fun game is now nothing more than a good, but frustrating game. The game isn’t all bad: the graphics are mostly magnificent, the audio sufficient and the gameplay is solid. All of it is just ruined by the now-changed economy system that should’ve been either reworked or removed in its entirety to make it less punishing and all in all just fairer. Despite all that it’s still a good game.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Plenty of classes and skills\n+ World events\n+ Decent XP system\n+ Amazing, detailed art…\n\nMixed:\n+/- …which is just a little too blurry\n\nCons:\n- Roots of the original IAP system are still clearly visible\n- Why is there still turn-based movement if there are no enemies around?\n- Load screen after every *player* turn\n- Very unbalanced economy which makes it feel unfair\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 6.9 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

Although Devils and Demons is in this category it failed to capture my attention within the first hour. During my play time the units I controlled vastly overpowered the enemies to the point where just going straight in without strategy will still win every battle. I understand it being like this for the first battle, but not after an hour into the game. In one random encounter I was faced with two enemies against my two heroes. The loading screen lasted longer than the battle. Even in encounters the enemies came in waves and did not usually outnumber the heroes. I might have been more patient to see if things picked up, but the animations play out too slow, and I felt the spells, abilities, and story were just not interesting. Also, there is no way to scroll the camera and sometimes you need to - either the camera is not centered on your unit so you can't see where you are going, or the camera does not cover the area you want to go. This last issue made the game unplayable for me, because even things later work out I won't be able to play without being able to control my units consistently.\n","October 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

OK lets try it then.\n\nIt looks great... no 3D grafix that look unprofessionally made... everything is handpainted and in 2D. It really reminds me of old games back in the days. You recieve a lot of gold from the beginning. It's enough to upgrade your chars. I know it's a mobile port and it's a pitty that it seems as if the devs tried to hard on selling you IAP on mobile. But not here.\n\n6 bucks is not much (just look at other games you buy for more just because they look pretty at first but suck at gameplay xD... trashy grafix, awfull gameplay, high price)\nI really hope the devs are going to fix some stuff and give us the perfect turn based game we may not waited for.. but found it anyways.\nYou know that feeling after discovering a game you thought was ok-ish and it turned out you playing it for hours and you are sad after finishing it. Well this game could be one of those.\n\nTo sum up:\npros:\n+ great art and grafix (some textures look weird though)\n+ really oldschool (its better then this mass of flashes and particles in your face action you get flooded with)\n+ great strategy game (you really have to plan your move)\n+ balanced (well at least at the beginning)\n+ different classes and skills (after only half an hour you already have 3 chars)\n\n+/- no Items (Weapons, Armor etc... but there are HP and MP Potions)\n\n- why is it turn based even after a fight without any enemy in sight?\n- a little bit to slow (chars have to move faster)\n- it's a pitty that this game wasn't first introduced to Steam and later on to Mobile phones... the other way around would have made it a great RPG experience without IAP marks\n\nShould you buy it? Well if you like turn based RPG with handpainted grafix, an interesting story, different characters and a great gameplay experience, well yes.\nBut if you are more the Hack and Slay, let's rush around this place and kill hundreds of enemys at once type.. maybe give it a try... but don't expect the same thing in this game.. this is more strategy.","October 7, 2015","true","0.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

This game is so booring that I feel wrong recommending it.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis game come as close to not passing a recommendation as it gets for me. 4/10 is my rating, but with an upwards tilt for nostalgia.\n\nD&D most closely resemble the old Hero Quest boardgame (and its computer adaptions). You walk around on a small location with 2 action points per hero per turn that can be used for attack or movement. Tactics is a matter of positioning and whom to attack with what hero. That's the whole game, really. The most appealing aspect of D&D, like hero quest, is the props. Atmospheric bookshelves, old descs filled with vials and recepies, and other pieces. Some of them can be looted, which was is an upgrade from the boardgame. There is also a very minimalistic character building system, that only have any relevance because the resource you use for the few upgrades available is scarce (atleast at the start when you may want to pay a fortune for the extra character).\n\nMy biggest gripe is the pace of the game. With a rather time-consuming search-system, I spend more time walking from tile to tile just to see if there is something there than actually playing out the scenario. The dialogue between the heroes consist of different ways of formulating the scentence "Let's go get the bad-guys".\n\nOtherways it's a cute, simplistic and relaxing little game. If you don't get as bored as me playing it, it may be just up your alley, which is why I recommend it.","October 8, 2015","false","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I had 3 and no problems beating the last boss with his insane spawning skills but if you do not have at least 2 in your party you are in for a very difficult experience.\nP.S. the best skill is the game is the one that the priest uses to buff your team and at level 5 it has a range of 3 and 50% more damage for your guys!

They do this because they KNOW, of course, that we'll reject any PC game with mobile-style microtransactions, paid ad removal, etc., but that's the issue here. See, with mobile, one would opt-in to paying; there's a psychological war going on between the player and developers, of course, but one still has the option of playing the game for free and never paying a thing, just dealing with the ads and sometimes ridiculous gameplay mechanics. That isn't the case with a PC game, and the style of game changes DRASTICALLY from mobile to PC, which is something that developers don't seem to understand. It's not a simple matter of converting touch controls to mouse controls; often, the mechanics themselves simply won't fit on PC, and  you end up with this.\n\nIronhide Games did this rather well with Kingdom Rush. I'd urge Devils & Demons' developers to check out Kingdom Rush--it's porting done right (in addition to initially being a PC game--kinda).\n\nThe difference is one of donating to a museum or paying an entry fee to the museum. It may seem minor, but there are few differences that are as important.","February 3","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
