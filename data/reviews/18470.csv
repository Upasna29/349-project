I got into the series when I got a demo of the 1st game "Desperado: Wanted Dead or Alive" free with a box a cereal (what a great promotion). I remember spending hours and hours silently knocking out every enemy in the one demo level and hiding their bodies in various outbuildings. This game still has the same great core game play with some less welcome mechanics bolted on such as the 1st person mode and movie export mode. This title improves upon the originals planning system in which you can set up satisfying combinations involving all your people silently taking down how a town. Some people may be put off by the large quantity of quick-saves and loading, but in this tittle I see it as slowly creating a masterpiece stroke by stroke. All in all I highly recommend this title or if you can get hold of it cheap, then "Desperado: Wanted Dead or Alive"","December 1, 2012","true","5.5"," 62 of 66 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","62","66","0","3"

If you liked the first one in the series (Desperados) you will like this one too. It's not an easy game, sure, but it's rewarding, especially when you're not just shooting, but trying to outsmart the enemies. I recommend it to every strategy fan who have patience.","January 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 45 of 53 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","45","53","0","0"

First in the series we have "Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive" which basically was "Commandos" in a western atmosphere. Then came "Desperados 2: Coopers Revenge". And finally "Helldorado".. And you know what? IT SUCKS BIG TIME!\n\nI Kidd, I Kidd! :-)\n\nVia google I had a hard time making out if "Helldorado" just was another name for "Desperados 2: Coopers Revenge" or if it was new game. Luckily for me it was a totally new game that picks up where Desperados 2: Coopers Revenge left off.\n\nStory\nThe beginning of the story is somewhat cheesy and random but one improvement with this game is that the story takes different turns with timen and make the overall experience more exciting.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is partly different from the original. In the original you usually have objectives as a sidemission. On most levels you have to kill all enemies no matter what the mission is. But in this game some levels are more oriented on the mission. Do you finish the mission you don't have to kill everyone in sight or even two thirds of them. This fact make you look more for patterns and you can choose in a wider sense what you can and MUST do. The missions also have differnet styles. For example, one mission is purely action and is more like Hitman than the original game.\n\nSet The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\nAs this game (and Desperados 2) has the "option" of playing in first person mode the controls and change of camera angle bothered me quite a bit. I found myself using the first person mode more than the upper view even though I prefer the upper view (it just was easier not having to change the view all the time). The controls aren't horrible but they seemed very rushed and could have been alot more smooth and natural.\n\nDifficult to Cure\nThe controls make this game a bit harder than it should be. Other than that the difficulty depends on the level you are at. I am not exactly sure but I think it was the second level of the game that took the longest time to finish for me. Meanwhile the "Hitman level" just went straight ahead.. And that is one of the later levels mind you. A level in one of these games is never "easy" but there definitely are different shades of grey.\n\nEnemies and Friends\nThis has the same characters as the second game. They are still entertaining to play and as fun to watch as ever (between missions) but I would have liked to try one or two new faces with some different abilties. If only for a few missions. The enemies is a bit smarter in this game as well. Some will make you scream naughty things. They might respond in different ways at different times. Which make it harder to make the right response.\n\nNobody's Fault..\nBut the creators of the game. One thing that shouldn't be is the fact that some levels must be played again and again with different objectives. Which just drags the game down. Each level takes quite a bit of time if you hare not really, really good. Do you then want to replay basically the same thing again? NO, you wouldn't. This game would get one grade higher from me if just all levels was different.\n\nPersonal sidenote\nI long for another game in the style of Commandos or Desperados (or one of them). The style of these game might not be for the biggest market (aka. Grand Theft Auto, World of Warcraft or Fifa) but it is for me! If one is ever made.. You have a customer right here mate!\n\nGrade: 7 / 10","May 24, 2012","true","27.4"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","35","40","2","0"

Helldorado offers depth and rewards the patient player willing to invest the time to create the perfect group combat strategy.  While the graphics are decidedly average and the Steam Overlay does not work, the addition of a first person action view, in addition to the overhead zoomable tactical view give the player a variety of choice when planning the attack.  This game is worth the bargain price for players who don't mind a high learning curve and are patient enough to carefully strategize.","March 9, 2012","true","0.2"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","29","39","2","0"

This game is horrible.\n\nEver time you launch it it tries to install some ♥♥♥♥ 3rd party crap you have to cancle.\n\nThere is about 1000 commands you can give with no tooltips on anything. You dont know what anything freaking does untill you try it out. You dont know anything about the terrain... like can I shoot over this rock? or will the dyamite just hit the rock and kill me?\n\nThe controlls are just clunky. Half of the moves require you to click 10 different things hold down 2 buttons and eventually you can get something done.\n\nThe story is boring and who cares. You are supposed to be saving your friend and I am not sure if I missed a game or something but I dont know who he is nor do I give a toss about him.\n\nThe auto save function doesn't overwrite itself so with each quicksave you will create a new save file.\n\nThe characters wont shut the hell up. The talk whenever you click anything and the voice action is alright at best.\n\nDo not buy this game. Its just not worth it.","October 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 51 of 91 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","51","91","3","5"
